    "Ethics Statement: All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The Rockefeller University.\n1. Pre-experimental Prespanparation\nSolutions\nPrepare the eugenol solution (2.5 g·L-1·kg-1 frog). Prepare the saline solutions (Table 1).\n\t\tNOTE: For a one-chamber preparation, prepare artificial perilymph; for a two-chamber preparation, prepare both artificial perilymph and artificial endolymph.\n2. Experimental Tools\nPreparation of glass stimulation fiber\nNarrow a borosilicate glass capillary with an electrode puller in a one-line pull with high heat and high velocity. Load the pulled capillary into a solenoid-driven puller.\nBring the capillary's tip toward a filament with a glass bead melted onto it until the capillary contacts the glass bead.\nTurn on the filament to melt the tip of the capillary into the glass bead. Once a thin bridge of glass forms between the capillary and the bead, turn off the filament and around the same time activate the solenoid puller.\n\t\tNOTE: This will pull the glass capillary at a right angle to its long axis and create a solid fiber.\nEnsure that the fiber's diameter is no more than 0.5 - 1 µm and that its length does not exceed 100 - 300 µm. If the fiber's length exceeds this dimension, trim it with iris scissors. Use scissors that are already dull to avoid damaging the dissection tools.\nTo enhance optical contrast, sputter coat the fiber. Use a sputter coater with a gold-palladium source. Vertically load each fiber into a sputter coater with its tapered end towards the source. Bring the fiber's tip to a distance of 1 - 2 cm from the gold-palladium source.",
    "Close the sputter coater's chamber to form a seal and turn it on. Repeatedly flush out the ambient air with argon. After flushing the air, reduce the pressure within the chamber to 10 Pa (70 mTorr).\nSputter coat in 10 s pulses with 10 s delays over a course of 120 s.\n\t\tNOTE: The fiber's tip will darken over the duration of this protocol if the sputter coating was a success.\nPreparation of sharp microelectrodes\nPull a glass capillary with an internal filament using a one-line high-heat pull. Electrodes should have a resistance of 100 - 300 MΩ when filled with 3 M KCl. Fill each electrode with 3 M KCl.\nBend each electrode's tip with the microforge to render it perpendicular to the hair cell apical surface when mounted in the amplifier headstage16.\nPreparation of iontophoresis pipettes\nPull a glass capillary with an internal filament to a 50 MΩ tip. Fill with concentrated solute (e.g., 500 mM gentamicin sulfate).\nPreparation of aluminum mounting square\nCut a 1 cm x 1 cm square of aluminum foil. Perforate the foil in the center with the tip of a pithing rod or other sharp object. Shape the perforation so that it is circular and approximately 1 mm in diameter.\nPreparation of vacuum grease-filled syringe.\nRemove the plunger from a 5 mL syringe. Fill syringe from the back with vacuum grease. Replace the plunger.\nPreparation of polytetrafluoroethylene glue applicator\nMake a 2 mm long axial cut into the end of a wooden applicator stick. The slit should be in the center of the applicator when viewed end-on.\nWith sharp scissors or a razor blade, cut a 2 mm x 4 mm rectangle of polytetrafluoroethylene from a sheet of 1 mm thickness.",
    "Use a razor blade to thin one of the 2 mm-long edges of the polytetrafluoroethylene rectangle. Starting in the middle of the rectangle, reduce the thickness of the rectangle by slicing outward to form a bevel at the tip of the rectangle.\nInsert the polytetrafluoroethylene rectangle into the wooden applicator slit such that the beveled edge faces away from the stick. Apply 5 min epoxy to the base of the polytetrafluoroethylene rectangle to secure it in place. Allow the glue applicator to cure for 1 h at room temperature.\nPreparation of lower half of two-chamber mount\nMachine or 3D print the lower half of the two-chamber mount (Supplemental file 2). Identify the 20 mm diameter recessed circle on the lower surface of the chamber.\nApply a thin layer of epoxy to the lateral most 3 mm of the recessed circle. Apply one 18 mm circular glass coverslip on the epoxy. Allow epoxy to cure for 1 h.\n3. Extraction of Inner-ear Organs\nAnesthetize an American bullfrog by placing it in a small bucket containing eugenol anesthetic solution for 10 min. Adjust the volume of solution so that the frog's humero-scapular joint lies just above the liquid-air interface.\nEuthanize the anesthetized bullfrog by double pithing.\n\t\nGrasp the anesthetized frog with one finger atop its nose and another below the jaw and rotate the frog's head forward.\nRapidly plunge the pithing rod into the cranial vault through the foramen magnum, which is found at the midline between the frog's occipital processes.\nSlowly withdraw and rotate the rod until its tip departs from the foramen magnum. Force the rod caudally through the vertebral foramina to destroy the spinal cord.\nConfirm that the frog has been properly doubly pithed by observing that its lower extremities are extended.",
    "Grasp the frog with a thumb atop the nose and first finger grasping the vomerine teeth for improved stability. Decapitate the frog by severing the temporomandibular joint bilaterally and subsequently cutting orthogonally to the rostrocaudal axis. To assure that the inner-ear organs within the skull remain intact, ensure that the cut is caudal to both tympana.\nUsing a stereodissection microscope, execute a midline cut through the palatal tissue from the vomerine teeth to the most posterior extent of the tissue (Figure 1A).\nSever and clear with horizontal cuts of the scalpel any muscle lying below the palatal tissue to reveal the posterior cartilage. After removing the muscle, observe the lollipop shape of the temporal cartilage forming the boundary of the otic capsule.\nSever the columella at its point of contact with the otic capsule's cartilage.\nRepeatedly shave thin layers of this cartilage by making shallow horizontal cuts through it. Avoid deep cuts to prevent damage to the inner-ear organs. This opens the otic capsule found within the lollipop structure of the temporal cartilage (Figure 1B). Within the otic capsule are the frog's inner-ear organs (Figure 1C).\nTrim the posterior and lateral edges of the otic capsule, taking care not to damage the inner-ear organs. During the dissection, frequently flow saline over the inner ear organs to ensure that they remain submerged and hydrated.\nLocate the two circular openings in the temporal bone at the medial connection of the cartilage to the midline. Cut downward through the most medial opening to rupture the temporal bone.\nMake a second downward cut through the otic capsule at its postero-lateral edge. Remove the piece of cartilage between this and the previous cut to provide access to the inner-ear organs.",
    "Pry loose the cartilage between the cuts from steps 3.8 and 3.9 and cut it away from the otic capsule. This action severs the nearest semicircular canal, which can then be used as a handle for further manipulations.\nTaking care not to touch the sacculus, sever the VIIIth cranial nerve.\nHold the ampulla of the nearest semicircular canal. Gently rotate the inner ear to expose the remaining two semicircular canals. Upon exposing each canal, sever it.\nHolding the nerve or a semicircular canal ampulla, extract the inner ear from the head and place it in a dish filled with chilled oxygenated artificial perilymph. Removal of the inner ear permits visualization of the passages within the temporal bone through which the semicircular canals once passed (Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: Repeat these steps to extract the second ear.\n4. One-chamber Preparation\nIsolation of sacculus\nLocate the sacculus by identifying its large white mass of otoconia and the saccular nerve that lies atop it (Figure 1E). Take care not to physically traumatize the sacculus during the following steps in order to maintain the integrity of saccular hair cells.\nTrim the semicircular canals to render the inner ear more maneuverable.\nRemove the perilymphatic cistern overlying the neural side of the sacculus. Make gentle cuts around the perimeter of the cistern. Next sever the small pillars of tissue that bridge the cistern's membrane to the neural side of the sacculus.\nRemove the lagena and its associated nerve.\nHolding the saccular nerve, gently lift the sacculus and cut through the thin membrane of the otoconial sac. As otoconia spill out of the sac, free the sacculus by cutting around its perimeter.",
    "NOTE: After isolating the sacculus, the remaining inner-ear organs can be saved if desired. Removal of the sacculus eases identification of other structures, such as the amphibian and basilar papillae.\nUse scissors or forceps to carefully wipe away any otoconia remaining on the sacculus. Take care not to touch the sacculus during this process.\nTrim any remaining otoconial-sac membrane from the sacculus' edge. This membrane tends to adhere to plastic and glass surfaces and its removal minimizes challenges in handling the tissue.\nGently flow saline over the sacculus with a Pasteur pipette to remove any remaining otoconia (Figure 1F).\n\t\tNOTE: Repeat this procedure for the second sacculus, which is a mirror image of the first.\nDigestion and mounting\nUsing the back end of a Pasteur pipette with its tip broken, transfer the isolated sacculi to a Petri dish containing 3 mL of 67 mg∙L-1 protease XXIV in artificial perilymph.\n\t\tNOTE: This protease treatment digests the links tethering each kinociliary bulb to the otolithic membrane, enabling removal of the membrane without damaging the sensory hair bundles.\nIncubate the tissue for 30 min at 22 °C (or 35 min at 21 °C). Transfer each digested sacculus to an open-faced experimental chamber and secure the tissue with magnetic pins.\nThe saccular macula lies directly below the otolithic membrane and is the portion of the sacculus that contains hair cells. Identify it and carefully remove its overlying otolithic membrane using a fine eyelash, taking care not to touch the saccular macula.\n5. Two-chamber Preparation\nIsolation of sacculus\nIsolate the sacculus from the inner-ear organs as in Section 4.1.\nMounting and digestion",
    "Fill the mounting block (Supplemental file 3) with artificial perilymph and place the perforated aluminum foil on one opening, using two spots of vacuum grease to hold it in place and form a weak seal.\nTransfer one sacculus to the foil and center it on top of the hole with the macula facing down and the nerve stump facing up.\nRemove the saline surrounding the sacculus with a piece of twisted tissue. Wick the saline to dry the surface of the aluminum square surrounding the sacculus.\nUse the polytetrafluoroethylene applicator to apply cyanoacrylate glue to form a tight seal along the boundary between the edge of the sacculus and the aluminum square. Ensure that the entire circumference of the sacculus is covered with glue.\n\t\tNOTE: Proceeding too slowly allows the cyanoacrylate glue to creep over the neural side of the sacculus and eventually cover it. It is therefore imperative to complete this task rapidly.\nPlace a drop of saline on top of the mounted tissue to cure the glue. A thin film of glue may form on top of the drop of saline; remove it with forceps.\nCarefully remove the foil from the mounting block. Flip the mounted tissue over so that the macular side of the sacculus faces upward and float it on an artificial perilymph-filled Petri dish.\nAdd a drop of protease XXIV solution on top of the macula and incubate for 30 min at 22 °C (or 35 min at 21 °C). Fill the lower canal of the two-chamber apparatus (Supplemental file 2) with perilymph and place vacuum grease around the central chamber.\nPlace the foil-mounted sacculus on the lower chamber with its nerve facing the chamber's surface. Add grease around the perimeter of the foil.",
    "Place the upper chamber (Supplemental file 1) of the preparation on the foil, taking care to form a complete seal with the vacuum grease. Fill the upper chamber with bubbled artificial endolymph and gently remove the otolithic membrane with an eyelash."
