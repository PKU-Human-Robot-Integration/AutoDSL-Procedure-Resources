    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEctopic expression of GSDME-NT\nTiming: 1 day\nDigest the exponentially growing HEK293T cells by trypsin-EDTA to single cells. Plate the cells (approximately 5 ×105 cells) in 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes for 12–17 h to reach 60%–70% confluency before transfection.\nDiscard the medium, and add fresh DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS) to the cells at 30 min before transfection.\nPrepare the transfection complex by using PolyJet transfection reagent.\nGently dilute the plasmid DNA (1 μg) and PolyJet transfection reagent (3 μL) with 50 μL serum-free DMEM.\nAdd the diluted transfection reagent to the diluted plasmid DNA and mix gently.\nIncubate the mixture for 15 min to prepare the transfection complex.\nAdd the transfection complex drop-wise to the cells and gently swirl the cell culture dishes.\nAfter transfection for 24 h, check the expression level of GSDME-NT using a fluorescence microscope.\nAlternatives: Some other commercially available transfection reagents, e.g., lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), can also be used for cell transfection. In addition, HeLa cells can also be used for the ectopic expression of GSDME-NT.\nCritical: To prepare the transfection complex for the negative control transfection, add the diluted transfection reagent to serum-free DMEM and incubate the mixture as described in step 3.\nCritical: Because HEK293T cells are semi-adhesive, all steps, including medium replacement, transfection, cell staining, and microscopic observation, should be careful to avoid cell detachment or damage.\nStaining of cell nucleus and membrane\nTiming: 1 h\nDilute Sytox Green and Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 in the cell culture medium to the final concentration of 1 μM (Sytox Green) or add one drop Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 solution per 105 cells according to the manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R37175[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R37175]).",
    "Incubate the cells with the Sytox Green and Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 at 37°C in dark for 15 min.\nCritical: Due to the calcium-dependent binding to phosphatidylserine, add sterile CaCl2 stock solution to the cell culture medium to reach a final concentration of 2.5 mM before Annexin V staining.\nTime-lapse imaging of pyroptosis\nTiming: 3–4 days\nStart the LSM710 confocal microscope, and pre-warm the laser source.\nEquip the microscope with an environmental control chamber. Warm up the environment chamber to 37°C, and maintain a supply of humidified 5% CO2.\nPlace the cell culture dish into the environmental control chamber.\nChoose the desired objective for cell imaging. Typically, 40 × (NA1.2) magnification objective is preferred.\nLocate a view field of interest and then go to the software operation panel. Choose the fluorescence channels and pseudo-colors that match the dyes used in the experiment. To view the brightfield image, select the channel corresponding to brightfield.\nAdjust the z-axis to get a clear view of interest. Set the excitation laser power, and optimize the gain of fluorescence to avoid low fluorescent intensity or overexposure. The “Pinhole” for each fluorescent channel is set at 1 Airy Unit (AU). Adjust the gain and offset of each fluorescent channel to as required before imaging.\nTake 512 × 512 time-lapse images at 3–5 min intervals for a total of 7 h or longer.\nSave the time series images, and represent the images as “Contents of Image window-series” or “Full resolution image window-series”. Adjust frames per second and export the time-lapse imaging video. The expected outcome could be the Method video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nAlternatives: The confocal microscope from Leica and Nikon can be used as an alternative to that of Zeiss.\nCritical: Warm up the environmental control chamber and supply humidified 5% CO2 at least 1 h before imaging.",
    "Critical: The concentrations of the fluorescent dyes/probes and the gain and offset of each fluorescent channel should be adjusted by using positive and negative control before time-lapse imaging.\nCritical: Repeat time-lapse imaging (steps 11–15) to generate a high-quality video.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Method video S1. Abalone GSDME-NT induces pyroptosis in HEK293T cells, related to step 15\n    \nGSDME-NT and Sytox Green are indicated by red and green colors, respectively. Scale bar: 10 μm."
