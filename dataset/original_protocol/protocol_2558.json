    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPlating cells—Day 1\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nThe following steps provide guidance in drafting the experimental layout for the dual sequential knockdowns of your genes of interest. The experimental design and number of experimental groups must be determined prior to plating the cell line.\nNote: Include 2–3 replicate plates per group. Experimental groups are as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2192_2.csv\nNote: In this sequential double knockdown design, each plate of cells will be transfected with an NS or a targeting siRNA on Day 2 and Day 4. This is a staggered protocol; we have experienced toxicity when co-transfecting siRNAs to PDPK1 and CAMKK2 at the same time.\nWarm up Plating medium to 37°C prior to use.\nPrepare 60 mm or 100 mm tissue culture dishes for each condition.\nPipet 5 mL per 60 mm dish or 10 mL per 100 mm dish of Plating medium.\nPlate cells at 10%–20% density in a tissue culture dish.\nFor OVCAR-3 cells, SK-OV-3 and Caov-3 cells we found that 300,000 cells per 60 mm dish or 1,000,000 cells per 100 mm dish is ideal.\nNote: A 10%–20% seeding density will allow the cells to grow for 5 days without reaching maximal confluency. Cell seeding density is based on the population doubling time which is unique for each cell line. OVCAR-3, SK-OV-3 and Caov-3 cells population doubling time is around 50–80 h.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] If the assay requires >5 days in culture, decrease the seeding density to >10%.\nNote: Determine the size of the tissue culture plate needed for subsequent applications. Scaling to 60 mm dishes is adequate for downstream applications such as Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation experiments may require more cellular material, therefore a 100 mm format can be used.",
    "Alternatives: Although Lipofectamine™ 2000 was used here, the newly formulated Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, #L30000001) has been reported to have increased transfection efficiency at lower doses. Please see manufacturer's protocol[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/lipofectamine3000_protocol.pdf] for required volumes of Lipofectamine 3000 to use.\nTransfection of cells with first siRNA (PDPK1)—Day 2\nTiming: 7 h\nThe following steps provide guidance for the knockdown of the canonical upstream modulator of Akt, PDPK1. This protocol is written for a 60 mm format, with the PDPK1 siRNA to be used at 40 nM in a final culture volume of 5 mL.\nNote: Volume of reagents for 60 mm and 100 mm tissue culture dishes using a final concentration of 40 nM siRNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2192_3.csv\nWarm up Transfection medium to 37°C prior to use.\nObtain two sets of Eppendorf tubes for each dish to be transfected.\nLabel tubes accordingly to decipher which set will be for the Lipofectamine + medium, and which set will be for the siRNA + medium.\nNote: Volumes below are designed to have a final volume of 500 μL in each set of Eppendorf tubes.\nPipet 490 μL of transfection medium and 10 μL of Lipofectamine™ 2000 into one set of tubes.\nVortex to mix and quickly spin down tubes in a microcentrifuge.\nNote: This quick spin is only used to pull-down any medium that may reside on the inside of the cap during the vortexing step.\nIncubate for 5 min.\nPipet 496 μL of transfection medium and 4 μL of siRNA into another set of tubes.\nVortex to mix and quickly spin down tubes in a microcentrifuge.\nPipet medium + Lipofectamine™ 2000 from step 6 into the tube with medium + siRNA from step 8.\nVortex to mix and quickly spin down tubes in a microcentrifuge.",
    "Incubate for 20 min. The final volume will be 1 mL.\nNote: This incubation time can be reduced to 5 min when using Opti-MEMTM medium.\nRemove medium from plated cells and replace with 4 mL of Transfection medium.\nAfter 20 min (step 10), pipet 1 mL of medium + Lipofectamine™ + siRNA to each dish of cells slowly, to avoid breaking Lipofectamine/siRNA complex.\nIncubate for 6 h at 37oC in a tissue culture incubator.\nAfter 6 h, remove medium from dishes and pipet 4 mL of Plating medium into the plates.\nIncubate at 37oC in a tissue culture incubator for 2 days.\nTransfection of cells with second siRNA (CAMKK2)—Day 4\nTiming: 7 h (for step 16)\nTiming: 2 days (for step 17)\nThis procedure is the same as the prior, except that this second siRNA is targeted to the putative upstream modulator (herein CAMKK2).\nRepeat steps 4–15 with second siRNA and incubate cells for 3 days.\nNote: OVCAR-3 cells grow best if medium is changed every 2 days. On day 6, medium was removed from all plates and replaced with fresh and warmed Plating medium.\nHarvesting cells for protein to assess the dual transfection knockdown efficiency and consequential signaling circuitry via Western blotting – Day 7.\nThe following protocol assess the knockdown efficiencies of the genes of interest (herein PDPK1 and CAMKK2) via the quantification of the protein expression in the single and double transfected cells with Western blotting. In this experiment, AKT was considered a putative target of PDK1 and CAMKK2. Therefore, in this experiment, the phosphorylation of AKT at the primary activation site, Thr308, was measured and normalized to total AKT protein levels.\nRemove media from cells.\nPipet 100–300 μL of Harvest buffer per dish and scrape cells from the plate.",
    "Collect lysate into an Eppendorf tube and store on ice.\nPause point: Cell lysates can be stored at −80°C.\nSonicate lysate at 1 Watt on ice for 5 s.\nSpin lysate at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet cellular debris.\nCollect supernatant in a new Eppendorf tube.\nLabel tubes for long-term storage.\nPause point: Protein can be stored at −80°C.\nConduct a protein assay to determine the protein concentration of each sample.\nNote: A quick protein assay can be conducted using the Pierce™ BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific™ #23227) per manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf].\nUse 20–35 μg of protein to perform Western blotting."
