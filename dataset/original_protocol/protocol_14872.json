    "General considerations: Ahead of time, set up an ethics protocol, prepare questionnaires for patients, and see to training the clinical personnel. Before using material from reduction mammoplasty surgery, procure authorizations, and ensure patient consent. Tissue may be infectious and needs to be handled accordingly. This protocol was approved by the ethical committee of ISREC - Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research.\n1. Tissue Recovery, Processing and Bio-banking\nTo ensure optimal sample quality for bio-banking, a number of steps are carried out at the hospital prior to transport to the laboratory.\nAt the hospital:\nObtain human breast tissues under sterile conditions from reduction mammoplasty surgery and blood samples, if required. Tissue needs to be examined by pathologist who will sample to exclude presence of malignant lesions.\nPlace the breast tissue under the hood on a sterile board and prepare scissors, surgical scalpel and forceps which are already sterilized with steam sterilizer. Make deep cut at different sites of the mammary tissue using a scalpel to open it. In human breast tissue look for white strands consisting of ducts and lobules, which are embedded in yellow adipose tissue.\n\tNOTE: The ratio of the white parenchymal to the yellow adipose tissue differs among women; typically younger women have more epithelial tissue.\nPick pieces of white material and hold them with forceps, then separate them gently from the adipose tissue with scissors. Avoid taking blood vessels.",
    "Rinse pieces of tissue in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2 to remove blood. Transfer the tissue to 250 ml plastic bottles containing F12 medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium F12) without phenol red with 2% penicillin/streptomycin (including 5,000 unit/ml penicillin and 5,000 g/ml streptomycin) and 1% antibiotic/amphotericin B (including 10,000 units/ml penicillin, 10,000 µg/ml of streptomycin, and 25 µg/ml of amphotericin B). Store tissues in the medium for transport to the laboratory.\nPrepare pieces of 3 - 5 mm diameter for RNA and protein extraction and flash freeze them in cryovials with cold (dry ice) isopentane. Transfer them to dry ice box for transportation to the laboratory.\nPut pieces of 3 - 5 mm into mold and cover it with a layer of Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) and then place the mold on the flat bottom of box filled with cold isopentane. After complete freezing transfer the mold to the dry ice box.\nFix 5 pieces of 3 - 5 mm diameter in paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% and another 5 pieces in formaldehyde (FA) 4% in PBS at RT histological analysis later on. Two different fixatives are recommended as some antibodies work better with one or the other of the two.\nIn the laboratory:\nDocument all information about the reduction mammoplasty, date of surgery and whether the samples are derived from left versus right breast.\nPlace the frozen samples at -80° C and transfer the fixed tissues into histology cassettes after 2 hr of fixation. Then put them either in PBS or 70% ethanol, for O/N storage at 4 °C. On the next day, transfer the histology cassettes to histology facilities for paraffin embedding.\n2. Tissue Digestion and Hormone Stimulation",
    "Transfer the bottles containing the tissue samples to a laminar flow cabinet in a P2 cell culture room. Place tissue pieces on sterile chopping board (29 x 19 cm). Hold the material with forceps and scrape the remaining fat and vessels away from the breast parenchyma (white part) with scalpel . Place the white material in PBS in a 10 cm culture dish.\nAfter removing the fatty material from all pieces and disposing them according to the safety rules of the laboratory, place the white parts containing the epithelial tissues back on the chopping board. Using opposing scalpels cut the tissue and chop it to pieces of up to 2 mm diameter.\nPlace the minced material into tubes of adequate size: up to 1, 2.5 and 10 ml into a 5, 15 or 50 ml tubes, respectively. Typically a 5 ml tube yields enough material for paraffin embedment and hormone stimulations, and a 15 ml tube yields enough material for Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Larger tubes are used for freezing aliquots.\nPrepare digestion master mix consisting of medium (DMEM/F12 without phenol red) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B and collagenase A (Clostridiopeptidase A from Clostridium histolyticum). Dose collagenase according to digestion times.\n\t\nFor 12, 24, and 36 hr of incubation, use final concentration of collagenase of 1.5 mg/ml, 1.0 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml respectively. Add digestion master mix up to 4 times of the volume of the digested material to ensure adequate agitation and aeration.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the experimental design and the duration of hormone stimulation, add hormones either during or after the enzymatic digestion step and microstructure recovery.\nAdd hormone(s) at desired concentration to test samples and the vehicle to the control. For stimulation with 17-β-estradiol, and promegestone (R5020) use a final concentration of 20 nM.",
    "NOTE: R5020 is a synthetic progesterone receptor agonist, which is more stable than natural progesterone in medium.\n\t\nPlace tubes on the roller mixer inside an incubator at 37 °C and 40 rpm O/N. Before placing the samples on the mixer, resuspend them very well to ensure that all material distributes along the centrifuge tubes.\nAs digestion takes at least 12 hr (O/N), for hormone stimulation times of less than 12 hr, add the hormones after recovery of the microstructures (detailed under step 3). Add the hormones as you resuspend the microstructures and place the suspension on ultra-low attachment plates. Tissue microstructures can be kept on ultra-low attachment plates for up to 7 days in growth-factor-free medium preserving about 70% viability.\nFor RNA and protein analysis, collect tissue microstructures by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min and flash freeze in centrifuge tubes.\n3. Recovery of Tissue Microstructures\nCentrifuge the tube(s) at 400 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the fat from the top of the centrifuge tube and transfer the supernatant of the remaining aqueous supernatant, which is enriched in fibroblasts, to a new centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1,250 x g for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: As the breast tissue microstructures are very sticky, for all subsequent steps resuspend the pellet by gently agitating the tube. Pipetting is not recommended due to the risk of losing material.\nResuspend the pellets enriched in microstructures and in fibroblasts derived from aqueous supernatant in PBS, 2% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). Subsequently spin both tubes at 1,250 x g for 5 min and then discard the supernatants.\nResuspend the pellets in 3 - 5 ml red cell blood lysis buffer and transfer them to clean tubes. Incubate them for 5 min at RT.",
    "Add 2x volume of PBS, 2% FCS and centrifuge them at 1,250 x g for 5 min. Wash the pellets with PBS, 2% FCS and centrifuge at 1,250 x g for 5 min. Repeat this step twice.\n4. Samples for Flow Cytometry\nAdd 1 - 2 ml trypsin 0.25% to the pellet and mix it by pipetting up and down very gently for 2 min with a 1,000 µl pipetman to dissociate cells.\nInhibit trypsin activity by adding 9 ml PBS, 2% FCS. Centrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml PBS, 2% FCS.\nTransfer the cell suspension onto a 40 µm cell strainer placed on top of a 50 ml centrifuge tube to prepare single cells. If a few microliters of cell suspension remain on top of the filter, help them pass through the filter by aspirating them from the other side of strainer with a pipet and add them to the filtered microstructures.\nSeparate immune cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells from microstructures with a cocktail of anti-CD45, anti-FAP and anti-CD31 antibodies and then sort them with FACS, based on pan-epithelial marker EpCAM and CD10 to separate luminal and basal cells respectively10.\n5. Samples for Histology\nAfter washing the mechanically and enzymatically digested material as described above, fix pellets from 1.5 ml initial material in 1 ml of 4% PFA in PBS at RT for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 1,250 x g for 5 min and wash with 1 - 2 ml PBS twice.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 x g for 10 min. During this time, prepare 1% multi-purpose agarose in Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer and heat the solution in the microwave oven until the solution comes to a boil.",
    "Remove the solution from the microwave oven and swirl the flask gently to mix the solution and resuspend any remaining agarose particles. Cool agarose solution to 50 °C and pour 1 ml in a paraffin base mold sized 31 × 23 × 13.5 mm.\nDiscard the supernatant and place the pellets on top of the solidified layer (1 - 3 mm) of agarose using a spatula with a flat end. Cover them all with an additional layer of agarose (40 °C).\nAfter the agarose solidifies, usually within 5 min, put the agarose blocks into the histology cassettes for paraffin embedment. Along with the agarose samples place a white office paper in the cassette with all information about the reduction mammoplasty number, experimental condition, and date written in small letters in pencil; this writing withstands all subsequent treatment steps.\nPut the cassettes in PBS O/N, or in 70% ethanol for storage over the weekend, at 4 °C. We have not noticed any difference between the two storage solutions. Then transfer histology cassettes to histology facilities for paraffin embedding.\n6. Freezing Microstructures (Future Culturing)\nResuspend tissue microstructures in freezing medium consisting of FCS with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and freeze 1 ml aliquots in cryovials. The number of obtained cryovials depends on the amount of primary material obtained from reduction mammoplasty.\nFreeze the cryovials containing tissue microstructures using a controlled rate freezer with the following program: 5 min dwelling at 4 °C, decreasing the temperature to -7 °C with rate of 6 °C/min, decreasing the temperature to -12 °C with rate of 6 °C/min, 10 min dwelling, decreasing the temperature to -40 °C with rate of 6 °C/min, decreasing in temperature to -80 °C with rate of 6 °C/min. Then transfer the cryovials to -80°C freezer.",
    "Next day, transfer the cryovials from -80°C to liquid nitrogen tank for long storage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
