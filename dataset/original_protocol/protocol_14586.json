    "All procedures follow guidelines and approved protocols by Georgia Regents University Animal Use and Care Committee.\n1. Establishment of Orthotopic Breast Cancer Tumor\nOne day before the experiment, culture approximately 2 x 106 4T1-Luc tumor cells in a 10-cm culture dish in 10 ml RPMI medium containing 10% FBS. Incubate the culture dish in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOn the day of tumor cell injection, remove culture medium from the culture dish with vacuum, add 5 ml sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 to the culture dish, and gently shake the dish to wash the culture surface, remove the PBS by vacuum.\nAdd 2 ml trypsin-EDTA (0.05% Trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA) to the culture dish, incubate it in the CO2 incubator at 37 °C for about 5 min. Check cells on an inverted microscope to make sure that all cells are detached from the bottom of the culture dish.\nQuench the trypsin by adding 8 ml serum-containing medium, transfer cells to a 15-ml conical tube and centrifuge the cells at approximately 450 x g for 3 min at RT.\nRemove the supernatant by vacuum and resuspend cells in 10 ml PBS. Centrifuge cells at approximately 450 x g for 3 min. Remove the supernatant by vacuum, and resuspend cells in 10 ml PBS.\nPipette 10 μl of the cell suspension onto a hemocytometer under the cover glass. Count the cells to determine the cell concentration. Resuspend cells in PBS at a density of 2 x 105 cells/ml HBSS. Transfer cells to a 1.5 ml sterile microfuge tube and keep cells on ice until use.\nUse female BALB/c mice of 6 - 8 week for tumor cell injection.",
    "Shave hair near surrounding nipple # 3 using an electronic hair trimmer. Injection of 4T1 cell into the mammary gland 3 fat pad reproducibly generates lung metastasis. Clean the shaved area by using the cotton swab dipped into 70% ethanol. Resuspend cells by inverting the microcentrifuge tube 2 - 3 times. Gently aspirate 50 µl of cell suspension into a ½ CC 27 G 1/2 tuberculin syringe.\nInject the tumor cells into the mammary fat pad under #3 mammary gland of a BALB/c mouse. Place the mouse in a clean cage and return the cage to animal housing facility. Wait approximately 21 - 30 days for tumor development. Tumor growth should be monitored on a regular basis as per institution’s policies for tumor studies.\n2. Live Mouse Bioluminescence Imaging of Tumor Growth\nImage mice every 3 days after tumor injection Transfer mice to the imaging facility. Inject 100 μl luciferin (30 mg/ml in PBS) intraperitoneally (i.p.) to mice prior to imaging. After approximately 10 min, anesthetize mice in an induction chamber with 2% isoflurane/O2 flow. Use the forceps to touch the leg of the mouse. No response to the touch confirms that the mouse is fully unconscious.\n\t\nPlace the mice in the imaging chamber with continuous 2% isoflurane and O2 at a flow rate of 2 L/min.  Place the mouse such that the area of interest (i.e., the mammary pad of the initial tumor injection) faces the camera of the imaging system. Ensure the nose and mouth of the mouse are firmly set within the anesthetic tubing. Animals should be anesthetized per veterinary standards at the institution.",
    "Acquire bioluminescence imaging with an array of various exposure time. For instance, set exposure to 30, field of view (FOV) to 25, object height to 1.5 cm, and obtain luminescent photographic images with low power X-ray. Set the units of measurement to \"radiance.\"\n\t\nUse an automatic linear color range with a maximum of approximately 2.4 x 107 radiance units. After acquiring initial images, adjust settings and obtain an optimized-image (Figures 3 & 4).\nReturn mice to clean cages and ensure mice regain consciousness with ambulation before returning the animals to the housing facility.\nAnalyze data with the living imaging software associated with the imaging instrument. Using an imaging program, draw an enclosed line around the region of interest (ROI). Use the imaging software to determine the radiance intensity of the ROI. Record the relative intensities of each ROI for each mouse.\n\tNOTE: Higher radiance intensities indicate greater levels of luminescent cells, and thus greater tumor growth.\nVisually examine the mouse every 3 days for adverse effects.\n\tNOTE: Mice will be weighed once a week. A weight loss of 15% body weight will be considered adverse effect and the tumor-bearing mice will be euthanized as described in step 5. Mice with ulcerated tumors will also be euthanized.\n3. Surgical Removal of Primary Tumors\nNOTE: Autoclave scissors, forceps and the wound clips and wound clip applier (Figure 1).\nPerform the surgery in a sterile hood to maintain a sterile condition to reduce risk of infection. One day before surgery, shave the area surrounding the tumors of the tumor-bearing mice with an electric hair trimmer.\nApproximately 2 - 4 hr before surgery, feed the mice chewable carprofen tablets formulated for mice at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight.",
    "Put the mice in a chamber containing 2% isoflurane in oxygen for approximately 30 sec. Continuously anesthetize the mouse using an anesthesia apparatus during the entire surgical period.\nUse a sterile cotton stick to apply vet ointment to the eyes of the mouse to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Use the forceps to touch the leg of the mouse. No response to the touch confirms that the mouse is fully unconscious.\nDisinfect the skin area around the tumor site with three alternating wipes of a soap disinfectant scrub. Wipe the surgical area with a 70% alcohol wipe.\nUse a sterilized scalpel (Figure 1) to cut a small incision near the tumor.\nInsert the tip of a pair of sterilized scissors to the incision to cut the skin around the tumor to expose the tumor nodule (Figure 2A). Hold the tumor with sterile forceps and use the scissors to separate the tumor from the skin (Figure 2B). Save the tumor sample by freezing in a -80 °C freezer or by fixing in 10% formalin solution for future use.\nClose the surgical site with 9 mm wound clips using the auto-clip applier (Figure 1). Return the mouse to a clean cage with autoclaved bedding. The animals should be monitored per institutional guidelines.\n\tNOTE: The mouse usually regains sufficient consciousness and starts to move in the cage approximately 10 - 30 min after the surgery.\nAdminister carprofen to mice again 24 hr after surgery. Carprofen is for post-surgery analgesia and prescribing of post-surgery analgesia should be verified by direct consultation with the institution’s veterinary staff.  Remove wound clips after the wound heals (usually within 5 - 7 days after surgery). Remove wound clips using the auto-clip remover.\n4. Live Mouse Bioluminescence Imaging of Tumor Metastasis",
    "Image mice every 3 days after surgery as described in step 2.\n5. Validation of Lung Metastases Using India Ink Inflation of Tumor-bearing Lungs\nNOTE: To validate the luciferase live tumor imaging results, perform India ink inflation of tumor-bearing mouse lungs to quantify tumor nodules. 4T1 cells also metastasize to other organs and tissues (Figure 5) and therefore, histological examination of these organs to validate tumor metastasis should be performed if needed. This protocol use lung metastasis as a example.\nKeep mice in their existing home cage for euthanasia. When housed with other animals, relocate those mice not being euthanized to a different cage.\nRemove the cage filter top and replace with the CO2 filter top. Turn on the compressed CO2 gas cylinder (100%) that is connected to the CO2 filter top. Set the flow rate at 2 L/min and keep CO2 on for at least 10 min. If the mice are still breathing at the end of 10 min, leave the CO2 on until at least 1 min after mice stop breathing. Turn off CO2 cylinder control and the flow meter. Wait for 3 more minutes and remove the filter top.\nPlace the sacrificed-mouse on its back on a polystyrene board. Pin the legs to ensure unobstructed access to the trachea. Spray the mice with 70% ethanol.\nUsing a pair of scissors, cut along the midline of the mid-abdomen of the mouse through the ribcage and up toward the salivary glands. Observe the trachea. Use forceps to remove tissues surrounding the trachea to expose the trachea.\nThread a pipette tip underneath the trachea. Holding the tip with one hand, gently lift the trachea up and away from the body.",
    "Rotate the platform holding the mouse 180°. Use a ½ CC 27 G 1/2 tuberculin syringe to inject India Ink (10% India ink and 0.1% Ammonium Hydroxide) into the lungs via the trachea. Completely inflate the lungs with ink until a strong resistance is felt.\nUse a pair of scissors to cut the trachea. Use forceps to hold the mouse and insert another set of forceps under the lungs and pull the lung lobes out of the mouse. Rinse the lungs briefly in a beaker containing water.\nIn a chemical fume hood, transfer the lungs to a glass scintillation vial containing 3 ml of Fekete's solution (50% Ethanol, 6% Formaldehyde, and 3% glacial acetic acid). Cap the vial to prevent the solution from evaporating.\n\tNOTE: The tissues can be stored in Fekete's solution indefinitely.\nAfter a few minutes, observe tumor nodules as white dots on the black lungs (Figure 5). The white tumor nodule is visible by eyes. Transfer the lungs to a dish in a fume hood and count the number of white spots. Each white spot represents a single metastatic tumor nodule.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
