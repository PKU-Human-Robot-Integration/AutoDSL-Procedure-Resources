    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1 – Plate Coating and PBMCs resting\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes how to prepare plates for FluoroSpot test setup. The plate pretreatment permits to obtain high-quality spots.\nPlate coating.\nPrepare Human IFN-γ/TNF-α/IL-2 Capture Solution and prepare 70% ethanol.\nRemove plate underdrain, pipette 15 μL of 70% ethanol into each well quickly.\nAdd 150 μL of PBS, decant, and wash with 150 μL of PBS 1× two more times.\nReplace underdrain and immediately (before plate dries) pipette 80 μL/well Human IFN-γ/TNF-α/IL-2 Capture Solution.\nSeal plate with parafilm and incubate at 4°C for 24 h.\nNote: Activation of the membrane with ethanol is instantaneous and can be seen visually as a graying of the membrane. Wash ethanol off as quickly as possible following activation.\nCryopreserved PBMCs thawing and resting.\nThaw frozen PBMCs in a 15 mL centrifuge tube adding CTL-Resting Medium at 37°C up to 15 mL.\nCentrifuge samples at 600 × g for 5 min at RT, then discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the thawed PBMCs in 1–2 mL of CTL-Resting Medium.\nCount PBMCs using a viability stain and calculate the total number of live cells.\nAdjust the total volume of CTL-Resting Medium to achieve a final concentration of 2 × 106 PBMC/mL.\nIncubate PBMCs at 37°C for 18 h resting.\nNote: since a 10%–15% loss in cell number is expected after resting, it is ideally advisable to thaw a higher number of PBMCs to achieve the desired number of cells.\nDay 2 - PBMCs plating and peptide stimulation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the steps to stimulate PBMCs for 24 h with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide. Antigen-specific T cells will produce IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 and will be detected as fluorescent spot forming units.",
    "Stimulate PBMCs with peptide pools and incubate for ex-vivo FluoroSpot.\nPrepare peptide pool solutions at two times final concentration (2 μM) in CTL-Test Medium.\nDecant plate containing Capture Solution from the day before and wash one time with 150 μL of PBS.\nPlate peptide pool solutions and provided stimulatory reagent Anti-CD28 (0.1 μg/mL final concentration for each well), 50 μL/well.\nCount PBMCs using a viability stain and calculate the total number of live cells.\nAdjust PBMCs to desired concentration in CTL-Test Medium, e.g.,: 6 million/mL corresponding to 300,000 cells/50 μL for each well (cell numbers can be adjusted according to expected spot counts since 300,000–500,000 cells/well will provide linear results). Keep cells at 37°C in humidified incubator, 5% CO2 while processing PBMCs and until plating.\nPlate PBMCs, 50 μL/well using large orifice tips. Once completed, gently tap the sides of the plate and immediately place into a 37°C humidified incubator, 5% CO2.\nIncubate for 24 h. Do not stack plates. Avoid shaking plates by carefully opening and closing incubator door. Do not touch plates during incubation.\nNote: ideally PBMCs per well should be seeded in duplicate or in triplicate. We recommend to include at least 3 unstimulated wells.\nNote: Ensure the pH and temperature are ideal for cells by placing the plate containing antigens into a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator if it will be more than 10–20 min before plating cells.\nNote: each washing step is done manually adding the correct volume of mentioned washing solution, allowing wells to soak for about 1 min.\nDay 3 - Spot-forming cell detection and plate scanning\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the Spot Detection by fluorophore-conjugated reagents and the plate count by S6 Ultra M2 Analyzer.\nDetect spots.\nPrepare 0.05% Tween-PBS Solution.\nPrepare Anti-human IFN-γ/TNF-α/IL-2 Detection Solution.",
    "Wash plate two times with PBS and then two times with 0.05% Tween-PBS, 200 μL/well each time.\nAdd 80 μL/well Anti-human IFN-γ/TNF-α/IL-2 Detection Solution. Incubate at RT, 2 h.\nPrepare Tertiary Solution.\nWash plate three times with 0.05% Tween-PBS, 200 μL/well.\nAdd 80 μL/well of Tertiary Solution. Incubate at RT, 1 h.\nDecant and wash plate three times with distilled water, 200 μL/well.\nRemove protective underdrain from the plate and rinse back of plate with sterile water.\nAir-dry plate for 2 h in running laminar flow hood.\nScan and count plate according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nexample of FluoroSpot representation is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3001-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Red numbers indicate positive spots.\n(B) Image of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 production exported from the ImmunoSpot 7 Software.\nNote: each washing step done manually adding the correct volume of mentioned washing solution, allowing wells to soak for about 1 min.\nIntracellular cytokine staining (ICS)\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes steps to better characterize SARS-CoV-2 T cells upon peptide stimulation and to quantify their cytokine production with flow cytometry.\nPeptide stimulation.\nResuspend at least 106 PBMCs with 200 μL of 8% human serum RPMI 1640 in a 5 mL round-bottom polystyrene tube.\nStimulate PBMCs with or without SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools (1 μM) in the presence of Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug 1 μg/mL) and Monensin (GolgiStop 0.5 μg/mL).\nIncubate at 37°C for 18 h.\nStain the cells with Abs.\nWash the tube with at least 2 mL of 2% FBS-PBS (centrifuge samples at 670 × g for 4 min).\nAdd 100 μL of LIVE/DEAD fixable dead cell cell stain 1×.\nIncubate at RT for 15 min.",
    "Add 60 μL of human anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8 and brilliant stain buffer cocktail and mix. See Flow cytometry Staining antibody table.\nIncubate 30 min in the dark at 4°C.\nWash the tube with at least 2 mL of 2% FBS-PBS (centrifuge samples at 670 × g for 4 min).\nAdd 100 μL of Fix reagent, as manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://nordicmubio.com/products/fixperm-cell-fixation-and-permeabilization-kit-ce/GAS-002].\nIncubate 15 min in the dark at 4°C.\nWash the tube with at least 2 mL of 2% FBS-PBS (centrifuge samples at 670 × g for 4 min).\nAdd 100 μL of Perm reagent, as manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://nordicmubio.com/products/fixperm-cell-fixation-and-permeabilization-kit-ce/GAS-002], and 4 μL of human anti-IFN-γ and anti-TNF-α cocktail and mix. See Flow cytometry Staining antibody table.\nIncubate 30 min in the dark at 4°C.\nWash the tube with at least 4 mL of 2% FBS-PBS (centrifuge samples at 670 × g for 4 min).\nAcquire samples on a BD LSR Fortessa and analyze with the FlowJo software.\nGating strategy is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3001-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating strategy for the intracellular cytokine staining performed with PBMC stimulated by peptide pools\nNote: Brefeldin A and Monensin are used to study protein transport and secretion in immune cells. They both prevent protein secretion, allowing the accumulation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi complex."
