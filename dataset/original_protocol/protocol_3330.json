    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell culture and transfection\nTiming: 2 weeks\nIn this step, WT GPR110 or F663S mutant is transiently expressed in HEK293 cells.\nWe recommend performing two experiments on three biological replicates. The first experiment aims to filter out the background proteins by identifying the common binding proteins of the expressed GPR110 and M45 control. The second experiment is to identify physiologically relevant partners by comparing the data from the WT GPR110 with the F663S mutant. Six 15-cm dishes of cells are required for each experiment.\nCell culture.\nCulture and maintain HEK293 cells in 15-cm dishes in EMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator.\nCritical: Cells with passage numbers of 8–12 are used for transfection.\nCell transfection.\nSeed HEK293 cells.\nSeed HEK293 cells (∼8 × 106 cells) in 15-cm dishes and incubate the cells at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 16–20 h.\nNote: Cell density should be 60%–80% confluent at the time of transfection.\nTransfect HEK293 cells.\nNote: The following protocol is used for transfection of a 15-cm dish of cells. The regents should be scaled up for triplicate samples.\nDilute 5 μg of GPR110, or F663S, or M45 plasmid in 700 μL of Opti-MEM I.\nReduced Serum Media (Opti-MEM).\nDilute 50 μL Lipofectamine 2000 in 700 μL of Opti-MEM.\nMix solutions from Steps i and ii and incubate for 15 min at room temperature (25°C).\nAdd the mixed solution to the 15-cm dish of cells from Step a drop by stop using a pipette. Gently rock the dish back and forth.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C and under 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nIn-cell crosslinking\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this step, protein-protein interactions are captured in living cells by chemical crosslinking with DSS.",
    "In-cell crosslinking with DSS.\nReplace the medium with PBS.\nRemove and discard the medium by aspiration.\nWash cells with 10 mL PBS.\nNote: Gently add 10 mL PBS to the side of the dish to avoid disturbing the cell layer, and gently rock the dish back and forth 3–5 times. Also, aspiration should be performed gently.\nRemove and discard the PBS by aspiration.\nAdd 5 mL PBS.\nCritical: Crosslinking cannot be performed in buffers containing primary amines.\nCrosslink proteins with DSS.\nPrepare freshly 200 mM DSS in DMSO.\nAdd 25 μL of 200 mM DSS to cells in PBS (Step 3iv). Gently rock the dish back and forth 3–5 times. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature (25°C).\nQuench crosslinking.\nAdd 150 μL of 1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 7.4) to quench the crosslinking reaction. Mix gently by rocking the dish back and forth several times. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nNote: It is normal that some cells become floating after crosslinking.\nImmunoprecipitation (IP)\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, cells are lysed and the HA-tagged GPR110 and its interacting proteins are pulled down by HA-antibody conjugated to protein G beads. The immunoprecipitated proteins are eluted from the beads by HA peptide.\nPreparation of cell lysate.\nHarvest cells.\nDetach the cells without removing PBS using a cell lifter.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15-mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 4°C at 1,000 × g.\nDiscard the supernatant by aspiration.\nNote: Care should be taken not to disturb the cell pellet.\nCritical: Do not directly remove PBS from the culture dishes which will result in loss of the floating cells. Do not harvest the cells by trypsin digestion, as trypsin digestion accelerates the degradation of proteins in the lysate.\nLyse cells.",
    "Add 1.5 mL cold lysis buffer to the pellet. Resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down 3–5 times.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 Eppendorf tube.\nIncubate the cell suspension on ice for 30 min.

Keep samples on ice.\nDetermine the protein concentration using BCA Protein Assay kit. Adjust the protein concentration to the lowest sample concentration with lysis buffer if necessary.\nNote: We use 1.3 mL (∼3.5 mg proteins) of the lysate for each IP. Additionally, 20 μL of each sample is used for western blotting with HA antibody to confirm the expression level of total GPR110 and F663S.\nImmunoprecipitation with HA antibody.\nIncubate the lysate with HA antibody.\nTransfer 1.3 mL of the lysate (Step 4bv) for each sample to an Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 40 μL of HA antibody to the lysate. Incubate samples on a rotator overnight (16–20 h) at 4°C.\nPrepare protein G beads.\nAdd 40 μL of well-resuspended magnetic Dynabeads Protein G to a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.\nPlace the tube in the rack of DynaMag-2 magnet for 1 min. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Remove the supernatant with a pipette while the tube is in the magnet rack. Care should be taken not to disturb the accumulated beads.\nConjugate antibody to protein G beads.\nTransfer the HA antibody-incubated lysate (from Step 5aii) to the tube containing the Dynabeads Protein G (Step 5bii).\nIncubate for 4 h at 4°C on a rotator.\nWash non-specifically bound proteins.\nPlace samples in the rack of DynaMag-2 magnet for 1 min. Remove and discard the supernatant.",
    "Remove the tubes from the magnet. Wash beads by adding 800 μL of lysis buffer.\nGently shake the tubes by hand. Spin down the beads briefly using a low-speed microcentrifuge.\nPlace the tubes on the magnet for 1 min. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat Steps ii and iii two more times.\nNote: Remove the supernatant with a pipette while the tubes are in the magnet rack. Care should be taken not to disturb the accumulated beads.\nElute co-immunoprecipitated proteins.\nPrepare 1 mg/mL HA peptide in lysis buffer.\nAdd 50 μL of 1 mg/mL HA peptide to each tube from Step 5div.\nPlace the samples on a rotisserie rotator for 20 min at 30°C.\nPlace the samples on DynaMag-2 magnet for 1 min.\nCollect and transfer the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube.\nPause point: The samples containing co-immunoprecipitated proteins can be stored at ‒80°C until further use.\nIn-gel digestion\nTiming: 3 days\nIn this step, GPR110 and its interacting protein partners are separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and digested by trypsin.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3098-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gel fractionation for in-gel digestion, LC-MS/MS and label-free quantitation\nGel bands are cut out into fractions (i.e., fraction A-C) from each sample (i.e., sample number 1–6) according to the molecular weight range of interest.\nIn-gel digestion.\nSeparate proteins with SDS-PAGE.\nMix 40 μL of the protein solution eluted from Step 5ev with 13.3 μL 4x lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol.\nIncubate the samples at 37°C for 30 min.\nAssemble a XCell SureLock Mini-Cell system with NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris mini gel (1.0 mm × 10 well) and MOPS SDS running buffer.\nLoad 45 μL of each sample. Load 5 μL protein standards before the 1st sample and after the last sample.",
    "Start electrophoresis with a constant voltage of 200 V. Stop when the dye front is around 1 cm away from the base of the gel.\nNote: The electrophoresis time is about 60 min.\nStain gel with Coomassie G-250.\nRemove the gel and wash the gel with 100 mL ultrapure water (18.2MΩ-cm) three times for 5 min. Discard each rinse.\nStain the gel with 20 mL of SimplyBlue SafeStain (Coomassie G-250) for 1 h at room temperature (25°C).\nRemove and discard the staining solution.\nIncubate the gel in 100 mL of ultrapure water for 1 h.\nCut out and excise gel bands.\nCritical: Wear gloves, sleeve protectors, mask, and cap to avoid keratin contamination. Clean gel cutting tools (blades and forceps) subsequently with methanol and water. Clean workspace (glass plates and bench). Do not talk over samples.\nPlace gel on a clean glass plate. Cut out gel bands using a wide stainless steel surgical prep blade.\nNote: In the case of GPR110, the monomeric receptor band appears at ∼130 kDa. Bands above ∼130 kDa are expected to contain interacting partners that are crosslinked to GPR110 via DSS. To identify more proteins, we divided the gel slice above 100 kDa into three fractions, 100–150 kDa, 150–250 kDa and 250 kDa to the top of the gel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nDice the gel slice of each lane (i.e., each sample) into 1 × 1 mm pieces using a single edge razor blade. Collect the gel pieces into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube containing 200 μL water using filter forceps.\nNote: Water in the collecting tube helps separate gel slices from the forceps.\nRemove and discard water from the tube using a gel loading tip.\nDe-stain gel pieces.",
    "Add 200 μL (or enough to cover) of de-staining solution (25 mM NH4HCO3 in 50% ACN). Vortex and spin briefly with a low-speed microcentrifuge.

However, they can be stored at ‒80°C for up to several weeks.",
    "Digest proteins in-gel.\nPrepare freshly 12.5 ng/μL trypsin/Lys-C in 25 mM NH4HCO3.\nCritical: Ensure that the trypsin/Lys-C pellet is at the bottom of the vial before adding 25 mM NH4HCO3. Gently tap down the pellet that sticks to the cap if necessary.\nAdd 100 μL of 12.5 ng/μL trypsin to dried gel pieces. Incubate on ice for 30 min to allow absorption of the solution into the gel.\nNote: To ensure gel pieces are fully submerged, the volume of trypsin solution should be at least three times as that of the dried gel pieces. If necessary, more trypsin solution can be added to completely cover the gel pieces.\nIncubate the samples at 37°C in an incubator for 16–20 h.\nExtract peptides.\nPrepare peptide extraction solution (PXS). Mix 5% formic acid in water with ACN at 1:1 ratio.\nAdd 100 μL of PXS (or the volume of the trypsin/Lys-C solution added in Step 6 fii). Vortex and spin briefly.

    "Dissolve the dried peptides by adding 10 μL of 0.1% TFA. Vortex and spin briefly.\nNote: Check the pH of the peptide solution using a pH paper. We perform this by pipetting a minimal amount of the solution (0.07 μL with a 2.5 μL pipette) into a strip of pH paper. Typically, the pH value is around 2–3.\nCritical: The pH should be less than 4 before the desalting step described below. Otherwise, the binding of peptides to C18 ZipTip column is compromised, and peptides are lost during washing steps.\nRemove salts and contaminants using Millipore C18 ZipTip according to manufacturer’s instructions. In this step, the purified peptides are eluted with 10 μL 0.1% TFA in 50% ACN.\nNote: We use 10 μL Millipore ZipTip pipette tips with 0.6 μL C18 resin. The binding capacity of the ZipTip is 3 μg peptides. Adjust the amounts of peptides to be desalted if necessary.\nDry the purified peptides to dryness with a vacuum concentrator (typically 30 min at 25°C).\nPause point: At this point, dried desalted peptides can be stored at ‒80°C until further use.\nNote: Alternatively, dry the sample down to 5 μL to remove ACN.

    "Note: We use 2 mL glass vials with a 250 μL polypropylene conical insert with flexible feet and PTFE cap.\nPlace samples in the autosampler of the liquid chromatography system.\nCritical: To ensure longer shelf life of the peptide samples, it is important to set the temperature of the autosampler at 4°C.\nSet up sequence for LC-MS/MS runs.\nSelect LC-MS/MS method, injection volume (e.g., 2 μL), vial position, etc.\nRun sequence.\nNote: During LC-MS/MS, peptides are injected onto a C18 peptide trap column and washed with 25 μL of trap column LC solvent at a rate of 5 μL/min for 5 min. The peptides are then eluted from the trap column into an analytical column and separated with 120-min gradients of nano-LC Mobile Phase B at a rate of 300 nL/min. The nano-LC eluent is analyzed by high resolution mass spectrometry in full scan mode and MS/MS in data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA). A recommended mobile phase gradient and mass spectrometry method are suggested in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], respectively.\nProtein identification\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, proteins are identified by searching of MS/MS data against NCBInr database.

The criteria used to filter results included 1% false positive threshold and expect value of less than 0.05 for significant peptide matches. The expect score was calculated using the homology threshold or the significance threshold as per a standard Mascot protein family report.\nExport the search results to Excel files.\nCompare proteins identified from GPR110-transfected samples with those from M45 controls.\nIdentify potential interacting proteins of GPR110.\nExclude non-specific binding proteins that are found in M45 samples.\nExclude proteins that are not reproducible in three independent experiments.\nLabel-free protein quantification\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, physiologically relevant partners of GPR110 are identified by quantitatively comparing the binding proteins of WT GPR110 with F663S mutant.

Progenesis QI for proteomics software aligns six LC-MS/MS data to compensate for between-run variation in the LC separation technique, resulting in increased reliability and precision of peak picking and peptide abundance measurements. An alignment vector is a representation of the difference between the chromatographic retention times of an ion in one run and the equivalent ion in the reference run. The quality of the alignment is indicated by the scores.\nIdentify physiologically relevant partners by label-free protein quantitation.",
