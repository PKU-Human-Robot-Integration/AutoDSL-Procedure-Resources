    "**A) Cell maintenance**\nHEK-293T cells\nHEK-293T cells were cultured in 25 mL D10 medium on a 150 mm tissue culture dish at 37°C and 5% atmospheric CO2 and passaged every 2-3 days when confluence reached 70%. To passage the cells, remove the culture medium and replace with 4 mL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate for 5 minutes. Dilute and quench the reaction by gentle pipetting with 10 mL fresh media, centrifuge the cells at 500g for 5 minutes, count the cells using the hemocytometer, and reseed 1 million cells in 25 mL D10 media on a new 150 mm tissue culture dish.\nJurkat and K562 cells\nJurkat and K562 cells were both cultured in suspension in C10 medium in vent cap cell culture flasks at 37°C and 5% atmospheric CO2 and passaged every 2-3 days when confluence reached 70%. To passage the cells, 1 million cells were added to a new cell culture flask containing fresh C10 media.\n**B) SCT library generation**\n1. Starting with a list of desired peptides to express in a SCT library, generate back-translated nucleotide sequences with the IDT Codon Optimization Tool. Select \"Amino Acids\" as the input sequence type, \"gBlocks Gene Fragments\" as the Product Type, \"Homo sapiens \\(human)\" as the Organism, and enter a tab-delimited list of peptides on the \"Bulk Entry\" page.\n  2. Append nucleotide sequences for cloning into a BsmBI digested backbone to the back-translated epitope sequences \"CAGGAGGGCTCGGCA\" + <epitope sequence> + \"GGATGCGGAGGGTCC\"\n  3. Append random nucleotides to the end of the epitope oligo for normalization \n  <epitope oligo> + \"GGCGGCCGCTCATCTCGTGCGACATCAAGCTATACTCTAATATAGCATTCCGTTCGAGTATAGCAG\"\n4. Submit the first 100 bp of each nucleotide sequence with appended random nucleotides for synthesis=Left\\(<epitope oligo with random nucleotides>, 100)\n  5. Cloning",
    "a. Backbone first digestion and purification: Prepare 1200 ul of digestion buffer including 120 μl of 10X NEB 3.1 Buffer, 48 μl of NEB BsmBI Enzyme, 72 μl of backbone plasmid \\(pCCLc-MND-2kb stuffer-β2m-A2-IRES-eGFP)  at 1 μg/μl, 960 μl of Nuclease-free water, aliquot 100 ul across 12 PCR strips, and incubate for 6 hours at 55°C, then heat inactivate enzyme at 80°C for 20 minutes.  Pool all digestion reactions in a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. Purify with NucleoSpin Gel and PCR purification kit, using one column per 240 μl of digested plasmid \\(5 in total), and elute in 20 μl Elution Buffer \\(supplied) per column. Pool elution in a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. About 50% recovery of digested plasmid expected \\(36 μg) in 100 μl is about 300 ng/μl final concentration.",
    "b. Backbone redigestion and purification: Prepare 600 μl of second digestion buffer \\(60 ul of 10X NEB 3.1 Buffer, 24 μl of NEB BsmBI Enzyme, 100 μl of digested backbone from Step 5a, 416 μl of Nuclease-free water), aliquot 100 μl across 6 PCR strips, and incubate for 6 hours at 55°C, then heat inactivate enzyme at 80°C for 20 minutes.  Pour a 0.9% agarose gel \\(mix 1.08 g agarose and 120 mL TAE buffer, heat to above 95°C until fully dissolved, cool to 60°C, add 10 μl gel green, mix and cast in a gel tray with wide combs until solidified). Pool all second digest reactions in a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube \\(600 μl). Add 120 ul 6X Purple Loading Dye to digest, mix, and load mixture on gel at 65 ul per well \\(11 total). Load 10 μl 2-log Ladder in a remaining empty well. Run gel at 120 V for 1 hour, or until dye front has run 75% of the gel. Briefly image the gel in a gel imager at 365 nm UV wavelength. Cut out the larger of the two expected bands with a razor, and place each excised band in a 2 mL eppendorf tube. Follow instructions for NucleoSpin Gel and PCR purification kit, using one column per 4 wells of excised plasmid \\(3 in total), and elute in 20 μl Elution Buffer \\(supplied) per column. Pool elutions in a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. About 30% recovery of digested plasmid expected \\(11 μg) in 60 μl is about 180 ng/μl final concentration. Note: The smaller band corresponds to the 2kb stuffer sequence, expected to run at 2,000 bases. The larger band is the digested plasmid.",
    "c. Library oligos amplification: Dilute or resuspend single-stranded oligo pool to 10 ng/μl with Elution Buffer \\(supplied in the PCR purification kit).

Pool all amplification reactions in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. PCR purify with NucleoSpin Gel and PCR purification kit, using one column, and elute in 17 μl Elution Buffer \\(supplied). Expect above 10 ng/μl of double-stranded oligos.\nd. Ligation: Dilute linearized vector to 100 ng/μl. Dilute double-stranded oligo pool to 12.5 ng/μl. In PCR strips, prepare 10 μl of ligation mix \\(2 ul of 5X In-Fusion mix, 2 μl of linearized vector at 100 ng/μl, 2 μl of double-stranded oligo pool at 12.5 ng/μl, 4 μl of Nuclease-free water) and 10 μl of no-insert mix \\(2 μl of linearized vector and 8 μl of Nuclease-free water). Incubate at 50°C for 15 minutes.",
    "e. Transformation: Dilute both ligation mix and no-insert mix to 24 μl with Nuclease-free water. Using 12 tubes \\(50 μl each) of NEB 5-alpha high efficiency competent cells, transform 2 μl of ligation mix per tube, according to manufacturer instructions. Pool cells diluted in SOC after recovery. Perform four serial dilutions on an aliquot of pooled cells and plate equal volumes of each dilution on LB + Carbenicillin plates to calculate transformation efficiency. Inoculate 1.5 L of LB + Carbenicillin liquid media with the remainder of the cell mixture, split across 3 maxi prep flasks. Incubate plates at 37°C for 12 hours or greater, and liquid media in a shaking incubator 37°C for 12 hours or greater. Note: Use cells with a transformation efficiency at 1-3 x 10^9 cfu/μg or above.\n f. Calculate library coverage from the amount of transformed cells pre dilution, total amount of pooled cell mixture, and number of unique oligos in the library:\n     Plasmid coverage = number of transformants / number of oligos\n g. Maxi prep the 1.5 L of liquid media across three maxi columns. Pool maxi preps in a 2 mL eppendorf tube. \n.\n**C) Transient transfection of plasmids of interest**\n6. For each plasmid to be transfected, seed one 60 mm tissue culture dish with 1.2 million HEK-293T cells one day prior to transfection and incubate overnight at 37°C and 5% atmospheric CO2.\n  7. Prepare transfection mixes for each of the plasmids of interest. For a retroviral vector, add 2 μg of plasmid, 1.3 μg of pRD114, and 2 μg of pHIT60 to 400 μL OptiMEM and mix by pipetting. For a lentiviral vector, add 2.8 μg of plasmid, 2.1 μg of psPAX1, and 0.7 μg of pMD2.G to 400 μL OptiMEM and mix by pipetting.",
    "8. To the plasmid mixture, add 16.8 μL TransIT-293 reagent and mix gently by pipetting. Incubate the solution at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.\n  9. Add the TransIT-293 reagent-plasmid mixture dropwise to different areas of the HEK-293T cells. Gently rock the culture vessel to evenly distribute the solution.\n  10. 48 hours after transfection, filter the viral supernatant using a 0.45 μm syringe filter and 10 mL syringe.\n  11. Use viral supernatant for subsequent transduction or aliquot the remaining viral supernatant into 1.5 mL tubes and freeze at -80°C for future use.\n  \n**D) Transduction and generation of Jurkat TCR and K562 library cell lines**\n12. For generation of Jurkat TCR cell lines, add 1 mL of a 0.2 million Jurkat cells/mL C10 media and 1.5 mL of viral supernatant to a 6-well plate. Add 2.5 μL polybrene \\(1000x) and mix by gently rocking the plate.\n  13. Spin infect the cells at 30°C for 1.5 hours at 2500 rpm.\n  14. After centrifugation, carefully aspirate away the media and replace with fresh media and culture the cells in the incubator.\n  15. For generation of K562 library cell lines, we aimed for 10% transduction efficiency with 0.3 MOI. Resuspend 15 million K562 cells in a premixed solution of 12 mL C10 media, 12 μL polybrene, and 3 μL of viral supernatant. Evenly distribute the mixture among the wells of a 6-well plate.\n  NOTE: A low MOI ensures only 1 copy of each gene is transduced to a single K562 cell.\n16. Spin infect the cells at 30°C for 1.5 hours at 2500 rpm.\n  17. After centrifugation, carefully aspirate away the media and replace with fresh media and culture the cells in the incubator.\n  18.
