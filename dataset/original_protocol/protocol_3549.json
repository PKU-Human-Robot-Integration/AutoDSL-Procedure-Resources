    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nhiPSC culturing\nTiming: 30 min\nThe hiPSCs are maintained under feeder-free conditions with daily medium changes and kept at 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2. When 80%–90% confluent, the hiPSC can be passaged (usually about 3 to 4 days after passaging).\nPrewarm E8 medium, EDTA Dissociation Buffer, and Matrigel-coated plates to 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the medium, and add 1 mL 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS to each well. At this point, 2.5 to 3 million cells should be present in each well of the 6-well culture plate.\nIncubate the plate for 3–5 min.\nAspirate the EDTA and flush the hiPSC with a 1 mL tip filled with 1 mL E8 + 5 μM Y27632, dispense the medium over the surface of the plate well until all the cells are detached and gently mix 2–5 times using the 1 mL tip.\nAdd the required cell amount from the 1 mL cell suspension into each well of a Matrigel-coated plate containing 2 mL E8 + 5 μM Y27632 (split ratio of 1:13 is performed here).\nPlace the plate in the incubator and make side-to-side movements to equally disperse the cells in every well.\nPrewarm hiPSC E8 Medium to 20°C–25°C.\nEach day aspirate the medium and add 2 mL of fresh prewarmed hiPSC E8 complete medium per well.\nWhen the hiPSCs are 80%–90% confluent they are ready to start the differentiation. At this point, equal dispersed hiPSC colonies should be present in each well.\nCritical: The starting seeding cell density is very critical for an efficient cardiac differentiation. The initial plating density and/or the time of expansion prior to initiation of differentiation may require optimization for different cell lines or expansion conditions. We recommend plating at a 1:10–1:20 splitting ratio with a cell density of 80%–90% within 3–4 days.",
    "Note: Karyotyping of the hiPSC lines is advised. Thereafter, hiPSC can be safely passaged for 20 times before another karyotyping is advised. Passaging over 40 times could lead in spontaneous differentiation of the hiPSC lines, resulting in inefficient differentiations.\nPause Point: The hiPSC can be maintained in hiPSC E8 complete medium and passaged every 3–4 days before starting differentiation and hiPSC-CM expansion.\nhiPSC-CM differentiation\nTiming: 10 min per day\nThe cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs can be successfully performed by the steps described below. The cultures of cardiomyocytes typically contract by day 8–9 of differentiation before starting the expansion on day 11 (see Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nDay 0: Prepare 3 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium with the appropriate concentration of CHIR per hiPSC line. Aspire the E8 medium and replace carefully with 3 mL/well with the prepared differentiation medium. For every differentiation apply two concentrations of CHIR for an optimal window concentration per differentiation per plate.\nCritical: Do not re-freeze and thaw the CHIR aliquots since this molecule is unstable after thawing and freezing.\nNote: Other differentiation protocols can be used to generate hiPSC-CMs before the expansion. Here, we have used the B27 (Lian, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), Heparin (Lin, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), and CDM3 (Burridge, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) medium, which were all sufficient for the massive expansion of hiPSC-CMs.\nNote: Though we identified 7 and 8 μM CHIR in the B27 protocol as the optimal concentration for the three lines that we tested, other lines may respond to CHIR treatment differently. We recommend testing concentrations of 2–8 μM of CHIR in heparin or CDM3 medium and 5–10 μM of CHIR in B27 medium differentiations.\nDay 1: On top of the original medium, carefully add 2 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2 incubator.",
    "Day 2: On top of the original medium, carefully add 1 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2 incubator.\nNote: Here we use the addition of medium on day 1 and day 2 to the original medium of step 10. This protocol is effective to gradual decrease the CHIR concentration, mimicking the first steps of embryonic heart development. However, other differentiation protocols such as 2 days of CHIR medium is also possible to generate hiPSC-CMs for the CM expansion.\nDay 3: Aspirate the old medium and carefully add 3 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium with 2 μM Wnt-C59 to each well of the 6-well plate. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2 incubator.\nNote: During differentiation, the cell death rate is high. Remove dead cell debris as much as possible by shaking and aspirating the medium completely.\nDay 5: Aspirate the medium and carefully add 3 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2 incubator.\nDay 7: Aspirate the medium and carefully add 3 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM culture medium. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2 incubator. Robust spontaneous contraction should occur by day 8–9.\nDay 9: Aspirate the medium and add 2 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM purification medium (PM). Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2 incubator.\nDay 11: The cardiomyocytes are now ready for cardiac expansion.\nNote: Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] shows a typical spontaneous contracting monolayer at day 11.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. Monolayer of contracting hiPSC-CMs at day 11 (hiPSC-CM differentiation; step 17)\nReplating of differentiated hiPSC-CMs\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Replating of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by enzymatic digestion can be performed in order to plate cells into desired culture vessel formats at defined cell numbers if required (e.g., in lower cell density for the maximum expansion capacity; Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Between day 10 and day 14 the hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be used for most successful cardiac expansion. Here, we use monolayers with spontaneous contracting cells on day 11 (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). From a 6 well plate format, select the most optimal well(s) by microscopic observe the amount of beating cardiomyocytes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_471_1.csv\nCritical: For efficient hiPSC-CM expansion, use wells where a beating percentage between 50% and 90% can be observed under the bright field microscope (confluent contracting wells roughly contain ∼90% CMs).\nAspirate the medium, wash the cells with PBS and incubate hiPSC-CMs with pure TrypLE Select (10×) for 15–45 min at 37°C (0.75 mL of TrypLE per 9.6-cm2 growth surface).\nNote: Use the pure TrypLE Select (10×) for efficient dissociation of the hiPSC-CMs. Other reagents such as TrypLE Express or Trypsin will result in an inefficient dissociation and low cell viability.\nAfter incubation for ∼15 min, gently shake to detach the hiPSC-CMs. If cells do not detach yet, then repeat incubation for 1 or 2 times (up to 45 min). When cells come off the culture plate, add 1.5 mL per 75-cm2 warm RPMI-1640 per flask and dispense over the surface of the plate until all the cells are detached and gently mix 2–5 times using the 5 mL pipette.\nNote: Premature dissociation by pipetting results in shear stress-induced cell death, therefore shaking and longer incubations with TrypLE Select (10×) is advised.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15-mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 3 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell suspension in 1 mL/flask of 37°C-preheated of the CM replating medium.\nCount the cell suspension by mixing 10 μL cell suspension with 1:1 Trypan Blue Solution in a counting slide and by using a cell counting machine.\nRe-plate passage 1 (P1) of hiPSC-CMs in the culture system of choice in a culture surface split ratio of 1:10–20 and add 37°C-preheated CM replating medium (RM) in the volume according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nNote: If animal-free and chemical defined is not desired, the knockout serum can be replaced with 10% FBS in the replating medium.\nRemove the Matrigel coating from the flasks and immediately add the cell solution to the prepared culture flasks/plates.\nPut the flask into the incubator and distribute the cells by moving the flask in short side-to-side and back-and-forth motions. Incubator conditions should be set to 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 90% humidity. Proceed to step 27.\nNote: Methods Videos S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] shows a typical morphology of passage 1 after 24 h.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S2. Morphology of hiPSC-CMS at passage 1 expanded for 1 day (hiPSC-CM expansion; step 26)\nhiPSC-CM expansion\nTiming: 30 min\nThe proliferation of hiPSC-CMs can be conducted by the removal of cell-cell contacts and small-molecule inhibition with CHIR99021. The expansion protocol comprise a series of medium changes and splitting as illustrated in the graphical abstract and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], in between which the cells are kept at 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2. The hiPSC-cardiomyocytes can be successfully split for 5 passages with a similar juvenile CM morphology (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and contraction (see Methods Videos S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/471-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

One hiPSC line was used for these experiments. n = 7, n = 2, n = 2 respectively from P0 day 11 to P5. Data are represented as mean ± SD.\n(C) Bright-field images at different time points of hiPSC-CM expansion with the input of the indicated differentiation methods. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nDay 1: After attachment and recovery of passage 1 (P1) hiPSC-CM for 24 h start the expansion process by replacing the replating medium with 37°C-preheated cardiac expansion medium according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] every other day or once every three days. For most cell lines 2 μM CHIR induces efficient expansion of hiPSC-CMs (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCritical: Even though we found that 2 μM of CHIR is the optimal concentration for the expansion of hiPSC-CMs from three different donors that we tested, it should be noted that cell line-to-line and molecular batch-to-batch variabilities are possible. Therefore, it is recommended to optimize CHIR concentrations between 1–3 μM (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: The protocol for the generation of hiPSC-CMs can be variable. Here, the differentiation methods; B27 (Lian, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), Heparin (Lin, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), and CDM3 (Burridge, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) are used to produce CMs, which can be efficiently expanded (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
    "After 3–5 days, the hiPSC-CMs will reach 70%–80% confluency and should be passaged to inhibit cell-cell contact. Aspirate the medium, wash with PBS. Add 3 mL of 37°C warm TrypLE per 75-cm2growth surface and incubate the hiPSC-CMs for 10–15 min at 37°C.\nAfter incubation for ∼15 min, detach the hiPSC-CMs with a 5 or 10 mL tip filled with 6 mL per 75-cm2 37°C-preheated RPMI-1640 and dispense over the surface of the plate well until all the cells are detached and gently mix 2–5 times using the 5 mL pipette.\nNote: The dissociation of expanding hiPSC-CMs will be more quickly and easier than the dissociation of d11 differentiated hiPSC-CMs, which sometimes requires prolonged incubation with TrypLE Select (10×).\nTransfer the cell suspension to a new 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell suspension in 1 mL/tube 37°C-preheated of the CM splitting medium supplemented with optimal CHIR concentration.\nCount the cell suspension.\nNote: If cell numbers are high per tube, resuspend hiPSC-CMs in a larger amount of medium before counting the cell suspension (1 mL per 10 million).\nAdd 37°C-preheated CM splitting medium to the hiPSC-CMs, in the density and volume according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nRemove the Matrigel solution from new flasks and immediately add the cell solution to the prepared culture flasks/plates.\nPut the flask into the incubator and distribute the cells in the well by moving the flask in short side-to-side and back-and-forth motions. Incubator conditions should be set to 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 90% humidity.",
    "Refresh the expansion medium every other day in the volume according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. After 5–8 days, the hiPSC-CMs will reach 70%–80% confluency and should be passaged to inhibit cell-cell contact. Repeat steps 28–36 for passage 2–5. By every passage, split the hiPSC-CMs in a splitting ratio and flasks according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nNote: By higher passage numbers hiPSC-CMs proliferation gradually slows down and further passaging then P4–5 usually does not result in increased cell numbers.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S3.

Scale bar, 200 μm. D, day; P, passage.\nNote: Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] shows a typical morphology of passage 4 after expansion.\nCritical: Replacement of medium is recommended for every other day in order to provide fresh nutrients and stable concentrations of CHIR for expanding hiPSC-CMs. For weekend free culturing it is possible to stretch the medium changing interval accordingly while increasing the medium volume in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] with 1.5×.",
    "After substantial expansion of the CM population, CHIR withdrawal from the medium results in the decrease of hiPSC-CMs proliferation, and subsequent regular CM culture medium change intervals can be extended for long-term culturing or downstream assays.\nPause Point: After passage 1 or passage 2, the expanded hiPSC-CMs can be efficiently frozen for biobanking and thawing upon analysis (See freezing of hiPSC-CMs; steps 39–44, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/471-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

To ensure pure populations and viable populations after thawing the cells should ideally be frozen after having passed in the expansion protocol. Cryopreservation can be performed from day 15 after the start of differentiation, after passage 1 or after passage 2 (data not shown). After the later passages, the viability of the hiPSC-CMs is less viable (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Note: Volumes are given for one cryovial.\nCount the CMs after the dissociation as described in the Replating of differentiated hiPSC-CMs section.\nCritical: Use hiPSC-CMs in passage 1–2 for the cryopreservation and biobanking to generate viable and expandable cultures.\nTransfer the desired cell suspension for freezing to a 15-mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the CM in STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Freezing Medium. Use 0.5 mL medium for 0.5–2 × 106 CMs and 1 mL of freezing medium for 2–8 × 106 CMs per vial.\nNote: Keep the cell suspension on ice.\nFreeze the vials at −80°C for minimal 4 h and maximal 12 in a CoolCell or 2-propanol-filled freezing container.\nTransfer the vials to liquid nitrogen or −150°C for long-term storage.\nThawing of hiPSC-derived CMs\nTiming: 30 min\nCryopreserved hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be thawed and recovered into culture as described below.\nPrepare 9 mL of 37°C-preheated RPMI medium in a 15-mL tube on RT.\nPrepare a Matrigel-coated T75 per 3–6 × 106 or a T175 for 7–14 × 106 hiPSC-CMs.\nCollect the vial with hiPSC-CMs from the liquid nitrogen and thaw the cells at 37°C till only a little clump is visible. Do not thaw more than three vials of CMs at one time.\nTransfer the cell suspension to the 15-mL tube, drop by drop, and swirl the tube while adding the cell suspension.

Incubator conditions should be set to 37°C, 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 90% humidity.\nReplace the thawing medium with CM expansion medium the next day. The hiPSC-CMs should be attached, beating, and can be used for expansion (step 28) or downstream assays.\n(Please see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for representative viability, morphology, and proliferation rate after thawing of hiPSC-CM)\nFlow cytometry analyses of dissociated hiPSC-CMs\nTiming: 1.5 h, plus 30 min for dissociation of CMs\nFor the quality control and expansion rate analysis of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, the cells can be collected, fixed, and immunocytochemically stained for the expression of a cardiac marker, such as α-actinin, and proliferation marker ki67 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/471-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
