    "1. General Preparation\nTo avoid debris, clean work area using packing tape and wipe down area with a cleanroom wipe and isopropyl alcohol.\nFor all steps requiring PDMS, mix PDMS at a 10:1 ratio (10 g of cross linking agent, 100 g of elastomer base). Mix by hand or with a commercially available mixer. Use a planetary centrifugal mixer here: mixing for 2 minutes at 2000 rpm, then degassing the PDMS for 2 minutes at 2200 rpm.\nClean all molds with air gun to blow out debris prior to use.\nCAUTION: Do not use metal forceps to remove debris as it will damage the surface of the molds.\n2. Top Channel Preparation\nWipe down the glossy side of each polyurethane piece with ethanol and cleanroom wipes. Make sure all residual ethanol is dried from the polyurethane surface.\nPlace the glossy side of the polyurethane over the open side of the MiP mold to create a seal on the open side of the mold, leaving only a well-like opening at the top of the mold for pouring PDMS.\n\tNOTE: Check that every mold is covered securely by polyurethane piece or the PDMS will leak from molds during pouring.\nPlace the mold and polyurethane assemblies into a MiP jig, with the textured side against the end of the MiP jig. Continue to do this until all molds have been placed in the jig.\nTighten the MiP jig by turning the handle using a wrench until the jig spacing is 25 mm in width.\nMake a boat of aluminum foil surrounding the MiP jig to prevent excess PDMS from leaking onto surfaces.\nPour PDMS into each of the molds well until full.\n\tNOTE: Each chip top component requires about 3 mL of PDMS.",
    "Once the entire jig is filled, place the jig into the vacuum desiccator. Pull vacuum at -80 kPa for 1 h to degas PDMS.\nAfter 1 h, remove the MiP jig from the desiccator and place in 60 °C oven for at least 4 h to cure PDMS.\nDisassemble the MiP jig using a wrench, loosen the jig by turning the handle counter clockwise. Once molds are free from compression, remove molds from jig.\nRemove the polyurethane strips from each mold and discard.\nCarefully de-mold PDMS parts from their molds and lay them feature-side up.\nLine up the blade of tile scraper at end tab notch and cut away each end to singulate the top components.\nCheck parts for any of the following failure modes and discard any unsatisfactory parts: scratches in the main channel, large debris above the channel area, large bubbles, deformed vacuum channels.\nStore finished parts in square Petri dishes within pressure positive cabinets at room temperature.\n3. Bottom Channel Preparation\nPour approximately 10.5 g of PDMS into molds until the PDMS reaches the top of the cavity.\n\t\nInspect the bottom channel mold for PDMS cured to the bottom of mold.\nIf dirty, scrape old PDMS from the bottom of the mold since an uneven surface on the bottom of the mold can cause uneven thickness of the final parts.\n\t\tNOTE: For small <2 cm2 areas that are uncovered, the air gun can be used very gently to move PDMS over the space.\nPlace molds into vacuum desiccator for 1 h.\nAfter 1 h, move the molds into a level 60 °C oven for >4 h.\nPlace mold on table in laminar flow hood. Loosen PDMS from one edge of the mold.\nGrip one corner and gently peel back the PDMS from the mold surface.",
    "When fully removed, lay on work surface, so that channel features are face up.\nCut parts along outside edges with tile cutters, placing tile cutter blade in notched PDMS as in step 2.12.\nLay parts feature side up on tape to remove any debris.\nRemove part from packing tape. Drag the loose end of the part across the slide. The loose end will laminate with the glass.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to avoid stretching the part while laying it down. If bubble is trapped between part and glass, gently lift the part with the forceps and re-lay.\nPerform quality control inspection of parts. Check parts for any failure modes and discard any unsatisfactory parts, including ones that contain scratches in the main channel, large debris, large bubbles, or deformed vacuum channels.\nCover features with tape.\nStore parts in a positive pressure cabinet at room temperature.\n4. PDMS Membrane Preparation\nCheck that the wafers are free of PDMS on the back.\nPlace each membrane wafer in the designated slots in the AMF trays.\nUse the 1 mL syringe to place 0.09 mL of PDMS onto the center of each membrane wafer post array. Let PDMS sit for a minimum of 5 min to allow PDMS to spread throughout the posts of the membrane wafer.\n\tNOTE: Do not proceed to next step until at least 75% of the post array is covered in PDMS. The quality of membranes improves the longer the PDMS is allowed to wick into post region so longer wait times in this step are preferred.\nPlasma treat the polycarbonate strip at 20 W for 45 s, O2 gas at 0.80 mbar in a plasma machine.\nRemove the polycarbonate sheet from the plasma machine and use scissors to cut the polycarbonate sheets into 45 mm x 45 mm squares.",
    "NOTE: Minimize contact with the plasma treated surface to prevent dust from sticking to the polycarbonate.\nGently lay the plasma treated side of the polycarbonate squares onto the liquid PDMS centered on the membrane wafer. Ensure that the polycarbonate and the PDMS are in contact.\n\tNOTE: Avoid air pockets between the polycarbonate and the PDMS.\nPlace the pre-cut PDMS spacer on the center of the polycarbonate square.\nPlace the pre-cut textured polycarbonate sheet on the PDMS block to keep the assembly from bonding to the compression plate.\nInsert tray so that Tray 3 is in the back, Tray 2 is in the middle, and Tray 1 is in the front. Tray 1 has a notch for alignment.\nOpen the output pressure valve and very slowly open the input pressure valve. Only then close the output pressure valve.\n\tNOTE: This is so that the output 4 kg of force is gradually applied to each membrane wafer as opposed to instantly, which may break the wafers.\nFlip the AMF switch to ON to begin the curing cycle. Cure wafer under 4 kg (16 kPa) of compression and a ramping temperature cycle listed in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nStep,Temperature (°C),Duration (min)\n1,20,20\n2,35,10\n3,45,10\n4,50,60\n5,60,120\n6,20,Hold\nTable 1 - Membrane curing conditions\nClose the input pressure valve and open the output pressure valve to release pressure from the air cylinders.\nRemove the trays and bring them to the laminar flow hood.\nCarefully peel off the textured polycarbonate and carefully remove the PDMS spacer.\n\tNOTE: Watch the PDMS spacer to ensure it does not also peel off the polycarbonate carrier, if this occurs start peeling from a different corner.",
    "Inspect the PDMS membrane through the polycarbonate carrier for areas with through-holes and use a marker to trace the outline of the through-hole area and mark any holes or defects in the membranes.\nUsing wafer handling forceps, loosen wafers from the tray.\nRemove each membrane from the wafer and place in Petri dish.\n\t\tNOTE: The PDMS membrane will de-mold from the membrane wafer and will be adhered to the polycarbonate backing. If PDMS starts detaching from the polycarbonate carrier, peel from a different region.\nStore membranes and wafers in Petri dishes in a positive pressure cabinet at room temperature.\n5. Top Assembly and Preparation\nUsing matte tape, clean the PDMS membranes as well as the insides of the Petri dish to remove debris.\nThoroughly tape the feature side of each top component to remove debris.\nPlace top channel part (\"top\") feature side up in Petri dish with PDMS membrane.\n\tNOTE: Be aware that some membranes may be used for one or two top parts depending on size of the usable area. The main channels of each top part should fit within the marked area of the membrane.\nLoad the Petri dishes into the plasma machine.\nPlasma treat membrane and top at 20 W for 45 s, O2 gas at 0.80 mbar.\nOnce the bonding cycles has finished, remove the dishes and lay the activated parts feature side down on top of the membrane and ensure part is fully laminated with membrane with no bubbles.\nPlace parts into 60 °C oven for at least 2 h to anneal.\nUsing a scalpel, trace around the perimeter of the bonded top to separate top-membrane assembly from the polycarbonate carrier.\n\tNOTE: Do not cut the carrier.",
    "Once the part is traced, peel the assembly from the polycarbonate. The PDMS membrane that is bonded to the top should peel from the carrier.\nUsing sharp tipped forceps, remove the membrane from the ports that access the bottom channel, and remove any debris or dust with forceps under a stereoscope.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave any part of the membrane covering the access port.\n6. Chip Assembly\nFeature side up, plasma treat assemblies with bottom components using the conditions in step 5.5.\nUnder an inverted microscope, align the top assembly with microscope slide to the bottom half.\nPlace in 60 °C oven for at least 2 h.\nChip Quality Control Inspection\n\tNOTE: Pay close attention to the main ports and channel of chip. Check for failure modes by eye and also under the microscope.\n\t\nTo check that the chip is bonded fully, tug lightly on each corner of the chip to check for delaminating parts.\nLook at the channel of the chip to check for a wrinkled or sagging membrane, which will appear as a wavy pattern or a light deflection in the channel.\nPerform a microscope inspection to inspect for debris in the main channel.\n\t\tNOTE: Debris in non-critical areas, such as the vacuum channels is acceptable.\nWith the chip still on the inverted microscope, inspect main channel and vacuum channels for delamination.\n\t\tNOTE: Delamination in non-critical areas (e.g., the edge of the chip) is acceptable.\nCheck that the main channels are aligned to within 50-60 µm (1-2 membrane pores).\n\t\tNOTE: It is crucial that the channels are not overlapping with vacuum channels.\nCheck that the membrane between the main channels and the inlet and outlet channels is intact without any apparent holes.",
    "NOTE: Any hole in the membrane can lead to a leaky chip or cell growth outside the channels.\nStore chips in Petri dishes in a positive pressure cabinet at room temperature.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
