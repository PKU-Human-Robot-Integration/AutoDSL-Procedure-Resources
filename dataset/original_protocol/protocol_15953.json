    "This protocol describes how to produce MPs. The initial steps encompass synthesis of peptide sets that are produced and lyophilized, as common practice in the field. They can be purchased from any supplier. However, all MPs described in this protocol were generated from peptides synthesized by TC Peptide Lab or Mimotopes. Each peptide is then solubilized and a pool generated by combining equivalent amounts of each solubilized peptide. The resulting pool is then re-lyophilized. If necessary, the procedure is repeated until a white, reasonably fluffy powder (lyocake) is obtained. Any synthesized peptides can be pooled for use into an MP. Generally, given the high cost of large sets of peptides, purified preparations are not necessary, and the of use crude peptides is acceptable. In the vast majority of cases, these will achieve >70% purity. Further, large-scale synthesis of crude peptide can usually be obtained in microtube racks, which allow efficient dilution of peptide stocks using, for example, multichannel pipettors. Purified peptides are excellent if resources are available or use necessitates. The final MP amount required should be calculated based on the number of samples or assays that need to be tested, but we recommend starting this protocol with 1 to 2 mg per individual peptide.\nMaterials\nPeptides (TC Peptide Lab or Mimotopes)\nDMSO (Sigma, cat. no.

    "Peptide preparation and pooling\n1. Resuspend peptides intended for use in MPs at a high concentration (≥20 mg/ml) in 100% DMSO.\nFor some peptides, it may be necessary to reduce the concentration and/or use water. In a few cases, precipitates might form in the solubilized pools. This can be addressed by further diluting the pools in water.\n2. Pool a uniform and desired amount of each peptide in a suitable vessel, such as a 15- or 50-ml conical tube.\nTo facilitate efficient lyophilization, the final total volume of pooled peptides should not exceed 20% of the capacity of the vessel.\n3. Dilute pooled sample 2:1 with distilled water (i.e., maximum 15 ml total volume in a 50-ml conical tube).\n4. Place diluted sample in a –80°C freezer for 24 hr.\nIdeally, samples should be frozen at an angle (∼45°) to maximize the surface area of the liquid sample in the tube. The tube holder used to hold the pools in the lyophilizer (see step 8) will ideally be frozen at the same time to facilitate maintenance of sample temperature (and prevent thawing) when subsequently moving the samples to the lyophilizer (see step 8).\nLyophilization\n5. Operate the lyophilization unit as per the manufacturer's specifications. Verify that all parameters have been set as prescribed by the manufacturer.\nIf using the 4.5-L-capacity FreeZone® Benchtop Freeze Dryer unit, set the conditions at –105°C at 0.1 to 0.01 mBar.\n6. Remove the accessory drying chamber (manifold) from the collector chamber lid and, using a soft, lint-free cloth or paper towel, wipe the port gasket(s) and sealing surfaces of the drying chamber/manifold and collector chamber lid to remove any dirt or contaminants that could cause a vacuum leak or contaminate the sample.",
    "7. Check that each sample valve is closed or in the “vent” position and then start the instrument collector and allow the refrigeration system to reach its specified operating temperature (e.g., –105°C). Start the vacuum when collector temperature is at –40°C or colder.\nOnce the system pressure is at 0.1 to 0.01 mBar and the temperature is –105°C, the system is ready for use.\n8. Moving quickly to avoid thawing, retrieve sample from the freezer (see step 4) and, using a pre-chilled 50-ml tube holder, place the samples into a pre-chilled lyophilizer flask. Cover the samples with a piece of filter paper and then attach the flask to the lyophilizer with a flask adaptor.\nDo not overload the flask; utilize additional flasks if necessary.\n9. Slowly open the port valves to commence lyophilization.\nAbrupt opening may result in bumping the sample against jar filters or into the instrument, potentially causing cross-contamination. Vacuum pressure will temporarily increase, but if the vessel is properly sealed and mounted, it will go back down to operating range (i.e., 0.1 to 0.01 mBar).\n10. Check sample and system periodically to ensure proper temperature and pressure are maintained and that the sample has not thawed.\n11. When the sample has completely dried, close the pressure valve and remove the flask from the lyophilizer.\nIt may take up to 24 hr to dry a sample, depending on the volume and sample mixture, but most samples are typically dry between 16 and 18 hr.\n12. Resuspend the sample in water using the same initial volume of water as was used to dilute the original sample (see step 3; i.e., 2 parts water to 1 part sample in DMSO) and then refreeze the sample.\nThis will facilitate further removal of any leftover DMSO.",
    "13. After the sample is frozen as in step 4, return it to the lyophilizer, repeating steps 5 to 8 as necessary. When the sample is completely dry, close the valve and carefully remove the flask from the machine.\nA successfully dried product will have a consistent white, almost fluffy powder appearance.\nMP resuspension and storage\n14. Resuspend the lyophilized MP in 100% DMSO down to 1 mg/ml peptide.\nThe final concentration of each individual peptide in the MP is uniform as long as the same amount of each peptide is pooled, irrespective of the number of peptides contained in each MP. In order to use the MP in cell stimulation assays, the peptides should be resuspended in enough volume to go into solution but not too concentrated (viscous) for accurate pipetting.\n15. Perform additional dilutions with water if concentrations <1 mg/ml are necessary.\nAvoid dilution with DMSO to minimize cytotoxicity in cell culture. In this case, it is advised to maintain a 1 mg/ml DMSO stock but to dilute smaller aliquots.\n16. Aliquot diluted pools into small aliquots (e.g., in 0.2-ml PCR tubes; volume of 25 or 50 µl is optimal) to prevent freeze-thaw cycles.\n17. Store aliquoted MPs at –20°C and inspect over time for appearance. If precipitation is noted, re-lyophilize the MPs.",
    "MPs are a complex mixture of multiple peptides, and therefore, it is unfeasible to perform mass spectrometry analysis on MPs for quality purposes. The quality of MPs is generally assessed by testing their bioactivity in a T cell assay. This protocol describes how to assess the quality of MPs and their use in an immunological assay to quantify antigen-specific responses. Specifically, the immunological assay described herein is an AIM assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as biological source material. This protocol also describes the steps of thawing and washing cryopreserved PBMCs prior to cell culture and stimulation and how to perform flow cytometry staining for membrane markers. This will allow identification of co-stimulatory receptors that are expressed on activated T cells after antigen-specific stimulation with MPs. Although this protocol is focused on an AIM assay, MPs can be used in other assay modalities to assess antigen-specific responses and/or validate MP quality, such as ICS or ELISPOT assays and assays using whole blood instead of PBMCs.\nMaterials\nFrozen PBMCs\nHR5 medium (see recipe), 4°C\nBenzonase (Sigma, cat. no.

    "NOTE: All solutions and equipment coming into contact with cells must be sterile, and proper sterile technique should be used accordingly, including use of a laminar flow hood (Labconco Purifier BSC Class II or equivalent).\nNOTE: All culture incubations are performed in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\nThawing of PBMCs\n1. Submerge cryovials with frozen PBMCs in a 37°C water bath. Hold the vials in the bath until all but a tiny bit of ice remains in the vials.\nDo not allow the cells to warm completely to 37°C.\nIf using fresh PBMCs, start at step 5 instead.\n2. Transfer the cells into cold conical propylene tubes (e.g., 50 ml) with cold culture medium (10 ml HR5 medium + 20 µl benzonase per vial used) and centrifuge the cells for 7 min at 180 × g, 4°C.\n3. Count the cells and determine cell viability.\n4. Add HR5 medium to adjust the cell concentration to 10 × 106 cells/ml.\nCell stimulation\n5. Prepare MP stimulation solution in HR5 medium at the desired 2× concentration. Adjust the volume depending on the number of samples used per experiment.\nWhen a new MP is used for the first time, it is advisable to perform a titration with cells known to respond to the stimulus. If it is not feasible to do a titration, the default recommended final concentration (for each peptide) is 1 µg/ml for CD4+ and CD8+ MPs, unless indicated differently for each individual MP.\n6. Plate in a 96-well U-bottom cell culture−treated plate, with 100 µl stimulus per well.\n7. Plate 100 µl cells at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/ml (see step 4) to plate 1 × 106 cells per well.",
    "The assay can be performed by plating a range of 0.5–2 × 106 cells per well. If fewer cells are available, consider removing one of the conditions from the assay. If >2 × 106 cells per condition are available, consider carrying out the experiment in duplicate or triplicate.\n8. Optional: If the membrane staining (see step 10) will include staining for the activation marker CD40L, then add anti-CD40 antibody (0.5 µg/ml) to the solution for each donor before incubation.\n9. Incubate plate for a total of 24 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nAntibody surface staining and flow cytometry\n10. To perform membrane staining after 24 hr of stimulation, prepare a cocktail of conjugated antibodies as shown in Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.934#cpz1934-tbl-0003] using cold diluent and concentrations recommended by manufacturers.\nFluorochrome combinations are optimized for the Bio-Rad ZE5 flow cytometer. The fluorochrome combinations should be changed and an additional antibody titration should be performed if using a different instrument.\n11. After stimulation, spin 96-well U-bottom plate for 2 min at 300 × g, 4°C.\n12. Wash plate by aspirating supernatant, adding 200 µl cold PBS per well, and centrifuging 2 min at 300 × g, 4°C.\n13. Aspirate PBS wash and add 100 µl cold antibody mix from step 10 to each well.\n14. Incubate for 30 min at 4°C. Protect from light.\n15. After incubation, add 100 µl cold MACS buffer per well and spin plate for 2 min at 300 × g, 4°C.\n16. Wash plate twice by aspirating supernatant, adding 100 µl cold MACS buffer per well, and spinning plate for 2 min at 300 × g, 4°C.\n17. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 µl cold PBS per 1 × 106 cells plated.",
    "For example, if you plate 0.5 × 106 cells, resuspend in 50 µl; if you plate 2 × 106 cells, resuspend in 200 µl.\n18. Acquire samples in a flow cytometer."
