    "All procedures and device protocols have been approved for human subjects by institutional review boards at both Stony Brook University and New York University Langone Medical Center.\n1. Participant Recruitment and Screening\nRecruit potential participants via referrals from IRB approved study physicians.\nContact participants and perform a pre-screening to confirm basic eligibility before the baseline study visit (see Supplemental File 1).\nAssess cognitive competency via remote administration of a cognitive functioning test, (e.g. the symbol digit modalities test or SDMT)14. Exclude participants who score below three standard deviations of the healthy normative mean in their age group due to concerns regarding their cognitive capacity to comply with the study protocol.\nBriefly assess the potential participant's medical history over the phone. Assess inclusion and exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria can be broad based on a recent consensus safety paper1. Assess the following portion of the inclusion criteria, including that patients must be 18 years or older and have the following: the understanding and ability to give consent, adequate home facilities to store equipment and perform RS-tDCS sessions, clearance for all study procedures by a study physician, and stable internet access at home.\n\t\tNOTE: Allot sufficient time for the baseline visit so that the study physician may clear the potential participant. At least 3 hours are typically needed to complete all baseline procedures, questionnaires, and neuropsychological tests in the current iteration of this study protocol.\nRate each patient's disease related disability (e.g., the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)15 score for MS patients only). Participants with severe disability (e.g. an EDSS score above 6.5) will complete daily tDCS sessions with the aid of a healthcare proxy. The healthcare proxy will complete, on behalf of the participant, the device and headstrap preparation steps that require more advanced ambulation.",
    "In sham-control studies, randomize the participant to either the active or sham condition, as dictated by the blocked stratification table. The table stratifies participants based on the cognitive functioning and disability ratings collected during pre-screening16. Any study using sham should be double-blinded and have an un-blinded study technician, who will not supervise the participant's daily sessions, assign the condition, and prepare study devices for participants and study personnel.\n2. Baseline Study Visit\nAdminister neuropsychological assessments and self-report questionnaires.\nChoose relevant neuropsychological assessments (such as the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS)17, based on the respective patient population. Administer measures and assess the motor and cognitive abilities of participants.\nAdminister self-report questionnaires relevant to symptoms that are specific to the patients' disease. For example, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)18 is a widely used clinical self-assessment questionnaire measuring Parkinson's specific symptoms. Likewise, the Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychology Questionnaire (MSNQ) is designed and validated to measure neuropsychological competence in daily living specifically in patients with multiple sclerosis19,20. Administer universal symptom rating inventories (such as the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)21 and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)22) to allow for comparison between patient populations.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56211/56211fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Left anodal DLPFC montage used in both studies. The red and blue patches are modeled representations of the left anode and right cathode, respectively, placed upon a scalp.

The headstrap holds the sponge electrodes in position throughout the duration of the stimulation session.",
    "Have participants attach the sponges, which are pre-moistened with 5-mL of saline solution, to the cable electrodes.\nInstruct participants to place the headstrap upon their head, taking care to align the nasion marker on the front of the headstrap with the bridge of their nose.\nHave participants pull the back the headstrap towards the posterior end of their heads so the back of the headstrap rests over their inion. The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), left anodal tDCS montage is used23,24,25,26,27.\nConfirm that the participant has achieved optimal or moderate contact quality before continuing.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The device dynamically adjusts its voltage depending on the entire resistive path between the anodal and cathodal electrodes (including skin and skull impedance) to deliver consistent amperage. The device will not unlock to release the stimulation if the contact quality is poor or the impedance is too high.\nIf a participant has a poor or moderate contact quality then suggest methods to improve contact quality, such as adding saline to the sponges, adjusting headstrap placement, or brushing hair away from electrode sites. The participant can monitor their own contact quality by looking at the device's interface screen.\nAssess the participant's aptitude to complete study procedures to determine whether they understand and can replicate the procedures competently at home.\nParticipants complete a tolerability test lasting 90 seconds to determine whether they are able to comfortably tolerate 2.0 mA of direct current. If a participant finds they are unable to handle 2.0 mA, lessen the amperage to 1.5 mA, and further to 1.0 mA if deemed necessary. If a participant finds 1.0 mA intolerable, they must be discontinued from the study.\nConducting the first tDCS session in-clinic.",
    "Ask the participant, after preparing the headstrap and prior to beginning the stimulation session, to report the duration of sleep from the previous night as well as any pain experienced due to the stimulation, disease specific pain, fatigue, and mood before the session with the aid of visual analogue scales.\nConfirm that the contact quality is still optimal or moderate. Provide the device unlock code to begin the participant's stimulation session.\nBegin stimulation and deliver a tolerable amount of stimulation (as detailed above) for an intended twenty minutes. The stimulation's length depends upon the parameters set by the study; for all studies presented herein, the stimulation length was twenty minutes. Should the participant be randomized to the sham condition, the participant receives only one minute of stimulation at the beginning of the session and at the end of the session, during which the amperage ramps up to the target tolerable amount of stimulation during the first thirty seconds and then ramps back down to 0 mA in the final thirty seconds, in order to convince participants that they are receiving stimulation. Aside from the first and last minute, sham participants receive no stimulation for 18 minutes.\nParticipants complete cognitive remediation with guidance from the study technician. The cognitive remediation may be swapped out for a different remediation strategy depending on the intended goals of the study. Similarly, the length of the remediation strategy may be modified.\n\t\tNOTE: Stimulation can be halted at any time by pressing \"zero\" on the device which immediately begins to abort stimulation by ramping down to 0 mA. Study technicians instruct participants to abort the session and end stimulation when any pain is reported above a 7 on a 1-10 visual analogue scale or if any other emergency situation occurs.",
    "After ten minutes, ask the participant whether they are experiencing any pain from the stimulation. Study technicians monitor placement through the videoconferencing software to determine that electrode placement does not shift and remains acceptable during the stimulation session.\nAfter an additional ten minutes, the pre-programmed tDCS device powers down and stimulation ceases. The device makes a loud beeping noise to notify the participant that the stimulation has ended. Should the participant have the sham condition, then the device ramps up once again during the final minute of the twenty-minute session to provide thirty seconds of the target stimulation current and then ramps down to 0 mA during the final thirty seconds of the session.\nAsk the participant once more to report their pain due to the device, disease specific pain, fatigue, and mood following the session, as well as any adverse events that may have been experienced during the course of the session.\nPlan a regular time for the remaining study sessions to ensure daily consistency for standardization purposes. Additionally for PD patients, coordinate session times so that stimulation takes place within 1-3 hours of their last dose of PD medication - a time window that study-approved physicians determined would provide maximum benefit in accordance with previous evidence showing greater improvement among Parkinson's patients in cognitive and motor dimensions (as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, or UPDRS) when tDCS was delivered during participants' \"on\" drug state vs. \"off\" drug state11.\n3. At-home tDCS Sessions\nParticipants complete computer preparation prior to study sessions.\nParticipants connect to the internet in their homes prior to any further study procedures. Participants without stable internet in their homes are excluded from all study procedures.",
    "Connect to a participant's computer with the use of remote desktop software28 and engage in HIPAA-compliant video conferencing with the participant29.\nStudy technicians administer study outcome measures wherein participants report the amount of sleep they received the previous night and rate pain due to the device, disease specific pain, fatigue, and mood before the stimulation session with the aid of visual analogue scales. Ask the participant to report any adverse events that may have occurred following the previous day's session (see supplemental files 2 and 3).\nParticipants remotely activate the stimulation.\nParticipants prepare the headstrap by attaching the pre-moistened sponges to the electrodes on the inside of the frontal headstrap. The sponge electrodes easily snap into the headstrap to minimize preparation.\nParticipants place the headstrap upon their heads as study technicians monitor placement. Participants report the contact quality, which is tested by the device and assesses the sponge placement and sponge saturation measured by the tDCS device. As previously described, moderate and poor contact quality is remedied by suggestions from study personnel such as adding additional saline solution or checking sponge placement.\nVerbally state the stimulation code that unlocks the device to the participant and allow administration of the stimulation for twenty minutes.\nShould a participant have an EDSS score above 6.5, the healthcare proxy completes the above steps in lieu of the participant.\nParticipants complete computerized cognitive remediation during the twenty-minute stimulation period. The remediation includes cognitive training tasks that specifically target working memory systems. A previous publication of ours details the cognitive results concerning our first pilot study8.\nAfter 10 min of stimulation, ask participants to report any pain they may be experiencing.\nParticipants complete post-session procedures.\nParticipants take off the headstrap and dispose of study sponges.",
    "Ask participants to report any pain due to the device, disease specific pain, fatigue, and mood after the session as well any adverse events that they may have experienced during the session. Record any adverse events that occurred along with their intensity and duration.\nPlan the session for the following day.\n4. Post-stimulation Visit\nAdminister neuropsychological assessments and self-report questionnaires.\nSchedule the final study visit as soon as possible after the final stimulation session.\nAdminister study outcome measures that were completed during the baseline visit a second time to assess whether patients experienced benefit as a result of the stimulation17.\nObtain and sanitize all study equipment.\nOffer participants who were assigned the sham condition the option to complete an additional ten active, open-label, RS-tDCS sessions. This open label study period is modeled after our first tDCS pilot study6.\n5. One Month Follow-up Survey\nReach out to participants about a month after their study end to ask if they would remotely complete an online survey asking whether they believe benefits received from the stimulation persisted."
