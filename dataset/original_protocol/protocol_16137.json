Serum and plasma samples should be stored at –80°C. Quantification of protein-bound HCit requires preanalytical dialysis or protein precipitation to remove free and peptide-bound HCit. Though it takes longer, we prefer dialysis because precipitated proteins can be difficult to resuspend resulting in lower yields.\nDialyze serum/plasma samples to remove free and peptide-bound HCit\nDialysis removes free HCit and peptide-bound HCit, yielding samples containing only macromolecules (including proteins), so that only protein-bound HCit will be quantified.\n1a. Transfer 150 µl serum or plasma into a GeBAflex mini dialysis unit with 8-kDa cutoff.\n2a. Using the foam support provided with the kit, place GeBAflex dialysis unit into a bucket containing 10 L of 0.15 M NaCl.",
    "Do not exceed 20 samples per bucket. If there are more samples, use additional buckets.\n3a. Dialyze for 24 hr at 4°C with constant stirring or agitation, and replace dialysate twice during dialysis.\n4a. Remove dialyzed serum from the dialysis unit, and transfer to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nDialyzed samples may be stored at –80°C before acid hydrolysis.\nPrecipitate proteins from samples to remove free and peptide-bound HCit\n1b.

Then gently pull with pliers.\nPrepare calibrators",
    "Calibrators are prepared by spiking a diluted serum (or plasma) sample (matrix blank [MB]) with different amounts of HCit standard. The use of samples made of a similar matrix to patient samples is compulsory to ensure the HCit standard behaves the same as the sample during separation by LC. The HCit concentration contained in the MB will be subtracted from values of the calibration points.\n5. Prepare MB solution by diluting 30 µl serum (or plasma) with 2.97 ml of 0.15 M NaCl.\nThis serum (or plasma) sample should be randomly selected from available serum (or plasma) samples deriving from control participants. Serum (or plasma) from patients with renal failure should be avoided.\n6. Prepare 200 µM HCit (high-level calibrator) by mixing 5 µl serum (or plasma) used to prepare MB, 18.9 µl of 5.29 mM HCit (1 g/L), and 476.1 µl of 0.15 M NaCl.\n7. Prepare a two-fold dilution series of the calibrator in MB solution to obtain six HCit concentrations: 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 µM. To do this, mix 100 µl of 200 µM calibrator with 100 µl MB solution to make 100 µM calibrator, and then combine 100 µl of 100 µM calibrator with 100 µl MB solution to make 50 µM calibrator. Repeat until a 6.25 μM solution is prepared.\n8. Store calibrators and MB solution at –80°C until ready for acid hydrolysis.\nPerform acid hydrolysis and evaporate hydrolysates\n9. Add 30 µl serum/plasma sample (or calibrator) to 6 µl of 200 µM d3-HCit (internal standard [IS]) and 564 µl Milli-Q water into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.",
    "If concentrations of HCit are expected to be very high, use 15 µl serum/plasma instead of 30 µl, and make up the volume by adding 15 µl of 0.15 M NaCl. The results will be multiplied by two during calculation steps.\n10. Transfer 0.6 ml solutions into 2-ml glass ampoules, and add 0.6 ml of 12 M HCl to each ampoule.\n11. Seal glass ampoules with a Bunsen burner (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-fig-0001]).\nCAUTION: Be careful not to burn yourself when sealing the glass ampoules (which remain very hot a few minutes after sealing). Hold the bottom of the ampoule. Do not wear latex or nitrile gloves while using the Bunsen burner, as it will increase the risk of harm.\n12. Incubate ampoules for 18 hr in a 110°C oven.\nCAUTION: Comply with the operating instructions of the oven, and be careful not to burn yourself.\n13. Cool ampoules on the bench for 30 min. Then break glass ampoules, and transfer 1 ml of each hydrolysate to new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n14. Transfer tubes to an evaporator connected to a nitrogen gas inlet and located under a chemical hood.\n15. Evaporate samples until dry (∼8 hr). Add 1 ml Milli-Q water to each sample, and evaporate overnight to ensure complete removal of HCl.\nAfter evaporation, the tube walls will look brown.\nThe dried samples may be stored at –80°C before the next steps.\n16. Add 100 µl of 125 mM ammonium formate to each dried hydrolysate.\n17. Shake tubes for 10 s on a vortex mixer. Transfer tubes to an orbital shaker, and agitate for 10 min at 1400 rpm.\n18.

    "19. Gently collect 50 µl supernatant, and filter through a 0.45-µm PTFE syringe filter into a 0.2-ml microcentrifuge tube. Repeat with the remaining 50 µl supernatant.\nFiltration should be performed in two steps (two filtrations of 50 µl). Transfer 50 µl into the filter, and then attach a 1-ml syringe to the filter. Push the plunger to force the liquid through the filter. Use a new filter for each sample, and wash the syringe with distilled water between each sample (taking care to dry the syringe with a paper towel to avoid any dilution of the sample).\n20. Dilute filtered hydrolysate 10-fold with 125 mM ammonium formate (10 µl hydrolysate + 90 µl of 125 mM ammonium formate), and transfer to an appropriate chromatography vial.\nThe diluted hydrolysates may be stored at –80°C until ready for LC-MS/MS analysis.",
    "Quantification of HCit may be performed in all types of tissues (fresh or frozen), including bones. In the case of frozen tissues, the samples should be cut into small pieces (100 to 150 mg each) and stored at –80°C until analysis. Using this protocol, only total HCit can be quantified.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-prot-0001])\nFresh or frozen tissue samples\n0.5 M acetic acid (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich)\n200 IU pepsin, specific activity >3000 IU/mg (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich)\nLysing Matrix tubes, A and D (e.g., MP Biomedicals)\nFastPrep-24 (e.g., MP Biomedicals)\n37°C incubator\nHomogenize tissue samples\n1. Place 100 to 150 mg fresh or frozen tissue samples into Lysing Matrix tubes, and add 1 ml of 0.5 M acetic acid to each sample.\nThe choice of Lysing Matrix tube depends on the stiffness of the tissue. For example, use Lysing Matrix D for skin, vessels, kidney, or liver. Use Lysing Matrix A for bone. For more details, refer to MP Biomedicals website (https://www.mpbio.com[href=https://www.mpbio.com]).\n2. Transfer tubes into the FastPrep-24 system.\n3. Perform four cycles of 40 s at 6 m/s. Between each cycle, place tubes on ice for 5 min.\n4. Centrifuge Lysing Matrix tubes 5 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C.\n5. Gently collect supernatant (about 800 µl). Add 200 IU pepsin, and incubate for 24 hr at 37°C.\nPredigestion of proteins with pepsin improves the efficiency of acid hydrolysis.\n6. Centrifuge tubes 5 min at 10,000 × g, 4°C.\n7. Collect supernatant (about 800 µl), and dilute two-fold with Milli-Q water (i.e., add 800 µl).\nStore the diluted homogenate at –80°C until ready for acid hydrolysis.\nPrepare calibrators\n8.

Cool ampoules on the bench for 30 min.\nAfter hydrolysis of the tissue samples, some black sediment may appear in the ampoule. These sediments correspond to tissue fragments that have not been hydrolyzed because there is too much material in the ampoule. If there is excessive sediment, the experiment must be repeated using a higher dilution of sample prior to hydrolysis in order to place less material in the ampoule.\n13. Break glass ampoules, and transfer 1 ml of each hydrolysate to new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n14. Transfer microcentrifuge tubes to an evaporator connected to a nitrogen gas inlet and located under a chemical hood.\n15. Evaporate samples until dry (∼8 hr).

However, it is possible to use a new syringe for each sample.\n20a. Dilute filtered sample hydrolysates with 125 mM ammonium formate containing 1 µM d3-HCit, and transfer to an appropriate chromatography vial.\nPreliminary tests should be performed to determine the best dilution factor, which depends on the HCit content in the tissue and on the sensitivity of the mass spectrometer. Usual dilution rates range from 1:5 to 1:20 (v/v).\n20b. Dilute filtered calibrator hydrolysates 10-fold with 125 mM ammonium formate containing 1 µM d3-HCit.\nAfter the 10-fold dilution of calibrator hydrolysates, the final HCit concentrations of calibrators will be: 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312, and 0.156 µM.\nDiluted hydrolysates may be stored at –80°C until LC-MS/MS analysis.",

    "In order to evaluate the rate of protein carbamylation, it is important to normalize results toward the protein content in the serum sample or in the tissue extract. Thus, it is possible to perform usual protein quantification assays and to report HCit results expressed as mmol/g protein. However, most studies dealing with protein carbamylation express HCit results as a ratio to Lys content. Accordingly, here we describe an LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of Lys in hydrolysates.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-prot-0003])\nFiltered hydrolysates (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-prot-0001], step 19)\nd8-L-Lys (CDN isotopes)\nD,L-Lys (Sigma Aldrich)\nDilute hydrolysates\nFor serum and tissue samples, use the filtered hydrolysates obtained after evaporation (i.e., hydrolysates before dilution from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-prot-0001], step 19).\n1.

Details about the buffer gradient, flow rate, and injection volume are shown in Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-tbl-0004].\nTable 4.\n                Liquid Chromatography Parameters for the Separation of Lys Using the Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC Column\ntable:\n﻿Parameter,Specification\nFlow rate,0.2 ml/min\nMobile phase A,\"5 mM ammonium formate, pH 2.9\"\nMobile phase B,100% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid\nAutosampler temperature,8°C\nInjection volume,1 µl\n%B for column equilibrationa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-tbl4-note-0002_44],80%\nGradient,\"0 → 1.0 min, 80% B, flow rate 0.2 ml/min\"\n,\"1.0 → 1.125 min, linear gradient to 30% B, flow rate 0.4 ml/min\"\n,\"1.125 → 2.25 min, linear gradient to 5% B, flow rate 0.4 ml/min\"\n,\"2.25 → 2.75 min, 5% B, flow rate 0.4 ml/min\"\n,\"2.75 → 3.25 min, linear gradient to 80% B, flow rate 0.2 ml/min\"\n,\"3.25 → 4.0 min, 80% B, flow rate 0.2 ml/min\"\nOven temperature,30°C\nHILIC, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography; Lys, lysine; MS, mass spectrometry; UPLC, ultra-performance liquid chromatography.\na Equilibration time with 80% B, 30 min.\nIon source and mass detection parameters are detailed in Tables 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-tbl-0005] and 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.762#cpz1762-tbl-0006], respectively. The MRM transition 147.1 → 84.1 is used as the quantification transition, whereas 147.1 → 130.1 is used to confirm peak specificity. MRM transition 155.2 → 92.2 is used for IS (i.e., d8-Lys) quantification. As with HCit quantification, these parameters have been optimized for this mass spectrometry system and should be redefined if another mass spectrometer is used. For that purpose, directly infuse the standard solution of each analyte (Lys and IS) into the mass spectrometer source using a syringe pump.\nTable 5.\n                Ion Source and Gas Parameters for the Detection of Lys Using the TSQ Quantis MS/MS System\ntable:\n﻿Ionization type,Electrospray (H-ESI)\nMode,Positive\nSource position,M/1/central\nSpray voltage,Static",

Insert a blank sample after the calibrator with the highest concentration and after samples with very high Lys concentration to avoid any cross-over contamination.\nQuantification of peak area is performed using Tracefinder 4.1 software. Ratios of Lys quantification peak area to IS peak area are used to calculate the calibration curve and to determine Lys concentrations in the samples. When establishing the calibration curve, the Lys-to-IS ratio of the matrix blank sample has to be subtracted from the ratios of all the calibrators before calculation.",
    "To ensure specificity of quantification, the ratio of areas of Lys quantification peak (147.1 → 84.1) to Lys confirmation peak (147.1 → 130.1) must be between 2.1 and 2.3. Each sample should be injected twice, and mean peak areas should be used for calculations. For the calculation of Lys concentrations used for the expression of HCit results, be sure to use the correct dilution factor. For serum (or plasma) samples, the dilution factor is 1:1200 (v/v): 1:40 dilution through acid hydrolysis, 10-fold concentration after evaporation (from 1 ml to 100 µl), and 1:300 dilution before LC-M/MS. For tissue samples, it is easier to use HCit results corresponding to HCit concentrations in the undiluted hydrolysates. In this case, dilution factors for Lys concentrations range from 100 to 1000."
