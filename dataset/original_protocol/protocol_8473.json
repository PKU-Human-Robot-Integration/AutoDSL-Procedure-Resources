  "procedures": [
    "All procedures on animals were approved by the IRCCS Neuromed Animal Care Review Board and by \"Istituto Superiore di Sanità\" (permit number: 1163/2015- PR) and were in accordance with the guidelines of the EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments.\n1. Preparation of FITC-albumin Solution to be Injected into Jugular Vein\nNOTE: All experiments were carried out in manifest (11-week old) HD R6/2 mice and in age and gender-matched wild-type (WT) control littermates.\nDissolve FITC-albumin powder (see Table of Materials) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 10 mg/ml.\n\tNOTE: For optimal results, this should be prepared fresh for each labelling reaction.\n2. Preparation of Equipment to Be Used During Surgery\nLay out the previously autoclaved surgical instruments (see Table of Materials).\nClean the surgical bench with alcohol (70% ethanol solution). Prepare the surgical area (45 cm x 45 cm) with a surgical sterile disposable towel drape and set up the operating stereomicroscope.\n3. Surgical Procedure for FITC-albumin Infusion into the Jugular Vein\nRecord mouse body weight for anesthesia.\nAnesthetize mouse with an intraperitoneal injection (i.p) of an appropriate dose of Ketamine (100 mg/kg) - xylazine (10 mg/kg) solution.\nMonitor animal sedation by gentle toe pinch withdraw reflex as demonstrated in Walantus et al.11,12.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse in a face-up supine position and fix the four legs and the tail on the surgical workbench with adhesive tape.\nAfter the mouse is secured, carefully shave the appropriate surgical margin on the neck with an electric razor (see Table of Materials) and disinfect it with povidone-iodine solution and 70% ethanol.\nDry the exposed shaved surface with cotton swabs.\nGently pull up the shaved skin and make a 1.5 cm long longitudinal incision, by scalpel, in the midclavicular line starting midway on the thorax and extending to just below the neck.",
    "Carefully stretch apart connective tissue with forceps under microscopic observation (5X magnification) to expose the external jugular vein.\nEnsure a sufficient space on the right and on the left of the jugular vein to facilitate the insertion of the 30½ G needle for the infusion of the FITC-albumin solution.\nInject the animal intravenously (right jugular vein) slowly (over 3 min) with 100 µL of 10 mL/kg FITC-albumin by using the 30½ G needle.\nAfter 15 minutes, euthanize the mouse by decapitation, rapidly remove the brain from the skull as previously described13, and immerse it for 15 min in at least 10x the volume of the brain itself of pre-chilled isopentane.\nMove the isopentane frozen brain into a pre-chilled tube and store it into a -80 °C freezer until histological sectioning.\n4. Histological Sectioning of Brain Infused with FITC-albumin\nEmbed frozen brain in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (see Table of Materials) prior to cryostat sectioning.\nSerially cut the brain into 20 µm thick sections, with a cryostat (see Table of Materials), and mount them onto microscope glass slides.\nPerform the FITC-Albumin/laminin co-staining by using a specific anti-laminin antibody (see Table of Materials) as previously described6.\nBriefly, incubate sections with the primary antibody anti-laminin (pAb 1:1000) over night and proceed with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3.\nCoverslip slides with mounting medium containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (absorption peak = 360 nm; emission peak = 460 nm (see Table of Materials).\nLeave the slide to dry overnight at 4 °C in the dark.\nObserve the fluorescence staining under a fluorescence microscope (see Table of Materials) at 20X magnification equipped with both FITC (absorption peak = 495 nm; emission peak = 525 nm) and Cy3 filters (absorption peak = 550 nm; emission peak = 570 nm).",
    "To view the samples immediately after the staining, secure the coverslip at the corners using nail polish and examine them under the microscope as above (4.3.3).\n5. Setting Up the Fluorescence Microscope and Acquisition of Colour Images\nSet up the fluorescence microscope as follows.\nTurn on the fluorescence lamp about 10 minutes before use. Turn on the microscope, the connected computer, and the digital camera. Run the image analysis software (see Table of Materials).\nUse the appropriate objective for optimal signal collection and spatial resolution, and select appropriate filters.\nAcquisition of Colour Images\nSelect the [live] command on the image analysis software (see Table of Materials) and set up the optimal illumination parameters for each filter.\nSelect the [freeze] command to take the single channel colour image and add the scale bar ('Edit>Burn Scale')\nSave each image in the '.tiff' format.\nMerge channels into a single image by selecting 'File>Merge channel' and save it in the\ntiff' format.\nAcquire a minimum of four twenty-four bit color pictures (2200 µm x 3400 µm) per brain slice (6 sections per slide).\n6. Assessment of FITC-albumin Extravasation\nAnalyze the fluorescence intensity for each single channel by using the freely available ImageJ14,15.\nNormalize the total fluorescent signal intensity of the FITC-albumin by the total CY3-Laminin fluorescent intensity per each image and report the extravasated albumin outside the vessels as Green Fluorescence Intensity.\nSubscription Required.
