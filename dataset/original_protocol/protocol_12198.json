    "Animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of Newcastle and confirmed to the New South Wales Animal Research Act, New South Wales Animal Research Regulation, and the Australian code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes. All the procedures undertaken on mice were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of Newcastle.\n1. Time Mating\nPair 6 - 8 weeks old male and female mice just prior to the end of daylight cycle.\nCheck the females for the presence of vaginal plugs early morning (on or before 8.00 AM), every day. Day of plug is considered as 0.5 dpc.\nTransfer the female with vaginal plug into a new cage (without male) and label the date of plug.\n2. Isolation of Mouse Embryonic Gonadal Ridges\nIsolate mouse embryonic gonadal ridges from 15.5 dpc pregnant females as described in 9, with a few modifications as described below.\nCarry out dissection before noon as the time pregnant females are considered to enter into the next day of pregnancy by afternoon.\nSacrifice 15.5 dpc pregnant females using cervical dislocation (or as per the approved protocol by the institutional Animal Ethics Committee).\nKeep the mouse on its back on absorbent tissue paper and spray the ventral side of the abdomen with 70% ethanol.\nLift the lower abdominal skin (ventral side) with forceps and make a lateral incision using surgical scissors, extending from urogenital opening to the end to rib cage. Pull the skin towards the head of the animal to expose the abdomen.",
    "Cut the abdominal muscles with surgical scissors to expose peritoneal cavity. Grab the gravid uterus with forceps just above the cervix and make a cut. Now lift the uterus by holding on to the urinary bladder and cut the uterine broad ligament followed by cuts at the uterotubal junctions to detach uterus from the peritoneal attachment.\nTransfer the uterus into a 50 mL tube containing ice-cold HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution). Wash the gravid uterus gently with ice-cold HBSS to remove the excess blood.\nKeep the uterus in a Petri dish containing ice-cold HBSS and keep on ice. Cut the uterine wall and take out the embryos. Keep the embryos in a fresh Petri dish with HBSS on ice.\nTake a clean sterile tissue paper and put it on a new Petri dish. Spray 70% ethanol on the tissue paper. Keep embryo on this tissue paper on the lateral side and cut it from lower abdomen using a sterile blade in the direction as shown by dotted line in Figure 1.\nFix the embryo on a sterile sponge base by pinning the vertebral column.\nPlace it under the dissecting stereomicroscope and carefully cut along the ventral midline. Remove the liver and intestines. The mouse urogenital system (kidney, ureter, testis, WD, and vas deferens) should now be visible.\nCut out the testis and WD, and keep in a fresh Petri dish with HBSS, on ice. To take out the WD and testis, cut the vas deferens close to its attachment to urethra and cut the attachment of lower portion of WD from gubernaculum.\nPool the testes and WDs from the embryos of the same group (this may vary as per the experimental plan).\n3. Culture of Embryonic Gonadal Ridges (Figure 2)",
    "Prepare medium for culturing the embryonic gonadal ridges by supplementing DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine. Warm the media to 37 °C in a water bath.\nAdd 300 µL of media per well of a 24-well cell culture plate.\nTake a fresh Petri plate and put a small drop of sterile HBSS on it. Put a polycarbonate track etch membrane (0.8 µm) on this drop of HBSS with its shining surface facing the HBSS.\nUsing clean forceps put two WDs and gonads on the membrane (on its rough surface, facing upward) and remove the maximum amount of HBSS using sterile wipes/absorbent paper. Do not touch the tissue with absorbent paper; otherwise, it will damage the tissue.\nEnsure that neither the WDs nor the gonads are touching each other. Otherwise, they will stick together during subsequent incubation.\nTransfer the membrane with the tissues in the well of a 24-well plate containing 300 µL culture medium and culture them at air-medium interface. Too much culture medium on membranes results in a cystic growth of WDs.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C incubator, in the presence of 5% CO2.\nChange the culture medium every day. To change the medium with the pipette, remove the medium from the well first and then add 300 µL of the prewarmed fresh medium.\n\tNote: For studying the effect of different signaling pathways on WD morphogenesis, chemical activators and/or inhibitors at the required concentrations can be added to the culture medium.\nCulture the tissues for 3 d. Within 3 d, uncoiled WDs collected from a 15.5 dpc embryo transform into highly convoluted tubes (Figure 3B). The addition of the Wnt inhibitor, IWR1, results in inhibition of WD coiling (Figure 3C).",
    "For harvesting these tissues take a Petri dish with ice-cold PBS. Transfer the membrane with cultured gonad and WD into the Petri plate. The membrane will float on the PBS. Press the membrane to sink it in PBS and take out the gonad and WD.\nFix the tissues with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) O/N at 4 °C or for 1 h at RT. If needed, take bright field images of the WDs before fixation.\n4. Whole Mount Immunofluorescence\nWash the fixed tissues 3x with PBS-T (PBS + 1% Triton X-100) with slow rocking, 10 min each, at RT.\nDehydrate the tissues in a graded series of ethanol (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%), 10 min each, at 4 °C, with slow rocking (~30 rpm). At this step, the tissues can be stored at 4 °C in 75% ethanol.\n\t\nTo change the ethanol, keep the tissues undisturbed for 2 min and let the tissues settle down. Take out as much supernatant as possible and then add the next higher concentration of ethanol. To avoid any damage to the tissues, the pipette tip should not touch the tissues at any stage.\nFollowing dehydration, rehydrate the tissues in a graded series of ethanol (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%), 10 min each, at 4 °C, with slow rocking.\nWash the tissues with PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100), 4x, 20 min each, at RT, with gentle rocking (~30 rpm).\nBlock the tissues for 1 h at RT with blocking buffer (PBS + 1% BSA + 0.2% non-fat dry milk powder + 0.3% Triton X-100).\nAfter blocking, transfer the tissues to primary antibody solution (diluted in blocking buffer) and incubate O/N at 4 °C with gentle rocking (~30 rpm). Dilutions of the primary antibodies used are described in the Materials Table.",
    "The next day, wash tissues with PBS-MT (PBS + 2% non-fat dry milk powder + 0.5% Tween-20), 4x, 30 min each, at RT, with gentle rocking (~30 rpm).\nFollowing this washing step, add secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:250 (this step needs optimization for individual antibodies) in blocking buffer and incubate for 1 h at RT, with gentle rocking.\nFrom now onwards keep the tissues covered with aluminum foil to prevent exposure to light as secondary antibodies are labeled with light sensitive fluorophores.\nWash the tissues 3x with PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20), 30 min each, with gentle rocking.\nPrepare slides for mounting the stained tissues.\n\t\nFor this, cut the glass cover slips into thin strips using a diamond pen and stick two strips one over the other on the glass slide using nail enamel. Make two boundaries and place tissues in between these two boundaries.\nAdd DAPI containing mounting medium and put on a cover slip. Apply nail enamel at the corners of the cover slip to fix it to the slide.\n\t\tNote: Tissues are now ready for imaging. Store these slides at -20 °C.\nSubscription Required.
