    "Plasmid constructionConstruction of pGeneXThis plasmid encodes DNA homologous to the upstream and downstream sequences of the target genetic locus. These DNA will recombine with the desired locus thus generating the desired recombinant phages (Figure 1).Perform a PCR amplification reaction with pUC19 plasmid as a template, using primers with 60 bp 5’ overhangs homologous to sequences flanking the target gene to be deleted (hereafter, geneX). The forward primer should carry a 60 bp overhang sequence identical to the 60 bp downstream to geneX. The reverse primer should carry a 60 bp overhang matching the upstream sequence. See design in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170730/20170730223722_0762.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170730/20170730223745_3957.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170730/20170730224015_3431.jpgFigure 1.

Schematics of the pAnti-GeneX construct. A. An example of a primer design yielding a spacer to target gene X. The targeted DNA is in pink. This protospacer is a 33 bp sequence in the gene of interest and is preceded by an AA, yielding a functional protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The forward and reverse primers encode annealing sequences to the pWUR477 template, and 5’ overhangs which together form the desired spacer sequence. B.

Gently tilt and rotate plate to spread top agar evenly.Allow the plates to cool for 5 min, invert, and incubate overnight at RT or for 4-6 h at 37 °C (until plaques are visible).Isolation and validationInoculate one colony of targeting bacteria (BL21-AI/pWUR397, pWUR400, pAnti-GeneX) into 3 ml LB supplemented with 50 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 µg/ml kanamycin and 35 µg/ml chloramphenicol. Shake at 37 °C overnight.Dilute plaques larger than 0.4 cm into 100 µl LB.Note: Small plaques are expected even on the control plates. Desired plaques (i.e., ones that have the desired deletion mutation) should appear 3-5 times larger than the background plaques.Perform a PCR amplification reaction on the diluted plaque for validation: Use primers upstream and downstream to geneX. Determine gene deletion according to PCR product size. Use wild-type T7 as a template for positive control. See Figure 3.Note: Deletion of a fragment encoding the corresponding protospacer can result in isolated phages that do not encode the desired deletion (by escaping the CRISPR-Cas targeting).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170730/20170730225455_4929.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170730/20170730225513_9409.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170730/20170730225542_4429.jpgFigure 3.
