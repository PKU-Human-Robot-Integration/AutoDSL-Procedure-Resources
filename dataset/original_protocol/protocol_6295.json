    "Preparation of a spleen single cell suspensionEuthanize a naive mouse by CO2 inhalation. Disinfect the skin of the mouse with 70% ethanol (Recipe 1). Extract whole spleen and place in a six-well plate with 3 ml PBS in one well. The rest of the procedures should be conducted in a sterile biosafety cabinet. Smash spleen thoroughly between frosted glass slides by placing the spleen on the rough side of the frosted part of the slide (wetted with PBS) and carefully grind it between the two slides until spleen is dissociated. Pipette up the PBS buffer containing splenocytes with a 5 ml pipette into a 15 ml tube. Filter through a 40 μm cell strainer over a 50 ml conical tube.Spin at 335 x g at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 ml of ACK lysis buffer at RT for 5 min. Add 8 ml of PBS to cell suspension.Spin at 335 x g at RT for 5 min.Discard the supernatant and resuspend in 10 ml of PBS. Count 1:10 dilution of cells. Place splenocytes on ice until ready for CD49b+ cell enrichment.Magnetic labelingSpin at 335 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend in 90 μl of “MACS buffer” per 107 total cells (approximately 108 total cells are expected from one spleen from an adult mouse). Add 10 μl of CD49b (DX5) microbeads per 107 total cells.Mix well by pipetting up and down several times and incubate for 30 min on ice.Add 1 ml of MACS buffer per 107 total cells.Spin at 335 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend up to 108 cells in 500 μl of “MACS buffer”.",
    "Place cells on ice until the autoMACS Separator is ready for use. Magnetic separation can be performed with MACS columns for positive selection (MS) or with other separators (e.g., MiniMACS, OctoMACS, VarioMACS, SuperMACS) if the autoMACS Separator is not available. Magnetic separation with the autoMACS SeparatorPrepare and prime autoMACS Separator. This procedure can be done while cells are being magnetically labeled (Step B4). Place tube containing the magnetically labeled cells in the autoMACS Separator choosing the positive selection program (“Possel”). Collect the purified CD49b+ cell fraction in outlet port “pos1”. Spin the enriched CD49b+ cell fraction at 335 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Discard the supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml DMEM. Count cells (approximately 106 cells are expected from one spleen). Place cells on ice until assessment of basophil purity by staining and flow cytometry analysis. Approximately 20-30% of the CD49b+ cells enriched from one mouse spleen are expected to be basophils of > 90% viability. Staining for flow cytometryDilute cells to 1 x 106 cells/ml for staining. Two samples are needed: one sample will be unstained and the second sample will be incubated with the antibody and DAPI mix (generating the stained sample). Spin both samples at 335 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Discard the supernatant and block both samples with 10 l of diluted FcBlock (1:200 in PBS).Incubate both samples on ice for 15 min. Stain one sample with 20 μl of antibody and DAPI mix: PE FcεRIα (1:200), APC/Cy7 c-Kit (1:100), APC CD49b and DAPI (1:100). Add the equivalent volume of PBS to the unstained sample tube. Place samples on ice in a dark place to stain for 20-30 min. Add 500 μl of PBS to the samples, vortex gently and spin at 335 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.",
    "Discard the supernatants and resuspend in 300 μl PBS. Filter cells into a new FACS tube trough the cell strainer to remove clumps and place samples on ice until flow cytometry analysis.Flow cytometryOn the BD FACS DIVA software, select for a “New Experiment” to set up.Select for Area, Height, Width for FSC and SSC; select Log and Area for the colors PE, APC, APC/Cy7 and Indo I-Violet.Create compensation controls and adjust the gating for unstained cells (adjust FSC and SSC voltages as necessary).Adjust each color of single stains to center each fluorescence histogram on 102 + 1 tick mark.For single stains for compensation, use the UltraComp eBeads following manufacturer’s instructions. Use cells stained with DAPI to generate a single color for compensation. Check that P2 (i.e., fluorescence positive) gates look appropriate for each single-stained tube and make any necessary adjustments to P2 gates before calculating compensation for an experiment. Calculate compensation controls and record events. Set up to collect 50,000 events.Adoptive transfer of spleen basophils into the peritoneal cavitySpin the enriched basophils at 335 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Discard the supernatants and resuspend 3 x 105 spleen basophils defined as FcεRIα+, CD49b+ and c-Kit- cells in 200 μl DMEM.Inject the recipient mice with 200 μl intraperitoneally using a 22 G needle and a 1 ml syringe."
