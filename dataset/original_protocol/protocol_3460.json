This will make the screen easier and more reliable than transient transfection of the antigen. If the degrader needs to be specific of a conformation or an isoform, then several stable cell lines can be done. Before starting the antibiotic selection of the cell line, an antibiotic kill curve needs to be performed to determine the concentration of antibiotic to use that kill all the cells (see Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section).\nPlate 40,000 cells per well of a 24-well plate (in 0.5 mL of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS) to get the cells at 80% confluence the next day.\n24 h later, transfect the cells with the JetPRIME reagent and the plasmid(s) of your choice (i.e., nuclear red fluorescent antigen entry vector). Add 0.75 μg of DNA to 50 μL of JetPRIME buffer, vortex 10 s and centrifuge 3 s at 2,000 × g. Add 1.5 μL of JetPRIME reagent, vortex 10 s and centrifuge 3 s at 2,000 × g. Incubate at 22°C for 10 min and then add the mix drop by drop on the cells.\n4 h later, change the medium with 0.5 mL of fresh medium.\nNote: Any cell lines of interest that can be easily transfected (for the cell-based screen) could be used to make stable clones such as HEK293T or HeLa cells. Any suitable transfection reagent can also be used.\nSelection of H2882 stable clones\nTiming: 3–4 weeks",
    "Once the cells are transfected, the antibiotic selection process can start. Generally, after 3 to 4 weeks of antibiotic selection (depending of the antibiotic used), clones should appear and be picked.\n72 h after the transfection, detached the cells.\nAspirate the medium, wash with 0.5 mL of PBS and add 0.3 mL of trypsin.\nLeave the cells at 37°C for 3–5 min, until they are detached. Add 0.7 mL of complete medium and resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down carefully (1 mL of resuspended cells).\nPlate 1/50 (i.e., 20 μL of the 1 mL of resuspended cells), 1/150 (6.7 μL of the 1 mL) and the rest of the cells (973.3 μL) in 10 mL of medium containing your antibiotic at the concentration determined with the killing curve in 100 mm plates.\nEvery three / four days, change the medium of the plates with fresh antibiotic.\nAfter 3 to 4 weeks (at least with Zeocin), clones (i.e., colonies of cells) should appear on the plate. When clones are 3–6 mm large, use sterile 8 mm cloning cylinders to pick the colonies.\nAspirate the medium, wash the 100 mm plate with 5 mL of warm PBS.\nPut the cloning cylinder around the colony of cells and press gently on the top of the cylinder to create a seal between the cylinder and the plate.\nAdd 50 μL of trypsin and wait under the tissue culture hood for 3 to 5 min, until the cells detached. You can pipet carefully up and down to force the cells to detach.\nPrepare a 96-well plate with 200 μL of complete medium with antibiotic.\nOnce detached, pipet the 50 μL of trypsinized cells and add it into one well of the 96-well plate. One clone per well.",
    "Amplify the clones by increasing the surface of culture every time they are confluent: from 96-well to 48-well to 12-well, until a dozens of aliquots (2 × 106 cells per vial) can be frozen as stock and stored in liquid nitrogen.\nCharacterization of H2882 stable clones\nTiming: 1 week\nClonal stable cell lines have to be checked for the proper expression and localization of the antigen in cells by immunofluorescence and western blot.\nCheck the expression of the antigen by western blot (using either anti-RHOB, 1/500, and/or anti-mCherry, 1/500, antibodies incubated 18 h) (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/347-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Analysis of the expression of the antigen (RHOB) by western blot\nWild-type (WT) and stable H2882 clones transfected with the H2B-mCherry-RHOBQ63L expression vector and selected with antibiotics were lysed and analyzed by western blot to check the expression of the antigen (RHOB) and the fluorescent reporter (mCherry) using anti-RHOB and anti-mCherry antibodies. α-Tubulin is the loading control (incubated 1 h at 1/10,000 dilution).\nCheck the correct localization of the fluorescent antigen (here nuclear mCherry-RHOB) by immunofluorescence (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/347-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Localization of the antigen in cells by immunofluorescence\nH2882 cells stably expressing the histone H2B-mCherry, H2B-mCherry-RHOBQ63L, or H2B-mCherry-RHOBT19N were stained with an anti-RHOB primary antibody and an Alexa-488 secondary antibody (green channel). DAPI is used to stain the DNA (blue channel) and mCherry is directly visualized on the red channel. Scale bars, 10 μm.\nPlate cells on a coverslip, the day after, fix the cells with 3.7% PFA, permeabilize the cells, block them and incubate the appropriate primary (mouse anti-RHOB: 1/50, 3 h incubation at 22°C) and secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, 1/400, 1 h incubation at 22°C) and mount the coverslip on a slide with mounting medium containing DAPI (Mowiol, see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).",
    "Critical: The clone used for the cell-based screen should ideally express a medium level of fluorescent antigen: enough to detect it easily by microscopy but not too high to be still able to observe a degradation by microscopy (here H2B-mCherry-RHOB, see clones 2–4 and 6 on Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] as good examples).\nCreation of a sub-library of intracellular antibody-based degraders\nTiming: 3 days\nThe phage display technology selects antibodies specific for an antigen. The protocol for selection and enrichment of conformational antibodies targeting GTP-bound RHO by phage display has been previously described elsewhere (Chinestra et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Usually three to four rounds of panning are sufficient to get specific antibodies according to the stringency of the competitive or washing steps (Haque and Tonks, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Then, antibody fragments are usually tested first as recombinant antibody fragments by various in vitro methods such as ELISA, western blot, or immunofluorescence. Then, some hits are further sub-cloned into a mammalian expression vector to be express as an intracellular antibody but only few antibodies performed best both in in vitro assays and as intrabodies. To directly identify the best intracellular antibody-based degraders, namely that express well in the reducing intracellular environment and remain functional (i.e., that deplete specifically their target antigen), we set up a cell-based screen after the last round of phage display by sub-cloning the library of antibodies obtained after this last round of phage display panning in an antibody-based degrader entry vector (described in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section and in Bery et al., 2019a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Importantly, this protocol is not limited to phage display and could be applied to other similar panning enrichment methods involving large libraries of protein binders (e.g., single domain antibodies, DARPins, monobodies, …).",
    "From the last round of phage display, directly grow TG1 E. coli containing the modified pHEN2 vector from NaLi-H1 library (Moutel et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) in 100 mL of LB with ampicillin and 0.5% glucose for 5 h at 37°C (until Optical Density (OD) ≈ 0.1–0.2).\nCritical: It is important to not grow 16–18 h, and be careful that OD not exceed 0.2 to avoid overgrowth of some antibody clones and loss of diversity.\nMake a high purity medium scale preparation of plasmid DNA from the culture using any midiprep kit (i.e., Machery Nagel or Qiagen).\nDigest 2–3 μg of DNA by NcoI and NotI enzymes 2 h at 37°C. This will digest the coding sequence of the antibodies from the modified pHEN2 vector.\nRun a 1% agarose gel to separate the digested DNA fragments\nPurify the NcoI/NotI digested DNA (band around 400 bp) with a gel extract DNA purification kit (i.e., Machery Nagel or Qiagen).\nDigest the entry vector pFBOX-X-IRES-MITO-GFP by NcoI and NotI (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nLigate the polyclonal pool of DNA fragments coding for the antibodies selected after the last round of phage display into the pFBOX-X-IRES-MITO-GFP vector using the T4 DNA ligase.\nTransform competent DH5α bacteria or any cloning stain with the ligation mix and plate on several agar plates with 100 μg mL−1 ampicillin.",
    "Pause Point: A 50% glycerol stock of each bacterial colony can be done by growing for 18 h the cells in a 96-well plate (one colony per well of a deep-well 96-well plate) containing 500 μL of LB complemented with 100 μg mL−1 of ampicillin. The next day, add 500 μL of 100% glycerol in each well, mix each well to homogenize and store the plate at −80°C. Several plates can be done and be used as starting point for the miniprep step described in the next step.\nCell-based screening of intracellular antibody-based degraders\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThe polyclonal pool of single domain antibodies (sdAb) selected after the last round of phage display is now in fusion with the FBOX domain along with a fluorescent reporter MITO-GFP. This reporter will allow the monitoring of transfected cells (useful for flow cytometry or microscopy analyses for instance). Each clone will be transfected for 48 h in the stable cell line expressing the fluorescent antigen of choice (here H2882 cells expressing H2B-mCherry-RHOBQ63L mutant). Each well will be observed using an inverted epifluorescence microscope. The cells expressing a FBOX-sdAb fusion will have green mitochondria, and in these cells, the red fluorescent nuclear signal will be examined.\nThe next day, start as many minipreps as needed for the screen by inoculating a colony into 3 mL of LB medium with 100 μg mL−1 ampicillin. A total of 300 minipreps was performed in (Bery et al., 2019a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). This can be scaled up or down (see Limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section).\nMiniprep are done using a miniprep kit (Machery Nagel or Qiagen).\nTo check the diversity of the sub-library, 50 clones have been sent for sequencing.\nPause Point: Minipreps can be stored at −20°C and the screen can be performed over weeks if necessary.",
    "In each well of 24-well plates, seed 30,000 H2882 cells stably expressing the target antigen H2B-mCherry-RHOBQ63L.\nThe next day, transfect 0.75 μg of plasmid DNA of interest (coding for FBOX-sdAb-IRES-MITO-GFP, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], top panel) with 1.5 μL of JetPRIME reagent. One plasmid per well, as many wells as needed for the screen (i.e., 300 clones will require 300 wells).\nCritical: It is important to include a negative control (antibody not binding the antigen of interest) in the screen to assess the effect of an antibody non-degrading the antigen (as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/347-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Expected results from the cell-based screening of conformational antibody-based degraders\n(A) Representative images obtained from the screen after transfection of the single domain antibody (sdAb)-based degrader plasmid (FBOX-sdAb-IRES-MITO-GFP) into the stable cell lines H2B-mCherry-RHOBQ63L and the negative stable cell line H2B-mCherry. White arrows indicate transfected cells (green mitochondria) where a decrease of the mCherry fluorescence is only observed with the FBOX-sdAb2 in the H2B-mCherry-RHOBQ63L stable cell line (FBOX-sdAb1 is a negative control).\n(B) Analysis of the conformation of the positive hits by flow cytometry. H2882 stables clones: H2B-mCherry (white bars), H2B-mCherry-RHOBT19N (gray bars), and H2B-mCherry-RHOBQ63L (black bars) are transfected with a negative FBOX-sdAb (not degrading) or a positive FBOX-sdAb (degrading). The intensity of mCherry fluorescence in the green transfected cells is analyzed by flow cytometry and compared to the normalized negative control. Data represented in (B) are means ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.\n48 h later, the cells are fixed 15 min with 3.7% of PFA, rinse three times with PBS and observed under an inverted microscope. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A left-hand side panel for representative images expected from such a screen.",
    "All the positive hits are subsequently screened against the negative stable cell lines expressing H2B-mCherry to confirm the specificity of the antibody-based degraders. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A right-hand side panel.\nTo check the conformational specificity of the hits, a counter-screen on a negative cell line (here the H2B-mCherry-RHOBT19N cell line) is performed by flow cytometry. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nFinally, positive hits which efficiently degrade the target but not the controls, are selected for further characterization on their capacity to efficiently degrade the endogenous antigen in more physiological cellular models."
