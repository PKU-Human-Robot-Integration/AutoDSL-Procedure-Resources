It is also possible to perform this ligation by incubating at 22°C for 2 h, then leaving for ∼18–20 h in a thermocycler at 16°C.\nTransform the entire ligation reaction (∼10 μL) into 50 μL of E. coli TOP10 competent cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After recovering for 45–60 min at 37°C (shaking at 250 rpm), plate cells onto an LB agar plate supplemented with 200 μg/mL ampicillin. Incubate the plate at 37°C for ∼18 h.\nNote: It is possible to eliminate the recovery time from this step, as the pGEN-luxCDABE plasmid is ampicillin-resistant.\nPick several colonies at random (see Problem 2) to verify the successful cloning of the sseA promoter by colony PCR with Taq DNA Polymerase, using the “Screening fwd” and “Screening rev” primers. Set up the following mix:",

Swirl tip in each tube briefly prior to removal.\nUse the following parameters to perform the colony PCR protocol in a thermocycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_106_5.csv\nNote: The 10 min initial denaturation stage is specific to colony PCR.\nRun an agarose gel to verify the size of the PCR product (successful clones should be ∼1,000 bp). Select 1–2 positive colonies that have been confirmed via colony PCR, and inoculate into 5 mL LB containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Incubate the cultures at 37°C for ∼18 h with shaking at 250 rpm.\nMiniprep the luciferase reporter plasmid (pGEN-PsseA-luxCDABE) from the overnight culture. Follow instructions in the manufacturer’s protocol (PrestoTM Mini Plasmid Kit), but elute in ∼30 μL water.\nPause Point: The plasmid can be stored at −20°C.\nNote: Before proceeding, the plasmid should be Sanger sequenced to verify the sequence of the inserted promoter.\nPrepare electrocompetent S. Typhimurium cells for transformation.\nGrow a 5 mL antibiotic-free LB culture of wild-type S. Typhimurium by incubating at 37°C for ∼18 h with shaking at 250 rpm.\nDilute 1 mL of overnight culture into 50 mL of LB, and incubate the culture at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm until an OD of 0.5–0.6 (mid-log phase, ∼2.5 h).\nTransfer the cells to two 50 mL Falcon conical tubes (∼25 mL culture per tube). Pellet by centrifugation for 10 min at 3,600 g in a pre-chilled (4°C) centrifuge. Remove promptly and discard supernatant.",
    "Wash the cells by vigorously resuspending in 10 mL ice-cold sterile ddH2O. Pellet by centrifugation for 10 min at 3,600 g in a pre-chilled (4°C) centrifuge. Remove promptly and discard supernatant.\nRepeat step d once.\nResuspend each pellet in ∼250 μL ice-cold, sterile 10% (v/v) glycerol. Divide into 50 μL aliquots in cold 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, kept on ice.\nCritical: Keep cells and all tubes on ice at all times throughout this process.\nPause Point: The electrocompetent cells can be frozen immediately and stored at −80°C for long-term usage.\nIf proceeding directly from step 13, immediately add ∼3–4 μL of the pGEN-PsseA-luxCDABE plasmid to one tube of electrocompetent cells and incubate on ice briefly (∼3 min). If using previously made, frozen electrocompetent cells, first thaw on ice for ∼5 min.\nCarefully transfer the competent cell/plasmid mixture into a pre-chilled electroporation cuvette and perform the electroporation using a Gene Pulser XcellTM Electroporation System at 2.5 kV.\nAfter the pulse, immediately transfer the mixture out of the cuvette and into a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing ∼1 mL LB.\nIncubate the LB mixture for ∼1 h at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm.\nPlate 100 μL of the transformed cells onto an LB agar plate supplemented with 200 μg/mL ampicillin.

Store at −80°C for long-term usage.\nVerify Inducing Conditions for Promoter Activity\nTiming: 4 days",
    "Validate the optimal growth conditions for sseA promoter induction and measure bioluminescence production (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The division of steps across days is as follows: step 21 (day 1), steps 22–26 (day 2), step 27 (day 3–4).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/106-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the High-Throughput Screening Approach\n(A) Schematic of inducing conditions for sseA promoter activity.\n(B) Illustration of experimental conditions for Z-prime determination and high-throughput screening. T0lux is the luminescence read immediately after bacterial addition (0 h), T6lux is the luminescence read after a 6 h incubation, T0OD is the OD600 read immediately after bacterial addition, T18OD is the OD600 read after a 18 h incubation. Δlux is calculated by subtracting T0lux from T6lux, ΔOD is calculated by subtracting T0OD from T18OD.\nNote: These growth conditions are specific to inducing SPI-2 gene expression in S. Typhimurium and may be modified by investigators to suit a different regulatory region of interest.\nGrow a 5 mL LB culture of pGEN-PsseA-luxCDABE-harboring S. Typhimurium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin.\nDilute 100 μL of overnight culture into 5 mL of LB, and incubate the culture at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm until an OD of 0.5–0.6 (mid-log phase, ∼2.5 h).\nRemove 10 μL of mid-log phase cells from the growing culture and add to a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Pellet by centrifugation for 2 min at ∼14,000 g in a centrifuge, then resuspend in 10 μL of PBS. Repeat once, then add the entire cell suspension into 1 mL of LPM. Aliquot 100 μL of this mixture into each of 3 wells in a 96-well black, clear flat bottom microplate.\nNote: Any brand of microplate may be used, but it is essential that the plate be opaque between wells to avoid luminescence signal contamination between samples.",
    "Immediately read luminescence and OD600 of the 3 wells using a Synergy Neo2 multi-mode reader.\nNote: Any other plate reader (with an appropriate luminescence filter and the ability to read absorbance) may be substituted.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C (without shaking) for ∼6 h. Read luminescence and OD600 every 60 min.\nNormalize luminescence values to OD600 values at each time point and plot these data against time. The curve should reach a maximum normalized luminescence value after ∼5–6 h of growth. This will be the time point at which promoter activity will be measured during the chemical screen.\nNote: This time point may be different for other target promoters.\nRepeat this assay in biological triplicate to validate the conditions required for promoter induction.\nDetermine Z-prime\nTiming: 3 days\nThe Z-prime is a statistical parameter to determine the degree of sensitivity in a particular assay. High-throughput screens require an easily detectable window between low and high signals, which is approximated by Z-prime calculation. For more details on the applications of this statistical effect size on high-throughput screening, see (Zhang et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The division of steps across days is as follows: step 28 (day 1), steps 29–32 (day 2), steps 33–35 (day 3).\nNote: At this stage, the assay is transitioned into 384-well plate format for compatibility with the well density of the compound plates in the chemical library. Investigators may adjust this as needed.\nGrow a 5 mL LB culture of pGEN-PsseA-luxCDABE-harboring S. Typhimurium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Incubate the culture at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm for ∼18 h.\nDilute 100 μL of overnight culture into 5 mL of LB supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Incubate the culture at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm until an OD of 0.5–0.6 (mid-log phase, ∼2.5 h).",
    "During this incubation step, prepare two 384-well black, clear flat bottom microplates to determine the Z-prime for the high-throughput screen.\nDesignate rows A-P/columns 1–12 as “high signal” wells and rows A-P/columns 13–24 as “low signal” wells.\nUsing the Labcyte® Echo® 525 Acoustic Liquid Handler, fill all “high signal” wells with 60 nL DMSO and all “low signal” wells with 60 nL rifampicin (50 mg/mL dissolved in DMSO). Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for guidelines on volume transfer.\nNote: The Labcyte® Echo® 525 Acoustic Liquid Handler is one of several instruments that may be used for low-volume transfer of screening compounds into assay plates. Other machines may be substituted.\nNote: Any antibiotic that the bacterial strain is susceptible to may be substituted for rifampicin in “low signal” wells. Although a growth-inhibitory antibiotic is imperfect as a positive control for this assay (as we are interested in compounds that affect only sseA promoter activity and not viability), this is sufficient to approximate the potential for reduced luminescence signal.\nRemove 700 μL of mid-log phase cells from the growing culture and add to a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Pellet by centrifugation for 2 min at ∼14,000 g in a centrifuge, then resuspend in 700 μL of PBS. Repeat once, then add the entire cell suspension into 70 mL of LPM. With the Biomek FXP Automated Workstation, fill all wells of both 384-well plates with this cell mixture, dispensing 30 μL per well. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for guidelines on liquid handling.\nCritical: For this liquid handler, a minimum volume of 40 mL must remain within the liquid reservoir at all times. This may vary depending on instrument.",
    "Note: The Biomek FXP Automated Workstation is one of several instruments that may be used for liquid handling for growth media during screening assays. Other machines or forms of pipette automation may be substituted.\nNote: At this point, antibiotic selection in LPM to maintain the luciferase plasmid is no longer possible, as the presence of ampicillin may interfere with the accuracy of chemical screening through unexpected drug-drug interactions. The pGEN plasmid (Lane et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) contains the hok/sok toxin-antitoxin system for maintenance.\nImmediately read luminescence (T0lux) and OD600 (T0OD) of both 384-well plates using a Synergy Neo2 multi-mode reader. Incubate the plates at 37°C (without shaking) for ∼18 h. Read luminescence at ∼6 h after the first read (T6lux).\nRemove plates from the incubator and read OD600 (T18OD).\nQuantify luminescence production (Δlux) by subtracting T0lux from T6lux. Quantify growth (ΔOD) by subtracting T0OD from T18OD. These two parameters are the functional readouts that will be monitored in the chemical screen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: OD600 is not recorded at the 6 h time point in this protocol to decrease the time required to read each plate, for better synchrony across assay plates. For the purposes of this first stage of compound identification, T18OD serves as a crude estimate of growth-inhibitory activity per compound. In later stages of experimentation, we recommend that investigators kinetically monitor bacterial growth in the presence of each hit compound to determine full dose-response profiles (MacNair et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCalculate the Z-prime for both Δlux and ΔOD and using the following equation:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/106-Si1.jpg\nA Z-prime between 0.5 and 1 is considered to be sufficient for proceeding with the screening assay (see Problem 3).\nPerform High-Throughput Screen\nTiming: 3 days",
    "Conduct high-throughput small molecule screen to identify anti-virulence inhibitors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).

Here, we describe the screening and data analysis process for a subset of 3,921 known biological actives from this compound collection. In our high-throughput screening facility, the compounds in this subset are arrayed across 13 unique chemical library plates, which include several empty wells.\nGrow a 5 mL LB culture of pGEN-PsseA-luxCDABE-harboring S.

Incubate the culture at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm until an OD of 0.5–0.6 (mid-log phase, ∼2.5 h).\nDuring this incubation step, fill all assay plates (384-well black, clear flat bottom microplates) with compounds. Each compound plate should be assayed in technical duplicate (13 unique assay plates, 26 total plates).\nUse the Labcyte® Echo® 525 Acoustic Liquid Handler to transfer 60 nL of each compound from 5 mM library stocks (to a final concentration of 10 μM compound per well).\nWhile loading plates, protect those that have already been filled from light due to the varied sensitivity of certain compounds.\nNote: Volume transferred per well can be adjusted depending on the stock concentrations of screening compounds in the library.",

Incubate the plates at 37°C (without shaking) for ∼18 h. Read luminescence at ∼6 h after the first read (T6lux).\nRemove plates from the incubator and read OD600 (T18OD).\nQuantify luminescence production (Δlux) by subtracting T0lux from T6lux. Quantify growth (ΔOD) by subtracting T0OD from T18OD (see Problem 4).\nNote: For this protocol, we recommend a maximum of ∼50 total assay plates per day (25 compound plates in technical duplicate). Steps 36–43 may be repeated across a number of days to process more compounds. An assay plate should be reserved for determining the Z-prime for each day of screening, to ensure consistency in luminescence production across days."
