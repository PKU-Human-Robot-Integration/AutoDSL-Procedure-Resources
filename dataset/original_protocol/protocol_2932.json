Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D is the photo of chamber at this stage.\nNote: For each electrotaxis chamber, two PDMS stencils are applied, one for the electrical stimulation group and the other for the control (without electrical stimulation).\nCritical: Air bubbles should be avoided between the PDMS and the cell culture dish to make a firm attachment of the PDMS stencils to the cell culture dish. The device's reservoirs are designed to be sealed and leak-proof.\nSeeding cells for cell patterning (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2677-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell patterning workflow\nReproduced with permission from iScience.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nPrepare a cell suspension at a concentration of 8×106 cells/mL.\nAdd 1 mL of cell suspension for each cell patterning reservoir.\nGently move the dish to an incubator and allow cells to attach for 15 min.\nObserve the cells with a microscope to ensure the desired cell density (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nGently remove the medium containing any unattached cells with a pipette.\nAdd fresh cell culture medium and incubate cells overnight (∼16 h).\nObserve the pattern of cell sheets with a microscope and confirm whether a confluent monolayer is formed.",
    "Using a pipette, remove the cell culture medium from the reservoirs.\nGently peel off the stencil with tweezers.\nGently wash the patterned cell sheet with the culture medium.\nUsing a microscope, examine the pattern of the cell sheets and confirm that they are in the desired size and shape (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCritical: For the HaCat cells, we recommend to keep the passage number lower than 30. Move the dish gently to avoid disturbing the settlement and adhesion of cells after seeding. The time required for cell attachment is cell type-dependent. When peeling off the stencil, try to peel it off from corners with tweezers and avoid contact with grease. In case the tweezers are contaminated by the grease, clean the tweezers with 75% ethanol and tissue paper. PDMS stencils will remain intact after peeling off. Discard the used PDMS stencils.\nAssembling the EF stimulation system\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the assembly of the EF stimulation chamber, preparation of salt bridge and set up the electrotaxis system.\nAssembling the EF stimulation chamber\nAdd 0.5 mL cell culture medium in the area between PDMS strips.\nGently put cover glasses over the stimulation area of the chamber (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).\nSeal the stimulation chamber into two reservoirs (on the left and right) by placing silicone grease on the top of the cover glasses (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F–2G). Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H is the photo of the chamber at this stage.\nAdd 6 mL fresh cell culture medium in each reservoir.\nNote: Since the distance between PDMS strips is less than 20 mm, thus the cover glass (50 × 24 mm) can be laid on the PDMS strips. In Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G, areas α and β, γ and δ are connected by the intervals between the cell culture dish and cover glasses, respectively.",
    "Critical: Air bubbles should be avoided between the cover glass and the cell culture dish. The device's reservoirs are designed to be sealed and leak-proof. Make sure the medium can go through the space between the cell culture dish and the cover glass. To store 6 mL of cell culture medium in each reservoir, we have to build up walls of the reservoir with silicon grease, as shown in the Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G.\nPreparation of salt bridge.\nMelt the 1.5% agar in 1× Steinberg solution by microwave.\nSlowly fill the agar in the glass bridge.\nLeave the salt bridge at room temperature to solidify.\nCritical: The agar solution should be fully melted before filling the glass bridge. Air bubbles should be avoided in the glass bridge.\nSet up the electrotaxis system.\nPreheat the incubator of the living cell imaging system (37°C, 5% CO2).\nMove the electrotaxis chamber into the incubator of the living cell imaging system.\nFull-fill two beakers (100 mL) with 1× Steinberg’s solution (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2677-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Electrotaxis system setup\n(A and B) electrotaxis experiment setup.\n(C) Electric potential and current density of the electrotaxis chamber simulated by COMOSL Multiphysics. Scale bar = 1 cm. Reproduced with permission from iScience.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nConnect the electrotaxis system including the power supply, electrodes, salt bridges, beakers with saline, electrotaxis chamber, and wires (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nSwitch on the DC power supply.\nMonitor the voltage by inserting electrodes of a multimeter at the two ends of the coverslip in the EF stimulation chamber, as indicated in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nAdjust the total voltage of the current supply to achieve the desired voltage between the two ends of the cover glass.\nSwitch off the DC power supply.\nCover the cell culture dish with a sterilized lid with holes in it.",
    "Align the electrotaxis chamber with the motorized loading stage of the microscope and make sure that the applied electric field is parallel to one edge of the stage.\nNote the relative position of the cathode and anode in the electrotaxis system.\nNote: For our experiment, the length of the cover glass is 50 mm, and to obtain an electric field of 200 mV/mm, the voltage measured should be 10.0 V.\nCritical: Wear insulating gloves and take caution against electric shock. The desired voltage between the two ends of the cover glass depends on the targeted strength of electric fields and the size of the cover glass. Electric fields distribute uniformly in the EF stimulation area, as indicated in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, and cell sheets should be patterned in this field. Note the relative position of the electrodes.\nMonitoring collective cell migration using time-lapse microscopy during EF stimulation\nTiming: 9 h\nThis section describes a step-by-step walkthrough of live cell imaging of collective cell migration in a large cell sheet.\nPreparation for imaging.\nStart the image acquisition software and set up the parameters required for the time-lapse.\nSelect the objective according to the experimental demand. Here we use a 10× phase contrast objectives lens for imaging.\nBring the imaging window of the stimulation chamber into focus.\nNavigate to a well-patterned cell sheet.\nNavigate an XY position to find a corner of the cell sheet and save the position in the image acquisition system.\nNavigate a series of XY positions to cover the whole cell sheet and make sure each adjacent region of interest (ROI) has a 20% overlap along the x and y axes.",
    "Navigate to the other cell sheets in the chamber and save the position in the imaging acquisition system. Cell sheets from both the EF-stimulation group and the NO EF group can be acquired in order.\nGive it a dry run by clicking the acquisition button.\nStop image recording after finishing the first frame of all ROIs.\nCheck the quality of the images to confirm that the focus and exposure of the image are set correctly and that there is no shift during multi-position acquisition.\nNote: In this study, the time interval was set as 5 min. The duration was set as 7 h. In our setup, 9 ROI with 20% overlap are required for a square cell sheet up to 1 mm × 1 mm in size.\nCritical: Cell sheets keep expanding after we peel off the PDMS stencil, thus to have a well-controlled experiment, the time spent on setting up the electrotaxis system and setting path of the imaging should be controlled within a certain time (in our experiment, it is about 1 h), thus making each independent round of experiments comparable.\nPerform real-time imaging with precisely controlled EF stimulation.\nStart multi-position time-lapse recording by clicking the acquisition button again.\nSwitch on the DC power supply at the desired time.\nMonitor the voltage during stimulation and adjust it if needed.\nCheck that all stage positions are still in focus at later points.\nStop image acquisition at a defined time point.\nSwitch off the computer and microscope system.\nNote: In our study, EF is applied 1 h later after the time-lapse recording, and the EF stimulation duration is 6 h.",
    "Critical: Stage drift is a common complication when performing time-lapse recordings that span multiple hours. If images need to be refocused, pause imaging recording at an appropriate time point (at the end of the last round acquisition), adjust the focus and resume imaging within a few seconds, up to a couple of minutes. EF stimulation will not need to be stopped while adjusting the focus.\nGeneration of time-lapse movies of integrated cell sheets using ImageJ software.\nLaunch the ImageJ program and import the imaging file using ‘‘File>Import>Image sequence’’.\nAdjust the brightness and/or contrast to attain a better view of the images by clicking ‘‘Image>Adjust>Brightness/Contrast’’.\nImages are then stitched together using Grid/Collection Stitching plugin in the ImageJ.\nSlight shifts of the images in the video are corrected by using Registration-Register Virtual Stack plugin in ImageJ software by clicking ”Plugins>Registration>Register Virtual Stack”.\nSave the video as single ‘‘.tiff’’ files (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2677-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Engineering of the cell sheets\n(A and B) Cell sheets of defined size and shape were engineered using a PDMS stencil. Scale bar = 500 μm.
