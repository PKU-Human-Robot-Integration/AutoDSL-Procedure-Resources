    "Note: It is assumed local knowledge of NMR spectrometer operation exists for 1H NMR spectroscopy or can be sourced appropriately. Commands listed here relate to the operation of Bruker NMR spectrometers–follow equivalent protocols for other vendors. Aggregation protocolDissolve the ligand (compound in DMSO-d6 to obtain a 10 mM stock solution).Weigh out the compound of interest on an accurate balance and add the DMSO-d6 using a micropipette to dissolve the compound and obtain a stock solution. If the compound was not fully soluble at first, gentle heating (around 40-50 °C) with a hair dryer can be applied for less than 1 min at a time followed by 30 s of vortexing. This can be repeated until the solid is fully dissolved. The resulting solution should be clear with no floating particles of material and not cloudy.Prepare a fresh buffer solution of 10 mM PBS buffer corrected to pH 7.4.Dissolve a phosphate buffered saline tablet in 100 ml of water and correct the resulting solution to pH 7.4 by mean of a pH meter.Add 10 µl of the stock 10 mM ligand solution to a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube [the following steps (A3-A5) are intended to make a compound dilution to a final concentration of 500 µM].Use a micropipette and tip to add the solution of ligand to the clean new Eppendorf. Discard the tip. Put the Eppendorf on an Eppendorf stand.Add 170 µl of the buffer to the Eppendorf and vortex the solution for 30 s.Use a micropipette and tip to add the buffer solution to the Eppendorf containing the ligand solution. Discard the tip. Close and vortex the Eppendorf at setting 8 for 30 s. Re-open the Eppendorf and put it back on its stand.Add 20 µl of D2O to the Eppendorf and vortex the solution for 30 s.",
    "Use a micropipette and tip to add D2O to the Eppendorf containing the ligand solution and buffer. Discard the tip. Close the Eppendorf and vortex it at setting 8 for 30 s. Re-open the Eppendorf and put it back on its stand.Transfer the resulting solution into a 3 mm NMR tube.Carefully draw the solution in a long Pasteur pipette with the aid of a rubber teat. Then transfer the solution carefully to the tube, putting the pipette completely in and taking it out as the teat is pressed gently to release the solution. Flick the NMR tube a couple of time (towards the floor) to make sure that the liquid moves completely to the bottom of the tube.Cap and centrifuge the NMR tube.Cap the NMR tube, place it in a manual hand centrifuge and centrifuge it for a couple of minutes to ensure no bubbles at the surface (as this can cause poor field optimisation (shimming) in the NMR experiment).Place the tube in the NMR spectrometer for waterLOGSY 1-D NMR detection.Place the NMR tube in the 3 mm spinner (turbine) and use the appropriate NMR depth gauge to position the tube correctly in the spinner. Transfer the sample/spinner into the NMR spectrometer magnet either via manual placement or via use of a sample transfer robot attached to the magnet cryostat.waterLOGSY basic protocolThe basic WaterLOGSY is exemplified here with using an initial stock protein solution of C = 50 µM. The concentration of the protein determines the amount of buffer that is needed in the experiment. Other protein concentrations can be used with buffer amount changed accordingly.Dissolve the ligand (compound in DMSO-d6 to obtain a 10 mM stock solution).",

If the compound was not fully soluble at first, gentle heating with a hair dryer can be applied for less than 1 min at a time followed by 30 s of vortexing. This can be repeated until the solid is fully dissolved.Prepare a fresh buffer solution of 10 mM PBS, 5 mM MgCl2 buffer corrected to pH 7.4.This buffer is the one required for the protein used in this protocol; the appropriate buffer for the protein under study should be prepared here. Buffers with low proton content, such as PBS, or that are deuterated (e.g., Tris-d11) are preferred to minimise background signals from the buffer. Similarly, concentrations of protonated buffers should be minimised.Thaw the protein just before the preparation of the sample.Take the protein out of the -80 °C freezer and place it in a box of dry ice to be carried to the NMR instrument. Take the Eppendorf containing the protein out of the ice and leave it to stand at room temperature to thaw completely. Do not put the protein back in ice until the end of all experiments. In some cases the protein can be frozen back, but only if it is stable enough to do so. For this protocol, we prepared careful aliquots to prevent any protein remaining after carrying out the experiments.Add 10 µl of the ligand solution to a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Use a micropipette and tip to add the solution of ligand to the clean new Eppendorf. Discard the tip. Put the Eppendorf on an Eppendorf stand.Add 130 µl of the buffer to the Eppendorf and vortex the solution for 30 s.",

Usually three ligands can be used at once and solutions in DMSO are used–the amount of buffer changed accordingly. The library screening protocol is exemplified here with using an initial stock protein of C = 50 µM.Dissolve the ligand (compound in DMSO-d6 to obtain a 10 mM stock solution).Weigh out the compound of interest on an accurate balance and add the DMSO-d6 using a micropipette to dissolve the compound and obtain a stock solution. If the compound was not fully soluble at first, gentle heating with a hair dryer can be applied for less than 1 min at a time followed by 30 s of vortexing. This can be repeated until the solid is fully dissolved.Repeat this step up to two more times in order to add all the ligands needed to be screened.Prepare a fresh buffer solution of 10 mM PBS, 5 mM MgCl2 buffer corrected to pH 7.4.This buffer is the one required for the protein used in this protocol; the appropriate buffer for the protein under study should be prepared here.",
