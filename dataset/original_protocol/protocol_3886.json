    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSurgical preparation\nTiming: 15 min\nCritical: All animal experiments must be performed under the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The procedure and drugs must be adapted according to the IACUC approved protocol.\nTwo-month-old male C57BL/6J mice are weighed. The weights of mice are around 20–23 g.\nNote: This technique can be used with mice of different weights over two months of age.\nAnimal anesthesia. Mice are induced to deep anesthesia with 7% (v/v) chloral hydrate (320-17-0, Sangon Biotech) dissolved in normal saline at room temperature (R.T.) by intraperitoneal injection (150 μL/ 20 g body weight).\nCritical: Mice will be anesthetized within 5 min and returned to their cage until deep anesthesia is induced. Check the anesthetic state by a hard pinch to the tail and a puff of air to the eye. If neither causes any responses, the mouse is considered to have achieved deep anesthesia.\nAlternatives: Isoflurane is a good alternative for animal anesthesia.\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse to a stereotaxic instrument (68045, RWD), fit the front teeth into the incisor bar's hole, and secure the incisor bar. Adjust ear bars in front of ears to tightly hold the head (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/828-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of the mouse for the surgery\n(A) The surgical instruments include stereotaxic instruments, animal platforms, animal surgical microscope, drill, microsyringe, and microsyringe needle.\n(B) An enlarged view of the white box in A. The mouse is secured onto the stereotaxic instrument through the incisor bar and ear bars.\n(C) A diagram of a mouse is held on the stereotaxic instrument.",
    "Critical: The height of the incisor bar should not be too low. Otherwise, it will affect the breath of the mouse. The ear bars should be the same height. Fix ear bars on both sides at the same length, which can be calibrated according to the scale on the ear bars. These are done basically to ensure left-right symmetry.\nApply ophthalmic ointment (Jieqi) to the eyes for physical protection and drying prevention.\nRemove the scalp hair of the mouse with a razor blade (74-C, Feiying). Carefully shave the hair to expose an area of about 1.5 cm2 on the top of the head.\nIncision and skull preparation.\nA 1.5–2 cm cut is made sagittally in the center of the scalp. Remove the whole scalp skin using small sharp scissors. Remove the overlying membranes on the skull with sterile swabs.\nThe edges of the scalp skin are glued to the skull with tissue adhesive (1469SB, 3M Vetbond) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/828-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Major steps of the installation of the cannula\n(A) Incision and skull preparation. Adjust the skull level by using a pipette.\n(B) Coordinates determination and drilling. The coordinates used for the injection are 2.45 mm posterior to bregma (Y-axis), ± 2.15 mm lateral to the midline (X-axis). Four holes are drilled. Two are at the injection sites; the other two are away from the injection sites.\n(C) Insert two cranial nails at the holes away from the injection sites.\n(D) Place the first cannula and secure the nail and cannula with dental cement.\n(E) Loosen the protective cap and make sure the protective cap can be removed.\n(F) Insert another cannula and secure it with dental cement.\n(G) Loosen the protective cap.\n(H) Recouple the protective cap.",
    "The orientation: a, anterior; p, posterior; l, lateral; m, medial. Scale bar, 5 mm.\nNote: Ensure the edges of the scalp skin stick tightly to the skull.\nSurgical procedure\nTiming: 1 h\nSkull level adjustment.\nA pipette is installed on a microsyringe needle, fixed on the microsyringe (Pump 11 Elite, Harvard apparatus). The pipette is used to level the skull along the midline axis at the suture intersection points of bregma and lambda.\nLower the pipette onto bregma to zero the coordinates (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nAdjust the height of the ear bars on both sides and make sure the readings of Z-axis coordinates (± 2.3 mm lateral to the midline) is less than 0.03 mm. Next, adjust the height of the incisor bar to make sure the readings of Z-axis coordinates (2.3 mm anterior to bregma, 2.3 mm posterior to bregma) is less than 0.03 mm.\nNote: When there is a big difference in the readings of the Z-axis between two sites, let the pipette go back to bregma and repeat zeroing the coordinates at bregma.\nCoordinates determination. Coordinates for drilling are measured using bregma as a reference point. The coordinates are marked using a sterile drill bit and re-confirmed for accuracy before drilling starts. Coordinates for specific brain regions of interest (e.g., here hippocampus) are determined, referring to the mouse brain atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The coordinates of the drill sites we used for hippocampal microdialysis are ± 2.15 mm lateral to the midline, 2.45 mm posterior to bregma (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Drilling. Drill four holes through the skull. Be careful to apply a minimal force so that the trauma to the dura and underlying membranes is minimal or absent. Two holes are at the measured sites of cannula installation, and the other two are away from the injection sites and used for the insertion of skull screws. Clear up the holes with a cotton-tipped swab after drilling.\nCannula placement.\nInsert skull screws of the specific size (e.g., 2.0 mm self-tapping screws; RWD) into the holes without impacting the brain beneath, which are used to anchor the dental cement (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCoordinates are re-confirmed to be the sites of the hole drilled and lowered to the target depth. The coordinates we used are ± 2.15 mm lateral to the midline, 2.45 mm posterior to bregma, 1.6 mm ventral to the surface of the skull. The first cannula is placed at the injection site on the left. The cannula and skull screws are secured in place with dental cement after correctly positioned. When the dental cement is completely set, remove the protective cap (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nInsert another cannula at the injection site on the right. Secure the cannula and skull screws with dental cement after correctly positioned. When the dental cement is completely set, loosen the protective cap and ensure the protective cap can be removed (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3G).\nTight the protective cap (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nNote: Ensure the dental cement is completely set before proceeding to the next step. See Troubleshooting 2 and 3.\nPost-surgical care\nTiming: 15 min (immediate care) and 3 days (follow-up care)\nPost-surgical care and recovery.",
    "Acute post-surgical care. Mice are placed in an empty cage with a heating pad until full recovery from the anesthesia. Then, return the mice to their cage and mark the date of surgery.\nFollow-up care in the recovery days following surgery. It takes about 7–10 days for recovery. Animals are examined at least once a day for the first three days. The overall health status of mice is checked according to institutional animal care guidelines.\nPause point: peptide injection and behavior testing can be performed 7–10 days after cannula insertion.\nPeptide injection\nTiming: 20 min\nAnimal anesthesia.\nSufficient amount of isoflurane (R510-22, RWD) is added into the isoflurane vaporizer (F700, Friends honesty) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The switch of the isoflurane vaporizer is turned on to the anesthesia chamber.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/828-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Peptide injection\n(A) Anesthesia instrument.\n(B) The mouse is secured on the stereotaxic instrument through the incisor bar and ear bars.\n(C) Animal anesthesia. The incisor bar holds the teeth of the mouse. Keep the nose entirely in the anesthesia mask with isoflurane at 1.5%. The ear bars hold the brain. The injection tube is connected to the microsyringe by an injection hose, which is absorbed peptide in advance.\nMice are anesthetized with airflow at 1 L/min and isoflurane at 4% in the anesthesia chamber.\nThe anesthetized mouse is transferred to a stereotaxic instrument. Fit the front teeth into the incisor bar, and insert the nose into an anesthetic mask. Adjust ear bars to hold the head tightly. Switch the isoflurane vaporizer to the mask, with airflow at 1 L/min and isoflurane at 1.5% (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nNote: The most suitable anesthetic mix of isoflurane is at 1.5%. It must be monitored discreetly to avoid a potentially lethal isoflurane overdose.\nMiniature syringe connection.",
    "The microinjection needle filled with mineral oil (M8410, Sigma-Aldrich) is installed on the microsyringe (Pump 11 Elite, Harvard apparatus) and connected to the hose, filled with mineral oil in advance.\nAdjust the microsyringe to the withdrawal mode and suck up 5 μL liquid (e.g., here peptides) into the hose.\nConnect the hose to the drug injection tube. Adjust the microsyringe to the injection mode and push the syringe forward until liquid comes out from the front of the injection tube.\nConnect the injection tube to the catheter.\nPeptides injection. Inject 1.5 μL of the peptides solution into each side of the hippocampus at a rate of 0.3 μL/min. When the injection is complete, keep the mouse in position for 2 min to ensure a complete infusion. Recouple the protective caps. See Troubleshooting 4 and 5.\nRecovery. Return the injected mice to the cage, and the mice will recover from anesthesia in 5 min.\nBehavioral testing\nTiming: 3 days\nAnimals are respectively infused with saline, scramble peptide, and peptide TAT-52-68aa for three consecutive days. One hour after peptide delivery, the injected mice will perform the spatial recognition tasks.\nHabituation. Clean the field arena with 70% (v/v) alcohol before each experiment and wait until it is completely dry. An hour after the peptide infusion, gently introduce the mouse into the arena for 10 min free movement and return to its original cage.\nTraining. Place two identical objects (i.e., A and B) at one side of the arena, re-introduce the testing mouse into the arena and allow it to explore freely in the arena for 10 min. Record its movements using the EthoVision XT7 video tracking software (Noldus). Finally, return the mouse to its cage. Clean the arena with 70% (v/v) alcohol between each mouse.",
    "Re-exposure. Keep object A in the original position, and move object B to the opposite side. Introduce the testing mouse into the area and allow it to explore freely in the arena for 10 min. Record its movements by the camera. Finally, return the mouse to its cage. Clean the arena with 70% (v/v) alcohol between each mouse.\nResult analysis. Analyze the record movements and calculate the exploration time for objects. Sniffing on the objects (with nose contact or head directed toward the object) within a 2-cm radius of the objects is regarded as an exploration of the objects. Sitting or standing on the objects is not considered an exploration.\nData presentation. Data are expressed as a percentage of moved-object exploration time relative to the total exploration time (familiar and moved-object exploration during 'test').\nPause point: injection sites and spread region analysis can be performed 1–15 days after behavioral testing.\nInjection sites and spread region analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nInjection sites analysis.\nPerfuse the mouse with 1 × phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (B548117-0500, Sangon Biotech), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (158127, Sigma Aldrich) in PBS (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/828-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analysis of the injection sites and spread region\n(A) The injection sites on the mouse brain. The white arrows indicate the injection sites.\n(B) The damaged area caused by cannulas was showed by DAPI staining. The white arrows indicate the damaged area. Scale bar, 30 mm.\n(C) Mouse has injected with peptide and DAPI mixed solution. The brain is cut into brain tissue sections and analyzed. The chromogenic region of DAPI represents the region of peptide spread. Scale bar, 10 mm. Enlarged images are displayed in the right panels: scale bar, 200 μm.",
    "Keep the brain in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. On the second day, wash the brain with 1 × PBS 3 times, 5 min each time.\nEmbed the brain in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (4583, SAKURA).\nProduce 14-μm-thick frozen brain sections on a freezing microtome (CM1950, Leica), then the brain tissue sections are placed on microscope slides (80302-2104, CITOTEST).\nDry the brain tissue slide at R.T., then wash the slide with 1 × PBS 3 times, 5 min each time.\nAdminister small drops of VECTASHIELD HardSet Mounting Medium with DAPI (H-1500, Vector Labs), then place cover slide (80340-3610, CITOTEST) on top of the microscope slide.\nAnalyze the brain slide by using a fluorescence microscope (DM5000B, Leica). The staining of DAPI shows that the trauma caused by the cannula is located above the hippocampus (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nThe spread region analysis.\nProduce the mixed solution by adding DAPI (dilution, 1:200) into the peptide solution.\nInject 1.5 μL of the mixed solution at 0.3 μL/min into each side of the hippocampus.\nKeep the infusion cannula in position for another 5 min after the delivery of the mixed solution.\nRemove the step-design cannula from the skull and kill the mouse immediately.\nThe brain is dissected and embedded in OCT compound.\nProduce 14-μm-thick frozen brain sections on a freezing microtome, then the brain tissue sections are placed on microscope slides.\nDry the brain tissue slide at R.T., then wash the slide with 1 × PBS 3 times, 5 min each time.\nAdminister small drops of VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium (H-1000, Vector Labs), then place the cover slide on top of the microscope slide.",
    "Analyze the brain slide by using a fluorescence microscope. The positive signal of DAPI is mainly in the dorsal hippocampus (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). The results indicate that the peptide mainly spread in the dorsal hippocampus."
