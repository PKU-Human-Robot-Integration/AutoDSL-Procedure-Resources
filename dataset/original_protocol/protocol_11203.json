    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n1. Experimental protocol\nSacrifice the mouse using an approved IACUC method. Here, we used cervical dislocation of a mouse anesthetized with 5% isoflurane. Use an appropriate mouse for the study; here, we use an 8-week old FVB mouse\nUsing surgical scissors, make a 3.5-5 mm horizontal incision in the middle of lower abdomen. Next, insert surgical scissors into the small hole created from incision and cut vertically up the center midline to just below the neck of the mouse.\nPull the skin back with fingers and inspect the axillary lymph nodes.\nUsing surgical scissors, make a 3.5 mm lateral incision to open the abdominal cavity, and then cut in the anterior direction up to the bottom of the thorax. Inspect the organs in the abdominal cavity: liver, spleen, kidneys, etc.\nWith the flat of the surgical scissors, or using forceps, move the liver to expose the diaphragm. Inspect the diaphragm for tumor growth or metastases. Then, gently snip the diaphragm on the operator’s right side, allowing it to expand. Gently cut the diaphragm from right to left to expose the thoracic cavity and lungs. Be careful not to cut the lungs.\nCut up through the lateral extreme of the left rib cage (on operator’s right) to inspect the left lobe of the lungs.\nGently move the right lobes of the lung out of the way and cut up the lateral extreme of the right rib cage and remove rib cage.\n\tNOTE: Removal of the rib cage is optional, though removal enables clearer view of later lung inflation.",
    "If fresh or frozen lung tissue is required, use hemostat forceps to clamp the bronchus of the left lobe and resect the left lung using surgical scissors prior to perfusion.\nUsing the forceps to lift the tissue covering the trachea, cut away any excess tissue. Then gently cut the thin tissue lining the trachea to expose the airway.\nCut through the renal artery with surgical scissors.\nTo perfuse the lungs, use a 3 mL syringe with a 22 G needle to inject 1x PBS with 10 U/mL heparin into the right ventricle of the heart. Slowly perfuse the lungs at approximately 300 µL/s with PBS/heparin. The lungs will frequently turn white. 2.5 mL of PBS are generally used in this step.\nFor lung inflation, use a 3 mL syringe with a 22 G needle, this time held parallel to the trachea. Insert the needle into the trachea and inject 10% formalin with rate of flow no greater than ~200 µL/s until the lungs have fully inflated. Once the lungs are inflated, formalin will backflow out of the trachea. Hold the needle in place for a few more seconds and then withdraw.\n\t\n(Optional) Prior to withdrawing needle and lung inflation, use suture thread to tie off the trachea. To achieve this, use 4 inches of suture thread holding the point of the thread with a small pair of forceps. Place the thread on the dorsal side of the trachea and pull through to make a loop around the needle. Next make an overhand knot around the needle. Pull knot tight, remove needle from trachea, close knot.\nUse forceps to lift the heart, insert surgical scissors directly behind the lungs, and cut connective tissue while the lifting the heart to resect lungs.\nCut the heart to remove it from lungs.",
    "Place the lungs a cassette labeled with the mouse ID or study ID. Place the cassette in 10% buffered formalin and fix for 24-48 h. Lungs can be left in fixative for over a year if desired.\nTransfer the cassette containing the lungs to 70% ethanol and proceed to processing for histology.\nSubscription Required.
