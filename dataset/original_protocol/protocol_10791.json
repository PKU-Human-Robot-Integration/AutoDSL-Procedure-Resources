    "1. Isolating Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ASCs) 1, 5\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nIsolate rat perirenal and epididymal adipose and wash with sterile Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as previously described 5. This study has been conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, the implementing Animal Welfare Regulations and in accordance with the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nMince the tissue and transfer 1-2 g into 25 mL of HBSS containing 1% FBS into a 50-mL tube and centrifuge at 500 g for 8 min at room temperature. \nCollect the free-floating adipose tissue layer and transfer to 125-mL Erlenmeyer flask and treat with 25 mL of collagenase type II (200 U/mL) in HBSS for 45 min at 37 °C on an orbital shaker (125 rpm). \nCarefully remove the liquid fraction (below oil and adipose layer) by pipeting and filter it sequentially through a 100- μm and 70- μm nylon mesh filter. Centrifuge the filtrate at 500 g for 10 min at room temperature, aspirate the supernatant, and wash the pellet twice with 25 mL of HBSS.  \nResuspend the cell pellet in 50 mL of growth medium (MesenPRO RS Basal Medium) supplemented with MesenPRO RS Growth Supplement, antibiotic-antimycotic (100 U/mL of penicillin G, 100 μg/mL of streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/mL of amphotericin B), and 2 mM of L-glutamine and pipette cells into two T75 flasks (25 mL/flask).\nCulture the ASC in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37 °C (passage 2-4 ASCs are used for all experiments).\n2. Preparing Chitosan Microspheres (CSMs)\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.",
    "CSMs are prepared by a water-in-oil emulsification process along with an ionic coacervation technique using our previous protocol 5. Emulsify an aqueous solution of chitosan (6 mL of 3%w/v chitosan in 0.5 M of acetic acid) in a 100 mL of an oil phase mixture consisting of soya oil, n-octanol (1:2 v/v) and 5% sorbitan-mono-oleate (span 80) emulsifier, using overhead (1700 rpm) and magnetic stirring (1000 rpm) simultaneously in opposite directions. This dual method of mixing ensures that micelles formed early on before cross-linking occurs can remain in solution and do not to settle to the bottom. Furthermore, the magnetic stir bar aids in de-aggregating chitosan during micelle formation and rigidization. \nStir the mixture continuously stirred for approximately 1 hour until a stable water-in-oil emulsion is obtained. Initiate ionic cross linking with the addition of 1.5 mL of 1% w/v potassium hydroxide in n-octanol every 15 min for 4 h (24 mL total) \nAfter completion of the cross linking reaction, slowly decant the oil phase of the mixture containing CSM and immediately add the 100 mL of acetone, the solution will become cloudy, due to the oil residue. After 5 minutes, decant, add an additional 100 mL of acetone and incubate overnight at room temperature. The next day, re-wash the beads with acetone for five minutes. After performing these serial washes the solution should have turned clear, if not continue washing until all oil is removed and the acetone solution is clear.\nDry the recovered spheres in a vacuum desiccator and analyze without further processing. You can determine the average CSM particle size, surface area per milligram, and the unit cubic volume by using a particle size analyzer.",
    "For subsequent experiments, wash the CSM three times with sterile water to remove residual salts and sterilize by washing overnight with 5 mL of absolute ethanol.\n3. Determining the Number of Free Amino Groups in CSMs\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nDetermine the number of free amino groups present in CSMs after ionic cross linking by using the trinitro benzenesulfonic (TNBS) acid assay of Bubnis and Ofner6. Incubate 5 mg of microspheres with 1 mL of 0.5% TNBS solution in a 50-mL glass tube for 4 h at 40 °C and hydrolyze with the addition of 3 mL of 6N HCl at 60 °C for 2 h.\nCool the samples to room temperature and extract the free TNBS by adding 5 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of ethyl ether. \nWarm a 5-mL aliquot of the aqueous phase to 40 °C in a water bath for 15 min to evaporate any residual ether, cool to room temperature, and dilute with 15 mL of water. \nMeasure the absorbance at 345 nm with a spectrophotometer using TNBS solution without chitosan as blank and the chitosan used for CSM preparation to determine the total number of amino groups. Estimate the number of free amino groups of the CSM relative to chitosan.\n4. Loading ASC in CSM\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nEquilibrate 5 mg of sterilized CSMs from section 2.5 in sterile HBSS overnight and add to an 8- μm pore size membrane culture plate insert (24-well plate). \nAfter the CSMs have settled onto the membrane, carefully aspirate the HBSS and add 300 μL of growth medium to the inside of the insert and 700 μL of growth media to the outside of the insert.",
    "Resuspend ASCs at the appropriate concentration (1 × 104 to 4 × 104) in 200 μL of growth medium and seed over the CSM inside the culture plate insert. The final volume of medium within the culture insert, after seeding, is 500 μL. \nIncubate the ASC seeded on CSMs for 24 h in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\n5. Determining the Percentage of ASC Loading and Cell Viability in CSMs\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nAfter incubation, pipet the ASC-loaded CSM in a sterile 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the cells that have migrated into the insert membrane. \nRemove the residual medium and add 250 μL of fresh growth medium to the tube. \nTo each tube, add 25 μL of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiozole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] solution (5 mg/mL) and incubate for 4 h in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. \nAfter incubation, remove the medium, add 250 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide, and vortex the mixture for 2-5 min to solubilize the formazan complex.\nCentrifuge the CSM at 2700 g for 5 min, pipet off the supernatant and determine its wavelength absorbance at 570 nm and 630 nm using a standard plate reader, according to MTT manufacturer's specifications.\nDetermine the cell number associated with the CSMs relative to the values obtained from defined ASC numbers cultured to develop a standard curve.\n6. Preparation and Characterization of ASC-CSM Embedded in PEG-fibrin Gels\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.",
    "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) fibrin (PEG-fibrin) hydrogel prepared by Suggs et al.7 by dissolving the succinimidyl glutarate modified polyethylene glycol (PEG; 3400 Da) using 4 mL of tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.8) and filter sterilize with a 0.22-μm filter just before starting the experiment. Dissolved PEG is only effective in this application for the first 3-4 hours.\nMix 500 μl of fibrinogen stock (40 mg/mL in TBS, pH 7.8) and 250μl of PEG stock in a culture well of a 6-well plate and incubate for 20 minutes in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. This mixture constitutes a molar concentration ratio of 1:10, SG-PEG-SG: fibrinogen. \nTake 250 μl of ASC-CSM at a concentration of 5 mg of CSM, (≈ 2 × 104 cells) and mix with the PEGylated fibrinogen solution.\nImmediately add 1 ml of thrombin stock (25U/mL) and quickly triturate once or twice with the pipette. After mixing the thrombin with the PEG-fibrinogen, immediately place the cell-gel mixture in a 12-well plate and incubated in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C for 10 min to allow for complete gelation. Since the gelation time is fast, do not try and hold the gel solution within the pipette tip for more than 5 seconds. The PEGylated fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin and forms a PEGylated fibrin hydrogel. As such, the final gel product is referred to as PEG-fibrin.\nWash the PEG-fibrin gels twice with HBSS and incubate with alpha minimal essential media (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\nObserve the migration of cells from CSM into the gel over an 11-day period using standard light microscopy techniques.\n7. Preparation and Characterization of ASC-CSM Embedded in Collagen Gels\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.",
    "Mix ASC-CSM (5 mg containing ≈ 2 × 104 cells) with type 1 collagen (7.5 mg/mL) extracted from rat tail tendons according to the method of Bornstein8 and fibrillate after adjusting the pH to 6.8 using 2N NaOH.\nAdd the fibrillated collagen-ASC-CSM mixture to a 12-well plate and incubate for 30 min in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\nAfter complete fibrillation, incubate the collagen-ASC-CSM gels for up to 11 days in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\nObserve the migration of cells from CSM into the gel over an 11-day period using standard microscopy techniques.\n8. Development of Bilayered PEG-fibrin-(ASC-CSM)-Collagen Gel Constructs\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nTo develop the bilayer construct, prepare both the collagen and the PEG-fibrin gels as described above, with slight modifications. Briefly, to study the migratory and co-induction properties of a single source of stem cells using two bioscaffolds, \"sandwich\" the ASC-CSMs between the collagen and the PEG-fibrin scaffolds by using a four-step process: 1) Load ASC onto CSM, 2) cast fibrillated collagen gel and layer the ASC-CSM beads over the collagen gel, 3) cast PEG-fibrin gel over the ASC-CSM-collagen gel and allow gel to solidify, and 4) add medium to well and insert to study cells in vitro or remove from insert for in vivo applications (see Figure 1). \nPrepare a 1-mL type 1 collagen (7.5 mg/mL) mixture as described above in 7.1, without adding ASC-CSM to the mixture. Place the mixture in a 6-well tissue culture insert (8-μm pore size) and incubate for 30 min in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.",
    "After complete fibrillation, layer over the collagen surface 5 mg of ASC-CSM (10, 000 cells/mg) suspended in culture media (200 μl). After the microspheres have settled over the gel, prepare the PEG-fibrin gel as described in section 6.0, without adding ASC-CSM to the mixture, and layer the PEGylated fibrinogen/thrombin solution over the ASC-CSM- collagen layers. When preparing the PEG-fibrin gel, use 250 μl of cell culture medium in place of the 250 μl of medium containing the cells. \nOnce completed, incubate the constructs for 30 min in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator to achieve complete gelation before feeding the construct with culture medium.\nAfter complete gelation, place 1 mL of medium in the upper chamber over the construct and 3 mL of medium in the lower chamber. \n9. Making Stock Solutions\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nCalcium chloride stock (40 mM): Use only CaCl2.2H2O. Dissolve 588.4 mg of CaCl2.2H2O with 100 ml of deionized water. Sterilize using a 0.22-μm filter.  \nPolyethylene glycol: PEG is highly reactive with oxygen and can become oxidized when exposed to room air. As such, PEG should be stored under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. Accurately weigh 32 mg in a 2-ml centrifuge tube (make sure to purge the tubes with N2 before use) and store at -80 °C until ready for use. Dissolve 32 mg of PEG in 4 mL of TBS solution before use.\n     \nThe following solutions must be made fresh before every experiment.\nTBS solution: (pH 7.75-7.77 at 25 °C; pH at 25 °C is very critical). To prepare 15 ml of TBS solution, carefully dissolve one buffer tablet in filter-sterilized deionized water and adjust to the required pH. Do not store the stock solution—prepare it fresh every time.",
    "Fibrinogen solution: (40 mg/ml). Dissolve fibrinogen powder in TBS to make the fibrinogen concentration 40 mg/ml. Dissolve it overnight using a magnetic stirrer at 4 °C. It is easier to dissolve the entire 1-g quantity with the required amount of TBS. The following day, remove the fibrinogen from 4 °C (usually cloudy) and allow it to warm in a water bath until a homogenous solution is obtained. Finally, filter sterilize the fibrinogen using a 0.45-μm filter.\nThrombin solution (25 Units/ml): To make the thrombin solution, weigh out the required amount and dissolve with the prepared 40 mM CaCl2.2H2O. It's always a good practice to use the entire vial of thrombin to make the stock. Example: Dissolve a bottle of 5 kU thrombin with 200 mM of CaCl2.2H2O, aliquot and store at -20 °C.\n10. Representative Results",
    "The overall goal of the technique presented here is to demonstrate the potential of simultaneous matrix-driven differentiation of ASC into multiple phenotypes using CSM as a delivery vehicle. We demonstrate an in vitro strategy to deliver stem cells from CSMs into a bilayered collagen-PEG-fibrin scaffold. Characterization of ASC embedded within this scaffold revealed that ASC-loaded CSMs can be \"sandwiched\" in between a layer of collagen and PEG-fibrin simultaneously and differentially take cue from both extracellular environments to thrive under their new conditions. We first characterized the ability for the model system to maintain cell viability and migratory capacities. Collagen supported the ability of ASCs to maintain their \"stemness,\" as was demonstrated by their expression of Stro-1 and their fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 2D and 2F). In contrast, PEG-fibrin induced the ASCs to differentiate toward a vascular phenotype, as is demonstrated by their tube-like structure morphology, their endothelial cell-specific expression of von Willebrand factor (Figure 2E and 2G), and pericyte-specific expression of NG2 and platelet-derived growth factor  receptor beta (PDGFRβ) (data not shown). Furthermore, these observed phenotypes appeared to occur early in culture and were maintained over 11 days, as is demonstrated in Figure 3.\nTables and Figures  \nBenefits of Bilayer Construct:\nThe scaffold alone without cells can perform as a bioactive scaffold.\nPEG-fibrin can induce stem cells to differentiate without the addition of growth factors.\nCollagen can assist in maintaining the stem cell phenotype of ASCs.\nA bilayer construct can be used as an active substrate for other cell types to migrate and proliferate (e.g., endothelial cells, fibroblast, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, pericytes).\nIt can be used with hard-tissue engineering scaffolds like hydroxyaptite or demineralized bone to regenerate hard and soft tissue.\nIt can be used to develop a multi-layered, diverse tissue-engineered construct (like dermal-vascular, vascular-epithelial, dermal-vascular-hypodermal, etc.).",
    "It uses a single-cell source to simultaneously develop multicellular compartments.\nIt has the potential to integrate with the host tissue since it is of natural origin.\nCSM within the gel construct provides a platform for cells to migrate from.\nChitosan, used to prepare CSM, is a well-known active chemo-attractant.\nThe overall concept applied in this protocol of \"matrix-driven stem cell differentiation\" may be applied to other stem cells types. However, further investigation is warranted to determine the feasibility of matrix-driven differentiation. The bilayered gel scaffold can act as a reservoir to deliver the cells in a sustained and controlled manner.\nAfter reconstruction, the gels can still be separated into individual components.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3953/3953fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic depicting the overall goal and process of the technique. 1) Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are loaded onto chitosan microspheres. 2) Collagen is then poured into a 6-well insert, the pH adjusted to fibrillate the collagen, and the insert placed into a 6-well plate chamber. The ASC-loaded CSM spheres are then layered over the collagen. 3) The PEGylated fibrinogen is then poured over the collagen (ASC-CSM) and gelled by the addition of thrombin. 4) The final bilayer construct can then be removed from the culture insert and used for in vitro or in vivo analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3953/3953fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Characterization of ASC cultured within collagen and PEG-fibrin 3D matrices. A) Phase-contrast photomicrograph of isolated ASC passaged and maintained using routine 2-dimensional cell culture techniques. Photomicrographs B, D, and F depict ASC-CSM cultured within a 3-dimensional collagen gel; whereas C, E, and G show ASC-CSM cultured within a 3-dimensional PEG-fibrin gel, both at day 12. In B and C), ASCs are shown migrating away from the CSM sphere in both scaffold types. ASCs appear to have a flattened, spindle-like morphology in collagen (B), while maintaining their expression of the stem cell marker Stro-1 (D; arrow). When cultured in PEG-fibrin ASCs exhibit more tube-like structures and are induced to express such vascular cell markers as von Willebrand Factor (E). Transmission electron microscopy depicts the typical morphology demonstrated by ASCs within each scaffold. ASCs in collagen gel appear to have smaller filopodia (fl) extending from the body of the cell (F), whereas ASCs typically formed lumenal (labeled L) structures (G; arrow). \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3953/3953fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The left column depicts ASCs migrating and proliferating within the collagen matrix and appear to take on a spindle-like morphology. The right column depicts ASCs migrating away from the CSMs and forming tube-like structures throughout the PEG-fibrin gel. Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
