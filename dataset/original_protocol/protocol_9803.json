    "1. Preparation of stock microtubule solutions\nCAUTION: Safety goggles, gloves and a lab coat should always be worn throughout the protocol.\nPrepare 5x BRB80 buffer: add 24.19 g of PIPES (piperazine-N,N′-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid]) and 0.38 g of EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis[β-aminoethyl ether]-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) to a 1 L glass bottle. Add 1 mL of 1 M MgCl2 and adjust the pH to 6.9 with KOH. Add deionized water to bring the solution to a 500 mL final volume.\nPrepare 100 mM stock of GTP solution: weigh 52 mg of GTP and suspend in 1 mL of distilled water. Divide 100 mM solution into 20 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare GPEM solution: mix 200 µL of 5x BRB80, 10 µL of 100 mM GTP solution, 100 µL of 100% glycerol, and 600 µL of deionized water. Divide GPEM solution in 100 µL aliquots and store in -20 °C. \nPrepare microtubule solution by reconstituting vials of commercially available, lyophilized tubulin (one vial each of biotinylated, fluorescently labeled, and unlabeled) in cold (4 °C) GPEM solution to a stock concentration of 5 mg/mL.\nPerform microtubule polymerization by mixing 4 µL of biotinylated tubulin, 4 µL of fluorescently labeled tubulin, and 24 µL of unlabeled tubulin (all at 5 mg/mL concentrations) to create a ratio of 1:1:6 at a final volume of 32 mL. Keep it on ice. Divide the tubulin mixture into 2 µL aliquots and store at -80 °C until needed.\n\tNOTE: Efficient polymerization requires that the concentration of tubulin is equal to or above the critical concentration (5 mg/mL)14. Here, selection of the tubulin ratio is optimized for a sufficient concentration biotinylated tubulin to efficiently bind streptavidin and GUVs, as well as a sufficient concentration of fluorescent tubulin for microscopic characterization.\n2. Preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs)\nAgarose film preparation",
    "NOTE: This protocol is adapted from Greene et al.15.\n\t\nPrepare a 1% w/v solution by mixing 1 g of agarose in 100 mL of deionized water in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Use a standard microwave to heat the agarose solution for 1–2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The solution will become translucent once the agarose is completely dissolved. Allow the solution to cool to 65–75 °C before use.\nUse a cut 1,000 µL pipette tip to pipette 300–400 µL of agarose solution onto a 25 mm x 25 mm glass coverslip. While holding the edge of the coverslip with gloved fingers, use another 1,000 µL pipette tip to spread the melted agarose evenly across the coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: Maintaining the agarose at 65–75 °C will allow for efficient spreading on the coverslip surface.\nDry the agarose-coated coverslips in a 37 °C incubator for at least 2 h, at which point the agarose will become transparent. Store the coverslips by placing the agarose coated surface facing upwards on a clean surface such as lint-free paper or wax-based film at room temperature (RT).\nLipid formulation\n\t\nRetrieve lipids dissolved in chloroform from a -20 °C freezer and place them in a chemical fume hood until they reach RT.\nCalculate the volume of lipid stock of each component lipid needed for the formulation using following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60899/60899eq1.jpg\n\t\tWhere: Vlipid is the volume of lipid to use, mol % is the molar percentage of the lipid component, n is the total number of moles of lipid used in the formulation, and M is the concentration of lipid in molar units.",
    "NOTE: For example, if using a formulation containing 45 mol% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) with a stock solution concentration of 12.72 mM, and 1 micromole of total lipids in the formulation, the volume of DOPC stock used in the formulation would be:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60899/60899eq2.jpg\nMix the lipids together at the calculated ratio in a glass vial in the chemical fume hood.\nPipette 30 µL of lipid solution onto the agarose-coated coverslips on a preheated hot plate that is set above the melting point of the saturated lipid component of the formulation (e.g., 50 °C hot plate for a lipid with Tm of 40 °C).\nSpread the solution across the agarose film in a circular motion using the long edge of an 18 G needle to until the chloroform has evaporated and a uniform layer of lipid has formed. Hold the edge of the coverslip with gloved fingers while performing this step.\n\t\tNOTE: Care should be taken not to damage the agarose layer with the needle.\nPlace the coverslip with agarose layer and lipid film in an aluminum foil-covered Petri dish, film side facing upwards, and place the Petri dish in a vacuum desiccator for at least 2 h to remove residual solvent.\nIn the meantime, prepare 560 mM sucrose solution by mixing 1.92 g of sucrose with 10 mL of deionized water.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of the sucrose solution depends on the osmolarity of the buffer GUVs are diluted in. Typically, the osmolarity of the sucrose solution should be no more than 10% larger than the buffer the GUVs will be diluted in, specifically the motility buffer (see step 3.11).\nGUV formation",
    "Adhere an adhesive chamber to the coverslip coated with the lipid film by gently pressing the adhesive chamber onto the lipid-coated coverslip with the lipid film facing upwards, ensuring that a tight seal is formed.\nAdd 400 µL of 560 mM sucrose solution (prepared in step 2.3) to the chamber. \nPlace the coverslip into the humidity chamber and close the lid.\nPlace the humidity chamber on a preheated hot plate set above the melting point of the saturated lipid component of the formulation.\nAllow vesicles to form for ≥1 h before recovery.\n\t\tNOTE: Vesicle formation may be checked with fluorescence microscopy with a 40x air objective lens.\n3. Preparation of motility assay stocks and reagents\nPreparation of casein stock\n\t\nAdd 3 g of dry casein to a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube, then add 30 mL of 1x BRB80 and rotate until the solution becomes viscous. Centrifuge the tube at 15,000 x g for 30 min.\nTransfer the supernatant into another 50 mL conical centrifuge tube and discard the pellet. Filter the solution through a 1 µm syringe filter, collecting the solution in a 50 mL conical vial. Filter the solution through a 0.2 µm filter, collecting the solution in a 50 mL conical vial.\nDetermine the protein concentration by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer and quartz cuvette.\nCalculate the casein concentration in mg/mL using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60899/60899eq3.jpg\nDilute the solution to 20 mg/mL in 1x BRB80, divide into 100 µL aliquots, and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare glucose oxidase (2 mg/mL) stock solution by mixing 2 mg of glucose oxidase with 1 mL of 1x BRB80. Divide into 100 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C.",

Store at RT.\n4. Gliding motility assay (GMA)\nPrepare a flow chamber by affixing two strips of double-sided tape separated by 5 mm onto a glass slide. Repeat this process until three layers of tape comprise each strip.\nPlace a coverslip on top of the tape, then press down gently on the coverslip/tape interface with a tweezer or pen to ensure sufficient adhesion.\n\tNOTE: The channel should be 5 mm in width by 25 mm in length by 300 mm in height.\nPipette 30 µL of 1 mm kinesin solution (prepared in step 3.12) into the flow cell and let it incubate for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: The casein forms a bilayer on the surface of the coverslip/glass slide and facilitates attachment of the kinesin tail to the surface.\nPipette 30 µL of 10 µg/mL microtubule solution (prepared in step 3.13) into the flow cell, using a laboratory wipe pressed gently against the opposite end of the flow channel to facilitate solution exchange. Incubate for 5 min.\nWash the flow cell 1x–3x with 1x motility solution at RT (prepared in step 3.11).  \n\tNOTE: Fluorescence microscopy using a 40x air objective may be used at this point to confirm microtubule attachment and motility.

LNT network characterization\nTransfer the flow chamber to an inverted microscope for imaging.\nChoose the appropriate filter set based on the wavelengths of the fluorescent lipids or tubulin used. For example, when using Texas Red-labeled lipids, use a 560 nm/25 nm excitation filter and 607 nm/36 nm emission filter.\nUse a 100x oil objective to focus on the surface of the coverslip.\nImage the LNT networks using fluorescence microscopy.",
    "NOTE: LNTs are linear structures extruding from the larger vesicles. LNTs much smaller than GUVs and have weaker fluorescence signals. Thus, the exposure and contrast must be adjusted accordingly to image LNTs. These adjustments also lead to overexposure of the GUVs, and thus, it is recommended that the lamellarity and phase separation in GUVs be characterized independently.\nFocus the microscope on a network of interest and take a standard or tiled image.\nAdjust the exposure time and neutral density filters to image the LNTs and minimize saturated exposure of the GUVs. Acquire images both in red and green channels.\n\tNOTE: Here, the red channel permits visualization of the Texas-Red lipids, while the green channel permits visualization of the microtubules (e.g., Oregon Green lipids and HiLyte488 dyes).\nCreate a composite image by overlaying the red and green channels (Figure 1).\nCharacterization of LNT networks by measuring LNT length\n\t\nOpen the acquired images using an image analysis software such as ImageJ.\nCalibrate the scale for the microscope by using the set scale feature, fill in the pixels to the mm conversion factor, and click OK.\n\t\tNOTE: The conversion factor is dependent on the microscope, objective lens, and camera, and it can be obtained using a microscope calibration slide. It is generally expressed in pixels/mm.\nUse the Multipoint line tool to measure the length of the nanotubes starting from the parent GUV. Hold Ctrl +M to measure the length.\nContinue measuring the lengths of individual tubes following the steps above. The image processing tool will save each new measurement in the results window.\nHold Ctrl + D after drawing each line to keep track of which tubes have been measured.\nMeasuring LNT thickness (Figure 2)\n\t\nOpen the image in ImageJ and select the Threshold feature under the Image tab.",
    "Click Apply to apply the threshold.\nDraw a rectangle of known length over the desired tube (black pixels have a value of 0, and red pixels have a value of 255).\nMeasure the integrated density of the area.\nDivide the density by the length (in pixels) of the LNT to obtain the thickness (in pixels).\n\t\tNOTE: The thickness measurements may only be compared across images when the imaging settings and threshold are set identically.\nDetermining the lipid partitioning in nodes of LNTs (Figure 3)\n\t\nOpen the image in ImageJ.\nUse the Line tool to draw a line over the desired node.\nMeasure the node intensity in both the Oregon Green and Texas Red channels.\nMove the line to the LNT and measure the LNT intensity in both the Oregon Green and Texas Red channels.\nSubscription Required.
