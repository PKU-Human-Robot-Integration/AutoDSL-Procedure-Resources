    "All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at American University (protocol # 1606, 19-02).\n1. Animals\nAnimal rearing and maintenance\n\t\nObtain adult wild-type zebrafish (Danio rerio) aged 4–11 months as embryos and rear them in-house.\nMaintain the fish in an aquatic rack system at 28–29 °C on a 14-h light:10-h dark photoperiod.\nFeed the fish twice per day with commercial flakes and supplement with live Artemia.\nChoose fish randomly from these stock tanks for behavioral experiments.\nUpon experiment completion, anesthetize the animals by immersion in 0.02% tricaine for 2 min or until there is a lack of motor coordination and reduced respiration rate for later molecular and/or neurochemical analyses.\n2. Three-chamber choice testing chamber\nNOTE: This behavioral technique was modified from Ruhl et al.20.\nChamber construction\n\t\nModify the behavioral chamber26—a 40 L aquarium (50 x 30 x 30 cm3)— to have a central or starting chamber (10 x 30 x 30 cm3), separated from two side choice chambers (each 20 x 30 x 30 cm3, Figure 1A).\nConstruct the three compartments using an aluminum “U-shaped” channel affixed to the interior glass walls with aquarium sealant, to separate the tank into three chambers.\nConstruct opaque dividers, 10 cm high, out of grey PVC sheet fit into the aluminum channels on either side. Make each divider out of 2 pieces, each equal in size: a stationary bottom piece permanently mounted within the tank and a moveable top piece that moves up and down in the aluminum tracks.\nGlue extra-large binder clips to the top of the grey PVC sheets to act as handles.\nUsing a permanent marker, draw small horizontal lines 10 cm above the adhered grey PVC pipe on the outside of the tank.",
    "NOTE: This mark is the point to which the top grey PVC sheet will be opened to allow access to either side.\nAdd control (system) water to the tank to a level of 25 cm from bottom to top of the tank, or ~ 30 L. Place glass aquarium heaters into each section of the chamber for 24 h prior to testing to bring the temperature to 28.5 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Remove the heaters at the start of the behavior session and perform a full water exchange after two days of use.\nDiscrimination setup\n\t\nFor each discrimination task, individually place colored felt pieces (beige, black, or white) on the outer back, side, and bottom of the choice chambers using Velcro (Figure 1B–D).\n\t\tNOTE: The central chamber should have no background color associated with it.\nAs a reward, create a group of conspecifics (shoal) by placing 4 adult zebrafish, who will not otherwise be used in the study, in a small, clear tank in the far back corner of each choice chamber (Figure 1B–D).\n\tNOTE: Choose shoal fish randomly from stock tanks each day, with at least one male and one female of the same age and size as the experimental fish in each shoal tank.\n3. Behavioral tasks\nAcclimation\n\tNOTE: Acclimation to the behavior chamber consists of three days of training; two days of group acclimation followed by one day of individual training.\nGroup acclimation\n\t\nAttach the beige (neutral) felt background to the outside of both choice compartments, and submerge a live shoal tank in each of the choice compartments (Figure 1B).\nAdd five-six zebrafish to the center starting chamber with both sliding doors open, and allow the fish to roam freely for 30 min.",
    "NOTE: The experimental zebrafish should be able to interact and socialize with these shoal fish through the tank as a reward after crossing into either choice compartment during acclimation. A fish is considered to have entered one of the side chambers when its entire body enters the chamber.\nRepeat this procedure with the same experimental fish for a second day (2 days of group acclimation).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not keep the same groups of fish.\nIndividual acclimation\n\t\nChamber setup: Attach the beige (neutral) felt background to the outside of both choice compartments, and submerge a live shoal tank in both of the choice compartments, as in group acclimation (Figure 1B,E).\n\t\t\nPlace an individual zebrafish in the central starting chamber for 2 min with the sliding doors closed, and after the 2-min period, open both doors simultaneously.\nMake sure that each fish swims from the central chamber through a door for a total of 10 times, regardless of which side. Reward the fish each time it enters one of the side chambers (1 day of individual acclimation).\n\t\t\tNOTE: If a fish is unable to complete this task 10 times within a 30-min period or refuses to leave the starting chamber at all, exclude it from the study.\nData acquisition: Record the number of times the fish swims into either side and the total time it takes to complete the task.\nAcquisition\n\tNOTE: After acclimation, zebrafish began a 3-day acquisition task.\n\t\nChamber setup: Attach a white felt piece to the outside of one choice compartment and a black felt piece to the outside of the other choice compartment (Figure 1C,F).\n\t\tNOTE: Alternate the background color of each side daily using a pseudorandom schedule37.",
    "For the duration of this phase of training, place a shoal-reward only placed in one of the choice compartments; this becomes the rewarded side.\nTo begin acquisition, place a single experimental fish in the starting chamber for a 2-min period with the choice compartments closed off.\nAfter the 2-min acclimation, simultaneously open both doors, giving access to both choice compartments, and start the stopwatch to assess the choice latency.\nUsing a biased design, randomly assign the fish either a black or white preference (i.e., either W+/B- or B+/W-), meaning that the shoal is placed in either the black (B+) or white (W+) choice compartment.\nDenoting the choice response\n\t\t\nOnce the fish makes a choice by entering one of the side compartments, stop the timer.\nIf the fish correctly chooses the preferred side, immediately close the door between the central chamber and that side to restrict the fish to the preferred side for 1 min, and allow it to be rewarded by interacting with the shoal tank (Figure 1C,F). Score this trial as “C” for “Correct” (rewarded).\nIf the fish swims through the incorrect door, transfer it back to the central chamber, close both doors, and score the trial as “I” for “incorrect” (non-rewarded).\nIf the fish does not make a decision within 2 min after the doors are opened, move the fish to the correct side for 1 min, and score the trial as “M” for “marked” (force-rewarded).\nWhen transferring/moving fish back into the starting chamber, gently guide the fish into the central chamber using a fish net as a shepherding tool.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not scoop the fish out of the water and replace it into the starting chamber as this could affect the behavioral assay.",
    "Once the fish returns to the central chamber, wait for 1 min before performing the task again. Ensure that each fish performs the task 8 times.\nData acquisition\n\t\t\nFor each experimental fish, record the time to first decision (or choice latency) and the individual scores (C, I, or M) for each of the 8 acquisition trials (section 3.4.2) in order.\nReport the results for these experiments were reported as group averages for each trial on each acquisition day.\nOnce a fish has completed a trial, categorize it as either a “high performing” fish or a “low performing” fish.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A fish was considered “high performing” if it successful chose the correct side of the tank in at least 6 of the 8 total trials for the day. Any fish that does not meet this criterion is a “low performer”.\nOnce identified, house high performing and low performing fish separately.\nCategorize the fish as “high” or “low” performers on each of the three days of acquisition, after a fish has completed the trials.\n\t\t\tNOTE: At the end of the third day of acquisition, fish remain as either “high” or “low” performers for the duration of the study.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Some fish that were initially in the ‘low performing’ group learn the task on acquisition day 2 or 3. When this happens, the initial ‘low performing’ fish may be moved into the ‘high performing’ group. Do not move the fish between groups in this manner after day 3 (the end of acquisition).\n4. Experimental treatment\nAfter the acquisition period, when the fish demonstrate the ability to solve a simple discrimination task between the black and white background, start the treatment regimen for the experimental zebrafish.\n\tNOTE: To show the applicability of this method, this study shows two experimental designs:\n\t\nLongitudinal study",
    "Return the experimental fish to their holding tanks for 8 weeks. Maintain the fish in standard tanks with daily water changes, and feed them twice daily.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not conduct any behavioral training during these 8 weeks in the holding tanks.\nPerform reversal assessment after this period to assess whether the zebrafish can solve the reversal task after 8 weeks without training.\nHyperglycemia: Expose the experimental groups to water (handling stress control), mannitol (1%–3%, osmotic control), or glucose (1%–3%) for 4 or 8 weeks22,23.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not conduct any behavioral training during these 4 or 8 weeks.\n5. Reversal\nNOTE: Following experimental manipulation (as in section 4.2), the fish are tested in the final part of the 3-chamber choice paradigm—reversal. To do this, the rewarded side is reversed (compared to acquisition) such that fish previously rewarded with a shoal on the white side are now rewarded with a shoal on the black side and vice versa. In this way, reversal assesses whether the fish have learned where the reward (shoal) is located, irrespective of the color of the background.\nChamber setup\n\t\nAttach black felt to the outside of one of the choice chambers and white felt to the outside of the other, making sure that the black and white sides are the same sides as in the acquisition trials (section 3.4).\nSubmerge the shoal tank in the far back corner of the side that is the opposite of the previously rewarded choice chamber (Figure 1D,G).\n\t\tNOTE: In other words, fish previously rewarded on the white side are now rewarded on the black side and vice versa.\nTest the fish individually as in section 3.5. Begin by placing a single experimental fish in the starting chamber for a 2-min period, and close off access to the choice compartments.",
    "Simultaneously open both sides of the chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: Complete a total of 8 trials each day for three consecutive treatment days.\nDenoting the choice response\n\t\nIf the fish correctly chooses the preferred color, immediately close the door to the central chamber for 1 min, allowing the fish to interact with the shoal reward. Score this trial as “C” for “Correct” (rewarded).\nIf the fish swims through the incorrect door, transfer it back into the central chamber, close both doors, and score this trial as “I” for “incorrect” (non-rewarded).\nIf the fish does not make a decision within 2 min after the doors are opened, move the fish to the correct side, and score the trial as “M” for “marked” (force-rewarded).\nData acquisition\n\t\nFor each experimental zebrafish, record the choice latency and the individual scores (C, I, M), in order, for each trial.\nReport the results for these experiments as group averages for each two-trial block on each of the 3 reversal days.\nKeep the data for high and low performing fish separate to determine whether they display the same level of performance during reversal as they did during acquisition.\nSubscription Required.
