    "Porous freeze-dried 3D scaffolds have a high degree of tunability in which to accurately mimic native tissue environments in a simple, cost-effective, and reproducible manner (Curtin et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0007]; Woods et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0052]). Freeze-drying is a process through which a polymer solution is frozen and a vacuum is applied to bring the frozen solution to the critical point at which the solvent sublimates leaving behind an interconnected pore network between compressed polymer strands that become physically cross-linked during the process. Freeze-drying can produce a macroporous scaffold structure with a micrometer-scale porosity, which enables easy cell infiltration into the 3D material (O'Brien, Harley, Yannas, & Gibson, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0033]). This protocol outlines the steps required to produce scaffolds of different stiffness, ECM composition, and topography. If conducted properly, the user will be able to customize and repeatedly produce biomimetic scaffolds with specific physicochemical properties for use in a wide range of CNS applications.\nThis protocol describes the manufacture of 3 mg/ml (∼900 Pa) and 10 mg/ml (∼3650 Pa) HyA solutions to manufacture scaffolds of different stiffness (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0002]). The procedure can be easily adapted to produce scaffolds of differing matrix composition and stiffness and allows the user to tailor specific extracellular conditions for their cell of study.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/57798460-01b4-4e82-bfc6-911393cc1b88/cpz1688-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nTimeline of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-prot-0001], which describes the manufacture of hyaluronic acid (HyA) gels of differing concentrations before undergoing cross-linking and dialysis. Desired extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are added to the HyA slurry before freeze-drying and further cross-linking/sterilization.\nMaterials\nHyA sodium salt, 1.6 to 1.8 MDa (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 53747-10G)\n1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC; e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Personal protective equipment (PPE), including safety glasses and reagent-impermeable protective gloves, should be worn and regularly exchanged when handling reagents.\nManufacture hyaluronic acid solutions\n1. Remove stock HyA sodium salt from −20°C storage, and allow to equilibrate to room temperature (RT; ie, ∼22°C) to reduce buildup of moisture inside the container.\n2. Calculate amount of HyA salt required to produce 3 and 10 mg/ml solutions in deionized, distilled water (dH2O) for the desired volume.\nFor example, to produce 100 ml of 3 mg/ml solution, dissolve 300 mg HyA sodium salt in 100 ml dH2O.\n3. Pipet desired volume of dH2O into a clean glass beaker, and place on a stir plate with a magnetic stir bar.",
    "4. Weigh out calculated amount of HyA sodium salt using a scale to two-decimal-point accuracy, and slowly add salt to the dH2O while stirring. Stir for 1 hr at RT, and check that HyA has dissolved into a uniform, viscous solution. If not fully dissolved, continue to stir, and check intermittently until there are no observable coagulations of HyA within the solution.\nIt is advisable to add the HyA salt in small amounts, allowing it to dissolve before adding more. Adding all the measured HyA salt at once can result in coagulation of the HyA and lead to longer stir periods. Additionally, higher concentrations may become more viscous in a short period, so it is important to add small quantities of HyA gradually. Finally, higher concentrations of HyA can produce highly viscous solutions that may hamper stirring. In this case, additional mechanical stirring can assist.\n5. Once HyA solutions are fully mixed, weigh out cross-linker reagents (0.8 g EDAC per 100 ml solution and 9.16 g adipic acid multiplied by mg HyA). Starting with EDAC, sequentially and gradually add both cross-linkers to the continuously stirring HyA solution. Add both cross-linking reagents gradually to prevent coagulation, and leave to stir until fully dissolved (overnight, RT).\nBoth cross-linkers are added in excess and are calculated as follows: EDAC = 0.8 g × total mg HyA in solution; adipic acid = 9.16 g × total mg HyA in solution (Luo, Kirker, & Prestwich, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0027]; Woods et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0052]).\nFor example, when cross-linking 100 ml of 3 mg/ml HyA (300 mg HyA total), the amount of EDAC is 0.8 × 300 mg and of adipic acid is 9.16 × 300 mg.",
    "6. The next day (once cross-linking reagents are fully dissolved), prepare a fume hood with a magnetic stir plate and pH meter, and don appropriate PPE (gloves, goggles, laboratory coat). Transfer cross-linked HyA solution to fume hood and resume stirring.\n7. Prepare 100 ml of 1 M HCl in dH2O, and ensure solution is uniformly mixed.\n8. With calibrated pH probe inserted into the slurry, use a 1-ml pipette to slowly add 1 M HCl drop-wise to reduce pH of HyA solutions to 4 to initiate the cross-linkage reaction. Once achieved, place solution at 4°C for 18 hr overnight to allow further cross-linking to occur while ensuring slurry stability.\nHigher concentrations of HCl can be used but can lead to rapid fluctuations in the pH of the solution resulting in the need to raise the pH using 1 M NaOH. Such a process can change the volume and may impact the final concentration of the HyA solution. Furthermore, it is important to ensure the pH is uniform throughout the HyA solution. For viscous HyA solutions such as 10 mg/ml, it is suggested to wait a few minutes after each drop of HCl to allow a uniform change in pH of the slurry.\n9. After the 18-hour incubation period, return slurry to the fume hood, and prepare 1 M NaOH in dH2O, ensuring a uniform solution.\n10. With a calibrated pH meter and constant monitoring, use a 1-ml pipette to add 1 M NaOH drop-wise to slowly increase the pH of the stirring HyA solution to a final pH of 7.4 and in so doing halt the cross-linking reaction.",
    "11. Prepare dialysis tubing to wash excess cross-linking reagents from the HyA solution. First, cut strips ∼30 cm in length, and incubate 5 min in stirring dH2O heated to 37°C to loosen and open the tubing. Fold one end over on itself, and clamp closed using a dialysis peg. Add each HyA solution to the open end of the dialysis tubing using a 5-ml pipette, and clamp tube opening closed with a second dialysis peg.\nPipetting viscous solutions predialysis can be challenging. The use of a wide-bore pipette tip or a 5-ml pipette can accelerate this process. Additionally, more viscous solutions can be harder to fully purge from the pipette, so avoid excessive changing of pipettes to prevent loss of material.\n12. Prepare dialysis bath of 100 mM NaCl in a 5-L beaker with constant stirring on a magnetic stir plate. Ensure NaCl is fully dissolved and the final volume is large enough to cover the dialysis tubing before adding the loaded dialysis tubes. Leave dialysis bath to stir 24 hr at RT. Discard old bath, and change to a fresh bath of the same NaCl concentration. Incubate again 24 hr at RT.\n13. Prepare sufficient 20% ethanol in dH2O from a 100% ethanol stock to cover the slurry-filled dialysis tubing. Discard NaCl solution from dialysis bath, and rinse briefly in dH2O to remove excess adipic acid. Incubate dialysis tubes in 20% ethanol 24 hr at RT.\n14. Discard 20% ethanol, and replace with an equal volume dH2O. Leave to stir 24 hr at RT. Repeat step twice (two dH2O bath exchanges) to complete dialysis process.",
    "15. Remove HyA-loaded dialysis tubing from dialysis bath, and prepare a 100-ml glass beaker for storage. Carefully, remove dialysis peg from one end, and transfer HyA solution from the tubing to the beaker. Cover in foil or cling film, and store at 4°C.\nDialyzed HyA slurry can be stored at 4°C for up to 4 weeks.\nManufacture porous hyaluronic acid scaffolds\nTo manufacture scaffolds with a unidirectionally aligned freeze-dried pore structure, set the shelf of a freeze drier to −40°C before preparing scaffolds to allow adequate time for the shelf to freeze. To manufacture scaffolds without unidirectional pore structure, keep the shelf at RT.\n16. Remove dialyzed HyA slurry from storage, and allow to equilibrate to RT. Determine number of scaffolds required and volume of slurry needed. Add aqueous stock ECM solutions of interest alone or in combination directly into the aliquoted slurry to achieve the final desired concentration (0.1 mg/ml). Ensure pipetted ECM solution is fully purged from the pipette, and rinse pipette several times by pipetting up and down in the HyA solution.\nSmaller volumes reduce costs when functionalizing with ECM components.\nThe ECM proteins can be incorporated at different concentrations depending on the desired effect and type of protein. In this protocol, we describe functionalization with ECM proteins collagen IV and fibronectin, both to 0.1 mg/ml, but further optimization of concentrations may be required for other proteins or to suit specific cell types.\n17. To ensure complete mixing, use a 10-ml syringe with 18-G, 1.5-in. needle to take up HyA-ECM slurry, and thoroughly mix solution by passing through the needle several times (∼30 cycles to ensure complete dispersion of ECM proteins throughout the HyA slurry).",
    "18. Use a freeze dryer to degas HyA solution (with and without additional ECM functionalization) by placing solution on freeze dryer shelf and applying pressure to <4000 mTorr until bubbling in the solution is no longer observed.\nHigher-concentration HyA solutions degas slower, and additional time may be needed to fully liberate all air bubbles.\n19. Assemble freeze-drying molds with a stainless-steel base and PTFE mold with cylindrical holes (6-mm height × 6-mm diameter), and clamp down with a steel frame so solutions cannot leak once loaded (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0003]).\nPTFE molds can be fabricated by cutting sheets to size, drilling holes of set diameters, and smoothing the inside bores of the holes. In this protocol, mold holes of 6 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height were each used to hold a total of 250 μl HyA solution. However, the dimensions of these molds can be fabricated to match the user's desired specifications to fabricate scaffolds of different diameters and heights. Although we describe one setup, mold fabrication is relatively inexpensive and straightforward with the key requirement being that the PTFE mold must be clamped tightly to the flat stainless steel plate to facilitate rapid freezing and avoid slurry leakage.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5ec27b04-2881-4619-b48e-e83058b24f15/cpz1688-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Scaffold mold design and comparison of freeze-drying approaches. (A) The design and assembly of the scaffold freeze-drying mold are shown and should be assembled before loading with the hyaluronic acid (HyA) slurry. (B) The protocol for manufacturing scaffolds with unaligned pore architectures is demonstrated. (C) The protocol for snap-freezing scaffolds is performed using an indirect snap-freezing technique. The bottom metal plate is placed in contact with liquid nitrogen, snap-freezing the HyA slurry in a unidirectional manner inside the insulated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) molds. The molds are then immediately transferred to a precooled −4°C freeze-dryer shelf to produce the aligned scaffolds.\n20. Calculate volume required per mold, and slowly pipette desired amount of HyA solution into each well by placing the pipette tip close to the bottom of each well and slowly withdrawing the pipette as the well fills to reduce bubble formation. Remove any bubbles inadvertently created during this process by using a fine needle and syringe (e.g., 18-G × 1.5-in. needle).\nNonaligned scaffold manufacture\n21a. To manufacture scaffolds without a unidirectionally aligned architecture, load mold directly onto the freeze dryer shelf that has been kept at RT, and run program described in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0004] for 25 hr at 200 mTorr throughout. Proceed to step 24.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c558e88c-48cd-448b-ade9-a23945c51a33/cpz1688-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nFreeze dryer cycle parameters. The graph depicts the freeze dryer cycle parameters for unidirectionally aligned (prefreeze-dry protocol) and unaligned (normal freeze-dry protocol) 3D structures.\nUnidirectionally aligned scaffold manufacture\n21b. If a consistent porous longitudinally aligned internal scaffold architecture is required (e.g., to study process outgrowth), first prepare a well-insulated liquid N2 container with a flat bottom, and place a stainless steel sheet of similar size to the scaffold mold in the bottom of the container to indirectly snap freeze the scaffold mold.",
    "22b. Using appropriate PPE, carefully fill container with liquid N2 so the conducting baseplate is fully immersed. Gently place filled mold apparatus on top of the baseplate to facilitate rapid metal-to-metal cooling and snap freezing of the ECM-filled wells (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0003]). Allow molds to incubate for 1 min.\nCAUTION: Don the appropriate cryoprotective PPE (aprons, face shield, gloves) before using liquid N2.\nThe bottom plate of the scaffold mold should only be in contact with the liquid N2, and through conduction the HyA solution will rapidly freeze within the insulated PTFE molds in a unidirectional manner through rapid but aligned ice crystal formation.\n23b. Immediately load snap-frozen HyA-loaded scaffold molds onto a prefrozen freeze dryer shelf set to −40°C, and run prefreeze program outlined in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0004] over 25 hr at 200 mTorr to complete scaffold formation. Proceed to step 24.\nProcessing of scaffolds post freeze-dryin\n24. Once freeze-drying cycle is completed (regardless of aligned or unaligned manufacture approach used), remove mold from the freeze dryer. Uncouple baseplate from the scaffold-containing Teflon plate, and gently remove each formed scaffold from the mold using fine forceps.\n25a. For dry scaffold characterization, immediately place scaffolds in a 24-well tissue culture plate at 4°C (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8fc8d77e-2e0a-411c-9c7e-0bb4d1e56d3f/cpz1688-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nOutline of scaffold characterization techniques. Following freeze-drying, scaffolds can be processed for characterization as either hydrated and cross-linked scaffolds or as dry scaffolds. Hydrated and cross-linked scaffolds are used for the characterization of scaffold mechanical properties, matrix composition, and pore size. Dry scaffolds are used for the characterization of scaffold porosity, pore alignment, and swelling ratio.",
    "25b. For hydrated and cross-linked scaffold characterization or to prepare scaffolds for cell culture applications (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0005]), place each scaffold individually into a 24-well tissue culture plate, and immediately rehydrate scaffolds in 100% ethanol (1 hr, RT, 1 ml per scaffold), 90% ethanol (1 hr, RT, 1 ml per scaffold), and then 70% ethanol (overnight, 4°C).\n26. In a sterile environment (e.g., laminar flow hood), prepare cross-linking solution containing 14 mM EDAC (2.68 mg/ml) and 5.5 mM NHS (0.63 mg/ml) in 70% ethanol, sequentially adding reagents and allowing each to dissolve. Filter sterilize using a 0.2-µm pore filter. Incubate each scaffold in 1 ml cross-linking solution for 2 hr at RT in a fresh culture plate in a sterile environment.\nIn this step, the hydrated scaffolds undergo a further cross-linking step to ensure that the added ECM molecules are cross-linked within the HyA scaffold structure.\nHereafter, all steps should be conducted in a sterile environment to ensure no bacterial contamination.\n27. Remove scaffolds from cross-linking solutions using fine forceps, and wash scaffolds in sterile PBS three times before storing at 4°C. Dispose cross-linking reagents in appropriate chlorinated waste disposal facilities.\nScaffolds can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks before cell culture, but it is advised to use scaffolds as soon as possible to avoid ECM degradation.",
    "A key advantage of freeze-dried scaffolds is the ability to easily tune physicochemical properties for specific applications (Woods et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0052]). It is essential to fully characterize the produced scaffolds before embarking on a series of experiments to monitor any batch-to-batch variance and clearly understand the impact the surrounding physical environment may play on resultant cell behavior. Here we outline several procedures that can be used to characterize scaffold physicochemical properties such as porosity, pore size, mechanical properties, swelling ratio, microarchitecture, and ECM functionalization. These steps generate data for several key physicochemical properties that may affect cell behavior. Depending on the desired characterization approach, one scaffold sample can be used for multiple characterization techniques (e.g., serial sectioning to analyze both pore size and ECM functionalization). Batch-to-batch variability can be minimized by accurately determining the pH of the scaffolds during cross-linkage and consistently performing the cross-linking protocol in terms of materials used and timing.\nThe procedures required to characterize the physicochemical properties of produced porous freeze-dried HyA scaffolds are outlined in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0005]. Previously reported characterization data can be found in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-tbl-0001] as reported by Woods et al.

    "NOTE: To save on materials, the scaffold porosity and swelling ratio can be calculated from the same scaffold samples by first performing the scaffold porosity measurements before hydrating the scaffolds for swelling ratio analysis.\nScaffold porosity\nPorosity is a critical property in tissue engineering applications and provides a percentage metric of the matrix to free space in a scaffold. The greater the porosity, the easier it is for cells to infiltrate and for nutrient diffusion to occur (see Loh & Choong, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0026]). Many scaffolds are designed to be porous, but freeze-dried tissue scaffolds in particular have high levels of porosity (typically >90%) while maintaining structural integrity, providing optimal diffusion both in vitro and in vivo (Curtin et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0007]; O'Brien et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0033]; Ryan et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0038]). Steps 1 through 3 describe how to calculate the porosity of freeze-dried scaffolds.\n1. Using fine forceps, place each individual dry scaffold in a clean weigh boat, and using digital Vernier calipers measure height and diameter of the scaffold, taking care not to crush the structure. Divide scaffold diameter by two to record the scaffold radius. Record values in millimeters for each respective scaffold, taking note of which values correspond to which scaffold.\n2. Using fine forceps, transfer scaffolds to a balance and weigh, recording the mass of each respective scaffold in milligrams to three decimal places.\n3. Using the following formulas, calculate porosity of the scaffolds:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\rm Volume \\rm = {\\rm{\\ }} \\rm \\pi {\\rm{\\ }} \\times {\\left( {\\rm radius} \\right)}^2{\\rm{\\ }} \\rm \\times \\rm height \\end{equation*}$$\nformula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\rm Porosity \\rm = {\\rm{\\ }}1{\\rm{\\ }} - {\\rm{\\ }}\\frac{{{\\rm P}_{\\rm scaffold}}}{{{\\rm P}_{\\rm material}}} \\end{equation*}$$",
    "where Pscaffold is the mass divided by the volume and Pmaterial is 1.8 ± 0.1 g/cm3 (i.e., density of HyA). To calculate the results as percent porosity, multiply the final values by 100.\nScaffold swelling ratio\nThe scaffold swelling ratio determines the ability of the material to absorb and retain water and affects the mechanical properties of scaffolds following rehydration (Raftery et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0037]). Steps 4 through 7 describe how to characterize the swelling ratio of dry scaffolds in a simple and effective manner.\n4. Following freeze-drying, immediately transfer dry scaffolds to individual wells of a 24-well culture plate, labeling each well before weighing each dry scaffold to record the respective scaffold's dry weight to three decimal places.\n5. Immerse each scaffold in 1 ml PBS for 24 hr at RT. Ensure buffer fully immerses the scaffold.\n6. Following incubation, using fine forceps gently blot individual scaffolds with filter paper to remove excess liquid before weighing again to record the respective wet weight of each scaffold.\n7. Use the following formula to calculate swelling ratio:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\rm Swelling{\\rm{\\ }} \\rm ratio = {\\rm{\\ }}\\frac{{\\rm \\left ( {\\rm wet{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm weight - dry{\\rm{\\ }} \\rm weigth} \\right)}}{{dry{\\rm{\\ }}weight}}. \\end{equation*}$$\nScaffold pore size\nScaffold pore size can significantly influence cell attachment, infiltration, and distribution within 3D scaffold environments. Characterization of pore size and distribution can offer insight into the structural layout and architecture in microscale detail.\n8. Transfer individual hydrated and cross-linked scaffolds into a clean 24-well cell culture plate, and place plate in fume hood for fixation.\n9. Fix each HyA scaffold in 1 ml of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at RT for 20 min.\n10. Gently remove 4% paraformaldehyde, and wash scaffolds with 1 ml PBS three times for 5 min per wash.",
    "11. Prepare scaffolds for cryoembedding by immersing in successive and increasing concentrations of sucrose solutions: 1 ml of 10% (w/v) sucrose in PBS for 1 hr at RT; 1 ml of 20% (w/v) sucrose in PBS for 1 hr at RT; and then 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C to ensure complete infiltration.\n12. The next day, create a 50:50 solution of 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS with OCT, and incubate each scaffold in 1 ml solution for 24 hr at 4°C.\n13. To cut on the cryostat, set cryostat internal temperature to −20°C, and adjust slice thickness to 10 μm. Create an OCT platform by placing a small amount of OCT on the chuck and allowing it to freeze. Next, gently place each scaffold on the OCT platform, and allow scaffold to freeze in place. Ensure scaffold is oriented appropriately to produce the desired transverse or longitudinal cut sections. Cover scaffold completely in OCT, and allow it to freeze.\nIn this protocol, we recommend using longitudinally cut sections for pore size analysis.\n14. Collect cut sections from the mounted scaffold, and ensure uniform slices are produced. Immediately mount cut sections onto charged Superfrost slides, and allow sections to dry at RT or on a drying table.\nWe recommend using a fine brush to flatten if needed and collecting the section as it comes off the blade by using a light-bristled brush.\nSeveral sections can be collected per slide. Ensure that sufficient labeling is used on slides to denote which scaffold and which representative region of the scaffold the section came from (i.e., front, center, back).",
    "15. Incubate dried slide-mounted sections in 10 mg/ml toluidine blue in dH2O for 5 min at RT. Then wash three times with dH2O (10 to 20 s per wash) before placing droplets of DPX mounting solution on each scaffold section and mounting with standard slide coverslips.\nThis will stain the HyA-ECM matrix and outline the pore architecture.\n16. Image scaffold sections using a bright-field microscope at 10× magnification, taking at least three images of chosen representative regions of each section to acquire enough data to sufficiently represent the average scaffold pore size throughout the section.\n17. Use ImageJ to measure pore size via manual tracing of the pore perimeters to analyze pore Feret diameter (the widest measure of pore diameter) and pore area, giving values for scaffold pore size.\nScaffold mechanical properties\nThe mechanical properties of the extracellular environment surrounding cells can directly influence neuronal and glial phenotypes, as well as the differentiation and maturation of neural cells (Moshayedi et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0030]; Placone et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0035]; Teixeira et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0047]). To characterize scaffold mechanical properties, uniaxial mechanical testing (Zwick/Roell tensile testing machine) is the preferred approach and is performed with a 5-N load cell attachment for the machine.\n18. Ensure appropriate safety guards are in place in the tensile testing machine before mounting the load cell. Once mounted, load software and prepare for operation.\nMechanical testing units may require different protocols to set up and prepare. Be sure to follow the preferred protocol recommended by the manufacturer.\n19. Using a pair of fine forceps, transfer scaffold onto dry filter paper, and gently blot excess PBS. Using Vernier calipers, measure height and diameter of hydrated scaffold, and record for each scaffold.",
    "20. Mount scaffold on the testing stage of the uniaxial mechanical testing machine so that the flat surface of the scaffold is in contact with the stage, and slowly immerse sample in PBS so that it is fully submerged.\nCare should be taken to avoid disturbing the scaffold when submerging with PBS. The top of the mechanical tester can be lowered to “pinch” the scaffold lightly in place.\n21. Input scaffold dimensions into the mechanical testing software, and apply a strain rate until failure.\n22. Use Young's modulus (Pa/N/m²) to calculate stiffness of each scaffold using the slope of the stress-strain curve from the values produced at two defined points that occur before failure (i.e., 1% to 10%) with the corresponding values in Newtons and strain in percentage. Calculate slope using the following formula to give stiffness values in Pascals for each scaffold:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\rm Slope = {\\rm{\\ }}\\frac{{\\rm \\left( {\\rm 10{\\rm{\\% \\ }}\\rm stress - 1{\\rm{\\% \\ }}\\rm stress} \\right)}}{{\\rm \\left( {\\rm 10{\\rm{\\% \\ }}\\rm strain - 1{\\rm{\\% \\ }}\\rm strain} \\right)}}. \\end{equation*}$$\nScaffold extracellular matrix functionalization\nHere two approaches are described to characterize the addition of ECM proteins into the scaffolds: (1) BCA analysis and (2) immunofluorescence.\nNonspecific extracellular matrix proteins via bicinchoninic acid assay\n23. Prepare 25 ml of 3 M NaOH in PBS.\n24. Transfer dry and hydrated scaffolds that contain only HyA (control) or ECM functionalized scaffolds into separately labeled microcentrifuge tubes containing 500 μl of 3 M NaOH.\n25. Incubate overnight at 4°C, allowing scaffold structure to fully dissolve in the solution.\nShould the scaffolds not dissolve fully, mechanical dissociation via a clean, sterile homogenizer may be used to accelerate the process. Ensure the homogenizer is clean before switching to a separate sample. Additionally, vigorous vortexing can accelerate the dissociation process.",
    "26. Once fully dissolved, measure protein content of the scaffolds via a colorimetric BCA assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. First, calculate number of wells required to run the samples and the desired standard curve in duplicate ([number of scaffolds + number of wells required for desired standard curve] × 2).\n27. Create working reagent (from BCA kit) by diluting reagent B in reagent A 1:50, ensuring the end volume supplies 200 μl/sample. Ensure working reagent is thoroughly mixed and yields a clear, green solution.\nThe working reagent is stable for several days at RT.\n28. Prepare BSA standard curve solution, diluting across a range of 0 to 2000 μg/ml protein standards in 3 M NaOH, where the blank solution of 0 is 3 M NaOH.\nDuring dilution of the standard curve, change the pipette tip and ensure adequate vortexing at each step to avoid contamination of standards and to ensure uniform dispersion of the BSA.\n29. Pipette 25 μl of each standard or sample in duplicate into each well of a clear 96-well assay plate. Ensure adequate mixing of the sample before pipetting to achieve uniform dispersion of the scaffold protein in the solution.\n30. Add 200 μl working reagent to each sample or standard, and mix plate thoroughly on a plate shaker for 30 s. Cover plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\n31. Following incubation, measure absorbance at 562 nm on a plate reader.\n32. To calculate results, subtract the average values of the blank standard replicates from the average values of the respective standards and unknown samples.\n33. Prepare a standard curve by plotting the blank-corrected standard curve measurements vs the known concentration in μg/ml. Use the standard curve to determine the protein concentration of each unknown sample.",
    "34. Compare values of the non-ECM and ECM-functionalized scaffolds to detect the difference in protein content, ensuring the added ECM is present.\nExtracellular matrix functionalization via immunostaining\n35. To characterize the presence and dispersion of specific ECM proteins throughout the scaffold structure via immunostaining, prepare scaffold cryosections of 10- to 50-μm thickness as per steps 8 to 17 (scaffold pore size analysis).\n36. Using a hydrophobic pen, circle each scaffold section on the slide to help retain the solutions during incubations.\n37. Prepare a working solution of 100 ml of 2.5% (w/v) BSA blocking solution (i.e., 2.5 g in 100 ml PBS), and apply to scaffold cryosections for 2 hr at RT to block nonspecific binding.\nThe volume range of applied solutions per slide is typically 500 to 1000 µl depending on the size of the hydrophobic ring surrounding the samples. At all times, ensure the sample is covered in enough solution so that evaporation and drying do not occur.\n38. Prepare primary antibody solutions for the desired ECM to be detected by diluting in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n39. Gently remove blocking solution by slowly dabbing the slide at a perpendicular angle on dry tissue. Perform a wash step by adding PBS for 5 min at RT to each sample before removing the solution by dabbing again. Perform this wash step three times.\n40. Incubate cryosections in the desired volume of primary antibody solution, and incubate overnight at 4°C. Store slides flat in a humid container with water to prevent evaporation during incubation.\n41. Prepare appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies that match the incubated primary antibody species by diluting at a concentration recommended by the manufacturer in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS.",
    "Although the antibodies presented in the Materials list have been validated for this application, it is recommended that each candidate antibody to be used is first trialed and optimized for concentration and immunostaining specificity. For our work 1% (w/v) BSA eliminated most nonspecific background staining when using fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies. The outlined secondary antibody wavelengths successfully worked for this application, but other wavelengths may require additional optimization.\n42. Wash cryosection slides as described in step 39, and then apply the secondary antibody solution. Incubate at RT for 2 hr in a humidified chamber.\n43. Perform a wash step as described in step 39.\n44. Cover each scaffold cryosection slice in a 50-μl droplet of mounting medium. Immediately and gently place a coverslip across all samples on the slide. Store slides at 4°C in the dark, or image immediately.\n45. To image stained ECM proteins, use a fluorescent microscope to detect immunostained ECM proteins within the scaffold cryosections.\nUniform distribution of the ECM proteins should be observed throughout the scaffold slices.\nIt is recommended to prepare primary and secondary antibody negative control samples to eliminate background/nonspecific binding and to ensure specific binding is achieved.\nScaffold microarchitecture via scanning electron microscopy\nSEM allows for a high-power, qualitative analysis of pore structure, matrix distribution, alignment, and fine morphological features of both the longitudinal and transverse features of the scaffolds (Hibbitts et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0012]; Ryan et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0038]).\n46. Following freeze-drying, immediately transfer dry scaffolds to labeled containers. Do not rehydrate scaffolds as samples must be dry for SEM analysis (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0005]).",
    "47. To prepare scaffolds for SEM imaging, transversely or longitudinally cut a scaffold using a fresh, single-backed blade in a single smooth movement or using a commercially available tissue chopper to produce a clean-cut surface. Alternatively, orient scaffold sample so that the tissue chopper cuts the scaffold longitudinally.\nFor a more cost-effective approach, a fresh scalpel blade may be used to section the scaffolds.\n48. Prepare SEM stubs by placing double-sided carbon tape on the chuck.\n49. Gently transfer cut scaffold sections using fine forceps onto the adhesive carbon tape stubs so that the exposed cut face of the scaffold points directly upward.\n50. Carefully transfer the scaffold-loaded SEM stubs to a sputter coater, and run the recommended program for biological samples to evenly coat the samples with gold or palladium to enhance electron flow through the samples for SEM imaging.\n51. Mount scaffolds in scanning electron microscope, and image at a range of desired magnifications to observe the transverse and longitudinal pore architecture of the different scaffold samples.",
    "Once HyA scaffolds of desirable stiffness and matrix composition have been manufactured, cross-linked, and sterilized, they can then be directly seeded with cells. Neuronal lines (e.g., SH-SY5Y cells in this protocol) are advantageous for the optimization of seeding properties, migration, and colonization period and are useful to study the interactions of neurons within 3D environments owing to their relative homogeneity and ability to acquire high cell numbers (Dominguez-Alfaro et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0008]).\nThe approaches outlined below can be used to study the metabolic, cytotoxic, proliferative, and morphologic responses of neurons to their surrounding microenvironment. Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-fig-0006] demonstrates an experimental outline and timeline of when to perform each assay across a 21-day experimental period.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8306640d-015a-4233-91d1-565644f46b1f/cpz1688-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nExample of an experimental setup and timeline to maximize the results from Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-prot-0003]. (A) A cell culture plan to maximize outputs from an experiment using scaffold models to study neuronal responses. Collection of supernatant for cytotoxicity analysis and metabolic assays can be performed on all scaffolds at desired time points as they are nondestructive.

    "Seed and culture neurons in scaffolds\n1. In 175-cm2 flasks, culture SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma-derived cells to the desired population size for seeding into scaffolds via expansion in SH-SY5Y growth medium.\nOnce the cells become 80% to 90% confluent, they are ready to be passaged and seeded into scaffolds or replated in 175-cm2 flasks and allowed to reach confluency for further experiments. For experimental consistency, it is recommended to use SH-SY5Y cells at the same passage number and never more than passage 15 for neuronal applications.\n2. To prepare sterile scaffolds for cell seeding, remove excess PBS, and incubate in 1 ml SH-SY5Y growth medium per scaffold at 37°C for 60 min to completely infiltrate scaffolds with medium.\n3. Discard excess medium from confluent SH-SY5Y flasks, and wash flask with 10 ml PBS. Immediately discard PBS to remove excess cellular debris.\n4. Immediately incubate cells in 10 ml trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37°C to detach cells from the flask.\n5. Following incubation, confirm most cells have dislodged from the flask using an inverted microscope, and collect cell suspension under sterile conditions into a 50-ml conical tube. Add 10 ml SH-SY5Y growth medium to neutralize trypsin. Mix gently and then centrifuge cells 5 min at 200 × g, RT, to form a pellet.\n6. Once centrifuged, carefully discard cell supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Gently resuspend cells by adding 5 ml SH-SY5Y growth medium and pipetting up and down 8 to 12 times (until a uniform cell suspension is achieved). Load 20 µl concentrated cell solution into a hemocytometer according to the manufacturer's specifications, and count total number of cells.\nTo ensure full colonization of the scaffold structures, it is recommended that each scaffold is seeded with at least 1 × 106 cells.",
    "Because cell lines typically yield high numbers from harvesting, it is recommended to dilute the cell stock solution to ensure accurate counting can be achieved.\n7. When ready for seeding, transfer medium-soaked scaffolds into individual fresh wells of a 24-well suspension culture plate, which prevents cells from attaching to the plastic. Remove excess liquid from wells so that only the scaffold contains medium.\n8. Dilute cell stock to 5 × 105 cells per 20 to 50 µl (i.e., roughly a droplet) to ensure most cell solution is absorbed into the scaffold. Carefully seed one side of the exposed scaffold with a cell droplet, and allow cells to adhere for 30 min at 37°C.\n9. Gently flip each scaffold using sterile forceps so that the other side is exposed. Repeat cell seeding and incubating as described in step 8, and then flood each well with 1 ml SH-SY5Y growth medium. Incubate overnight at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.\n10. Transfer each scaffold to a fresh well in a new 24-well suspension plate with 1 ml SH-SY5Y growth medium.\nThis step is essential to eliminate any cells not attached to the scaffold from further analysis.\n11. Discard all medium, and wash with PBS. Replace PBS with SH-SY5Y neuronal differentiation medium to promote differentiation of a neuronal phenotype. Replace 50% of the medium every 2 to 3 days for the desired culture period.\nThroughout the culture period, cell supernatant can be collected into labeled microcentrifuge tubes and stored at −20°C for analysis of metabolism (steps 14 to 19) or cytotoxicity (steps 29 to 36).\n12. When the experiment has reached its end point, remove and store all medium at −20°C for further analysis. Wash scaffolds in 1 ml PBS.",
    "13. Fix scaffolds with 1 ml of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at RT. Discard paraformaldehyde and then wash three times in 1 ml PBS, 5 min per wash, at RT. Store fixed scaffold samples at 4°C until ready for analysis.\nAssess cell viability of neurons in scaffolds\nAlamar blue assays offer a noninvasive and nondestructive assay for the measurement of cell metabolic activity. In the fluorometric dye, the active component resazurin is reduced to resorufin when in the presence of specific metabolic products when incubated with cells. The assay can be performed multiple times to study neuronal metabolic activity across an experimental timeframe with minimal disruption to the cells under study. Alamar blue reagent is highly light sensitive, so ensure all solutions are protected from light where possible (e.g., covering all reagent tubes with foil).\n14. Calculate amount of Alamar blue reagent required:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\rm Total{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm working{\\rm{\\ }} \\rm reagent = \\rm \\left( {1{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm ml{\\rm{\\ }} \\times \\rm number{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm of{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm samples} \\right) + 2{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm ml{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm for{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm blank{\\rm{\\ }}\\rm values. \\end{equation*}$$\n15. Prepare desired working solution volume in sterile conditions by diluting Alamar blue reagent 1:10 in SH-SY5Y differentiation medium, ensuring the solution is evenly mixed and protected from light.\n16. Discard medium from each well of the scaffold samples, and wash briefly with PBS. Incubate scaffolds with 1 ml Alamar blue working solution for 1 hr at 37°C in the dark. Additionally, incubate 1 ml Alamar blue working solution under the same conditions to serve as the blank (negative control).\n17. Transfer 100 µl cell-incubated Alamar blue reagent and negative control in duplicate to each well of an opaque 96-well assay plate.",
    "18. Cover plate and transfer to a plate reader to analyze at excitation/emission wavelengths of 545/585 nm.\n19. Average duplicate readings before subtracting the blank values from all samples to obtain absolute values.\nData can be graphed as relative fluorescence units or calculated as fold change to the desired control group or time point.\nDetermine proliferation rate of neurons in scaffolds\nDNA content assays, such as those containing PicoGreen, can provide useful and accurate insight into neuronal proliferation within 3D scaffold environments. However, such assays require lysing of all cells on a scaffold to liberate neuronal DNA.\n20. Prepare 100 ml lysis buffer comprising 0.2 M carbonate and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in dH2O.\n21. Once the desired neuronal culture period has been reached, remove cell culture medium (retain for end of experiment assays by storing at −20°C), and rinse scaffold with 1 ml PBS. Transfer scaffold to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml lysis buffer.\n22. Immediately transfer scaffold-containing microcentrifuge tube to −80°C, and store until samples are ready to be analyzed.\n23. Before carrying out the assay, freeze-thaw (i.e., completely freeze at –80°C and then bring to RT) frozen, lysed samples to liberate DNA from the cultured neurons.\nIt is recommended that freeze-thaw process is done at least three times to ensure complete lysis and liberation of all DNA into the lysis buffer.\n24. Using a PicoGreen assay kit, prepare a standard curve of the lambda DNA standard using concentrations ranging from 0 to 2000 pg/ml by diluting 1:2 in lysis buffer, where the 0 pg/ml is lysis buffer only (blank). Ensure adequate vortexing to obtain uniform mixing, and change pipette tips between each standard to avoid contamination.\n25. Prepare 20 ml working reagent by adding 100 μl dsDNA PicoGreen reagent to 19.9 ml 1× TE buffer.",
    "26. Pipette 100 µl of each sample and standard in duplicate into an opaque 96-well plate.\n27. Using a multichannel pipette, load 100 µl PicoGreen working reagent to each sample and standard. Then immediately read fluorescence at an excitation/emission wavelength of 485/583 nm using a plate reader.\n28. To analyze the results, subtract the average blank reading from all standards and samples. Plot the standard curve of the fluorescence values versus the known concentration of DNA in pg/ml to calculate the concentrations of DNA within the scaffold samples.\nAnalyze neuronal cytotoxicity in scaffolds\nEnvironmental properties can influence cell survival and stress, which leads to the release of LDH owing to low-level damage to cell membranes (Aras, Hartnett, & Aizenman, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0002]). LDH analysis can be performed on collected supernatant medium as a real-time noninvasive measurement of neuronal stress and cytotoxicity.\n29. Warm stop solution from LDH assay kit, and thaw frozen conditioned medium to room temperature while preparing additional reagents.\n30. Prepare 1 ml of 1× LDH positive control by adding 1.5 µl into 1 ml of 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS.\n31. Prepare reaction mixture by diluting 300 μl assay buffer to 5.7 ml substrate solution. Mix thoroughly while protecting from light.\n32. Transfer 50 µl of each sample's conditioned medium, prepared LDH positive control, and negative control (unconditioned neuronal medium) in triplicate into individual wells of a clear 96-well assay plate.\n33. Transfer 50 µl reaction mixture to each sample and control well, and then mix gently by tapping the plate. Incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark.",
    "34. Add 50 µl stop solution to each sample well, and gently mix by tapping the plate. After adding stop solution, read plate between 1 and 2 hr of incubation at RT. Verify positive control turned color, indicating the assay has been successfully run.\nEnsure no air bubbles are present, and if necessary remove any bubbles with a syringe before reading.\n35. Measure absorbance at wavelengths of 490 and 680 nm using a plate reader.\n36. Subtract 680-nm values from the respectively matched 480-nm values for each sample and control. Next, subtract negative control values from all sample values before calculating the average of the sample triplicates. Plot resulting absorbance values as relative absorbance units, or calculate as fold change compared with a desired control or time point.\nAnalyze neuronal morphology in scaffolds\nCell morphology such as neurite length can be used to assess neuronal vigor and behavior. It is known that both stiffness and matrix composition can influence neurite extension, branching, and complexity (Leach et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0024]; Song & Dityatev, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0041]; Sundararaghavan, Monteiro, Firestein, & Shreiber, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0046]; Woods et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0052]). Immunostaining combined with light and confocal microscopy can be used to assess not only individual neurites but also the 3D networks of neuronal processes within the scaffolds. Here we describe two approaches to preparing and imaging neuronal structures within scaffolds through: (1) cryosectioning and immunostaining to produce a high number of sections for staining various representative regions throughout the scaffold architecture and (2) scaffold hemisectioning, immunostaining, and imaging of regions of interest using confocal microscopy.\nScaffold cryosections\n37. Prepare cryosections of 10- to 50-μM thick fixed neuronal scaffold as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-prot-0002], steps 8 to 17.",
    "38. Apply blocking solutions and relevant primary antibodies (e.g., β-tubulin III) to scaffold cryosections, followed by appropriate fluorescently tagged secondary antibody as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-prot-0002], steps 35 to 45.\nWe recommend using an antibody for anti-β-tubulin III, an abundant neuronal cytoskeletal protein. However, a range of other specific and nonspecific antisera can be used to highlight specific features of neuronal growth within the scaffolds. It is recommended to optimize and validate all antibodies to be used for specificity and concentration before widespread use.\n39. After secondary antibody incubation, wash sample slide three times for 5 min per wash with 1 ml PBS, dabbing excess solution off on dry tissue between individual washes.\n40. Place DAPI (1:500 in PBS, protected from light) on the scaffold cryosections for 30 min at RT in the dark to stain cell nuclei.\nDAPI can be added to the primary or secondary antibody solutions if desired.\n41. Wash three times with PBS for 5 min per wash, dabbing excess fluid off before mounting as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-prot-0002], steps 35 to 45. Store mounted slides at 4°C until ready for imaging.\n42. Using fluorescence/confocal microscopy, image scaffold samples at the desired magnification to analyze cellular infiltration, distribution, and neurite extension within the 3D scaffold.\nIt is recommended to image three different representative regions per scaffold cryosection for adequate sampling and analysis.\nAlthough the antibodies listed in the Materials list have been validated for this application, it is recommended to first optimize antibodies of different manufacturers, wavelengths, and concentrations.\nScaffold segments\n43. Using a single-backed blade or fine forceps, transfer individual scaffolds to a tissue chopper, and cut scaffolds longitudinally and transversely as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-prot-0002], steps 46 to 51.",
    "44. Once scaffolds have been cut into the desired number of segments (we recommend hemisections), incubate individual scaffold segments in 1 ml of 2.5% (w/v) BSA in PBS to block nonspecific binding.\n45. Wash scaffolds three times in PBS for 5 min per wash.\n46. Prepare primary antibodies using concentrations according to the manufacturer's recommendations in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100. Incubate individual scaffold segments in 500 µl primary antibody solution overnight at 4°C.\n47. Remove primary antibody solution, and wash scaffolds as described in step 45.\n48. Prepare appropriate secondary antibodies at the manufacturer's recommended dilution in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100. Incubate scaffold samples in 500 µl secondary antibody solution for at least 2 hr at RT in the dark.\n49. Wash scaffold as described in step 45.\n50. Incubate scaffolds in DAPI (1:500 in PBS, 500 µl/scaffold) for 30 min at RT in the dark.\n51. Wash scaffolds as described in step 45. Store scaffolds in PBS at 4°C until ready for imaging via confocal microscopy.\n52. To image via confocal microscopy, use forceps to carefully mount the scaffold on the underside of a coverslip, and gently invert so the scaffold hangs below the coverslip and is safely adhered owing to the surface tension of water.\n53. Place coverslip onto the fluorescent/confocal microscope mounting stage, and add water or oil (depending on lens) to the top surface lens-facing side for optimal imaging.\n54. Capture at least three images from different representative scaffold regions to study neurite outgrowth, network formation, and cellular distribution throughout the scaffold structures.",
    "It is important to consider that confocal microscopes have a limited range of depth penetration into tissue scaffolds (∼300 µm). Therefore, although this approach to imaging 3D scaffolds can be useful to study regions of interest within the structures, scaffold orientation is critical, and a range of orientations should be viewed to ensure unambiguous capture of representative data from all areas of the whole scaffold. Examples of representative images can be found in Woods et al. (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.688#cpz1688-bib-0052])."
