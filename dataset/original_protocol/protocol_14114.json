    "The rabbits used in the present study were treated in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All the experimental procedures were followed by the rules of the Bioethics Committee of Zhejiang Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n1. Preparation of the Bacterial Suspension\nDissolve 0.5 mg of S. aureus freeze-drying powder (ATCC 6538) with 0.3 mL of Luria-Bertani culture medium. Mix suspension completely.\nStreak the bacteria suspension onto tryptic soy agar plates and incubate the bacterial colonies at 37 °C for 16 h.\nSelect a single bacterial colony forming unit (CFU) and culture in tryptic soy broth tubes for 24 h. Perform a subculture for approximately 24 h at 37 °C, and obtain mid-logarithmic growth phase bacteria after 16 to 18 h, when the optical density (OD) value is 0.6 at 600 nm14.\nTransfer 1 mL of bacteria suspension into a centrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 825 x g and 4 °C, and discard the supernatant. Resuspend and wash the bacteria with 100 µL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS); repeat this step 3 times. Finally, resuspend bacteria with 3 mL of PBS.\nEstimate the bacteria concentration using McFarland's turbidimetry15.\nTransfer 100 to 500 µL of bacteria suspension to a colorimetric tube until the turbidity is equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard.\nAssess turbidity by visual comparison to the 0.5 McFarland, when the content of bacteria reaches approximately 108 CFU/mL.\nNOTE: Make sure the volume of bacteria suspension is sufficient for the following protocols. For every rabbit, the volume of bacteria suspension is less than 1 mL.\nTransfer 0.2 mL of bacterial suspension to an agar plate and apply it evenly. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 16 h. Count the bacteria colonies to verify the CFU of bacteria suspension.",
    "2. Preparation of Bone Infection Models\nKeep male New Zealand white rabbits, aged 3 months, in individual cages, under air-controlled conditions (20 ± 1 °C) and 12 h/12 h light-dark illumination cycles. Offer routine diet and tap water daily.\nEnsure that at the time of surgery that the rabbit weighs more than 3 kg.\nAnaesthetize rabbits by intraperitoneal injection with pentobarbital sodium (3 mg per 100 g of body weight). Make sure rabbits are fully anesthetized by a failure to respond to a paw pinch. Fix rabbits on the operating table during operation procedure.\nNOTE: Make sure that the modeling procedure duration is less than 1 h.\nShave the proximal tibia region using an electric shaver against the direction of hair growth. Disinfect the skin by applying a povidone-iodine solution.\nMark the upper end of the tibia and the drilling hole position for injection with S. aureus (the distance to the upper end of the tibia is 1.5 cm) with pen and ruler. Make sure the drilling hole positions are in the middle of the tibial plateau horizontally (Figure 1A).\nCut tibia skin using a No. 11 scalpel and make a 1 cm incision in the periosteum (Figure 1B,C). Punch a 2 mm diameter hole in the tibia using an electric bone drill unit (Figure 1D).\nPress the 2 mm diameter holes in the tibial plateau with a cylinder of bone wax of 2 mm diameter and 2 mm height (Figure 1E). Remove the spare bone wax along the horizontal plane of the tibial plateau (Figure 1F). Check that the 2 mm hole is full of bone wax (Figure 1G).\nNOTE: Ensure that the holes are full of bone wax by checking the hole with or without blood overflow.",
    "Sew up the periosteum and skin with absorbable surgical suture in a vertical mattress suture to prevent the animal from chewing the sutures (Figure 1H).\nInject 1 x 108 CFU/mL of S. aureus solutions (30 µL per 100 g of body weight) with a 1 mL asepsis injector (Figure 1I). Make sure the needles penetrate the bone wax and inject the S. aureus solution into bone marrow slowly.\nKeep the animal in warm and clean conditions to avoid heat loss after modelling. Monitor respiratory rate and heart rate. After waking up, house the rabbits in individual cages with free access to food and water.\n3. Evaluation of Bone Infection Model\nAt days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after infection, place rabbits into the rabbit fixer with the head and ear outside of the fixer.\nDraw 2 mL of blood from the auricular veins into a dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-K2) anticoagulant blood container. Draw 1 mL of blood from a blood vessel into a blood container. Centrifuge the serum for 10 min with a speed of 651 x g at room temperature.\nDetermine white blood cell count (WBC) in whole blood using a blood biochemical analyzer, and C-reactive protein (CRP) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method16.\nAt days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after infection, anaesthetize one model rabbit with pentobarbital sodium at the dosage of 3 mg per 100 g body weight. Cut tibia skin using a No. 11 scalpel and make a 2 cm incision in the periosteum (Figure 2A).\nClean bone wax. Debride necrotic bone by punching two adjacent 4.8 mm diameter holes using an electric bone drill unit (Figure 2B). Debride necrotic bone marrow and granulation tissue using a bone spoon (Figure 2C).",
    "NOTE: Clean bone tissue during the debridement to avoid bone tissue remaining in the bone marrow.\nScrape and clean the bone tissue between the two holes (Figure 2D).\nSpread 1 mL of bone marrow onto sheep blood agar plates. Incubate plates overnight at 37 °C. Select plates of 30–300 colonies, and calculate the number of colonies.\nAt the end of day 28 after infection, extract tibia specimens along the edges of knee and ankle joints. Fix the tibia specimens in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Decalcify the tibia specimens in 10% EDTA for 8 weeks.\nDehydrate the tibia specimens in a graded series of ethanol dilutions, and then embed in paraffin wax. Cut 4 consecutive 5 µm sections from the coronal planes. Stain sections with a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining kit.\nUse a microscope to view the stained sections and record transmitted light images with standard software.\n4. Preparation of VCS Beads\nAdd 1 g of vancomycin hydrochloride powder to 9.5 g of medical grade calcium sulphate, and then add 3 mL of normal saline to the mixed power. Mix them thoroughly with a spatula for 30 to 45 s.\nPlace the mixed product into a flexible silica gel mold (cylinder of 4.8 mm diameter and 4.8 mm height), and dry at room temperature for 15 min. Remove the VCS beads by flexing the mold.\n5. Antibiotic Treatment and Implantation of Autogenous Bone\nAnaesthetize model rabbits with pentobarbital sodium at the dosage of 3 mg per 100 g body weight on the 28th day after infection. Shave the proximal tibia region using an electric shaver. Disinfect the skin by applying povidone-iodine solution.\nNOTE: Make sure that the modelling procedure is less than 1 h.",
    "Shave the tail region using an electric shaver and disinfect the tail by applying povidone-iodine solution.\nCut down the tail using surgical scissors. Cut tail skin using a No. 11 scalpel and reveal the tail bone. Sew up the skin at the tail region with absorbable surgical sutures in a vertical mattress suture to prevent the animal from chewing the sutures.\nRemove any muscle, soft tissue and periosteum. Detach the tail bone at each joint and transfer the bone fragment to a 100 mm plastic dish containing sterile saline.\nImplant 4 pieces of VCS beads (cylinder of 4.8 mm diameter and 4.8 mm height, 1.25 mg vancomycin per piece of bead) into the marrow cavity using curved tweezers (Figure 2E).\nFill the bone defect with 8 pieces of autogenous bones (cylinder of 2 mm diameter and 4 mm height per each piece) using curved tweezers (Figure 2E).\nSew up the periosteum and skin with absorbable surgical sutures in a mattress suture manner (Figure 2F).\nNOTE: Keep the temperature at 25 °C during the surgery.\nKeep the animal in warm and clean conditions to avoid heat loss after surgery. Monitor respiratory rate and heart rate. After waking up, house the rabbits in individual cages with free access to food and water.\n6. Assessments of Antibiotic Activity\nPut rabbits into a rabbit fixer, and place the head and ear outside of the fixer at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after treatment.\nDraw blood from auricular veins with EDTA-K2 anticoagulant blood vessel. Draw 1 mL of blood from a blood vessel into a blood container. Centrifuge the serum for 10 min with a speed of 651 x g at room temperature.",
    "Determine the white blood cell count (WBC) in whole blood by using blood biochemical analyzer, and C-reactive protein (CRP) by an ELISA method16.\n7. Assessments of Bone Regeneration\nEuthanize rabbits by injecting with an over dosages of pentobarbital sodium, at the end of 8 or 12 weeks after treatment.\nExtract tibia specimens, along the edges of knee and ankle joints. Debride muscles and fascial layers.\nAnalyze structure of tibia by using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Choose an oval area 4.8 mm diameter and 9.6 mm long as the region of interest (ROI). Reconstruct 3D model images using bitmap data.\nChoose scores of the ratio of bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecula number (Tb.N) and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp)from the3D models to assess bone regeneration.\nSubscription Required.
