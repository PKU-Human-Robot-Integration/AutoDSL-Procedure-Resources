    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol is aimed at isolating EVs from adherent epithelial cells in cell culture models. The protocol can be adapted depending on the treatment and desire for further characterization including morphological analysis, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cells are treated, prepared, and cell culture media is collected (1) using standard procedures. Centrifugation of the collected cell culture media (2) separates EVs from other extracellular materials (Livshits et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), while differential ultracentrifugation further enriches and concentrates the EV sample (Yu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nNote: The protocol shown below is described step by step, performed with MCF10A cells treated with 2.5 μM RSL3 for 18 h, though this protocol may be adapted to other treatments.\nCell culture preparation\nTiming: ~1 day\nHere, we will be culturing MCF10A cells. Total number of plates will depend on the downstream applications and desired yield. Given the limited concentration of EVs separated from cell culture media, we suggest starting with 6–150 × 20 mm TC-treated dishes. This procedure aims to prepare cells for collection after treatment. Cells are treated with 2.5 μM RSL3 and cell culture media is collected for EV isolation in the following section.\nSubculture MCF10A cells. Plate ~750,000 cells in 100 × 20 mm TC-treated dishes. Keep them in a DMEM/F:12 media consisting of 5% EV-free horse serum, EGF (Final Concentration: 20 ng/mL), hydrocortisone (Final Concentration: 0.5 mg/mL), Cholera Toxin (Final Concentration: 100 ng/mL), insulin (Final Concentration: 10 ug/mL), and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.\nNote: The number of MCF10A plates is restricted only by the volume limited by the ultracentrifugation rotors and tubes. More plates may allow for a greater quantity of separated EVs. This protocol can be adapted to other cell lines such as the Hs578t cells.\nSample treatment and media collection",
    "Timing: ~1 day\nThis procedure aims to prepare cells for collection after treatment. Cells are treated with RSL3. Cell culture media is collected for EV isolation in the following section.\nRemove media from cells.\nNote: We suggest 80%–90% cell confluency at which point media is collected for EV isolation. Confluency can be adjusted differently depending on the purpose of the experiment; however, we do not recommend less than 50% cell confluency as this will greatly affect the overall EV yield/enrichment.\nTreat cells with 2.5 μM RSL3 for 18 h in EV-free media.\nCollect cell culture media and transfer into 50 mL conical tubes.\nCritical: Following cell culture media collection, it is necessary to keep samples on ice at all times to avoid EV degradation (Cheng et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nEV isolation\nTiming: 5–6 h\nHere, differential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation are utilized to separate EVs from cell components (e.g., cells, cell debris, and cellular organelles). Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] emphasizes the major centrifugation and ultracentrifugation steps of this protocol for ease of use.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/440-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustrative extracellular vesicle isolation protocol overview\nAfter cell culture preparation and sample treatment, the media is collected and undergoes two phases for EV isolation and enrichment: (1) centrifugation and (2) ultracentrifugation. During (1), cells (alive and dead) and debris are removed. EVs are then separated and enriched in (2). Figure partially created using BioRender.\nPlace 50 mL conical tubes into Rotor A-4-62 and pellet down cells by centrifuging tubes in Centrifuge 5810 R at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard pellet and transfer supernatant into new 50 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge tubes in Centrifuge 5810 R at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Note: While samples are in centrifuge, we suggest turning on/setting Optima XPN-80 to 4°C and placing SW 32.1 Ti Swinging-Bucket rotor in cold room to allow sufficient time for pre-cooling.\nDiscard pellet and transfer supernatant into new 50 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge tubes in Centrifuge 5810 R at 4,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C.\nTransfer supernatant into ultracentrifuge tubes.\nCritical: Be cautious when transferring supernatant in steps 6, 8, and 10 (centrifugation steps) because the pellets contain cells, dead cells, and cell debris, which will contaminate the EV pellet. The use of a portable pipette controller is recommended until ~5 mL media remain in centrifuge tube to minimize disturbances to cell pellet. The remaining media should be collected using P200 and P1000 pipettes.\nPlace ultracentrifuge tubes into pre-cooled SW 32.1 Ti Swinging-Bucket rotor and centrifuge tubes in Optima XPN-80 Ultracentrifuge at 22,000 rpm for 140 min at 4°C.\nNote: Ultracentrifuge tubes should remain balanced. Use cold PBS and add to ultracentrifuge tube with media (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: It is necessary to fill ultracentrifuge tubes to a sufficient volume, as the tubes may collapse and limit the ability to recover EV sample.\nRemove media and resuspend pellets in 10 mL cold PBS.\nCritical: Do NOT use aspirator to remove media because this may inadvertently remove the EV pellet from the ultracentrifuge tube. Instead, remove media by gently pipetting using P1000 pipette. When ~1–2 mL media remain in the ultracentrifuge tube, use P200 pipette to remove residual media.\nCentrifuge samples in Optima XPN-80 Ultracentrifuge at 22,000 rpm for 140 min at 4°C\nCarefully aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in suitable buffer for further downstream applications and characterization/identification analyses, such as immunoblot, mass spectrometry, and TEM.",
    "Note: Specific buffer and volume for EV resuspension is dependent on specific downstream analyses and applications. For immunoblot and TEM, we suggest resuspending in 30 μL–50 μL RIPA buffer and cold PBS, respectively, and incubating on ice for 10 min. For ICP-mass spectrometry, we resuspended EV-containing pellet in 0.5 mL PBS and centrifuged in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator at 45°C. Samples were then digested in 100 μL HNO3, heated for 20 min at 65°C, and diluted to 2 mL with ddH2O before analysis.\nOptional: EV-containing pellets can be stored at −80°C while maintaining EV membrane integrity and quality (Lee et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), though we suggest avoiding repeated freeze/thaw cycles to avert sample degradation."
