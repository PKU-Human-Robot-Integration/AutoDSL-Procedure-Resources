    "All animal experiments reported in this article were conducted according to the Federation for Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) category B and the Society of Laboratory Animal Science (GV-SOLAS) standard guidelines and were approved by the local German authorities in Karlsruhe (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany). Please note that biosavety level 2 applies to mosquito and Plasmodium berghei ANKA sporozoite work.\n1. Infection\nInfect Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes with Plasmodium berghei ANKA by feeding them for 15 min on a gametocytemic mouse. Keep the infected mosquitoes at 80% humidity and 21 °C.\nCollect female mosquitoes from their cage 17 to 22 days after the blood meal. Place them on ice to anesthetize them.\nUsing forceps, place three to four mosquitoes on a glass slide covered with a drop of cold RPMI medium. Place the slide under a microscope.\nUsing forceps, carefully stretch the mosquito between the head and body. Isolate the salivary gland using a syringe and needle. Repeat this procedure with the remaining mosquitoes.\nCollect the salivary glands from the glass slide by sucking them up with a glass pipette and collect them in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the infection rates, usually 8,000 to 15,000 infectious sporozoites can be obtained per salivary gland.\nFor approximately 3 min, smash the isolated salivary glands within the centrifuge tube with a small, plastic stick to isolate the sporozoites from the salivary gland tissue.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 1,000 x g and 4 °C to purify the sporozoites from the remaining tissue.\nPipette the supernatant, which contains the sporozoites (SPZ), to a new centrifuge tube and count the purified sporozoites in a Neubauer hemocytometer.\nAdjust the concentration of purified sporozoites to 10,000/mL by adding phosphate-buffered saline.",
    "Inject a total of 1,000 sporozoites (0.1 mL) into the tail veins of inbred C57BL/6 mice to initiate infection. To facilitate the injections, place the C57BL/6 mice in a restrainer and put the tails into warm (approximately 37 °C) water to assist with the visualization of the tail veins;\n\tNOTE: The injection itself is a short procedure that can be performed within a few seconds.\nOnce daily, check blood-stage parasitemia on blood smears from day 3 onwards after the SPZ infection.\n\tNOTE: Monitoring parasitemia has been previously visualized in a JoVE article by Mueller et al.8\nAssess the mice once daily with the Rapid Murine Coma and Behavior Scale (RMCBS) score, starting from day 5 after the sporozoite injection.\n\tNOTE: A detailed description of this procedure, including a video demonstration, has been published by Caroll et al.6\nAssess the mice with MRI imaging according to the RMCBS score and the research question to be addressed.6\n2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Setup\nPerform MRI on a 9.4T small animal scanner using a volume resonator for radiofrequency transmission and a 4-channel-phased-array surface receiver coil. Turn on the temperature-controlled water bath to 42 °C in order to maintain the body temperature of the mouse.\nInduce anesthesia in a chamber using 2% isoflurane and compressed air until the mouse no longer reacts to a toe pinch. Maintain the anesthesia at 1-1.5%.\nPlace a tail vein catheter into the tail vein of the mouse. Position the mouse for MRI by placing it prone and with a crunched back on an animal bed equipped with a headlock and tooth bar to minimize head motion. Take care not to straighten the cervical spine of the mouse.",
    "Connect a contrast agent injection system to the tail vein catheter. Use a custom-made injection system filled with a Gd-DTPA (0.3 mmol/kg) syringe or use PE tubing connected to a Gd-DTPA (0.3 mmol/kg) syringe.\nApply dexpanthenol eye ointment to both eyes. Place the 4-channel-phased-array surface receiver head coil onto the head of the mouse. Place a breathing pad onto the back of the mouse and connect it to a respiration monitoring device.\n3. Imaging Protocol\nNOTE: Choose imaging sequences from the protocol listed below according to the research questions to be addressed. All listed parameters are valid for the MRI software but might need to be adjusted if other software programs are used.\nBegin by performing a localizing scan to make sure that the mouse brain is in the isocenter of the magnet.\nTo qualitatively assess the vasogenic edema, use 3D T2-weighted imaging by selecting a multi-slice RARE sequence.\nEnter the following parameters into the MRI software: repetition time = 2.000 ms, echo time = 22 ms, isotropic resolution = 0.1mm, field of view = 20 x 10 x 12 mm3; matrix = 200 x 100 x 120, flip angle = 90-180°; (spin-echo), and rare factor = 8. Start the sequence and wait 10 min 48 s to acquire the raw images.\nTo quantitatively assess vasogenic edema perform T2 relaxometry by selecting a multi-slice, multiple spin echo sequence.\nUse the following parameters: repetition time = 3.100 ms, echo time = 8-136 ms in increments of 8 ms, number of slices = 17, slice thickness = 0.7 mm, in plane resolution = 0.116 mm x 0.116 mm, field of view 20 x 20 mm2, matrix = 172 x 172, flip angle = 90-180 degrees; (spin-echo). Start the sequence and wait 8 min 53 s to acquire the raw images.",
    "To quantitatively assess both vasogenic edema and cytotoxic edema, carry out diffusion-weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping by selecting a spin-echo EPI diffusion sequence.\nUse the following parameters: repetition time = 3.400 ms, echo time = 20 ms, slice thickness = 0.7 mm, number of slices = 17, number of diffusion sensitized directions = 30, b value = 1.500 s/mm2, δ = 3 ms, Δ = 9 ms, partial Fourier encoding acceleration factor = 1.51, field of view = 12 x 15 mm2, matrix = 96 x 128, in-plane resolution = 0.125 mm x 0.117 mm, flip angle = 90-180 degrees, and number of saturation slices (sagittal) = 1. Start the sequence and wait 7 min 56 s until the raw images are acquired.\nTo assess microhemorrhages, use 3D T2*-weighted imaging. Select a flow-compensated FLASH sequence.\nEnter the following parameters into the MRI software: repetition time = 2.000 ms, echo time = 22 ms, isotropic resolution 0.08 mm, field of view = 32 x 15 x 8 mm3, matrix size = 400 x 188 x 100, and flip angle = 12 degrees. Start the sequence and wait 15 min 40 s to acquire the raw images.\nTo assess arterial patency, use time of flight angiography by selecting a 3D FLASH sequence.\nUse the following parameters in the MRI software: repetition time = 16 ms, echo time = 3.5 ms, slice thickness = 0.07 mm, in-plane resolution = 0.104 x 0.104 mm, field of view = 20 x 20 x 10 mm3, matrix = 192 x 192 x 142, and flip angle = 15 degrees. Start the sequence and wait 7 min 16 s until the images are acquired.",
    "To assess blood-brain barrier disruption, use 3D T1-weighted imaging before and after a contrast agent injection of 0.3 mmol/kg. Select a radio frequency-spoiled FLASH sequence with a global radio frequency excitation.\nUse the following sequence parameters in the MRI software: repetition time = 5 ms, echo time = 1.9 ms, isotropic resolution = 0.156 mm, field of view 20 x 18.7 x 18.7 mm3, matrix 128 x 120 x 120 and flip angle = 8.5°;. Start the sequence and wait 1 min 14s until the images are acquired.\n4. Image Processing and Analysis\nTo analyze blood-brain barrier disruption, subtract 3D non-enhanced T1-weighted images from enhanced T1-weighted images with the arithmetic tool or image calculator tool in ImageJ. Evaluate the subtraction images for an increase of signal, which corresponds to blood-brain barrier disruption.9\nTo analyze brain volume, use native 3D T1- or 3D T2-weighted datasets. Delineate the brain from the olfactory bulb to the cerebellum using the segmentation editor.10\nVasogenic edema\nProcess the T2 relaxometry data with MRI software or use a nonlinear least-squares fit procedure.11 Process diffusion-weighted data to obtain ADC maps using MRI software or FDT toolbox (see Materials Table).\nPlace regions of interest manually into the different anatomical regions.\n\t\tNOTE: Automatic placement of regions of interest may register incorrectly due to significant brain swelling. The T2 times and ADC values of the chosen anatomical regions are obtained in this fashion.\nTo analyze microhemorrhage volume, delineate microhemorrhages, which appear as ovoid, dark foci on T2*-weighted datasets, using the segmentation editor.\nSubscription Required.
