    "RNA ExtractionNote: It is modified from standard TrizolTM procedure. Spray gloves, equipment and all materials using RNase (ribonuclease) AWAY.Snap freeze about 100 mg of leaves by immersing the leaves for 5 sec in liquid nitrogen. Tip: Snap freezing works better than crushing the leaves directly in liquid nitrogen.Grind the frozen leaves in the presence of 1 ml of Trizol using a mortar and pestle (not necessary to be cold) and transfer to a nuclease-free microfuge tube using a pipette.Note: This step should be performed inside a fume hood.Incubate the tube for 5 min at room temperature (RT).Then add 200 μl of 24:1 Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol into the tube and vortex to mix thoroughly.Tip: The sample must be vortexed until it is homogeneously green. This vortexing step is critical for high yield of RNA.Incubate this mixture for 2 min at RT.Then centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant (the aqueous phase containing RNA) to a new tube.Tip: Note the volume of phase transferred.Add chilled isopropanol into the new tube at a volume of 0.5 times the original volume of aqueous phase present. Tip: Isopropanol must be chilled, otherwise the yield of RNA might be low.Vortex the mixture vigorously for at least 10 sec and incubate for about 15 min at -20 °C.Centrifuge the mix for 10 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.RNA can be seen as a small white pellet at the bottom of the tube.Remove the supernatant isopropanol without disturbing the pellet. Wash the RNA pellet by adding 500 μl of 75-80% ethanol and discard the supernatant after spinning at 7,000 x g for 5 min (Potential stop point: can be stored at -20 °C for up to a week).",
    "Spin the tube again (without adding any reagents) and then remove any residual ethanol that sticks to the wall of the microcentrifuge tube.Air dry the pellet for 15 min by placing the inverted tube inside the fume hood.Then resuspend the pellet in 40 μl of nuclease-free water and incubate in a water bath with the tube open at 60 °C for 15 min to completely dissolve it. The cap of microfuge tube should be kept open for efficient evaporation of residual ethanol (Potential Stop point: samples can be stored at -80 °C). The samples stored at -80 °C must be thawed on ice and treated by the following steps.RNA PurificationNote: It is modified from ZYMO Clean and Concentrator KitTM protocol (ZYMO RESEARCH, USA). Add 80 μl of RNA binding buffer to the RNA (see above) and gently mix it using pipette tip.Then add 120 μl of 100% ethanol to the tube followed by gentle mixing.Transfer the RNA sample to a Zymospin column in a collection tube and spin at 12,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C.Wash the column with 400 μl of RNA wash buffer by spinning at 12,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C. The flow-through will be discarded.Prepare DNase cocktail by mixing 5 μl of Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AmbionTM) and 35 μl of DNA digestion buffer (ZYMO RESEARCH, USA) gently in a microfuge tube.Add the cocktail to the RNA column and incubate for 20 min at RT.Tip: Longer incubation times do not improve purity.Add about 400 μl of RNA Prep buffer (or RNA Pre-Wash Buffer) to the column and spin at 12,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C. Then discard the flow through.Wash the column again twice using 400 μl of RNA Wash buffer like Step B4.",
    "Spin the column (without adding any reagents) for 2 min to remove the residual ethanol.Finally, transfer the column to a new nuclease-free microfuge tube.Add about 20 μl of nuclease-free water to the column and incubate for 2 min at RT. Collect the flow through after spinning for 2 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.Pipette out the flow through and add it to the column again.Incubate the column for 2 min at RT and collect the pure RNA after spinning for 2 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C."
