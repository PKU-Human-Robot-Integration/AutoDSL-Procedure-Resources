    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEx vivo tumor antigen presentation assay\nTiming: 8–12 weeks, depending on tumor growth rate\nThis major step allows for the generation of a mixed bone marrow chimera system designed to test the ability of antigen-presenting immune cells to have picked up, processed, and presented exogenous tumor antigen in vivo (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). This is done by measuring surface expression of SIINFEKL peptide in the context of the H-2Kb allele of MHC-I and testing APC activity ex vivo of TAM and mDC1 by coculturing them with OT-I T cells, which recognize SIINFEKL. The mixed bone marrow chimera aspect allows for direct comparison of APC activity of wild-type versus IRF8-knockout TAMs, which are coming from a shared tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the chimera system ensures tumor antigen is exogenous, as the USA cassette is not expressed by donor bone marrows. This assay also allows for testing of APC activity of mDC1 from the tumor-draining lymph node.\nLethally irradiate (900 rad) 8–12 week old female recipient mice (S100a8CreLSL-USAPyMT, CD45.1.2+) 12–24 h before bone marrow transfer.\nMaintain these mice on antibiotic sulfatrim diet for at least two weeks post-irradiation and post-bone barrow transfer.\nNote: The purpose of this dose of irradiation is to kill off the host/recipient mouse’s bone marrow and immune system. The donors’ bone marrows will reconstitute the hematopoietic compartment, but this can take a few weeks, hence the mice are maintained on chow with antibiotics (Sulfatrim diet) while they are immunocompromised.\nHarvest bone marrow from adult (∼8–12 week old) female donor mice (one C57BL/6 CD45.1+ mouse and one CD11cCreIrf8fl/fl CD45.2+ mouse for transfer into up to five recipients).\nEuthanize donor mice and harvest both femurs and tibias.",
    "Remove the muscle from the bones, clean bones in 70% ethanol and wash in sterile PBS in 60 × 15 mm tissue culture dishes.\nMash bones using mortar and pestle in sterile biological safety cabinet.\nCollect mashed bone marrow in T cell media (TCM) and pass it through a 70 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube to obtain single-cell suspension. Take small aliquot (∼20 μL) for counting.\nCount number of cells in each sample.\nMix 10 μL 0.4% trypan blue with 10 μL cells to count.\nLet sit 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPipette 10 μL underneath coverslip of hemacytometer.\nPlacing hemacytometer on microscope, count number of cells that have not taken up the dye (live cells) in each of the four outer quadrants.\nCalculate number of live cells in sample: (number of cells in four quadrants/4) × (104) = number of cells per mL, then (number of cells per mL) × (total volume of cells [unit in mL]) for final cell number.\nAfter ensuring comparable numbers of cells (i.e., ∼60–80 × 106 per mouse), mix bulk bone marrow from the two donor mice at a 1 to 1 ratio and spin down for 6 min at 4°C and 550 rcf.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend in appropriate volume of sterile PBS (100 μL per recipient mouse, total volume up to 500 μL for mixed bone marrow from two donor mice).\nNote: Pooled bone marrow from both hind legs of two donor mice can reconstitute up to five irradiated recipient mice, assuming consistent and successful harvesting of bone marrow across donors (∼60–80 × 106 cells per donor).",
    "Note: The number of cells transferred does not need to be exact. Because WT and KO donor bone marrow is mixed 1:1 and transferred together into the same host, as long as they each have similar numbers of cells and the recipient receives at least 1/5 of the total bone marrow from two donors, that should be sufficient to allow bone marrows to graft successfully. If there are fewer than five recipient mice available, bone marrow can be split among fewer recipients.\nInject 100 μL mixed bone marrow intravenously into irradiated recipient mouse via retro-orbital injection using 500 μL syringe.\nAlternatives: Cells can also be injected via tail vein injection.\nAge the mixed bone marrow chimeric mice to allow bone marrow to graft and PyMT tumors to grow.\nMonitor mammary glands weekly, checking for tumor growth.\nTo measure tumors, scruff mouse by the neck and palp each of the ten mammary glands.\nFor palpable tumors, measure “length” and “width” (perpendicular dimensions) of the tumor with a caliper and record values.\nTo calculate tumor volume per gland, use the formula: tumor volume = [(length × width2) × (π/6)].\nNote: There should be ten values per mouse, one per gland. For no palpable tumor, volume is 0. Add together values in order to calculate total tumor burden for that mouse.\nWhen total tumor burden reaches ∼ 2,000 mm3 across all mammary glands (after ∼8–12 weeks, around 20–24 weeks of age), mice can be used to sort out TAMs from the tumor and mDC1 from tumor-draining lymph nodes. Multiple chimeric mice can be used for the same experiment, representing biological replicates.\nEuthanize mice, dissect out tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes.\nIsolate cells from the tumor.",
    "Mechanically digest tumor by cutting tissue with a razor blade on a glass slide. Pool tumors from one mouse.\nCritical: Make sure to mince the tumor tissue well, as this will help the enzymatic digestion and filtering steps and will provide a better yield of cells from the tissue.\nTransfer minced tumor tissue into a 50 mL conical tube with 8 mL HBSS without Ca2+, Mg2+ with 280 U/mL Collagenase Type 3 and 4 μg/mL Dnase I.\nVortex for 5 s and incubate in 37°C water bath for 1 h, vortexing every 15 min.\nMash resulting tissue through 70 μm cell strainer with the back of a 3 mL syringe plunger, adding an additional 20 mL chilled PBS during washes of strainer. This will result in a single-cell suspension.\nSpin down tube with tumor sample for 6 min at 4°C and 550 rcf.\nResuspend pellet in 7 mL 44% Percoll. Transfer to 15 mL conical tube.\nSlowly add 3 mL 66% Percoll to bottom of tube.\nCritical: When creating Percoll gradient, make sure 66% layer and 44% layer are fully separated with a clear, crisp interface between the two layers. Adding the 66% Percoll slowly is key to keeping the layers separate.\nCentrifuge sample for 30 min at 4°C and 1,900 rcf with no brake.\nRemove debris at the top of the 44% Percoll layer, collect cells at the interface between 44% and 66% Percoll layers and transfer to a new 15 mL conical tube.\nTo wash away remaining Percoll, add chilled PBS to cells, bringing volume up to 12 mL. Vortex tube well.\nSpin tube for 6 min at 4°C and 550 rcf.\nVisually inspect tube to ensure cells are pelleted at the bottom of the tube and the Percoll gradient has not reformed. Discard supernatant.",
    "Critical: Make sure to vortex tube well before spin to ensure Percoll is fully mixed into wash. After spin and before decanting supernatant, inspect tube to make sure cells are pelleted at the bottom of the tube, not at a re-formed Percoll interface.\nResuspend pellet in 1 mL TCM. Keep on ice until ready to start antibody stainings.\nIsolate cells from the tumor-draining lymph node.\nNote: This lymph node digestion protocol is specifically designed to isolate dendritic cells from the lymph node, as they are harder to liberate than other immune cells, such as lymphocytes.\nMechanically digest lymph node by mincing tissue with a razor blade on a glass slide.\nTransfer minced lymph node to a 15 mL conical tube with 4.5 mL T cell media (TCM) and 280 U/mL Collagenase Type 3.\nVortex for 5 s and place in 37°C water bath.\nIncubate in water bath for 30 min, vortexing every 15 min.\nAdd 500 μL 0.1 M EDTA to the sample, bringing volume up to 5 mL.\nVortex briefly and incubate in 37°C water bath for another 5 min.\nRemove tube from water bath, vortex and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nMash resulting tissue through 70 μm cell strainer with the back of a 3 mL syringe plunger into a 50 mL conical tube, adding an additional 10 mL PBS during washes of strainer. This will result in a single cell suspension.\nSpin tube for 6 min at 4°C and 550 rcf.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 mL TCM. Keep on ice until ready to start antibody stainings.\nSet aside about 10% (no more than 1 × 106 cells) of each tumor sample in TCM on ice for flow cytometric analysis in order to characterize phenotype of TAMs from mixed bone marrows.",

When determining when to transfer the T cells, the mice should have a sizeable tumor burden in at least one gland, thus ensuring the tumors are at a late enough stage for a robust TAM response to have developed (ideally at multiple glands and larger than 5 × 5 mm). However, mice should also be able to survive for two more weeks for the assay. Thus, the tumor burden should be sizeable but not too advanced.
