    "The protocol in this article describes standard clinical practice. No permission from the ethical committee was needed. Images in the protocol contain no information which can be used to indentify patients.\n1. Radial endobronchial ultrasound\nPreparing for the procedure\n\t\nExamine the CT scan to check for bronchus signs and the location of the lesion before the procedure.\nCalibrate the ultrasound probe, guide sheath, and biopsy tools of choice prior to the examination, ensuring that the tool will reach the same position as the ultrasound probe when inserted into the guide sheath.\nPerform a systematic examination of the bronchial tree and segments as described in \"Systematic bronchoscopy: The 4 landmark approach\"24.\n\t\nPlace the C-arm over the patient and adjust until the lesion is visible in the image.\nInsert the tip of the bronchoscope in the segment or subsegment where the lesion is most likely present.\nAdvance the guide sheath and probe under fluoroscopy guidance until the metallic guide sheet tip is adjacent to or in the lesion.\nAdvance and activate the probe. Now an ultrasound image will appear on the monitor.\n\t\t\nIf the probe is surrounded by a tumor or dense tissue, a concentric consolidation will appear (see Figure 1A). Look for grey and homogeneous consolidation with a hyperechoic border toward the normal lung tissue.\nIf the probe is placed adjacent to the lesion, the image will be eccentric (see Figure 1B).\nIf the probe is placed in normal lung tissue, only a scattered image of air will appear (see Figure 1C).\nWith lesser dense lesions such as ground glass lesions, inflammatory tissue, or atelectasis, a more heterogeneous and less defined image will be presented (see Figure 1D). This is caused by air (hyperechoic) or fluid (hypoechoic) trapped in the bronchi.",
    "If a consolidation matching the lesion on the CT scan does not appear, adjust the guide sheath and probe until the correct placement is achieved.\nSave the fluoroscopy image of the position where the ultrasound probe provides the best consolidation (will be used in step 1.3.2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65623/65623fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Radial EBUS ultrasound images.

Verify the placement of the forceps, especially if the patient is coughing. Collect a minimum of 10-15 samples using forceps and confirm the correct location by removing the forceps and inserting the ultrasound probe every four to five samples.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65623/65623fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Fluoroscopy-guided sampling.

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy\nNOTE: The following procedure is based on the superDimension system by Medtronic.\nThe planning phase\n\t\nBefore the procedure, evaluate the CT images. Ensure that the image is of high quality, preferably with slices no thicker than 1.5 mm, and recorded during inspiration to fully expand the airways revealing bronchi leading to the lesion25.\nUse the software to create a 3D model of the bronchial tree, where the route to the lesion is planned, starting at the lesion and moving toward the trachea.",
    "NOTE: If a pathway to the lesion cannot be established based on the scans, ENB is not the correct modality for the patient.\nRegistration\n\t\nPlace the patient on a board. Place the three sensors on the thorax to compensate for movements during respiration.\nBegin the procedure with a systematic bronchoscopy24.\nInsert the extended working channel (EWC) and locatable guide into the working channel of the bronchoscope until the tip of the locatable guide is visible.\nLock the locatable guide.\nPress Start registration on the machine or use the foot pedal.\nInsert the bronchoscope stepwise in each lobar bronchus, starting contralaterally and ending in the lobe with the lesion. The position and movements are registered by the system, and the information is used to match the registration of the patient´s airways to the 3D model of the bronchial tree created based on the CT scan. Start the registration on the opposite side from the lesion and finish closest to the target.\nWhen the system shows that all lobes are registered, press Review registration to see if the registration points match the virtual 3D model. If there is a mismatch, repeat steps 2.2.5-2.2.7 (see Figure 3D).\nNavigation\n\t\nPress the foot pedal to begin the navigation. The software will demonstrate a route to the target. Use the central navigation in the larger airways, displaying the video image from the camera along an image of the route in the 3D model of the airways (see Figure 3A).\nFollow the preplanned route until the scope cannot be advanced further.\nUnlock the EWC and locatable guide.\nSwitch from central navigation to peripheral navigation by pressing the foot pedal.",
    "NOTE: Peripheral navigation is used when advancing the EWC. During this part, the 3D model of the airways is visible alongside the CT images from the scan. The target is marked with a green ball and a reticle, which provides direction and distance from the target (see Figure 3B).\nKeep the target on the right side while ensuring that the route is illuminated (\"right and bright\"). Advance the EWC, ensuring the route to the bronchi appears open on the CT images.\n\t\tNOTE: The EWC is maneuverable and can be turned in the desired direction (X, Y, and Z axes) to reach the target.\nOnce the target is in the center of the reticle, with a distance of 0.4-0.9 mm from the target, the navigation is complete.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended that the locatable guide is not 0.0 mm from the distance, since this can cause the biopsy tool to extend beyond the target.\nLock the EWC in position and retract the locatable guide from the scope.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65623/65623fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic navigation.

Fluoroscopy, rEBUS, and tissue sampling\nNOTE: Once the locatable guide is retracted, fluoroscopy can be used without disturbing the electromagnetic field.\nPlace the C-arm over the patient and adjust until the lesion is visible in the image.\nConfirm the correct position of the EWC using fluoroscopy and by inserting the rEBUS probe as described in step 1.2.5. If the EWC is not in the lesion under fluoroscopy or a consolidation does not appear using rEBUS, the position must be adjusted as described in steps 1.2.4-1.2.6.",
    "NOTE: CT-to-body divergence occurs when the alignment between the constructed 3D model and the real-time registration points is skewed; the marked target will not be at the location of the lesion.\nWhen the correct location is reached and confirmed, perform tissue sampling as described in steps 1.3.1-1.3.2.\nSubscription Required.
