    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLentiviral transduction: packaging\nTiming: 5 days\nHEK293T cells are used to package the gene of interest and generate virus to use for infection of mES cells. Here, a 90% confluent plate of HEK293T cells is transfected with three plasmids: psPAX2, pMD2.G, and the gene of interest in the modified pTRIPZ.\nSeed HEK293T Cells for Packaging\nCells should be split the day before transfection such that a 100 × 20 mm dish reaches 90% confluency (  ∼  3 ×  10 6    cells) in 14 mL of complete HEK293T cell medium the following day.\nPrepare transfection mixture using CaPO4\nPrepare Solution A. Refer to solution A Recipe for details. Actual plasmid volumes needed are concentration dependent and should be added as accurately as possible.\nNote: psPAX-2 and pMD2.G are safe to handle when separate. However, after they have been combined and have entered cells, the production of virus will begin. At this point, all material in contact with virus should be treated with detergent and sterilized by UV light in class 2 biosafety cabinet before transferring to autoclave for sterilization.\nPrepare 2× HBSS. Refer to 2× HBSS recipe for details. Adjust pH to 7.1 by dropwise adding 10 N NaOH. Add water to 250 mL. Filter-sterilize through 0.22 μm filter flask (Note: The pH is crucial for experimental success. The optimal pH should be between 7.05 and 7.12) (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nAdd 1,050 μL of 2 × HBSS dropwise while vortexing such that the solution reaches roughly halfway up the side of a 15 mL Falcon tube. Wait at least 5 s between drops so that the addition takes around 3–5 min (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).",
    "Note: the dropwise addition of HBSS is vitally important to prevent the formation of large DNA-ion particles. If these particles get too large, they cannot easily enter the cell and packaging efficiency is lowered.\nVortex solution at max speed for 1.5 min to ensure a proper mix.\nIncubate between 20°C–25°C for ∼10 min until a marginal turbidity is seen. Comparing the solution to a similar volume of water is helpful to discern this turbid.\nNote: If the change in opacity can be easily seen, this generally indicates that these particles are too large. Paying close attention to phenomena rather than time passed will lead to higher packaging efficiency.\nPlate the transfection mixture dropwise evenly over entire plate of cells. Breaking the plate into thirds and plating a 700 μL volume per section helps ensure an even distribution of Solution A.\nLook at the cells with a conventional light microscope. If black dots are seen, this is an indication that larger particles formed and there will likely be a lower packaging efficiency (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12 h\nIt is recommended to store cells within a separate tray or container inside the incubator to prevent any spread of virus.\nAfter incubation look at cells under a light microscope and two major phenomena should be seen among a small fraction of cells: fusion of cells to form large colonies and cell bursting (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Medium will likely have changed to a yellowish color.\nNote: At this stage, phenotypic changes should occur in only a subset of cells. If more than 10% of cells have already changed, the initial incubation of medium went for too long. Reduce to 10–11 h as necessary.",
    "Remove medium into a separate container that has detergent (1.5–2.0% (V/V) LpH®se Nonsterile Disinfectant) added. Used pipettes should be placed in this container and filled with detergent-containing solution to ensure virus has been neutralized.\nFill plate with fresh HEK293T culture medium and incubate for 5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nRepeat steps 7 and 8 one more time, placing medium and used pipettes into detergent bottle.\nNote: Wash step is key for removing CaCl2 from medium. This is necessary when infecting cells that are sensitive to changes in Ca2+ concentration.\nAdd 12 mL fresh HEK293T culture medium.\nNote: all virus-containing medium and any equipment that touched it should be treated with detergent and UV-sterilized in class 2 biosafety cabinet before transferring to autoclave for sterilization.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 h. During this time, cells should continue to fuse and/or burst (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). A successful packaging should have over 90% of cells fused or burst. Medium should maintain a normal color or turn a pink/orange color.\nLentiviral transduction: infection\nTiming: 7–10 days\nViral titer from HEK293T cells is harvested. This is used to infect mES cells with the gene of interest by incorporating plasmid DNA into the genomic DNA of the cell with the aid of the polymer polybrene to interact with the negative surface of cells more easily. Cells that are integrated with the gene of interest are selected using puromycin (see a simplified plasmid map in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1182-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A simplified plasmid map showing puromycin selective marker\nPlease note that some elements are not shown in the simplified plasmid, thus the shown elements in the figure are not proportional.",
    "Create single-cell suspension of mES cells (transfer 20% of an 80% confluent 100 × 20 mm dish). It is important cells are single to increase surface area for virus to enter the cell and helps increase infection efficiency.\nCentrifuge to pellet cells (300 rcf, 5 min, 4°C).\nRemove medium and resuspend in 1.0 mL 5 × mES culture medium (or another nutrient-rich culture medium) in a 50 mL falcon tube.\nCollect virus-containing medium from HEK293T cells. Use caution as the medium will be virus-rich at this point. PPE including an extra set of gloves and a lab coat is recommended.\nCentrifuge to remove any dead cells from medium (1,000 rcf, 5 min, 4°C.\nTransfer virus-containing medium to falcon tube containing mES cells. Since the transducing efficiency is very low for mES cells (typically below 5% of 1–3 million mES cells), the titration of viral tier is not necessary. However, if working with readily transducing cells, such as HeLa cells, titration may be necessary to avoid multiple copies of fusion genes integrating into the genome.\nAdd polybrene to a final concentration of 8 μg/mL.\nIncubate 6–8 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, resuspending the solution every 2 h to mix cells and ensure interaction with virus.\nEnsure the cap of 50 mL falcon tube is only loosely attached to allow airflow to cells during incubation\nPlate entire solution onto a gelatinated 100 × 20 mm dish.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12 h.\nCells should continue to be stored separately from other cultures.\nRemove medium by pipetting into a separate container with detergent to ensure any remaining virus is killed.\nReplace with 10 mL mES medium.\nRepeat every day until cells reach 60% confluency (typically 2–3 days). ES cells should not undergo any significant morphology changes during this time.",
    "Add 2.0 μg/mL puromycin for selection when replacing medium. If all cells are killed by 2.0 μg/mL puromycin within three days, this may be due to puromycin concentration used or a low viral titer (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nOnce cells have been split and transferred to a culture dish, cells can be treated normally.\ni.e., medium can be removed via suction, pipettes used do not need to go into separate biohazard bags, and cells do not need to be stored separately.\nCells are selected for at least one week in the presence of puromycin. Then cells are maintained in the presence of 1.0 μg/mL puromycin.\nNote: After cell death appears below 0. 1% and cells have a healthy morphology, a stable cell line has been created.\nNote: freezing cells in liquid nitrogen for later use is key for preserving cell lines.\nmES cells should be split every 2–3 days, with a daily medium change to prevent any cell differentiation. The same circular morphology will be maintained if cells are healthy.\nSingle molecule tracking: population\nTiming: 3–4 days\nJanelia Fluor® 549 (JF549) HaloTag® dye is utilized at the picomolar concentration to sparsely label molecules from protein of interest, typically 5–20 labeled molecules per frame. This can be achieved through varying dye concentrations or culturing cells in the presence of 0.1 ug/mL doxycycline or without doxycycline (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]). This data is used to obtain the percent of chromatin-bound, confined diffusing, and freely diffusing molecules within the total molecular population.\nOnce cell line has reached stable expression after multiple passages, for the following 72 h culture the cells in the absence or presence of 0.1 ug/mL doxycycline.\nThe day before splitting the cells for imaging, coat the bottom of the imaging plate with 0.2% gelatin.",
    "After 12–16 h, remove the gelatin and replace it with fresh gelatin.\nBefore seeding cells into the imaging plates remove gelatin.\nSeed the cells into multiple imaging plates with 0.5–0.7 million cells per plate.\nIt is important that cells are seeded in a single-cell suspension and cells are plated in a monolayer for clear imaging.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 between 16 and 24 h. Longer culture duration leads mES cells to become multilayer.\nGently remove the culture media by pipetting.\nAdd fresh culture media with the addition of 50 pM JF549 HaloTag® dye to obtain 5–20 labeled molecules per frame.\nNote: Depending on the cell type, the necessary concentration of ligand may vary. Concentrations ranging from 10–50 pM are frequently utilized for experiment (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nIncubate for 15 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 covered from light.\nRemove the culture media by pipetting and discard it.\nGently wash the cells once with PBS.\nAdd fresh culture medium and incubate for 30 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 covered from light.\nRemove the culture media by pipetting and discard it.\nGently wash the cells once with PBS.\nAdd FluoroBrite DMEM live-cell imaging medium supplemented with 10% FBS into the imaging plate.\nAcquire images using an Axio Observer D1 (Zeiss, Germany) Total Internal Reflection (TIRF) microscope equipped with an Alpha Plan-apochromat 100 × /1.46 oil immersion objective (Zeiss, Germany) with an additional 2.5 × magnification was equipped on the emission pathway. A Solid-state Laser-stack (3i) was used to excite JF549 at 552 nm. A Brightline® single-band laser filter set (Semrock; excitation filter: FF01-561/14, emission filter: FF01-609/54, and dichroic mirror: Di02-R561-25 3 36) was used for the excitation and emission spectra of JF549.",
    "Maintain cells at 37°C using a single-channel temperature controller (TC-324, Warner Instruments) and acquire all images within 90 min from taking cells out of 5% CO2.\nFocus on a single nucleus such that as many particles as possible are clear. Stably bound proteins are easier to identify and so the eye is drawn to them. Ensure that transiently bound particles are still visible (see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]).\nTake a stroboscopic video of the nuclei with the following conditions: intensification 200–700, number of frames 100, dark time (ms) 0 or 20, exposure time (ms) 30 or 10, laser power (mW) 7.5, TIRF angle 6.65–6.80.\nNote: both TIRF angle and focus may need minor adjustments between each cell imaged as depth and curvature changes slightly between cells. Intensification adjustments ensure the final image is bright enough to be seen clearly after being exported.\nSingle molecule tracking: residence time\nTiming: 3–4 days\nCells cultured in 0.1 μg/mL doxycycline for 3 days were treated with JF549 dye at the picomolar concentration level to label only a subset of molecules (between 5–20 for any given frame) and allow for accurate tracking of individual molecules. It is important to limit the number of molecules per frame because crossing tracks are difficult for algorithms to account for. This data is used to obtain the residence time of bound protein and fraction of specific and non-specific interactions.\nOnce cell line has reached stable expression after multiple passages, for the following 72 h culture the cells in the absence or presence of 0.1 ug/mL doxycycline.\nThe day before splitting the cells for imaging, coat the bottom of the imaging plate with 0.2% gelatin.\nAfter 12–16 h, remove the gelatin and replace it with fresh gelatin.\nBefore seeding cells into the imaging plates remove gelatin",
    "Seed the cells into multiple imaging plates.\nIt is important that cells are seeded in a single-cell suspension as one layer.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 between 16 and 24 h. Longer culture duration leads mES cells to become multilayer.\nRemove the culture media by pipetting.\nAdd fresh culture media with the addition of 10–50 pM JF549 HaloTag® Ligand to obtain 5–20 labeled molecules per frame.\nNote: Depending on the cell type and protein being studied, the concentration of ligand may vary. Manipulation of dye concentration will allow for sparse labelling of HT fused proteins that is required for residence time experiments.\nIncubate for 15 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 covered from light.\nRemove the culture media by pipetting and discard it.\nGently wash the cells once with PBS.\nAdd fresh culture medium and incubate for 30 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 covered from light.\nRemove the culture media by pipetting and discard it.\nGently wash the cells once with PBS.\nAdd FluoroBrite DMEM live-cell imaging medium supplemented with 10% FBS into the imaging plate.\nAcquire images using an Axio Observer D1 (Zeiss, Germany) Total Internal Reflection (TIRF) microscope equipped with an Alpha Plan-apochromat 100 × /1.46 oil immersion objective (Zeiss, Germany) with an additional 2.5 × magnification was equipped on the emission pathway.

    "Focus on a single nucleus such that as many particles as possible are clear. Stably bound proteins are easier to identify and so the eye is drawn to them. Ensure that even transiently bound particles are still visible (see troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13]).\nNote: look for cells that are healthy and securely attached to the surface of the coverslip as any cell shifting during imaging will result in false movement and the video cannot be used.\nTake a stroboscopic video of the nuclei with the following conditions: intensification 500–700, number of frames 400, dark time (ms) 170, exposure time (ms) 30, laser power (mW) 2.25, TIRF angle 6.65–6.80.\nNote: both TIRF angle and focus may need minor adjustments between each cell imaged as depth and curvature changes slightly between cells. Intensification adjustments ensure the final image is bright enough to be seen clearly after being exported.\nSingle molecule tracking: particles within condensates\nTiming: 3–4 days\nA combination of dyes is used to monitor the dynamics of molecules in condensates. HaloTag® TMR Ligand is utilized at the 20–50 nM concentration to stain condensates, and Janelia Fluor® 646 (JF646) dye is used at picomolar concentration to track a subset of molecules. Images are taken of condensates, then time lapse of molecular dynamics are captured immediately after. Immediately following, another image is taken of the condensates to check for cell movement during image acquisition. Appending these frames allows for location of condensates and tracks of individual molecules, enabling relationships between dynamics and condensates to be explored. This data is used to obtain angular dynamics, the percent of protein in condensates and bound fraction in condensates.\nOnce cell line has reached stable expression after multiple passages, for the following 72 h culture the cells in the absence or presence of 0.1 ug/mL doxycycline.",
