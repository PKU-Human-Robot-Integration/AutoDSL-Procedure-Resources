    "Notes: Perform all centrifugation and staining steps at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Flow cytometry sorter should be set to 100 μm nozzle. Prepare all reagents ahead of time and warm to room temperature if necessary.  Optional: To label adhesion molecules, such as VCAM1 which is uniquely enriched in arterial and venous BECs (Vanlandewijck et al., 2018; Yousef et al., 2018), on BECs for vessel segmental enrichment. If VCAM1 (or another adhesion molecule) labeling is desired, conjugate anti-VCAM1 mAb and rat IgG1 isotype control antibody to DyLightTM-488 according to manufacturer’s instructions.  Mice: Mice were anesthetized with avertin and perfused with 20 ml cold PBS following blood collection.  Optional: Set controls using LPS-stimulated mice: Mice were treated with LPS for 16 h and 2 h before perfusion (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice were injected with fluorescently labeled anti-VCAM1 mAb (100 µg, r.o.) or IgG1 isotype control 2 h prior to cell isolation and flow cytometry analysis. All experimental (healthy) mice are also injected with anti-VCAM1 mAb (100 µg, r.o.) 2 h prior to cell isolation if vessel segmental enrichment is desired. Tissue DissociationFor each sample, usually comprising of dissected cortex/hippocampus from 1-2 brains for applications such as bulk RNA-Seq, or pooled hippocampi (from 4 mice) for applications such as single cell RNA-Seq (Yousef et al., 2018), preheat 1.5 ml of Buffer X from Neural Dissociation Kit (NDK) + 9 μl of 2-Mercaptoethanol (BME) + 50 μl Enzyme P from NDK in 15 ml Falcon tubes in a 37 °C water bath.Remove meninges by rolling whole brain on Whatman paper.Dissect hippocampus, cortex, and remainder of the brain using microscissors and forceps in a sterile plate. Separate individual tissues and roughly chop into fine bits using a razor blade.",
    "Chop the brain segments to such a degree that you can pass the minced tissue through a trimmed, 1 ml pipettor (trimmed meaning the very tip is cut off to increase the diameter of the hole so that minced tissue can get through), but not so chopped that it becomes very mushy and could go through an untrimmed 1 ml pipettor. If the brain is too minced, it might be overly digested in the enzyme mixture in subsequent steps leading to cell loss. Alternatively, if isolating the hippocampus or other very small brain regions separately, it is not necessary to mince in a sterile plate. Rather, transfer each dissected small tissue using sterile forceps into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes with 0.5 ml of Buffer X from NDK and chop finely with microscissors.Using a trimmed 1 ml tip (trimmed meaning the very tip is cut off to slightly increase the diameter of the hole), transfer finely chopped samples to the preheated Buffer X solution prepared in Step A1. Triturate 10 times with the same pipette tip. Incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min. Flick tubes every 5 min of incubation. Prepare Enzyme 2 Mix from NDK for each sample: 10 μl of Enzyme A + 20 μl Buffer Y.Add 30 μl of Enzyme 2 Mix into each sample and triturate 10 times with a 1 ml pipette tip, start 10 min timer from when the first sample receives the Enzyme 2 Mix. Incubate samples in a 37 °C water bath for the remainder of the 10 min timer, flick samples every 5 min. Note: Be quick! Do not over incubate, over digestion will result in poor yields. Prepare 50 ml tubes with 70 μm cell strainers, wash strainers with 1 ml of mDPBS.",
    "Collect the flowthrough in the 50 ml tube. Triturate samples 10 times with a 1 ml pipette tip and immediately add 10 ml mDPBS.Pass all of the supernatant through a 70 μm cell strainer prepared in Step A7. Wash through another 5 ml mDPBS.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and collect the pellet. Carefully pipette out supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Myelin Removal and StainingResuspend pellets in 5 ml (2.5 ml for Hippocampus samples) of 0.9 M Sucrose and transfer each pellet to a 15 ml tube. Centrifuge at 850 x g for 15 min. Discard the supernatant, and collect the pellet. Carefully pipette out and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.Sample resuspensionFor Hippocampus samples:Resuspend pellet in 2 ml FACS buffer, transfer to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube and wait for other tissue type samples before continuing to Step B3.For Cortex and Whole Brain samples: Resuspend pellet in 1 ml 0.9 M Sucrose before further adding another 2 ml of Sucrose. Centrifuge at 850 x g for 15 min. Discard supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml FACS buffer, transfer to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube.Centrifuge all samples at 300 x g for 5 min. Prepare Fc Blocking solution (100 µl per sample): For 10 samples, dilute 10 μl Fc Block in 1 ml FACS buffer. Plan which Compensation standards will be needed (Single Channel comps for each marker, and 2 unstained controls, with and without propidium iodide (PI) which is added in Step C3 below). Cell pellets are visible for cortex pooled samples, but likely not visible for hippocampal samples. Note the estimated cell numbers in Step C6 below.",
    "Resuspend each sample in 100 μl of Fc Blocking solution prepared in Step B3 above (For the sample to be used in Compensation standards, add an extra 25 μl of Fc Blocking solution to the sample for each planned Compensation standard). Incubate on a shaker for 5-10 min at room temperature.Add the following antibodies (1:100) and incubate on a shaker for 30 min at RT:Anti-CD31-APC Anti-CD11b-BV421 Anti-CD45-APC/Cy7 or anti-CD45-FITCNote: If mice were injected with fluorescently labeled anti-mouse VCAM1-DyLightTM488 as described above, stain CD45 in the APC/Cy7 channel, and also gate CD31+VCAM1+ cells in the APC and FITC channels.  Add 1.8 ml of FACS buffer to dilute the samples, then centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Prepare Sorting Mix: FACS buffer + PI (1:5,000 of a 1 mg/ml stock) + RNase Inhibitor (1:500) (For 5 ml: Add 1 μl PI and 10 μl RNase Inhibitor). Carefully pipette out supernatant and resuspend each sample (except Compensation standards, resuspend comps in 0.5 ml FACS buffer) in 0.5 ml of Sorting Mix.Transfer all samples through cell strainer capped FACS tubes (Blue 40 μm cell strainer caps). Keep on ice and covered from light until sorted by flow cytometry. If collecting whole population cells: Prepare 1.5 ml RNase-free collection tubes with 0.5 ml of RNA later. Be prepared to dilute samples to a total volume of 1.3 ml with RNA later after collecting cells and snap freeze samples with dry ice. If collecting single cells: have plates prepared with RNA lysis buffer as instructed by manufacturer for the technique chosen, and kept frozen and stored at -80 °C until used for cell sorting (aka, Smart-seq-2 protocol as described previously [Picelli et al., 2014; Darmanis et al., 2015], was used in Yousef et al. [2018] study).",
    "Notes: This protocol does not cover detailed instructions for FACS parameter setup. For assistance, please contact your FACS core facility manager or FACS machine vendor. Use a 100 µm nozzle. While sorting, keep the threshold rate around or below 100x the value of the set frequency (typically fewer than 2,800 events per second). Estimated sort time is 15-20 min per stained sample. FACS and sample collectionRun unstained cells to set up forward (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A) (Figure 2B).Run single-color controls to set FACS parameters and compensate for channel spillover.Add 1:5,000 PI from a stock of 1 mg/ml (0.2 µg/ml final concentration) (or 1:500 from 1:10 pre-dilution) PI for live/dead staining right before running the individual sample, if it was not already added at Step B7 of Myelin Removal and Staining section above. For your first run and whenever obtaining a new antibody: Run controls in which cells are stained with all antibodies except for one, to determine positive cell populations and set up gates accordingly. Run stained FACS sample:Gate cells on forward (FSC-A = size) and sideward scatter (SSC-A = internal structure) to exclude cell debris and residual myelinPlot FSC-A against FSC-W to discriminate single cells from cell doublets/aggregates.Exclude PI positive (dead) cells.Exclude CD11b+CD45+ monocytes/macrophages and microglial cells by gating on CD45 and CD11b negative cells.Gate on CD31+ BECs and collect cells from this gate to obtain a pure brain endothelial cell population. Record at least 1 x 106 events.Collect cells in either: 1.5 ml RNase-free tubes containing FACS buffer (if RNA integrity is less of a concern) or 0.5 ml RNA later (to preserve for later RNA isolation for bulk RNA-Seq). If containing 0.5 ml of RNA later: Ideally, 100,000 cells or more are needed for optimal RNA extraction. Top off the RNA later up to 1.",
    "3 ml before mixing well and snap freezing the samples with dry ice. Store at -80 °C until RNA isolation. When spinning down the cells to extract RNA, thaw cells and warm to room temperature before 10 min centrifugation at 1,000 x g. Isolate total RNA from the cell pellets using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (QIAGEN). Assess RNA quantities and RNA quality using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). All samples passed a quality control threshold (RIN ≥ 8.5) to proceed to library preparations and RNA-Seq.Single cells in a 96-well plate with RNA lysis buffer for single cell RNA-Seq (according to Smart-Seq-2 [Picelli et al., 2014; Darmanis et al., 2015] or other preferred protocol). Notes:Keep plates frozen on dry ice until just before they are used to sort cells. Immediately after cell sorting, cover each plate with an aluminum freezing compatible lid, vortex the plate to mix cells with RNA lysis buffer, and freeze plate on dry ice until it can be transferred and stored at -80 °C until RNA isolation.  For a typical sample of 1-2 cortex/hippocampi to isolate cells in bulk for RNA extraction (aka for bulk RNA-Seq), sorting by flow cytometry will result in around 100,000 isolated CD31+BECs per sample. For a typical sample of 4 pooled hippocampi, sorting by flow cytometry results in collection of a few thousand to tens of thousands of cells which varies by prep, cell collection method (bulk or single cell) and if VCAM1 is enriched."
