    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFeces and colonic tissue collection\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThese steps are to collect fresh feces and colonic tissues to be used for downstream analysis.\nCollect fresh feces.\nPlace mouse in a sterile container and await defecation.\nCollect using sterilized forceps. Those feces should be immediately preserved at –80°C, or frozen in dry ice temporarily before transporting.\nEuthanize mice by means of euthanasia which are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nIncise the abdomen and collect colonic tissue from the mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3058-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissecting a mouse and processing the tissues\nSpray 70% ethanol onto the abdomen and thorax entirely.\nCreate a 5–10 mm of horizontal incision in the abdomen and peel back the skin to expose the peritoneum.\nCut again. Hold each side of the incision and pull to open the abdomen.\nIdentify the cecum. Cut with scissors to pull out the intestinal tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nRemove cecum and small intestine.\nCut and open the colonic tissue longitudinally by using a blunt ended scissor.\nWash off fecal contents and mucus by immersing the colonic tissue in CMF PBS at room temperature.\nTransfer the colonic tissue to another CMF PBS to wash off again (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nImmediately move forward to the colonic tissue digestion step, or cool the tissue in ice-cold CMF HBSS/FBS before transporting (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3058-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Critical: To see the effect of NMP administration on microbiota, it is important to collect feces at pre-NMP treatment conditions, in addition to post-NMP treatment conditions, which will be stored at 80°C and subjected to 16s rRNA metagenomic analysis at the end. Colonic tissue can temporarily be transported in ice-cold CMF HBSS/FBS, but it should move to the following step as soon as possible.\nOptional: In step 5, luminal contents can be collected for further microbiota analysis depending on the purpose. Keep in mind the microbiota composition of luminal contents can be different from that of feces.\nColonic tissue digestion\nTiming: 2 h\nThese steps to prepare the colonic tissue to be digested.\nPrepare collagenase solution: 1.5 mg/mL Type IV Collagenase dissolved in pre-warmed CMF HBSS/FBS with 40 μg/mL of DNase at 37°C.\nCut the colonic tissue into approximately 1.5 cm pieces.\nTransfer it into separate 50 mL conical tubes with 30 mL of pre-warmed CMF HBSS/FBS and 2 mM EDTA.\nUse a single 50 mL conical tube for the pieces of colonic tissue per mouse.\nPlace each 50 mL conical tube horizontally in a pre-warmed orbital shaker (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) and shake at 250 rpm for 20 min at 37°C.\nPut a mesh wire strainer over a waste bucket and pour the contents of each 50 mL conical tube through to recover the 1.5 cm pieces of colonic tissues (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace the tissues in another 50 mL conical tube with 30 mL of pre-warmed CMF HBSS/FBS with 2 mM EDTA.\nRepeat 3 and 4.\nPour the contents of each 50 mL conical tube through the wire strainer. Transfer 1.5 cm pieces of colonic tissues to a small plastic weigh boat.\nMince the 1.5 cm pieces of colonic tissues 10 times using scissors in the weigh boat (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Add minced tissues into 20 mL of collagenase solution.\nPlace each 50 mL conical tube into an orbital shaker to digest at 200 rpm for 10–15 min at 37°C.\nVortex shortly to confirm sufficient dissociation of colonic tissues (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Filter through a 100 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nAdd 30 mL of ice-cold CMF HBSS/FBS and centrifuge at 440 G for 5 min at 4°C by using a floor-standing centrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatant to find a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 50 mL of ice-cold CMF HBSS/FBS.\nRepeat the centrifugation one more time.\nDiscard the supernatant. Use the cell pellet in the following steps.\nIsolation of immune cells and RNA isolation\nTiming: 2 h\nThese steps to isolate CD45+ colonic immune cells and purify RNA.\nPrepare MACS buffer on ice by mixing MACS BSA stock solution and autoMACS rinsing solution (1:20).\nResuspend the cell pellet obtained from the previous step into the MACS buffer with CD45 MACS beads according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nWash cells with MACS buffer and centrifuge at 440 G for 10 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL ice-cold MACS buffer and pass through a 100 μm cell strainer.\nEnrich for magnetic bead-attached cells by positive selection using MACS LS magnetic column by passing through a 40 μm cell strainer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nWash cells with ice-cold CMF PBS and centrifuge at 440 G for 10 min at 4°C.\nRepeat step 6 once more.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 350 μL of RLT buffer to lyse cells.\nPurify RNA by using RNeasy Plus Micro kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPurified RNA was quantified by NanoDrop and preserved in a −80°C freezer until used for RNA-seq.",
    "Optional: In step 8, TRIzol (Sigma-Aldrich) or other RNA-preserving reagents can be used instead of RLT buffer.\nPause point: After step 8, RLT buffer can be preserved at –80°C."
