    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissection and isolation of aNSCs\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step describes the procedure for brain dissection followed by digestion and trituration of tissue into single cells. It is possible to use this protocol for isolation of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) from the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ).\nIn the protocol, two separate sets of surgical kit are required to prevent contamination from mouse tissue, hair or other sources. Surgery Kit A: To harvest the brain tissue from the adult mouse (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and Surgery Kit B: for further dissection of the required brain regions (dentate gyrus of the hippocampus or the subventricular zone tissue) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/642-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Steps of DG and SVZ isolation from the adult mouse brain\n(A) Photograph of the surgery equipment needed for harvest of the adult mouse brain.\n(B) Photograph of the surgery equipment for the isolation of the SVZ and DG from harvested adult mouse brain. Note that two separate sets of surgical kit are used to prevent contamination from mouse tissue, hair or other sources.\n(C–E) Dissection steps of the adult mouse brain. Through coronal sections the brain is dissected while being placed on its dorsal surface. The black arrowhead points to the Optic chiasm (C), the regions between the white lines and blue lines represent the SVZ and DG isolation sections respectively (D).\n(F–K) Steps of SVZ isolation. The black arrows indicate the lateral ventricles (F). Firstly, the septal area (Sp) is removed, followed by dissecting the SVZs each at a time. The white arrowheads show the isolated SVZ tissue (J–F).\nNote: the dashed white lines (F and G) represent the SVZ borders bilaterally.",
    "(L–Q) Steps of DG isolation. The dashed blue lines represent the regions of the DG (L). A scalpel (or alternatively a needle 26–27G) is used to gently separate the DG from the surrounding tissue on both right and left sides (M–O). The blue arrowheads show the isolated DG tissue (P-Q).\nNote: 1-mm thick sections were measured and used for isolation of both DG and SVZ. Moreover, the use of an angled forceps to fix/stabilize the brain sections during the isolation steps is preferred. Scale bars, 5 mm.\nCritical: Good handling and quick transition between the steps of the procedure is desired.\nEuthanize one adult (age 6–24 weeks) C57BL/6 mouse.\nSterilize the dissection area, surgery tools, and the head of the euthanized mouse with 70% ethanol.\nSurgically remove the brain and transfer it to a 50-mL tube with ice cold dissection buffer.\nUsing the Optic Chiasm as an anatomical landmark (≈0 mm Bregma point) slice the brain into 1.0 mm coronal sections using a Mouse Brain Slicer Matrix at 0 -+1 mm Bregma and -1–-2 mm Bregma for the SVZ and the hippocampal DG respectively.\nCollect the slices containing the hippocampus or the SVZ into a 10 cm petri dish filled with ice cold dissection buffer.\nUnder a microscope, quickly but carefully isolate the dentate gyrus or SVZ out of each relevant slice.Use a scalpel or a needle (26 or 27 G) to dissect the DG or SVZ while stabilizing the slice/section using angled forceps for easier and much accurate tissue isolation. Please refer to (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]) Then:\nImmediately transfer the dissected tissue into the cap of a 15-mL tube or another petri dish and mince it with a fine scissor.",
    "Once minced, attach the cap to its 15-mL tube with 10 mL ice cold dissection buffer and rotate slowly once to suspend the tissue chunks. Keep the tube on ice during further dissection.\nKeep adding the dissected and minced tissue to the same 15-mL tube.\nAfter finishing the dissection of all relevant brain sections, spin down the tissue at 200 g for 1 min at 18°C–25°C.\nIn a laminar flow cabinet aspirate the dissection buffer and add 1 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the 15-mL tube containing tissue chunks.\nIncubate at 37°C with slow mixing such as gentle rotation or light shaking in a water bath.\nAfter the 15-20 min, confirm adequate digestion by pipetting slowly up and down a few times with a p1000 pipet.\nIf the digestion is inadequate, continue digestion at 37°C for 5-15 min. However, do not exceed 30 min of digestion as this can severely affect viability of the cells and result in increased debris in the culture afterward. Please refer to (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3])\nAdd 1 mL of Trypsin inhibitor solution to inhibit further digestion and incubate for 20 min at 37°C with slow mixing.\nTriturate the tissue by pipetting up and down 10–20 times until only few tissue clumps are visible (first using a p1000 then p200).\nAdd 8 mL of wash media and pellet the triturate cells at 200 g for 5 min at 18°C–25°C.\nWash the cells two times by resuspending the cells in 10 mL wash media and then spinning at 200 g for 5 min.\nWash the cells once in 6 mL growth media and spin down at 200 g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of growth media and plate them into a single well of a low-adherent 24-well culture plate.",
    "Incubate the cells in a 5% CO2 37°C incubator for 48 h.\nAfter 48 h, exchange half of the media with fresh growth media. For this, slowly aspirate media from a single periphery point as most neurospheres should be condensed towards the center of the well.\nContinue to replace half of the media with fresh growth media every second day.\nAfter 1–2 weeks neurospheres should form (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), at this point proceed to next step for passage of aNSCs. Please refer to (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/642-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Neurospheres derived from the adult mouse brain\nWithin 7–10 days post isolation of aNSCs, neurospheres were detected.\n(A-C) Phase contrast images of SVZ derived neurospheres 7 days post isolation (A), after dissociation into single cells (B) and after the first passage (C) of aNSCs. Scale bars, 100 μm.\nCritical: Avoid generating excess air bubbles during the triturating and wash steps as this can affect cell viability.\nOptional: In the last wash step, it can be beneficial to pass the cells through a 100 μm cell strainer to remove undigested tissue.\nAlternatives: Mice strains other than the C57BL/6 background can in principle be used. However, cell yield and viability might be affected. Thus, some method optimization for other mice strains might be required.\nPassage of aNSCs\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step outlines how to passage isolated aNSCs. We recommend to culture the aNSCs in low adherence 6 well plates or 35 mm petri dishes. Neurospheres should be passaged at around a size of 50–100 μm in diameter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) as described (Guo et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Liu et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Growing the neurospheres larger than 250 μm, could result in reduced growth rate (Mori et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) and inner core cell death due to lack of nutrients and oxygen.",
    "Carefully collect all neurospheres using a p1000 into a 15-mL tube and spin down at 200 g for 5 min at 18°C–25°C.\nAspirate the media and add 1 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for each well/dish.\nIncubate at 37°C with slow mixing for 1–2 min.\nAdd equal volume of Trypsin inhibitor and triturate into single cells (first using a p1000 then p200).\nAdd equal volume of growth media and spin down at 200g 5 min.\nAspirate and suspend the cells in growth media.\nCount cell number and viability.\nSeed cells at 1×10ˆ5 cells/mL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) into a low adherent 6-well plate (3 mL per plate) or low adherent 35mm petri dishes (2 mL per dish) and incubate the cells in a 5% CO2 37°C incubator.\nPassage the neurospheres every 2–4 days. Neurospheres should be around 50–100 μm in diameter when passaging (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCritical: Larger formation of spheres should be avoided as cell loss, mainly of inner/core cells due to reduced access to nutrients and oxygen.\nFor general experimental usage, we recommend using the cells between passage 3 and 10.\nNote: During the initial first passages, small tissue debris or clumps of dead cells can remain present. Thus, when collecting the neurospheres, try to avoid disrupting such debris on the bottom of the well. Furthermore, most of the neurospheres tend to accumulate in the center of the well, so collecting from the center only can also reduce the amount of debris.\nNote: At times, instead of growing as neurospheres, some cultured aNSCs can start growing as adherent cells which can lead to differentiation and growth arrest. To avoid this, use low adherent cell plates for suspension culture.\nDifferentiation of aNSCs\nTiming: 7 days\nHere we outline a simple 5-day differentiation protocol for the aNSCs.",
    "Two days before seeding the cells for differentiation, coat flask/wells with 20 μg/mL of Poly-L-ornithine solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 37°C.\nNext day, wash 3×1 min with PBS and coat with 5mg/mL Laminin in PBS over night at 37°C.\nOn the day of cell seeding, wash flask/wells 3×1 min with PBS. On the last wash, wait to aspirate PBS just before adding media/cells. Please refer to (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7])\nCollect neurospheres and triturate them into single cells as described for passaging.\nSeed aNSCs as appropriate for the cell flask/well (approximately 40000 cells per cm2, depending on downstream analysis) and keep the cells in a 5% CO2 37°C incubator.\nCritical: Please refer to the Limitations section under Seeding density part.\nThe next day, exchange half the media with freshly prepared differentiation media. Repeat this every day for the neuron/astrocyte differentiation media and every other day when using the OPC medium to differentiate the aNSCs into neurons/astrocytes and OPCs respectively. This should be continued for a total of 5 days for differentiation.Please refer to (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9])\nAfter 5 days, differentiated cells can be analyzed by quantitative methods such as qPCR, immunofluorescence-based assays, and flow cytometry.\nConfirming aNSCs identity\nTiming: 4 days\nIn this final step, we suggest simple immunofluorescence-based assays to confirm aNSCs identity before using the cells in experimental assays.\nConfirming presence of neural stem cell markers\nSeed aNSCs in Poly-L-ornithine/Laminin coated cell culture slides and incubate the cells for 12–16 hrs in a 5% CO2 37°C incubator.\nNext day, aspirate medium and wash 2×1 min with ice-cold PBS.\nAdd ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 and incubate for 30 min at 18°C–25°C.\nWash 3×5 min with PBS.",
    "Incubate fixed cells with 0.1% T×100 in PBS 15 min at 18°C–25°C , followed by 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01% T×100, in PBS for 30 min.\nIncubate fixed cells with neural stem cell marker antibodies such as anti-nestin (1:400) and anti Sox2 (1:400) in 3% BSA, 0.01% T×100, PBS for 2 h at 18°C–25°C or at 4°C for 12-16 hrs.\nWash 3×5 min in PBS.\nIncubate fixed cells with secondary fluorescence conjugated antibody (1:800) in 3% BSA, 0.01% T×100, PBS for 1 h at 18°C–25°C in the dark.\nWash 1×5 min in PBS\nIncubate cells with DAPI (1:2000) for 5 min.\nWash 2×5 min in PBS and mount cell slides with coverslip.\nApproximately >90% of all cells should be positive for nestin and Sox2 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C respectively).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/642-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Incubate fixed cells with 0.1% T×100 in PBS 15 min at 18°C–25°C , followed by 3% BSA, 0.01% T×100, in PBS for 30 min.\nIncubate fixed cells with neural differentiation antibody markers, such as anti Map2 (1:400) as a neuronal marker, anti GFAP (1:2) as an astrocytic marker, and Olig2 as an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell marker (1:500), in 3% BSA, 0.01% T×100, PBS for 2 h at 18°C–25°C or at 4°C for 12–16 hrs.\nWash 3×5 min in PBS.\nIncubate fixed cells with secondary fluorescence conjugated antibodies (1:800) in 3% BSA, 0.01% T×100, PBS for 1 h at 18°C–25°C in the dark.\nWash 1×5 min in PBS\nIncubate cells with DAPI (1:2000) for 5 min.\nWash 2×5 min in PBS and mount cell slides with coverslip.\nUsing the Neuron/Astrocyte Differentiation media, usually the percentage of Map2 positive derived neurons and GFAP positive derived astrocytes are each roughly 10%–30% of total cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).
