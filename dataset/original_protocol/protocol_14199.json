    "This study was guided and approved by the Department of Laboratory Animal Resources, Yonsei Biomedical Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. This study followed the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Commission on Life Sciences National Research Council. All Pigs were acclimated for One week before the operation.\n1. Preparation\nKeep the pigs without food for over 12 h before general anesthesia with free access to water.\n\tNote: Six female Yorkshire pigs were used weighing 25–30 kg each.\nUse a 16 Gauge Needle of 1 cm length to intramuscularly inject alfaxan (1 mg/kg), xylazine (2 mg/kg), and azaperone (2 mg/kg) behind and below the ear to initiate anesthesia.\nShave the anterior midline of the neck and the abdominal wall of the pig using a surgical hair removal shaver.\nSecure an intravenous (IV) route through central or marginal ear vein on the posterior side of the auricle with a 22-G needle. Inject Ketorolac (1 mg/kg) via an IV line.\nThen inject atropine (0.04 mg/kg) intramuscularly as described in 1.2. Inject cefazolin (30 mg/kg) intramuscularly as described in 1.2.\nPut the pig lying down in a supine position over the Operating room table.\nAllow the pig to breath 2 L of oxygen with 5% of isoflurane through Swine anesthesia mask spontaneously.\nExpose the vocal cords through the mouth by using a laryngoscope and spray them with two puffs of 2% Lidocaine topical solution to prevent intubation-induced laryngospasm.\nIntubate with a 6.5 mm tube, inflate the tube cuff with 3-5 mL of air using a syringe without a needle attached to it.",
    "Note: Perform capnometry to ensure that the tracheal tube, which is a part of the anesthesia machine, is in proper position and there is CO2 back to the machine as an indication of proper oxygenation.\nMaintain the anesthesia after the intubation with 2% isoflurane.\nUse the vet ointment on pig’s eyes and close it with an eye cover patch.\n2. Procedure: Reception Site\nDisinfect the neck and the abdominal wall with the iodine-based scrub solution 1%.\nStart a vertical midline incision in the anterior neck using blade No. 23 up to the sternum.\nDissect the strap muscles and retract it laterally using Kelly tissue scissor and Lahey retractor.\nExpose the trachea from the first ring to the thoracic inlet.\nThen, expose the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein for the anastomosis.\nCreate a window in the second or third tracheal cartilage, ~1 cm in width using blade no. 11.\nLook for the endotracheal tube through the tracheal defect created, and make sure the aeration through the tube is continued using the ventilator without a leak.\n3. Procedure: Flap Site\nNote: The superior epigastric artery perforator (SEAP) flap harvest can be performed, according to the method described by Frederic Bodin7.\nDesign a flap on the upper abdomen by a surgical marker pen (Figure 1A).\nCreate an elliptical Skin incision 4 x 3 cm using a No. 23 scalpel to the anterior sheath of the abdominal wall on the medial side of the drawn flap (Figure 1B).\nElevate (peel) the Flap from the rectus abdominis muscle sheath looking for the perforators going to the skin flap while holding the fascia by the allis.\nPerform the intramuscular dissection and follow the perforators to the superior epigastric vessels (Figure 1B)",
    "Now perform the lateral skin incision on the designed flap (Figure 1A) using a No. 23 scalpel (Figure 1C)\nClamp the superior epigastric vessels and venae comitantes with the hemostat superiorly and use Kelly tissue scissors to cut below the hemostat and ligate the vessel above the hemostat by 3-0 suture. Then take off the hemostat.\n4. Anastomosis and Closure\nPut on a surgical loupe.\nClamp the Carotid artery using two hemostats with 1-2 cm distance between them.\nUse micro-scissors to cut between the carotid artery and tie the superior part by double suture insure no oozing.\nUse the double clamp without the frame between the carotid artery and flap artery.\nStart anastomosis by using 10-0 suture simple full thickness interpreted.\nPlace the first two stay sutures approximately 120 degrees apart on the vessel’s circumference then in between place 2-3 stitches.\nRelease the clamp. If there is blood oozing do the similar suture at the oozing site.\nLook for the venous back flow from venae comitantes.\nPerform anastomosis as described in step 4.1 to 4.7 for the internal jugular vein and venae comitantes (Figure 1D).\nUse a syringe needle size 18 to prick the skin to ensure flap viability by seeing a blood drop.\nClose the tracheal window and suture it with the muscle fascia of the SEAP flap using 3-0 suture.\nExteriorize and suture a skin paddle of the SEAP flap to the cervical midline skin incision (Figure 2A).\nClose the abdominal skin incision (Figure 2B).\n5. Post-operative Care\nGet the pig back into the prone position.\nStop the isoflurane and wean the pig from the ventilator.\nAllow the pig to recover in the animal cage and monitor it closely to ensure its smooth recovery from the procedure.\nLook for the flap at reconstruction site after healing (Figure 2C).",
    "Look at the donor site in the animal after healing (Figure 2D).\nStart Ringer's lactate at the rate of 150 mL/h until full recovery and administer 0.3 mg buprenorphine for analgesia.\nFollowing extubation, monitor the pig closely until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain position and breathing and is able to drink spontaneously.\nKeep the post-surgery pigs in separated place from no operated animals.\nStart intramuscular amoxicillin–clavulanate (14 mg/kg) for 1 week.\nStart intramuscular Meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg) for 1 week.\n6. Euthanasia\nStart anesthesia for the pig by injecting propofol through i.v. (5-10 mL) and maintain it with isoflurane 5%.\nIntubate the pig as described on step (1.1, 1.2, 1.6-1.10).\nInduce the cardiac arrest by intravenous injection of 40 mmol KCl.\nSubscription Required.
