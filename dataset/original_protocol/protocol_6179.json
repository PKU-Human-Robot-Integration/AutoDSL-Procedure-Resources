    "Sample preparationNote: All materials and equipment that come in contact with samples must be clean. Minimize handling and manipulation of samples.Rhodopsin is a chromoprotein made up of opsin and 11-cis-retinal. When the eye is exposed to light, the 11-cis-retinal component of rhodopsin is converted to all-trans-retinal, resulting in a fundamental change in the configuration of the rhodopsin. The change in configuration causes opsin to dissociate from retinal, resulting in bleaching during which rhodopsin is deactivated through receptor phosphorylation. Light-exposed retinae contain a mixed population of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated rhodopsin. Complete dark adaptation can only occur when all rhodopsin has been dephosphorylated, a process that requires > 3 h in complete darkness. Variable time periods are used to capture differentially phosphorylated species. Dark adapted retinae not exposed to light is the control as all rhodopsin species are unphosphorylated.Perform all the procedures involved in dissection, preparation, and Isoelectric Focusing under infrared light or dim red light. We use Delta 1 Brightlab Universal Red Junior Safelight 11 W bulb in our dark room as the source of dim red light. Rhodopsin phosphorylation can be examined by performing experiments both in situ in intact mice or in retinae that had been isolated and then incubated for various times in darkness. Processing of dark-adapted tissue serves as a control for bleached samples. All the mice are dark adapted overnight before exposure to light.For each experimental condition, sacrifice mice under dim red light or infrared light by cervical dislocation. Mice can be of any strain or gender and at 3-12 weeks of age at the time of experiment. Wild-type strain, like C57BL/6J, is included for comparison.To examine rhodopsin phosphorylation in isolated retinae, first dissect the retina from the eye (Video 1).",
    "After euthanizing, place the mouse on a flat clean surface and protrude the eye out by applying pressure around the socket. Place the curved tweezers underneath the eyeball and gently pinch the eyeball using your dominant hand. Hold scalpel in your nondominant hand and gently cut the cornea from top to bottom (dorsal to ventral). Put pressure under the bottom of the eye using curved tweezers and gently pinch so that the lens pops out. Remove the lens gently using tweezers and continue to put pressure from the bottom to pull out the retina. Place the retina in buffered Ames’ medium (1.9 g/L NaHCO3 bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2) (Ames and Nesbett, 1981). Phosphorylation determination is made under five different experimental conditions: a) Freeze the dark adapted retinae and store it at -80 °C (Dark), b) Dark adapt the retinae, bleach and immediately freeze and store at -80 °C (0 h), c) Dark adapt the retinae, bleach, incubate in darkness for 1 h, immediately freeze and store at -80 °C (1 h), d) Dark adapt the retinae, bleach, incubate in darkness for 2 h, immediately freeze and store at -80 °C (2 h), e) Dark adapt retinae, bleach, incubate in darkness for 3 h, immediately freeze and store at -80 °C (3 h). Further process these samples for IEF analysis. For bleaching, place the retinae in buffered Ames’ medium (1.9 g/L NaHCO3 bubbled with 95% O2 /5% CO2) in the center of a 5 mm diameter “O” ring affixed to the center of a 3 cm plastic Petri dish. This dish is centered on the stage of a calibrated photostimulator, as illustrated in Figure 1. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Retinal Dissection.",
    "This video was made at University of Southern California according to guidelines from the University of Southern California on Animal Care, and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of University of Southern California under IACUC protocol ID 11853 and 20575.The photostimulator consists of a variable intensity tungsten-halogen light source, a 500 nm (green) interference filter (to set the color of bleaching light to that at which rhodopsin is most sensitive), and neutral density filters (to adjust the intensity of the light). Thus, this apparatus defines the intensity, wavelength, and time of light stimulation to provide a precise bleaching of photopigment. The light spot is sufficiently large and of uniform intensity to provide uniform exposure to the entire retina. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715223619_4262.jpgFigure 1. Photographs of the photostimulator. A. Parts of the photostimulator; 1–Tungsten-halogen light source. Light path is highlighted in yellow; 2–Aluminum plate on which components are mounted; 3–Two filter wheels in which neutral density filters are mounted; 4–Cage plate with 500 nm (green) interference filter mounted next to the neutral density filters; 5–Cage plate with plano convex lens; 6–Cage cube-mounted non-polarizing beam splitter located under the tissue chamber. B. A front surface mirror oriented at 45° to the beam axis, which reflects light upward to fill a 5 mm aperture over which the Petri dish containing the retina is centered.The fraction of photopigment bleached by the photostimulator is calculated according to the relation:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715223506_1375.jpgwhere,F is the fraction of pigment bleached;I is the intensity of the bleaching light;P is the photosensitivity of the visual pigment (5.7 x 10-9 μm2 per molecule) measured in situ at the wavelength of peak absorbance;t is the time of light exposure (Woodruff et al., 2004).Time of light exposure and light intensity should be adjusted to bleach at a rate of 0.03% of the total pigment per second.",
    "After bleaching, incubate the retinae in darkness in a light-tight Delrin chamber (Figure 2) in Ames’ medium to which 1.9 g/L NaHCO3 and 3.33 g/L fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin have been added. Solution in this plastic chamber is equilibrated with a 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture, which sets the pH at 7.4. In cases where indicated, 10 μM 11-cis-retinal is added to facilitate rhodopsin regeneration (11-cis-retinal stock preparation, see Recipes).Incubate retinae in darkness for variable periods up to 3 h at room temperature (RT). At the end of the incubation period, remove retinae in darkness and place it in individual 2 ml microfuge tubes. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715223652_6268.jpgFigure 2. Custom-made Delrin light-tight chamber. Lid at left shows marked gas inlet (top) and outlet (bottom). The lower portion of the chamber is shown to the right. Here, two glass incubation dishes are shown. These dishes are filled with Ames’ medium in which the retinal tissue is immersed during incubation in darkness.Microfuge tubes are rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, wrapped in light-tight aluminum foil, labeled, and stored at -80 °C. For in vivo experiments dark adapt the mice overnight. Expose the mice to fluorescent light for 15 min, which will result in ~90% bleach (Berry et al., 2016). The in-house setup for bleaching experiment is shown in Figure 3. Photostimulator is not required for bleaching in in vivo experiments. Phosphorylation determination is made under five different experimental conditions. Dissect the retina from dark adapted mice and freeze the retina immediately (Dark). Also expose 4 different mice to white light for 15 min and place the mice in darkness for the indicated times (0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h), then dissect and freeze the retina and store at -80 °C. Further process these retinal samples for IEF analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715223714_9937.jpgFigure 3.",
    "In-house setup for bleaching for in vivo experiment. A. Fluorescent lights. B. Fluorescent light source setup in lab. Mice are placed in a box in the center and exposed to light. Process samples for IEF analysisThaw the frozen retinae and homogenize retinae in 400 μl of Buffer A (homogenization buffer, see Recipes) using a Polytron (~30 s). Centrifuge the sample for 15 min (19,000 x g, 4 °C), and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellet three times each with 1 ml of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of Buffer B (regeneration buffer, see Recipes).Add excess 9-cis or 11-cis-retinal to the sample (~900-1,200 pmol) (11-cis-retinal or 9-cis-retinal stock preparation, see Recipes).Incubate the sample overnight at 4 °C on a nutator.Next morning, centrifuge the sample for 15 min (19,000 x g, 4 °C), and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellet three times each with 1 ml of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and re-suspend the pellet in 100 μl of cold Buffer C (solubilization buffer, see Recipes) for 3 h at 4 °C.Centrifuge the sample and transfer supernatant to a 0.5 ml microfuge tube.Add glycerol to the supernatant to 50% final concentration. To prepare 10 μl of final sample for loading on the gel, mix 5 μl of supernatant sample with 5 μl of glycerol.Load the final sample onto the prepared acrylamide gel as described in Procedure B.IEF gel preparation and electrophoresis (Figure 4)Assemble the Hoefer gel casting apparatus according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Figures 4A-4B).Connect the IEF electrophoresis system to the cooling system as per manufacturer’s instructions and set the temperature to 10 °C.Prepare 20 ml of IEF gel solution (see Recipes).Swirl the solution gently to mix the components and de-gas the solution not more than 2 min to avoid premature polymerization.",
    "Transfer the gel solution to the casting apparatus using 25 ml serological pipette (Figure 4C). Allow at least 90 min for the gel to polymerize.Gently lift one of the glass plates using the plate separation tool so that gel sticks to the other glass plate.Note: If gel sticks to the glass plate, clean the glass plate and coat one of the glass plates with repel silane. Saturate electrolyte strips with 0.04 M glutamic acid at the anode and 1 M sodium hydroxide at the cathode, and place directly on the exposed surface of the IEF gel. Make sure that the electrolyte strips are correctly placed and fully in contact with the gel. The length of the electrolyte strips should not exceed the length of the gel.Note: Gel swells around electrode strips, especially at the cathode. It is a normal phenomenon. Blot the strips with blotting paper occasionally if it interferes with the run. Apply mineral oil over the Amersham Pharmacia Multiphor II IEF system cooling platform and place the glass plate on it with the gel exposed face upward (Figure 4D). Note: Mineral oil is applied over the cooling platform of the IEF system so that there is good contact between the glass plate and the cooling plate to allow even cooling. Gently place the electrodes of the platinum wire on the electrolyte strips and install the safety lid. Pre-focus the gel for 40 min at 23 W constant power (to initiate pH gradient) using Bio-Rad PowerPac 3000 high voltage power supply. After pre-focusing for 40 min, remove the safety lid and place the silicone sample application strip on the gel near the anode electrolyte strip.",
    "Maintain a distance of 1 cm between sample application strip and the anode electrolyte strip to protect proteins from exposure to extreme pH (Figure 4D).Replace the electrolyte strips with fresh solution (if the strip appears dry) and load protein sample onto the gel using silicone sample application strip. Close the electrophoresis cell and carry out Isoelectric Focusing for 2 h at constant 23 W or till the voltage does not exceed 3,000 V.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715223742_3127.jpgFigure 4.

Anodic strip is soaked in 0.04 M glutamic acid and placed on the gel. Similarly, cathodic strip is soaked in 1 M sodium hydroxide and placed on the gel. Sample applicator is also placed on the gel and gently sample is loaded using micropipette. E. Orientation of gel, membrane, and blotting paper for protein transfer from gel to membrane. F. Protein blotting by capillary method.Preparing gel for immunoblot analysisRemove the gel from the electrophoresis system and remove the electrolyte strips from the gel.Rinse the gel with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (see Recipes).Cut the nitrocellulose membrane to the size of the gel, wet the membrane with 1x PBS, and place it on the gel. Rinse blotting paper in 1x PBS and place it on the membrane (Figure 4E). Cover the whole glass plate together with its contents with saran wrap, and invert the glass plate, and place a weight on the glass plate. Transfer proteins onto nitrocellulose membrane by capillary method for 45 min (Figure 4F). Place the membrane in the blocking solution (5% Nonfat-dried milk in 1x TBST) (see Recipes) for 1 h at RT. Wash the membrane with 1x TBST for 10 min.",
    "Repeat twice with fresh buffer. Place the membrane in the primary antibody solution (Rhodopsin antibody, RET-P1 in 5% BSA, 1x TBST) overnight at 4 °C. Next day, wash the membrane with TBST for 10 min. Repeat twice with fresh buffer. Place the blot in the secondary antibody solution (Peroxidase labeled anti-mouse IgG, in 1% BSA, 1x TBST). Again, wash the membrane with TBST for 10 min. Repeat twice with fresh buffer. Visualize the band using ECL system. Quantify the intensity of the bands using NIH ImageJ (Berry et al., 2016). Figure 5 shows immunoblot quantification of rhodopsin phosphorylation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715223803_3110.jpgFigure 5. Immunoblot quantification of rhodopsin phosphorylation using ImageJ. A. Immunoblot of rhodopsin carried out after Isoelectric Focusing of rhodopsin from solubilized mouse retinae. Rhodopsin is multiply phosphorylated in vitro in intact rods and in vivo, and the amount of rhodopsin phosphorylation is indicated by the multiple bands representing differently phosphorylated species of rhodopsin. 0P corresponds to unphosphorylated rhodopsin. The number next to ‘P’ (1P, 2P, 3P, 4P, 5P and 6P) corresponds to the number of covalently added phosphate groups to rhodopsin. B. Quantification of the intensity of the band using ImageJ. Screen shot of the inverted image (TIFF format) is shown. The bands are selected using the rectangle icon and the values are measured under the “Analyze” command."
