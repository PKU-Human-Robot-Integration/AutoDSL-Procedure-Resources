    "Protein extraction Note: Work always on ice unless stated differently.   Grind plant tissues in liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle.    Aliquot 100 mg tissue powder in chilled microcentrifuge tubes. Prepare at least 3 replicates per sample.    Add 1 ml of ice cold extraction buffer to each sample. Homogenize samples by pipetting up and down. Centrifuge at 18,000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min.    Transfer the supernatant to a new, chilled microcentrifuge tube. The obtained protein extracts can be stored at -80 °C.      Dialysis   Wet a piece of Spectra/Por?1 Dialysis Membrane with water and tie a knot at the bottom (Figure 1).    Transfer 500 μl of the protein extract into the tubing and tie a knot at the top (Figure 1).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131015/20131015035127_6904.jpg Figure 1. Tying a knot at the bottom and top of a dialysis membrane     Place tubing in a 100 ml cylinder filled with ice cold dialysis buffer. Dialyze the extract at 4 °C for 2-3 h under continuous stirring on a magnetic stir plate.   Replace dialysis buffer and continue the dialysis at 4 °C overnight.    Transfer the dialyzed extracts to new, chilled microcentrifuge tubes. The dialyzed extracts can be stored at -80 °C.      Trehalase activity adapted for 96-well plates Note: Work always on ice unless stated differently.   Prepare a water bath at 95 °C.           For samples    Transfer 10 μl of the dialysis product in a 96-well plate with flat bottom (= plate S).    Transfer 10 μl of each respective glucose standard to plate S.         For blanks    Transfer 10 μl of the dialysis product in a 96-well plate with flat bottom (= plate B).    Place plate B at 95 °C temperature for 5 minutes to denature the trehalase enzyme present in the blanks.   Place plate B on ice for 2 min.",
    "For samples and blanks     Add 50 μl of trehalose buffer to plates S and B. Mix by pipetting up and down.   Incubate plates S and B for 30 min on a rocker at 30 °C.    Stop the reaction by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C (denaturation of the trehalase).   Place plates S and B on ice for 2 min.   Add 200 μl of Glucose, GOD-PAP to plates S and B for determining the glucose concentration of the samples and blanks by colorimetry. Mix by pipetting up and down.    Incubate plates S and B for 15 min at 30 °C on a rocker.    Measure the absorbance of plates S and B at 505 nm with a spectrophotometric plate reader (30 °C).   Determine the glucose standard curve to calculate the glucose concentration (nmol) present in the samples and blanks. Subtract the glucose concentration of the blanks from the samples (see Example: Calculating the trehalase activity in excel).         For proteins (Lowry procedure, Van Houtte et al., 2013)    Transfer 10 μl of the dialysis product in a 96-well plate with flat bottom (= plate P) and add 30 μl water to these samples.    Transfer 40 μl of each respective BSA standard to plate P.   Add 200 μl of Reagent C (Lowry buffers) to plate P and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.    Add 20 μl of Reagent D (Lowry buffers) to plate P and incubate for 30 min at 30 °C.   Measure the absorbance of plate P at 546 nm with a spectrophotometric plate reader (30 °C).   Use the BSA standard curve to determine the amount of protein (μg) present in the extracts (see Example: Calculating the trehalase activity in excel).",
