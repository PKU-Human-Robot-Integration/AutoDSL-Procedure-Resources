    "The research protocol was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board.\n1. Buffer preparation\nMake the labeling buffer (2x PBS, pH 7.9). Using 400 mL of distilled deionized (DD) water, add 100 mL of 10x PBS. To adjust the pH of the solution, add NaOH until it reaches 7.9.\nCreate 3 mM biotin by dissolving 1 mg of biotin into 588 µL of labeling buffer previously created. Make 3 mM Ru Sulfo-NHS by dissolving 150 nmol of Ru Sulfo-NHS into 50 µL of labeling buffer.\nMake the antigen buffer (1% BSA) by taking 500 mL of 1x PBS and adding 5 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the solution. Prepare 0.5 M of acetic acid solution. Prepare 1 M Tris-HCl buffer using Trizma Base and adjusting the pH to 9.0.\nFor the coating buffer (3% Blocker A), take 500 mL of 1x PBS and add 15 g of Blocker A. Prepare the washing buffer (0.05 % Tween 20, PBST) by mixing 5000 mL of 1x PBS with 2.5 mL of Tween 20. Create reading buffer (2x Read Buffer T with surfactant) by adding 500 mL of DD water and 500 mL of 4x Read Buffer T with Surfactant.\n\tNOTE: To keep consistency between assays it is important that both the biotin and Ru Sulfo-NHS solutions are created just before the labeling procedure and are not created and stored for future use.\n2. Labeling each antigen protein with biotin and Ru Sulfo-NHS separately\nNOTE: To have a more effective labeling reaction, use an antigen protein concentration of ≥0.5 mg/mL.",
    "Calculate the molar number of each antigen protein and the molar numbers of the biotin and Ru Sulfo-NHS. Add a proper amount of biotin or Ru Sulfo-NHS to antigen protein for labeling reaction according to the molar ratio of antigen protein to biotin or Ru Sulfo-NHS.\n\t\nFor the antigen that has the smaller molecular weight (≤10 kDa), such as proinsulin protein, use a molar ratio of 1:5 (antigen: biotin and Ru Sulfo-NHS). For the antigen that has the larger molecular weight (>50 kDa), such as GAD protein, use a molar ratio of 1:20. For the antigen that has a middle molecular weight (10-50 kDa), use a molar ratio adjusted between 1:5-1:20.\nFor both the biotin and Ru Sulfo-NHS, divide each antigen weight by their corresponding molecular weights to get the antigen molar number for each one. Divide the molar number by the concentration to get the volume for biotin. Repeat this for Ru Sulfo-NHS.\nMix the antigen protein with biotin using the proper molar ratio, determined in step 2.2. Then do the same for Ru Sulfo-NHS.\n\tNOTE: For efficiency of labeling reaction, any reducing chemicals like Tris or glycine in the buffer system need to be exchanged to 2x PBS buffer, pH 7.9 by the sizing spin column. The labeling protocols for biotin and Ru Sulfo-NHS are identical.\nCover the reaction tubes with aluminum foil and incubate them at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. The reason covering the reaction tubes with foil is because both biotin and Ru Sulfo-NHS reagents are light sensitive.",
    "Prime the 2 mL or 5 mL spin column while the reaction tubes are incubating (the size of spin column is determined by the volume uploaded onto the column). Fill the spin column with 2x PBS buffer and then centrifuge it at 1,000 x g for 2 min each time, for a total of three times.\nStop the labeling reaction after the reaction tubes have finished incubating. To stop the reaction, purify the labeled antigen protein by passing it through the spin column once. Then centrifuge the column at 1,000 x g for 2 min.\nCalculate the total labeled antigen concentration by dividing the amount of antigen protein present by the final volume. Aliquot 50 µL of the purified labeled antigen protein per tube and store the aliquots at -80 °C for long term use.\n\tNOTE: It is important to be aware that for every time the spin column passes the antigen protein through, there will be about a 90-95% retention rate.\n3. Define the best concentration and ratios for the two labeled antigens for the assay (checkerboard assay)\nNOTE: Since the ECL-IAA assay in this 7-Plex assay requires acid treatment of serum samples, the checkerboard assay for each antigen has to go through this step before incubating with the labeled antigen mixture.\nApply the checkerboard assay for each antigen separately before running the multiplex assay. Steps 3.2-3.6 will use GAD65 as an example.",
    "Calculate dilution of labeled GAD65 protein. The recommended targeted concentration of the first mixture solution of biotinylated GAD65 is 2000 ng/mL and Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled GAD65 is 1000 ng/mL. If the concentration of both biotinylated and Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled GAD65 in stock solution are 1.0 µg/µL, the volume needed for biotinylated GAD65 in 560 µL of working solution will be 1.12 µL, and the volume needed for Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled GAD65 in 700 µL of working solution will be 0.7 µL.\nMix 1.12 µL of biotinylated GAD65 protein with 240 µL of streptavidin-conjugated linker 1 in one tube and 160 µL of 1% BSA. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. Add 160 µL of stop solution to the tube and incubate the mixture at room temperature for another 30 min.\nMake a serial dilution. Take 280 µL of the mixture to a new tube and add 280 µL of stop solution to make a 1:2 dilution. Prepare several new tubes. Repeat this step to run a horizontal serial dilution for biotin labeled GAD65 antigen (refer to the previous publication12).\nMix 0.7 µL of Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled GAD65 (1 µg/µL) protein with 700 µL of stop solution. Then take 350 µL of the mixture to a new tube and add 350 µL of stop solution to make a 1:2 dilution. Prepare several new tubes, repeat this step to run a vertical serial dilution for Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled GAD65 antigen.\nPrepare two serum samples, one sample highly positive for GADA and one sample negative for GADA, each having a volume of 0.75 mL. Aliquot 15 µL of positive serum into every well on the left half of the 96-well PCR plate. Aliquot 15 µL of negative serum into every well on the right half of the 96-well PCR plate.",
    "Add 18 µL of 0.5 M acetic acid into each well and mix. Incubate for 45 min at RT. Prepare a new 96-well PCR plate. Add 17.5 µL of the biotin labeled antigen and 17.5 µL of the Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled antigen into each well according to the serial dilutions (refer to the previous publication12).\nContinue the rest of the assay steps described in step 5.2 through 9.1.\nDetermine the signal ratio from the high positive samples against the corresponding negative sample signals. Select the best concentration for the Biotin labeled antigen and the Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled antigen by identifying the point that has the highest or near to the highest ratio of positive to negative signal. In this ratio calculation, consider the low background signal obtained from the negative samples.\n\tNOTE: The optimal concentrations of Ru Sulfo-NHS and biotin labeled antigen proteins from checkerboard assays are shown below: 30 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL for GAD65, 120 ng/mL and 120 ng/mL for proinsulin, 10 ng/mL and 42 ng/mL for IA-2, 80 ng/mL and 80 ng/mL for TG, 8 ng/mL and 16 ng/mL for TPO, 31 ng/mL and 31 ng/mL for ThG, and 12 ng/mL and 12 ng/mL for IFNα.\n4. Create the mixed linker-coupled antigen solution\nSelect the optimal concentration for each antigen based on the checkerboard assay. Dilute the biotin and Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled antigen to the rational working concentration.\nBind different linkers to each of the uniquely biotinylated antigen proteins. For one 96-well plate assay, mix 4 µL of biotinylated GAD65, TPO, tTG, ThG, proinsulin, IFN-α and IA-2 protein with 240 µL of streptavidin-conjugated linker 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 into separate tube (Figure 1). Then add 156 µL of PBS/1% BSA per tube. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "Add 160 µL of stop solution into each tube and incubate them at room temperature for another 30 min. Take 400 µL of linker-coupled antigen from each tube, and combine all 7 antigens together. Add 1.2 mL of stop solution and then add 4 µL of Ru Sulfo-NHS labeled GAD65, TPO, tTG, ThG, proinsulin, IFN-α and IA-2 antigen to the mixture. Now the antigen solution is ready to be used in the assay.\n5. Incubate serum samples with the labeled antigen\nNOTE: Since the ECL-IAA assay in this 7-Plex assay requires acid treatment of serum samples, each serum requires the acid treatment step before incubating with labeled antigen mixture for this 7-Plex assay.\nAliquot 15 µL of serum per well for a 96-well PCR plate. Add 18 µL of 0.5 M acetic acid into each well and mix. Incubate for 45 min at RT. Prepare a new 96-well PCR plate and aliquot 35 µL of antigen solution into each well.\nWhile the plate is still incubating, add 13 µL of 1 M Tris pH 9.0 buffer to every well in the antigen plate. Add buffer to the side of each well to limit the mixing of Tris buffer and antigen. After incubation is complete, take 25 µL of the acid treated serum, and immediately pipette it into every well on the antigen plate. Agitate the solution and cover the plate with PCR sealing foil to avoid light exposure.\nAt RT, put the plate on a shaker, set at a low speed, for 1 h. Afterwards, store the plate at 4 °C and let the plate incubate for 18-24 h.\n6. Prepare the multiplex plate",
    "Take a multiplex plate from the 4 °C refrigerator and allow the plate to come to RT. Once the multiplex plate is at RT, add 150 µL of 3% Blocker A to each well. Cover the multiplex plate with sealing foil. Incubate the plate in a 4 °C refrigerator overnight.\n\tNOTE: Assay Day 1 includes Steps 4 through 6.\n7. Transfer serum/antigen incubates into the multiplex plate\nThe following day, place paper towels on the table and take the incubating multiplex plate from the refrigerator. Empty all of the buffer out of the plate. To do this, flip the plate upside down and pat it onto the prepared paper towels until there is no buffer present in any of the wells.\nWash the multiplex plate by adding 150 µL of PBST into every well. Discard the buffer, as mention in step 7.1., and repeat this step three times. Add 30 µL of serum/antigen incubates into every well in the multiplex plate. Cover the plate with foil to limit its exposure to light. Place the plate on a plate shaker, set to a low speed, at RT for 1 h.\n8. Wash the plate and add read buffer\nRemove the serum/antigen incubates from the multiplex plate by holding the plate upside down and flicking out the solution. Add 150 µL of PBST into all of the wells and remove the buffer from the plate by again holding the plate upside down and flicking out the solution. Repeat this step three times. After the third wash is complete, add 150 µL of Reading buffer into each well.\n\tNOTE: Air bubbles interfere with the plate reader machine’s ability to accurately analyze the plate’s results and should be avoided at all costs.\n9. Read the plate and analyze data",
    "Count the prepared plate on the plate reader machine, reading all of the values in counts per second (CPS).\nCalculate the relative index for the assay, using the antibody levels obtained from the plate reader machine, with the following equation:\n\tIndex value = [CPS (sample) - CPS (negative standard)] / [CPS (positive standard) - CPS (negative standard)].\nDetermine which antibody results are negative or positive using the cut-offs that have been established.\n\tNOTE: Assay Day 2 includes Steps 7 through 9."
