    "Ethic Statement: Human fetal tissue was obtained from Advanced Biosciences Resources or from Novogenix and was obtained without identifying information and did not require IRB approval for its use. Animal research described in this manuscript was performed under the written approval of the University of California, Los Angeles, and (UCLA) Animal Research Committee (ARC) in accordance to all federal, state, and local guidelines. Specifically, these studies were carried out under strict accordance to the guidelines in The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council and the accreditation and guidelines of the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) International under UCLA ARC Protocol Number 2010-038-02B. All surgeries were performed under ketamine/xylazine and isoflurane anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize animal pain and discomfort. \n1. Construction of Humanized Mice Engineered with CD4 Chimeric Antigen Receptor \nProcessing Fetal Thymus and Isolating CD34+ HSCs from Fetal Liver\nThymus Processing\nGently wash the thymus in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, in a 15 ml conical tube. Repeat wash step 3 - 4 times.\nAdd 7 ml RPMI media + 10% FBS + Pen/strep. Decant everything into a sterile 100 mm Petri dish.\nUse scalpels to cut the thymus into small pieces of about 1 mm2. Place every single thymus piece in a single well on a 96-well plate. Use curved blunt forceps when transferring thymus pieces to the 96-well plate.\n\t\t\t\nAdd a small amount of media (100 - 200 μl) to all of the wells so that the tissue does not dry. Visualize under microscope (thymi have lobes and should look like sacks of cells).\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Discard any pieces that look questionable in any way; there is often connective tissue and this should not be implanted.",
    "Remove the confirmed-thymus pieces and place all of them into a T25 cell culture flask. Add 7 ml RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and 450 μg/ml of piperacillin/tazobactam and amphotericin B. Gently rock flask to mix. Culture the flask overnight at 37 ºC/5% CO2.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step is required to prevent bacterial contamination of the tissue.\n(Optional step) Freeze the thymus for future use. Equilibrate the chunks in 90% Human AB Serum with 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 10 min. Freeze them at a rate of 1 ºC/min to -50 ºC, then rapid cooling to -150 ºC. When ready to thaw, rapidly thaw in a 37 ºC water bath and gently wash 3x in RPMI complete media without DMSO.\nLiver Processing\nGently wash the liver in PBS in a 50 ml conical tube. Repeat wash step 3 - 4 times.\nAdd 10 ml (Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Media) IMDM media to the 50 ml conical tube. Decant everything into a 100 mm sterile Petri dish.\nHomogenize the liver tissue using two scalpels. Cut the liver into small pieces of about 3 mm2. Cut out and discard any white connective tissue.\nUse 10 ml syringe fitted with a 16 gauge blunt needle to take up the liver pieces and media. Then transfer to a 50 ml conical tube.\nGently resuspend the media and tissue suspension and expel 5-7 more times to homogenize the tissue completely.\nPrepare 10 ml IMDM media supplemented with enzymes: 500 U/ml collagenase, 2,400 U/ml hyluronidase, and 300 U/ml DNase as well as 450 μg/ml piperacillin/tazobactam and amphotericin B. Filter the media via a 0.22 µm filter then add the media to the liver suspension.",
    "Cap the 50 ml conical tube containing the liver suspension and seal tightly with self-sealing film such as Parafilm to prevent leaks. Rotate in a tube rotator in the incubator at 37 ºC for 90 min.\nFilter the digested cell suspension through a 100 µm cell strainer into a fresh 50 ml tube.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Add PBS to the suspension to bring the total volume up to 50 ml. Split this into two tubes of 50 ml tubes each containing 25 ml of cell suspension.\nSlowly and gently underlay the cells in each tube with 10 ml density centrifugation media (e.g., Ficoll). Spin at 1,200 x g for 20 min without brake. Note: all centrifugation mentioned in this protocol is done at room temperature (25 ºC).\nCarefully remove the interface (i.e., buffy coat) from each tube and transfer to two separate 50 ml tubes. Bring the volume of each tube of interface up to 50 ml with PBS. Spin at 300 x g for 7 - 10 min. Aspirate supernatant carefully.\nCombine the two pellets. Wash three more times with 50 ml PBS containing 2% FBS. Spin at 300 x g for 7 - 10 min each time while carefully aspirating the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 ml RPMI media + 10% FBS. Count cells using hemocytometer at this time before proceeding to cell sorting.\nSort CD34+ cells immediately using CD34 sorting Kit (e.g., CD34 micro-beads), according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, cells can be cultured in RPMI media + 10% FBS at 1 million/ml overnight.\nSave both CD34+ and CD34- fraction.",
    "NOTE: At this step, CD34+ and CD34- cells can be frozen using Bambanker freezing media or other freezing medias. Freeze 1 ml of 4 - 6 x 106 CD34+ cells per tube and freeze 1 ml of 40 - 60 x 106 CD34- cells per tube.\nTransduction of CD34+ Cells \nCalculate the number of transduction wells required of a 6 well-tissue-culture plate. 1 well can be used to transduce up to 8 x 106 cells. For each BLT mouse, 0.5 x 106 CD34+ will be implanted along with CD34- cells and thymus underneath kidney capsule and 0.5 x 106 CD34+ cells will be injected intravenously. The number of CD34+ cells to use is determined by the number of mice (1 million cells per mouse).\nCoat the needed number of wells of a non-tissue culture treated 6-well plate with 1.25 ml of recombinant human fibronectin solution (e.g., Retronectin) (20 µg/ml in PBS) into each well. Cover the plate and allow it to stand for 2 hr at room temperature in a clean biosafety cabinet.\nAspirate fibronectin solution from wells and add 1.25 ml of FACS buffer (PBS with 4% FBS) to each well for blocking. Allow the plate to stand at room temperature (25 ºC) for 30 min.\nAspirate FACS Buffer and wash wells once with PBS.\nKeep PBS in the coated wells until the plate is ready for use. Store the plate at 4 ºC overnight if not used immediately.\nPlate CD34+ cells in Infection Medium (2% Human Serum Albumin in Yssel’s Serum-Free T-Cell Medium) in fibronectin solution-coated wells (~2 x 106 cells/ml) and incubate at 37 ºC for 1 hr.\nUse a pipette to add lentiviral vector to the wells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) between 2 - 10. Gently mix and incubate overnight at 37 ºC.",
    "NOTE: The titer of the lentivirus vector used should be determined beforehand.\nHarvest the cells the next morning by gently scraping the bottoms of the wells with a cell scraper. Collect cells and count with hemocytometer at this time.\nTo prepare cells for implant, combine 0.5 x 106 transduced CD34+ cells with 4.5 x 106 CD34- cells per mouse, aliquot into sterile 1.5 ml screw-cap tubes. Spin the cells down at 300 x g to pellet them, aspirate supernatant. Spin them again at 300 x g and aspirate any remaining supernatant using a P10 pipette and aspirating very carefully. Keep the dry pellets on ice throughout the study. Note: To make sure the cells are viable, use the pelleted cells and perform the surgery within 2-3 hr.\nTo prepare cells for injection, spin 0.5 x 106 transduced CD34+ cells per mouse to pellet them, aspirate supernatant. Resuspend cells in 100 µl RPMI media per mouse and keep on ice.\nTo check transduction efficiency, aliquot ~1 x 105 non-transduced and transduced CD34+ cells from each condition and culture in 200 µl cytokine medium (RPMI media with 10% FBS, supplemented with 100 ng/ml human IL-3, IL-6, SCF) in 96-well plate for 5 - 7 days at 37 ºC.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells used in this step is not used for surgery but to ensure that transduction is successful and the vector is not toxic for stem cell survival and renewal. Transduction efficiency can be checked by looking for gene expression of the vector (e.g., GFP&CD4) and analyze by flow cytometry.\nTissue Transplants to Construct Genetically Engineered Mice\nOn the same day prior to surgery perform total body irradiation of the NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) immuno-compromised mice with a Cesium-137 Irradiator and a dosage of 2.7 Gy (270Rad).",
    "NOTE: The NSG mice are severely immunocompromised. Therefore their housing and maintenance must conform to the highest health standard and handled by highly trained staff.\nPour thymus pieces and medium from the flask into a 60 mm dish. Pour PBS into another 60 mm dish, which will be used to clean the trochar and keep the kidney wet.\nChill positive displacement pipette tips by placing them in open 1.5 ml sterile screw-cap tubes on ice. Keep on ice with the dried cell pellets and gelatinous protein mixture such as Matrigel.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to keep the gelatinous protein mixture and any tubes or tips that will touch it cold at all times until the implant needle is loaded.\nAnesthetize the mice: Weigh mice individually and record weights; ear punch the mice to number them. Inject them intraperitoneally with 15 µl of Ketamine (2.6 mg/ml in saline)/Xylazine (100 mg/ml in saline) per gram of body weight). Put the mice back in the cage and wait for it to be fully anesthetized.\n\t\tNOTE: Check the anesthesia level of the mouse by squeezing a paw. If the mouse reflexively flinches, administer 25-50% of the original amount of Ketamine/Xylazine to anesthetize the mouse further. Wait until it does not reflexively flinch to perform the surgery.\nUsing the Oster clipper (shaver), shave the left side of each mouse from hip to shoulder between the center of the back and the stomach. Subcutaneously inject 0.3 ml of the diluted Carprofen (6 mg/kg) into the animal’s shoulder or inguinal triangle (leg pit). Using a cotton swab, put a small drop of Artificial Tears onto each eye and lay the mouse on its side back in the cage. \n\t\tNOTE: Limit surgery prep to one cage (approximately 4 - 5 mice) at a time.",
    "Flush the cannula of the 16 gauge cancer implant needle (trocar) with PBS. Using a pair of blunt curved forceps, place a piece of thymus from the 60 mm dish into the opening of the cannula with the trocar just inside the opening, then pull back on the trocar to aspirate the tissue into the cannula.\nUse a positive displacement pipette and a chilled tip to put 5 µl of cold gelatinous protein mixture into the tube with a dried cell pellet (CD34+ and CD34- mixture for implanted cells) and gently stir to generate cell suspension. Do not pipette up and down. Pipette the gelatinous protein mixture /cell suspension into the opening of the cannula and slowly pull back on the trocar to load the needle.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to have a helper to load the pipette while one manipulates the implant needle.\n Swab the shaved area of the mouse with Povidone-iodine and subsequently wipe down the area with an alcohol wipe three times. Determine the darkest spot under the skin. This indicates the location of the spleen. The kidney is approximately 5 mm dorsal to the spleen. Lift up the skin with curved forceps and make a 15 mm long incision with surgical scissors in the skin parallel to the spleen. Then make a similar cut in the peritoneum layer below. In males, the kidney should be easily visible, and can be extruded simply by pressing on the abdomen. You can support the kidney with a hemostat or a pair of curved blunt forceps. In females, the ovaries tend to block the kidney from easy extraction. Using a hemostat, pick up the ovary and carefully expose out the kidney.\nUse the needle-tipped forceps to pluck a tiny hole at the posterior end of the kidney capsule.",
    "NOTE: Do not use these needle-tipped forceps to handle biohazard materials.\nSlide the implant needle into this hole and along the kidney until the opening of the cannula is completely covered by the kidney capsule.\nGently extrude the tissue under the kidney capsule, and pull the needle back out. The thymus pieces can be sticky so use a curved forceps to make sure the thymus piece does not come out with the needle.\nLift up the peritoneum with the forceps and gently use the hemostat to push the kidney back into place. Tie one double-knotted stitch in the peritoneum using 4-0 vicryl absorbable sutures. Use two Autoclips wound clips to close the skin.\nMix the transduced CD34+ cells that were set aside for injection and uptake 100 µl (0.5x106 cells) into an insulin syringe. Inject these cells into the mouse through retroorbital vein injection or other routes of intravenous injection. Using a cotton swab, put a small drop of Artificial Tears onto each eye and lay the mouse on its side back in a cage.\nOnce all the mice have been implanted, confirm that the animals are regaining consciousness and ambulating normally before leaving them.\nPost-operational care: The day after the surgery, subcutaneously inject 0.3 ml of diluted Carprofen (6 mg/kg) and 1.2 ml of sterile saline into each mouse. 2 and 3 days post surgery, subcutaneously inject 1.5 ml of sterile saline into each mouse. Monitor the mice and the incisions for 10-14 days following surgery. Remove the Autoclips and weigh the mice after 10-14 days. NOTE: Mice are sluggish after radiation and injection of saline prevents the animals from becoming dehydrated.",
    "After 8 - 10 weeks, check engraftment by bleeding the mice and performing FACS analysis on the peripheral blood, staining for markers such as CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, and any genes the vector should express.\n2. Characterization of Differentiation and Development of Gene Modified Cells\nCharacterization of Gene Modified Cells from Peripheral Blood\n8 - 10 weeks after transplant, obtain 50 - 100 μl of mouse blood from retro-orbital bleed. Place in microcentrifuge tubes containing 10 μl of EDTA. Centrifuge cells at 350 x g for 3 min. Collect plasma. Freeze at -80 for ELISA analysis or plasma viral load assay if the mouse is HIV infected.\nAdd 2 ml NH4Cl (83%) solution to lyse red blood cells. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature (25 ºC). Following incubation, add 10 ml RPMI 10% FBS to fill tube. Spin at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant carefully. Cells are ready for immuno-staining and flow cytometry analysis and other assays.\n\t\tNOTE: Markers for various hematopoetic cell lineages, activation, and phenotypic markers for naïve or memory cells can be measured every 2 weeks before and after HIV infection by flow cytometry. Gates are created by staining cells with isotype controls. It is recommended to stain healthy human PBMCs and use that as positive control. Alternatively, mouse can be euthanized and up to 1 ml of peripheral blood can be obtained from cardiac puncture which will provide enough cells for multiple panels of flow analysis17.\nCharacterization of Gene Modified Cells from Spleen, Thymus and Bone Marrow\nHarvest Spleen, Thymus and Bone Marrow from the Humanized BLT Mice",
    "Euthanize mice by using overdose of isoflurane. Confirm euthanasia with secondary cervical dislocation. Spray the surface of the carcass with 70% ethanol to keep fur from sticking to tissues. Pin down the limbs on a wax dissection tray.\nUse surgical scissors, cut open the skin, and then cut through the peritoneal layer to expose the body cavity.\nRemove the spleen using forceps. Remove the thymic implant on the kidney using forceps and scissors. Put the thymic implant and spleen in labeled tubes containing 5 ml of PBS.\nFrom mid-abdomen cut and remove the skin from the distal part of the mouse covering the lower limbs.\nCut off the muscles from the lower extremities using scissors and carefully dislocate the acetabulum from the hip joint. Remove the femur and tibia and place them in a tube containing 5 ml of PBS.\nIsolation of Splenocytes\nPlace a 100µm cell strainer on a 50 ml conical tube. Wet the strainer with 3 ml of RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and Pen/strep (RPMI complete media).\nPlace the spleen onto the cell strainer.

Add 20 ml RPMI complete media and spin at 300 x g for 7 min.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 ml RPMI complete media and filter again through a 100 µm cell strainer. Count cells using hemocytometer.",
    "NOTE: Cells can be used for ex vivo assays, flow analysis and can be viably frozen for later use. Before cell counting, Trypan blue can be used to determine the number of viable cells.\nIsolation of Human Thymocytes from Implant\nPlace the thymus into 5 ml of PBS in a well of a 6 well plate. Using clean blunt forceps and scissors cut the thymus into small pieces.\nPlace a sterilized stainless steel mesh square into the well. Using the rubber plunger of a 10 ml syringe, mash the thymus pieces on the stainless steel mesh to break apart the thymus.\nResuspend cells well and strain through a 100 µm cell strainer. Spin cells at 300 x g for 10 min. Suspend cells in 10 ml RPMI complete media. If clumps are visible, pass the resuspended-cells through a cell strainer again.\nCount cells using hemocytometer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Cells can be used for flow analysis and viably frozen for later use.\nIsolation of Cells from Bone Marrow\nClean and sterilize mortar and pestle with 70% ethanol. Place the femur and tibia into mortar. Add 5 ml of cold PBS. Use pestle to crush the bones until the PBS turns light pink and cloudy.\nPipette up the fluid from the mortar and filter through a 50 μM cell strainer placed on a 50 ml conical tube. Wash mortar with 5 ml PBS and repeat five times until PBS becomes clear.\nSpin cells down at 300 x g for 7 min. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 10 ml RPMI complete media.\nCount cells using hemocytometer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Cells can be used for ex vivo assays, flow analysis and can be viably frozen for later use.\n3. Functional Characterization of Gene Modified Cells \nHIV Infection and Monitoring of the Viral Replication Over Time",
    "After confirmation of the human immune system reconstitution, inject desired amount of HIV virus via retro-orbital vein injection using an insulin syringe. After HIV infection, collect 100 μl peripheral blood via retro-orbital bleeding every 2 weeks.\nHarvest plasma by following steps in part 2.1.1 - 2.1.2. For HIV viral load assay, extract viral RNA using RNA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instruction and measure viral load by real time RT-PCR with appropriate primer and probe sets for the HIV virus used 4,8,18,19.\nTo measure cell associated HIV RNA and identify cells that are actively infected by HIV, first perform RBC lysis following steps 2.1.2\nResuspend cell suspension in 1 ml PBS, divide evenly into two tubes. Spin at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant.\nTo measure cell associated RNA, extract RNA using RNA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instruction and perform real-time RT-PCR using appropriate primer and probe sets.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that the primer/probe does not recognize the lentivirus used to modified the stem cells\nTo measure HIV infected cells by flow, resuspend cells in the other tube in 50 μl FACS buffer and perform surface stain with desired antibody such as anti-CD45, anti-CD4 and anti-CD3. After surface stain, fix and permeabilize cells and stain intracellularly for gag expression using anti-Gag antibody (clone KC57). Perform flow cytometry.\nEx Vivo Cytokine Assay of the Gene Modified Cells from Splenocytes\nHarvest splenocytes from mice as described in section 2.2.2.\nPrepare target cells. To test the functionality of CD4 chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells, use HIV infected T1 cells as target cells. Infect T1 cells with HIV 3 days prior to the cytokine assay, confirm HIV infection by staining the cells intracellularly with anti-HIV gag antibody (clone KC57). Use uninfected T1 cells as control target cells.",
    "Co-incubate splenocytes with target or control cells at 1:1 ratio overnight. For best result, carry out a titration (1:1, 1:3, 1:9) of effector (splenocytes) versus target cells (infected T1s). For example, resuspend 0.9 million splenocytes in 0.25 ml RPMI complete media, add 0.9, 0.3 or 0.1 million infected T1 or uninfected T1s resuspended in 0.25 ml RPMI complete media.\nThe next morning, add protein transport inhibitor for 6 hours to inhibit protein transport and perform staining for extracellular markers and intracellular expression of cytokines as described previously in 8.\nSubscription Required.
