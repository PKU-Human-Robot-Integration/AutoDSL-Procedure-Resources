    "All animal experiments were performed following Swiss Federal Animal Regulations and approved by the Veterinary Office of Zurich (n° 225/2019), assuring human care. Female virgin Lewis rats (body weight of 170-200 g) and female virgin Brown Norway rats (170-200 g) were used as uterus donors/recipients, while male Lewis rats (300-320 g) were used for mating. The rats were aged from 12-15 months. The animals were obtained from commercial sources (see Table of Materials) and were housed in controlled conditions and an enriched environment with free access to water and standard food.\n1. Uterus retrieval\nNOTE: For details on the procedure, please see the previously published reports12,13,15.\nInduce anesthesia with isoflurane and oxygen within an enclosed Plexiglas container (14 cm x 25 cm x 13 cm) for 1-2 min (5 vol% isoflurane in O2).\n\t\nAdminister buprenorphine subcutaneously (0.05 mg/kg) and bupivacaine (0.5%, 8 mg/kg) subcutaneously in the region of the planned abdominal incision 30 min before surgery.\nShave all the abdominal skin of the rat with an electric shaver.\nUse tapes to keep the animal fixed on a heating plate during surgery. Apply eye ointment to both eyes.\nMaintain anesthesia during the procedure with 2-4 vol% isoflurane in oxygen by continuous administration through a small nose cone.\nMonitor the anesthetic depth by clinical parameters without specialized tools (respiratory rate of ~70-120/min-a slow rate drop of 50% is acceptable during anesthesia; checking anesthetic depth with toe pinch; color of mucous membranes should be pink, not blue or grey)16, and adjust the isoflurane concentration accordingly.\n\t\tNOTE: Optional: frequent respiration monitoring during surgery is feasible with the help of an assistant.\nConfirm anesthetic depth by performing a toe pinch.\nClean the abdominal skin in a circular motion with three alternating swabs of an antiseptic solution and 70% alcohol. Allow to dry.",
    "Place a sterile drape (see Table of Materials) with an abdominal window over the animal.\nPerform median laparotomy.\n\t\nOpen the abdomen via a 6-8 cm midline long incision, starting 0.5 cm below the xiphisternum toward the hypogastrium. Use a no. 10 scalpel for the skin incision and small sharp scissors for the linea alba incision. Do not damage the liver or the bladder.\nMove the intestines outside the abdominal cavity using cotton swabs, cover them gently with a gauze moistened with sterile saline, and protect them with a sterile plastic bag for better insulation.\nInsert retractors or clips (see Table of Materials) at the left and right abdominal wall folders to keep the peritoneal muscle aside and the abdomen open, to obtain optimal access and visibility of the uterus and associated vessels. Fix the clips/retractors with tapes.\nApply prewarmed saline to keep the surgical area and the intestines moist and avoid drying of the viscera.\nHarvest the right uterine horn with the common uterine cavity and cervix plus vascular pedicles, including the right uterine, internal, and common iliac vessels.\n\t\nLigate (4/0 polyglactin; see Table of Materials), cauterize, and sever the left uterine horn adjacent to the branching from the common uterine cavity.\nRemove excess fat surrounding the uterus and vagina.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the fat around the uterine-vascular system.\nDissect the bladder at its attachment to the cervix with cauterization of all draining and feeding bladder vessels. During cauterization, maintain an adequate distance between the cervix and the vagina to avoid unncecessary cauterization on these two structures. Otherwise, the risk of graft necrosis increases.\n\t\tNOTE: Most surgical manipulation should affect the bladder. Retract or pull the bladder caudally with a vascular clamp (see Table of Materials)  to obtain a better view of excavatio vesicouterina.",
    "Cauterize and sever the descending uterine vessels at the level of the ureter as distal to the cervix as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: Maintain microcirculation around the vagina and cervix as much as possible during the division.\nSeparate the cervical/vaginal portion of the future graft from the rectal attachment and the paravaginal and paracervical ligaments.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid any cauterization on the graft vagina.\nCarefully dissect the vagina via diathermy around 2-3 mm caudal of the cervix.\n\t\tNOTE: No villi (cervix) is visible inside the vaginal lumen.\nLocate both the uterine artery and vein at their origins. Ligate (8/0 polyamide; see Table of Materials), cauterize, and sever the gluteal vessels and all vessels caudal of the uterine vessels.\n\t\tNOTE: Direct ligation of the common iliac vena caudal to the uterine vena is usually possible.\nBy blunt dissection, free the common iliac vessels from each other, from the bifurcation of the aorta and the vena cava down to the division of the uterine vessels.\n\t\tNOTE: One can gain better surgical access to the area by removing one or two adjacent lymph nodes.\nExcise the right uterine horn 3 mm from the Fallopian tube, after cauterizing the utero-ovarian pedicle at the same level. This enables anastomosis of the graft uterine horn to the upper part of the recipient uterine horn.\nPlace ligatures (8/0 polyamide) directly around the right common iliac artery and vein, proximal to the aortic and caval bifurcations. Make a small incision (0.5-1 mm) into the right common iliac artery adjacent to the bifurcation, and insert a bent, blunted 30 G needle or a straight, blunted 25 G needle into the lumen (for flushing). Secure it with a ligature (6/0 polyamide).\n\t\tNOTE: A further option is additional securing with a bulldog clamp to avoid displacement of the needle and/or vessel.",
    "Dissect the common iliac vein caudally of the ligature at the right common iliac vein to enable outflow during flushing.\nFlush the graft following the steps below.\n\t\nFlush the uterus manually using 3 mL syringes with approximately 9 mL of cold Ringer solution (RHX: Ringer supplemented with 50 IU/mL heparin and 0.4 mg/mL xylazine) at a flowrate of 6 mL/min. Flush again with 6 mL of organ preservation solution supplemented with heparin (50 IU/mL) and xylazine (0.4 mg/mL) (see Table of Materials).\n\t\t​NOTE: Avoid high flushing pressure and ensure proper needle placement.\nRemove the transplant when the uterine tissue has turned pale. Cut the common iliac artery caudally of the ligature at the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta.\nPlace the transplant into chilled organ preservation solution (4 °C) for back table preparation and storage before transplantation.\nAfter removing the graft, euthanize the animal by first turning the isoflurane setting to maximum and then inducing bilateral pneumothorax followed by exsanguination17.\n2. Syngeneic uterus transplantation\nNOTE: For details on the procedure, please see the previously published reports12,13,15.\nInduce anesthesia and prepare the animal as mentioned in step 1.1.\n\t\nAdminister effective analgesia (as described in step 1.1.1) and 200 IU/kg high molecular weight heparin 30 min before surgery.\nPerform median laparotomy.\n\t\nOpen the abdomen via a 6-8 cm long midline incision starting 0.5 cm below the xiphisternum toward the hypogastrium. Use a no. 10 scalpel for the skin incision and small sharp scissors for the linea alba incision. Do not damage the liver and the bladder.\nMove the small intestines outside the abdominal cavity using cotton swabs, wrap them with a sterile moistened gauze, and cover them with a sterile plastic bag for better insulation.",
    "Insert retractors or clips at the left and right abdominal wall folders to keep the peritoneal muscle aside and the abdomen open, to obtain optimal access and visibility of the uterus and associated vessels. Fix the clips/retractors with tapes.\nApply prewarmed saline to keep the surgical area and the intestines moist and avoid drying of the viscera.\nPerform a hysterectomy with dissection and mobilization of the upper third of the vagina from the rectum and the bladder.\n\t\nCauterise the microvasculature around the uterus, cervix, and vagina. Cut and separate the uterus from the surrounding structures close to the organ to protect the microcirculation of the uterine sinister.\nRemove fat tissue from the surroundings.\nAmputate the left horn by cauterization. On the right side, preserve a 7-8 mm segment of the upper part of the uterus for later anastomosis to the uterine graft.\nPerform uterus transplantation.\n\t\nMobilize and separate the right common iliac vessels, from the origin of the uterine vessels up to the aortic/caval bifurcation.\nPosition the graft in the abdominal cavity. Wrap the graft in a gauze soaked in cold organ preservation solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The graft needs to be kept cold during anastomosis.\nPlace atraumatic vascular clamps onto the right common iliac vein at each side, framing the future anastomosis site.\n\t\tNOTE: Lower the anesthesia to 1-1.5 vol% isoflurane to adapt to the sudden decrease in cardiac preloading and the resulting hypotension.\nCut a slit slightly larger than the opening of the graft vein into the common iliac vein.\nPosition the graft vein.\nPlace one stay suture (10/0 polyamide; see Table of Materials) into each corner of the slit on the right common iliac vein.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the suture knot at the caudal corner loose for better adjustment and to prevent purse-string effects.",
    "Regularly flush the anastomosis area with cooled RHX during the procedure to prevent thromboses.\nAnastomose one side of the graft vein to the recipient's vein with six to eight loops of a continuous suture (Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Start with the cranial stay suture (10/0 polyamide) and first anastomose the inbound part of the vessels.\nAnastomose the other side of the vessel in the same manner, this time starting from the outside.\nTie a knot at the cranial stay suture, and then one at the caudal stay suture (10/0 polyamide), after finishing the anastomoses at both sides.\n\t\tNOTE: Tighten the continuous sutures only as much as necessary to prevent purse-string effects.\nPlace atraumatic vascular clamps onto the right common iliac artery at each side, framing the future anastomosis site.\nPerform the arterial anastomosis (right common iliac arteria [RCIA] via 8-10 loops using interrupted sutures (10/0 polyamide).\n\t\tNOTE: Interrupted sutures are easier to control than continuous ones (optional with the \"fish-mouth\" technique)18. Constant flushing of the anastomosis area with cooled RHX during the procedure helps to prevent thromboses. When using continuous sutures, perform this step analogous to venous anastomosis.\nPerform graft reperfusion.\n\t\nWhen both anastomosis sites appear patent and any bleeding is stopped, release the vascular clamps on the graft vessels (Figure 2).\nInspect the graft for signs of reperfusion, such as reddening, filling of the vein, or pulsation in the graft artery.\nConnect the vaginal cuff of the transplant to the vaginal vault of the recipient by using six to seven intraluminal (6/0 polyglactin) interrupted sutures.\n\t\tNOTE: Start with a single suture at the 12 o'clock position first, and place the next ones at the 10 and 1 o'clock positions. The two sutures at the 9 and 3 o'clock positions should be tied after the sutures in the front row19,20.",
    "Anastomose the graft uterine horn end-to-end to the remaining cranial uterine segment of the recipient uterus by using five to seven interrupted sutures (7/0 polyamide).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not stitch through the lumen.\nClose the abdomen with a continuous suture. Use 4/0 polyglactin for suturing the muscle layer, and 6/0 polyamide or surgical wound clips for the skin.\nLet the animal recover in a warmed cage once the transplant is completed. Remain with the animal until it has regained sternal recumbency ability, and maintain single housing until its full recovery. Provide psotopertaive analgesia treatment by subcutaneously administering buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) and suitable NSAID, however not before 4-8 hours after the first dose of anesthesia. Provide continuous with buprenorphine via drinking water (1 mg/kg, oral, 5 mL buprenorphine in 160 mL drinking water (0.3 mg/mL)) for three days after surgery.\nThe skin suture is removed 10-14 days post suregery.\nSubscription Required.
