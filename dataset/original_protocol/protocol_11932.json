    "All experiments were carried out following the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Chengdu University of TCM Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The care and maintenance of the animals in the laboratory were performed following References14,15. Adult male C57BL/6J mice, weighing 20-25 g, were used for the test. All mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle at 24 °C and 40%-50% humidity, with free access to food and water. The following protocol depicts the moxibustion procedures under typical laboratory housing conditions.\n1. Preparation of the equipment\nMouse tethering\n\t\nPrepare a mouse tethering device consisting of a vertical plate, vertical plate base, and brackets made of wood.\n\t\t\nConstruct the fixed body using a straight wooden splint (length: 30 cm x width: 3 cm x height: 3 cm) and attach the fixed velcro belt (which is made up of two sides: a hook side (4 cm x 3 cm) and a loop side (10 cm x 3 cm)) to allow tethering of the mouse body while maintaining flexibility (see Table of Materials).\nUse a glue gun to attach the hook side on the right side of the wooden splint and attach a 1/4 length of the loop side on the left side.\nPlace the mouse on the fixed bed, and use the fixed velcro belt to tether the torso of the mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the tethering belt is not tight enough to exert pressure on the heart, which could lead to the death of the mouse. Tether the mouse loosely but firmly.\nUse tape to attach the lower/upper limbs to either side of the wooden splint and attach the tail to the surface of the wooden splint.\nPreparation of the mouse-bed rack",
    "NOTE: The rack comprises a vertical wood plate, wood baseplate, and wood brackets. The bracket consists of an L-shaped piece of stainless steel, which provides support for each mouse bed.\n\t\nAttach the vertical plate onto the base plate, and create square grooves in the base plate to insert wooden sticks used as baffles (Figure 1).\nPrepare a transparent, plastic head cover if the mice are administered moxibustion above the head.\n\t\t\nUse a 1000 mL syringe, and remove the needle and core rod. Use a cutting tool or knife to cut the syringe jacket in half.\nChoose either side of the syringe jacket, cut off the head and tail, and set the middle section aside (length: 4 cm) as the headcover for the mouse.\nDrill a hole (1 cm) at the center of the syringe jacket with a drill machine and place a moxa stick in the hole. Place a headcover over the mouse's head to limit its head movement and protect it from the ignited moxa.\nAttach two parallel wooden strips (length: 7 cm x wide: 1 cm) and a horizontal cross-piece (length: 7.5 cm x width: 1 cm) to the head end of the mouse bed if mice are administered moxibustion on the forelimbs (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: The space between each parallel wooden strip and the mouse bed should be 1 cm. The number of brackets and height of the vertical plates can be determined based on experimental requirements. These steps should be performed gently to avoid terrifying the mice. Be sure to give mice adaptive training for 1 week before the experiment.\nPreparation of moxibustion stick holder",
    "Prepare the moxibustion stick holder comprising a magnetic metal rectangle (length: 30 cm), a bracket base (length: 5 cm x width: 5 cm x height: 2 cm), and wooden cubes (length: 3 cm x width: 1.5 cm x height: 1 cm), each with a hole (diameter: 0.55 cm) in the center into which a moxa stick may be placed (see Table of Materials).\nAttach a flat, thin magnet (length: 3 cm × width: 1.5 cm, thickness: 0.2 cm) to one side of each cube. The magnetic attraction between the cubes with moxa sticks and the holder allows adjusting the height of the moxa sticks.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the magnetic poles of the cube magnets are opposite the holder magnet's pole.\nTo record the beginning and end of the moxibustion procedure, place a timing device (see Table of Materials) near the mouse tethering device where it can be easily read.\nUse a bare or thinly gloved hand when holding and tethering the mice. A thinly gloved hand is also effective during moxibustion treatment.\n2. Moxibustion procedure\nPut on the laboratory gloves. Before moxibustion treatment, shave the fur via mouse shaver at the moxibustion site to expose the acupoint.\nInsert moxa sticks (0.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length) into the moxibustion stick holder (which comprises the magnetic metal rectangle, bracket base, and wooden cubes with holes in their centers for moxa stick insertion, and one stick holder can only accommodate one moxa stick, step 1.3).\nTo ascertain the moxibustion temperature, attach a digital thermo-detector at the acupoint to monitor the temperature variation.\nStart the timer and ignite the moxa stick; fix or control the distance between the skin of the acupoint and the lighted end of the moxa stick depending on the temperature variation required for the experiment.",
    "3. Simultaneous mouse moxibustion\nNOTE: Mice can be treated with moxibustion as a group. A mouse-bed rack is used to position the mouse beds so that a group of mice can be treated simultaneously.\nPlace each mouse bed on the rack and insert a wooden stick into the base plate to protect the mice from falling (Figure 3).\nInsert moxa sticks (0.5 cm in diameter and 12 cm in length) into the moxibustion stick holder at levels that coincide with each mouse bed. Adjust the distance between the mouse rack and stick holder, and then ignite the moxa sticks.\n\tNOTE: This allows the mice to be treated with moxibustion in a relaxed, comfortable state. During moxibustion, ensure that the distance between the mouse rack and stick holder remains consistent for all mice.\nBefore modeling, conduct the mouse responses to the thermal withdrawal threshold (TWL) test to determine whether moxibustion would be effective in analgesia.\nSubscription Required.
