    "The study was performed according to national regulations for animal experimentation and EU Directive 2010/63. Prepare equipment as described previously by Brittain et al.8.\n1. Mouse Preparation\nObtain 12 to 13 week-old male C57Bl6/J mice and house them with a 12 h light/dark cycle, at a constant room temperature, and with ad libitum access to standard laboratory chow and water, until the start of the experiment.\nAnesthetize the mouse using general anesthesia approved by the Institute and check for the lack of response to the toe pinch. Under mild anesthesia with isoflurane 0.8%–1.2%, fix the mouse on a heated platform. Apply electrode gel to its extremities for the continuous monitoring of its heart rate and temperature.\nDepilate the mouse's chest hair using depilation creme. To reduce pressure on its thorax, do not apply the ultrasound coupling gel directly on the thorax; rather, apply a layer of the gel to the tip of the transducer.\n2. Image Acquisition\nApical four-chamber view with a left and caudal tilt of the platform\nAfter the mouse preparation, angulate the platform to the left at 10°–15° and then caudally at 10°–15°.\nPosition the transducer above the apex with the imaging plane ~45° to the coronal plane and the central axis of the ultrasound beam directed cranially, posterior, and to the left to obtain the apical four-chamber view. Press the B-Mode button to activate the B-mode/2-D image.\nNOTE: The transducer can be held manually or fixed by a stage. The term \"B-mode\" comes from the imaging system that was used instead of the more familiar term \"two-dimensional\" (2-D) and is used throughout the protocol.",
    "Look for the appearance of the following structures in the acoustic window: the left ventricle (LV), the left atrium (LA), the RV, the right atrium (RA), the mitral valve (MV), and the tricuspid valve (TV).\nManipulate the imaging plane in the coronal plane and rotate clock- and counterclockwise around the central axis until both ventricles are visualized at their longest dimension and both atria are visible. This is the four-chamber view (Figure 1).\nPress the Cine store button to save the recording.\nPress the Scan/Freeze button to pause the system.\nMeasurement of transtricuspid blood flow velocities\nPress the Scan/Freeze button to activate the system.\nPress the Overlay button several times to activate the sample volume for PW (pulsed wave) mode.\nWhile keeping the obtained four-chamber view, use the trackball to position the sample volume at the opening of the tricuspid valves for the measurement of inflow velocities (E and A peak velocities).\nPress the PW mode button for the measurement of inflow velocities (E and A peak velocities).\nNOTE: Because tricuspid valves are difficult to visualize in this position, performing several measurements helps to align correctly the sample volume with the blood flow. Perform the Doppler sampling with the smallest incidence angle between the Doppler beam and the blood flow direction. The obtained blood flow profile should correspond to the following criteria: 1) an inflow profile similar to an M-shape with the first peak lower than the second; 2) a respiratory modulation with an increased amplitude at inspiration; 3) a maximal amplitude of velocities in several measurements (Figure 2).\nPress the Cine store button to save the optimized recording.\nPress the Scan/Freeze button to pause the system.\nMeasurement of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)\nPress the Scan/Freeze button to activate the system.",
    "Switch to B-mode by pressing the B-Mode button. Some manipulations on the image might be necessary to regain the correct four-chamber view.\nPress the Overlay button several times to activate the sample volume of the M-mode. Using the trackball, align the sample volume with the lateral part of the tricuspid annulus. By pulling the edges of the sample volume using the trackball, align the length of the sample volume to cover the entire amplitude of the cardiac movement during the cardiac cycle.\nPress the M-Mode button to activate M-mode. Tricuspid annulus' movements should appear as a wave (Figure 2).\nPress the Cine store button to save the recording.\nPress the Scan/Freeze button to pause the system.\nMeasurement of tissue Doppler parameters\nPress the Scan/Freeze button to activate the system.\nPress the B-Mode button to activate B-mode.\nNOTE: Some manipulations by angulation in the coronal plane and rotation clock- and counterclockwise around the central axis of the image might be necessary to regain the correct four-chamber view.\nPress the Overlay button several times to activate the sample volume for TDI (tissue Doppler imaging). Using the trackball, align the sample volume with the lateral part of the tricuspid annulus, where the RV free wall creates an angle with the tricuspid valve. By pulling the edges of the sample volume using the trackball, adjust the sample volume to include both the systolic and the diastolic extreme positions of the annulus.\nPress the Tissue button to activate TDI mode.\n\t\tNOTE: Yellow tracing of the TDI recording appears corresponding to the following criteria:1) a recording similar to an inverted M-shape; 2) clearly distinguishable E' and A' peaks during diastole and S' peak during systole; 3) a maximal amplitude of velocities in several measurements (Figure 2).\nPress the Cine store button to record an optimized image.",
    "Press the Scan/Freeze button to pause the system.\nApical four-chamber view with right and cranial tilt of the platform\nAngulate the platform to the right at 10°–15° and then cranial at 10°–15°. Perform the measurements as described in the previous sections for the LeCa steps (steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4).\nNOTE: During the investigation, isoflurane should be titrated between 0.–1.2 to keep the mouse's heart rate at 400–440 bpm. In this range, separate peaks of transtricuspid blood flow and tissue Doppler (DTI) velocities are measurable. To avoid the effects of the heat loss on hemodynamics, the data are recorded, and the analysis is performed off-line. Only signals obtained at the end-expiration are used for analysis. Measurements of 3 - 5 heartbeats are averaged.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
