    "The purpose of this protocol is to detail the steps required to express opsin in the tissue of a macaque monkey brain, such that light can be used to manipulate neuronal activity. Choosing a virus is an essential part of the experimental design. We have found success with adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (see Tremblay et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0015] for a review of virus types in non-human primate optogenetics). The choice of viral payload will be determined by what experimental manipulation is being performed (inhibition or activation) as well as the kinetics of the manipulation (Mattis et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0013]). For instance, Channelrhodopsin-2 (hChR2) and a chimeric opsin variant (C1V1) have been used to stimulate neural activity, and Archaerhodopsin-3 (ArchT) and Jaws have been used to inhibit neural activity in nonhuman primates (Tremblay et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0015]). In order to verify viral expression, it is essential to choose a virus that causes cells expressing its optogenetic payload to coexpress a fluorescent indicator such as enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP), green fluorescent protein (GFP), or mCherry.\nMaterials\nVirus\nHead holder (item #1)\nSurgical blades #15 and #11\nPeriosteal elevator (item #2)\nAdson tissue forceps\nHemostats 5″ and 3.5″\nMayo scissors\nBone Rongeur\nBone wax\nSurgical patties (item #3)\nAbsorbable suture (e.g., Vicryl 3-0)\nSurgical drill\nCircular cutting wheel (item #4)\nDrill bit (item #5)\nSurgical spoon (item #8)\nFrazier dura hook\nFine forceps\nIris scissor\nBraided suture lines (e.g., silk/Vicryl 5-0)\nInjector array (Fredericks et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0007])\nSterile transparent film (item #9)\nArtificial dura (item #10)\nAbsorbable braided suture lines (e.g., Vicryl 5-0)\nNon-absorbable sutures for this procedure (e.g., Ethilon 3-0)\nGrooved surgical spoon (item #8)\nBone putty (item #11)\nHead stabilization\n1. Use a low-profile head holder (Jerry-Rig USA, item #1) to stabilize the animal's head (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0001]).",
    "For secure head placement, the ridges on the tooth bar should be placed symmetrically between the molar teeth, and the teeth should lay flat on the tooth bar. The orbit bar should be secured in a horizontal position, parallel to the base.\nIt is important to make sure that the head holder does not apply any pressure on the lips and tongue, as this can cause tissue damage and severe swelling during the procedure. The intubation tube should be taped and secured to the head holder, to prevent it from being accidentally pulled out when the head is rotated.\nThis head holder was originally developed by Karl Pribram and Karl Lashley and was modified by Mortimer Mishkin and Richard Saunders. Unlike stereotaxic devices, this head holder does not require earbars, making it possible to fully retract the temporalis muscle. Moreover, its rotational ball technology provides the ability to rotate the head during surgery.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/90450390-6318-41fe-8b1f-f9a798d3e95b/cpz1704-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nHead placement in the low-profile head holder.\nIncision\n2. Perform a long coronal incision on the skin crossing zygomatic arches on both sides (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0002]) using a surgical blade (#15).\nThis provides access to the temporal and zygomatic bones, as well as parietal bones on which we will implant the pedestal connector. The incision should be made in one smooth (controlled) motion to leave straight, clean edges of skin for optimal healing.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/83d82c79-bbcc-4886-8a23-78aec169608d/cpz1704-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nCoronal incision.\n3. Separate the skin margin from the fascia using a periosteal elevator (item #2) while holding the skin margin with Adson tissue forceps.\n4. Apply retraction to the skin by placing five large hemostats (5″) on each side of the margin, evenly spaced.",
    "Hemostats should be attached to the hypodermis so as not to compromise the integrity of the skin margin. This will lead to more rapid healing of the incision line.\n5. Make an incision in the fascia parallel to the skin margin with the same blade.\nIt is important to only cut the layers of the fascia and not the epimysium of the underlying temporalis muscle. This can be achieved by applying opposing pressure with the thumb and forefinger of the hand not holding the blade, such that when all layers of the fascia have been cut, it will pull apart under pressure from the other hand. As with the skin, the fascia incision should be performed in one controlled, continuous motion, so as to leave one clean edge for closing.\nAlternatively, the incision through the fascia can be made using Mayo scissors to avoid damage to the muscle capsule. Make a small incision with the blade over the midline. Blunt dissect a pocket in each hemisphere, using a periosteal elevator or closed Mayo scissors (∼5″) parallel to the line of the skin incision. Place the open scissors into the pocket and apply pressure away from the skull while cutting to produce a single clean edge for closing.\n6. Similar to skin, apply retraction to the fascia by placing five small hemostats (3.5″) to each side of the margin, evenly spaced.\nSkull exposure\n7. Removing the zygomatic arch allows us to fully reflect the temporalis muscle and expose the temporal bone. To expose the arch, make a 10-15 mm incision in the temporalis muscle fascia covering the arch.",
    "The incision should be made on the horizontal midline of the arch using a surgical blade (#15). The blade should be pressed against the bone to ensure that the fascia is cut thoroughly and creating clean edges for closure.\n8. Use a periosteal elevator to detach the muscle and fascia attachments from the arch.\nThese attachments are mainly temporalis muscle and partly masseter and zygomaticus major muscles. It is important to carefully remove all attachments from the zygomatic arch in order to remove it with minimal damage to the surrounding muscles. This will help to preserve the integrity of the muscles. To do this, the sharp end of a periosteal elevator can be used to bluntly detach the attachments from all sides of the arch. Avoid causing unnecessary trauma to the surrounding tissues.\n9. Extract the zygomatic arch. After isolating the arch, cut both ends using a bone rongeur and extract the arch (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0003]). Then, use the tip of the rongeur to remove all the remaining parts of the arch on the zygomatic bone and temporal bone.\nIt is important to smooth any residual sharp edges to avoid causing trauma to the muscles and the soft tissue around the arch.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5972499a-a7f0-4545-aca9-85722e326d28/cpz1704-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nRemoving the zygomatic arch.\n10. Use bone wax to stop osteal bleeding After applying bone wax to the bleeding bone edges, use a periosteal elevator and a 5 × 20 mm piece of surgical patties (item #3) to firmly press the wax against the bone orifices.\n11. Close the fascia incision over the arch with an absorbable suture (e.g., Vicryl 3-0) with a simple continuous or interrupted suture pattern.",
    "12. Now the temporal bone can be exposed by detaching the temporalis muscle from its origins on the dorsal aspect of the skull. Use the sharp edge of a periosteal elevator to detach the dorsal part of the temporalis muscle from the periosteum of the parietal and frontal bones. To detach the body of the muscle, gently retract the muscle away from the bone using Adson forceps and detach it by moving the elevator horizontally (rostrocaudal) along the attachment line to keep the muscle capsule intact as it is separated from the bone.\n13. Reflect the temporalis muscle toward its ventral insertions, then use traction on the temporalis muscle to maximize access to the temporal bone (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9814f664-7489-496d-8fdb-92f73d094467/cpz1704-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nCraniotomy with a circular cutting wheel.\nCraniotomy (bone flap removal)\n14. Use a circular cutting wheel (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0004]; item #4) at a 45° angle to the surface of the bone. The angle is important since later we replace the bone flap for closure. To prevent dura damage during craniotomy, try not to drill through the full thickness of the skull.\n15. Finish the opening by using two periosteal elevators to break the bone flap free from the cranium. Firmly but cautiously insert the elevators along one edge of the craniotomy so as to make contact with the full thickness of the edge of the bone flap without penetrating the dura. Apply pressure to the elevators to carefully lift the bone flap, detaching it gradually from the skull. Move the elevators along the bone flap until at least three sides of the bone flap are detached.\nAlternatively (less preferred method), the craniotomy can be performed using drill bits (item #5) and covered by titanium straps (item #6) or Teflon (item #7) for closure.",
    "16. While removing the bone flap, carefully detach any dura adhesions by sliding one of the elevators between the flap and the dura.\n17. After removing the bone flap, carefully detach any dura adhesions to the skull around the craniotomy margin.\nSpecial caution is needed near the ventral posterior aspect and the interaural canal, where the vein of Labbé runs from the dura to the bone.\n18. Smooth the dorsal and anterior margins of the craniotomy and the bone flap edges using a rongeur.\n19. Using a drill bit (item #5), drill four holes on the dorsal edge of the craniotomy which later will be used for suturing the bone flap back into place (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0005]). During drilling, use a ‘surgical spoon’ (item #8) between the bone and dura to protect the dura and the cortex. Drill these holes at an angle—exit hole closer to the bone margin than the entry hole—to make it easier to pass a needle through.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d0d1607c-31d0-422a-b939-bc4d27939a59/cpz1704-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nExpanding the craniotomy.\n20. Expand the ventral aspect of the craniotomy by rongeuring the temporal and sphenoid bones to the skull base (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0005]). Use an elevator to ensure the bone is separated from the dura before rongeuring to avoid tearing the dura or bridging vessels. This expansion of the craniotomy is crucial for accessing the lateral aspect of the inferior temporal cortex.\n21. Bone wax can be used to control osteal bleeding around the craniotomy, particularly the ventral side. Use a periosteal elevator and a 5 × 20 mm section of surgical patties (item #3) to press the bone wax into the bone orifices.\nDural opening\nA T-shaped incision in the dura provides the best access to the central and anterior IT (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f3e30615-7164-4d57-aa60-754605250eff/cpz1704-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nDural opening.",
    "22. Cut the superficial layers of dura using a surgical blade #11. Hold the blade with the sharp edge facing away from the dura. Position the blade parallel to the dura, and make an incision through the superficial layers with the tip of the blade, using a steady and controlled motion.\n23. To perform a dural incision, use a Frazier dura hook (∼5″). First, hold the handle of the dura hook with your dominant hand and insert the hook into the partially cut dura. Once the hook is inside the incision, rotate it so that it is perpendicular to the dura surface. Gently pull the dura away from the brain using the hook. To make the first incision, hold a surgical blade #11 parallel to the dura with your other hand, then insert the tip of the blade to fully penetrate the dura. If the dura remained intact until this point, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will flow out. It is important to be careful and precise when performing this procedure, to avoid any damage to the cortex.\n24. Expand the dura opening with a dorsal curved incision with an approximate 4-mm margin from the edge of the craniotomy. Pull the edge of the opened dura with fine forceps (∼3″) away from the cortex and insert an Iris scissor (∼3″) to cut the dura along the craniotomy margin.\nPreferably, avoid closing and opening with scissors, as this can create jagged or uneven margins. Instead, open the tip of the scissors a couple of mm and use a sliding motion to cut the dura, creating clean straight margins.\n25. Perform a second right-angled dural incision towards the temporal pole reaching the rostral-ventral corner of the craniotomy. Apply tension to the edge of the dura with fine forceps and cut with Iris scissors.",
    "26. Optionally, two braided suture lines (e.g., silk/Vicryl 5-0) attached to small hemostatic forceps can be used to provide retraction.\nVirus injection\n27. To speed up the virus injection procedure, use an injector array: a novel multi-channel injection device designed to target the ventral surface of the cortex, and facilitate efficient and uniform vector delivery to the cortical regions of the nonhuman primate brain. This array consists of four 2.5-mm 31-gauge needles placed on a 3D printed manifold (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0007]). For more details and instructions see Fredericks et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0007].\nCovering the lateral surface of the central IT (the area of interest of this paper) often requires 3 to 4 placements of the injection array, injecting 10 µl per needle at a 0.5 µl/min rate, resulting in 40 µl per array placement in 20 min. At the end of each injection, leave a 10-min wait time to allow the injected liquid to disperse and diffuse into the cortical tissue before removing the needles.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/88bff62d-704e-4c80-860c-e01141bb04a2/cpz1704-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nVirus injection.\n28. After the injection procedure, place sterile transparent film (item #9) on the pial surface and mark the injection site, craniotomy margins, and other anatomical landmarks, then remove the film. This film will be used to pinpoint the injection site in the second surgery to make a dural opening of the appropriate size and location.\nDural closure\n29. Before closing the dura, cut and place a piece of artificial dura (item #10) between the dura and cortex to prevent the formation of adhesions prior to the second surgery.\n30. Use absorbable braided suture lines (e.g., Vicryl 5-0) for dural closure. First, secure the tips of each dural flap to one another, and then attach the joined region to the dorsal edge of the dura opening with single interrupted sutures.",
    "31. Close the dorsal-ventral incision with a simple continuous suture pattern with 1-2 mm spacing, starting from the rostral-ventral corner of the craniotomy. The dura closure procedure can be completed by closing both sides of the dorsal incision with continuous sutures (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0008]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/26ee2eb4-7545-4a73-8597-2f2b0969e4c4/cpz1704-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nDural closure after virus injection.\nBone flap replacement\n32. Use non-absorbable sutures for this procedure (e.g., Ethilon 3-0). Pass the suture lines through each of the four holes previously drilled into the skull. Place a grooved surgical spoon (item #8) under the skull while passing the needles through the holes to protect the dura and cortex.\n33. Pass the suture lines through all four corresponding holes in the bone flap.\n34. Fix the bone flap in place by using square knots. To do this, tie two half knots in opposite directions, allowing gradual tightening. Do not fully tighten a single knot while the rest of them are still loose, as this may misplace the bone flap by pulling it too much to one side. Instead, tighten the knots in parallel by slightly tightening each one in separate steps. After ensuring that the bone flap is securely fastened in place, tie two more half knots to secure the bone flap.\n35. Optionally, injectable bone putty can be used to fill the gaps (item #11) and promote osteoinductivity.\nClosing\n36. Reposition the temporalis muscle to its original location and secure it in place using two or three simple interrupted sutures on the frontal and occipital sides. Choose absorbable suture lines (e.g., Vicryl 3-0) and avoid applying too much tension on the muscle during reattachment.\n37. Close the fascia with a simple interrupted or continuous suture pattern with absorbable suture line (Vicryl 3-0).",
    "38. Close the skin with interrupted or continuous horizontal mattress suture patterns with a non-absorbable line (e.g., Ethilon 3-0).\nPost-operative care\n39. Monitor the animal's heart rate, temperature, and respiration until it regains consciousness. Then transfer the animal to a heated cage in an ICU or return to its home cage. Standard post-operative treatment consists of prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin 25 mg/kg IM BID for 3 days) and analgesics (e.g., ketoprofen 1-2 mg/kg IM BID for 3 days followed by ibuprofen 100 mg PO BID for 4 days). If cerebral edema or swelling occurs, mannitol (2 mg/kg IV) and/or dexamethasone (4 mg IM BID) may be administered. Monitor the animal for seizure activity for at least 3 days post-operatively and treat any seizures with diazepam (0.25-1 mg/kg IM) as needed. Moreover, provide supportive care such as softened food, additional fresh fruit, fluid, and electrolyte oral supplements during the post-operative recovery period. The animal routinely resumes post-operative testing 10 to 14 days after surgery based on an uneventful recovery period.",
    "The second surgery is performed 4 to 8 weeks after the first surgery. The goal of the second surgery is to confirm virus expression and implant the Opto-Array. The general approach and closing is the same as the first surgery. Drill the bone flap on the same lines as the first surgery if the bone flap has fused with the skull.\nMaterials\nEverything used in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-prot-0001], except injection array and viruses.\nLight source (item #13)\nLight filter (item #13)\nOpto-Array (item #12; for more details see Rajalingham et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0014])\nOpto-Array driver and portable computer\nSelf-drilling titanium screws (6 mm; item #14)\nMedical-grade polypropylene mesh (item #15)\nTitanium plates (item #16)\nSelf-drilling titanium screws (3.5 mm; item #17)\nArtificial dural graft (item #18)\nSelf-tapping titanium screws (item #19)\nSelf-tapping titanium screws (item #20)\nDental acrylic\nAdhesive cement system (item #21)\nDural opening\n1. After removing the external artificial dura (if used) between the dura and skull, use the transparent film marked in the first surgery to find the injected site.\n2. Perform a horizontal dural incision parallel to the skull base at least 10 mm dorsal to the injection site (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0009]; follow the procedure explained in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-prot-0001]; steps 21-22, ‘Dural opening’ section 2.1.5).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1cc77591-713f-43ab-b03f-8a8b07d385f7/cpz1704-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nVerification of virus expression.\n3. Perform two parallel dural incisions extending to the ventral margin of the craniotomy. The distance between the parallel incisions should be 4 mm, which is the distance between the Opto-Array (item #12) holes. Keep in mind that the opening will widen after the incisions are made, so it is best to plan for a slightly smaller opening.\n4. After opening the dura, remove the artificial dura placed between the dura and cortex in the first surgery using fine forceps to expose the cortex.",
    "Virus expression verification\n5. To confirm expression of the viral payload, check and document the fluorescent signature of the virus. Use a light source and filter (item #13) with wavelengths matching the virus fluorescent protein (for example, 440-460-nm excitation light, 500-nm longpass filter for cells expressing green GFP). Turn off the ambient lights in the operating room and use the light source to illuminate the cortical surface. Then look at the cortical area through the filter, which blocks most of the light reflected from the cortex. The GFP should emit a wavelength that passes through the filter, causing the cortex to appear to be glowing. Capture the evidence of expression by taking a photograph.\nOpto-Array implantation\n6. Secure the connector pedestal to the skull with two self-drilling titanium screws (6 mm; item #14). The remaining screws to secure the pedestal connector will be placed later in the procedure.\nThe array connector and cables need to be gas-sterilized prior to the surgery.\n7. Implant the array by suturing the holes located on its four corners to the edges of the dural window that was opened in the previous step (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0010]). Surgeon's knots and braided non-absorbable suture material should be used to secure the array in place (5-0 silk).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/34cfe312-536b-4337-af37-fcf9cd67e65b/cpz1704-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nOpto-Array implantation.\n8. The skin around the pedestal implant may gradually recede, exposing the wires. To protect the wires, cover them with a medical-grade polypropylene mesh (item #15) made for hernioplasty surgeries. Secure the wire and the mesh on the skull with titanium plates (item #16) and self-drilling titanium screws (3.5 mm; item #17).",
    "9. Test the Opto-Array to make sure it was not damaged during implantation of the array and wire by connecting it to its driver and associated portable computer, and running a script that flashes each light.\nAt this stage, the array can be replaced if necessary, since the pedestal connector has not been permanently implanted.\nDural closure\n10. Place the dura flap back to cover the Opto-Array, suture the dorsal edge followed by the anterior edge. For dura closure, use braided absorbable sutures (Vicryl 5-0) in a simple interrupted pattern (Fig. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0011]).\nIt is important not to over-tighten the dura flap on the array in order to avoid cortical damage.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b96f0723-d3d0-487c-922c-7a3bd00de795/cpz1704-fig-0011-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 11\nDural closure after Opto-Array implantation.\n11. After closure, cover the dura with an artificial collagen-based dural graft (item #18) to conceal any gap remaining in the dural opening and to facilitate dural cell growth in the region of the opening.\nPedestal connector implantation\n12. After closing the dura and replacing the bone flap (per Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-prot-0001], steps 32-35), secure the pedestal with self-drilling titanium screws (6 mm; item #14). To avoid damaging the sagittal sinus, avoid placing screws on the sagittal midline (Fig. 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-fig-0012]).\nSelf-drilling screws may not secure the pedestal in the long term. Therefore, self-tapping titanium screws (item #19) are preferred.\nAlternatively, the implant can be reinforced using a dental adhesive cement system applied on the skull and under the pedestal connector. Two or three self-tapping titanium screws (item #20) can be implanted around the pedestal and covered with dental acrylic contiguous with the acrylic covering the base of the pedestal. The dental adhesive cement system (item #21) can also be applied to fill the gap between the base of the pedestal and the skull before using acrylic.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/afebda1d-91e9-4891-9723-ab6044999731/cpz1704-fig-0012-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 12",
    "Implantation of the pedestal connector and securing the wire.\nPost-operative care\n13. Follow the post-operative care outlined in Protocol 1, Step 39. However, enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg PO QD for 7-10 days) is a more suitable choice of antibiotic to protect the tissue around the implanted device from infection.",
    "Many behavioral experiments are possible using the methods described above. Here, we outline the general task design we use to probe behavioral detection of an optogenetic stimulus and the steps we use to train the animal on this task.\nMaterials\nLaboratory macaque monkey with titanium headpost following implantation of Opto-Array\nWater or fruit juice\nBehavior chair (item #22)\nComputerized control system\nBehavior software (MWorks)\nReward delivery system (item #23)\nComputer monitor\nEye tracker (Eyelink 1000, SR Research)\nGeneral structure of the behavioral task\nAlthough specific tasks will differ depending on the experiment, we assume the basics of training non-human primates on complex behavioral tasks are shared and give details on training a macaque monkey to perform the cortical perturbation detection task. The cortical-perturbation-detection (CPD) task is a psychophysical detection task in which the animal is rewarded for correctly identifying whether a given trial contains optogenetic stimulation (Azadi et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0001]; Azadi et al., 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0002]; Lafer-Sousa et al., 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0012]; Rajalingham et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.704#cpz1704-bib-0014]). Each trial begins with the animal fixating on a central fixation point (black-on-white bullseye, 0.4° outer diameter and 0.2° inner diameter) for 500 ms. Then an image appears on the screen for 1000 ms while the animal must maintain fixation on the central fixation point. In 50% of the trials (randomly selected), 500 ms after the image appears, a cortical stimulation pulse is delivered by illuminating an LED. After the image disappears from the screen, two response targets appear and the animal is trained to fixate on the target that corresponds to the trial condition (“stimulation” or “no-stimulation”).\nBefore training",
    "Before training on the CPD task, the animal must be trained to enter the primate behavior chair and be motivated by water scheduling. Water scheduling should be performed in accordance with the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Experimental training should take place in a quiet experimental booth equipped with the ability to deliver the animal liquid rewards, track gaze, and display experimental stimuli on a computer screen in front of the animal.\nTraining step I: Eye tracker calibration\nThe goal of this step is to gain the ability to automatically reward the animal based on its eye movements. If the animal is naïve to behavioral experiments, it can be difficult to establish a ground-truth eye position because in the uncalibrated system it is not possible to automatically reward the animal for correctly fixating on a fixation point.\n1. Start with an eye-tracker calibration derived from another (already trained) animal in the same booth.\nIf a preexisting eye tracker calibration is not available, use a calibration derived from a human lab member performing the calibration procedure with their head in the same location the animal's head would be.\n2. Begin the eye tracker's calibration sequence. An experimenter should be standing by, observing the eye trace and manually rewarding the animal by giving it a small amount of water/juice through its juice tube (approximately ¼-½ ml) and when the animal appears to fixate on the current calibration point, reward it with water/juice.\nOver the course of approximately two hours, the animal should learn to fixate on the fixation points and successively better calibrations will be achieved.\nTraining step II: Fixation training",
    "3. A behavioral task should be prepared that rewards the animal for fixating on a fixation point for a set length of time. In this task, the animal accepts a trial by fixating at a fixation point and must maintain that fixation for a set amount of time. If the animal maintains this fixation, it receives a reward. If it does not, it receives a “time out” in which the fixation point does not appear for a set length of time and it cannot initiate a new trial.\nThe purpose of fixation training is to instruct the animal about the trial structure and reward contingency of the eventual CPD task.\n4. Begin training the animal on the fixation task with starting parameters of 200 ms fixation time and 1 s “time out” time.\n5. The fixation time should be slowly “walked up” in 50-100 ms increments until the animal is able to fixate for the length of time required by the behavioral experiment. Each increase in fixation time should be done between behavioral sessions, and fixation time should be increased whenever the animal is completing over 85% of the trials it initiates.\n6. During fixation training, the volume of reward should be titrated to maximize the number of trials the animal will perform. This should be done by keeping the total amount of water given to the animal per day constant, but reducing the per-trial reward each day by a small amount. The maximum number of trials will vary by subject, but it is reasonable to begin training aiming for 200 trials and finish training aiming for approximately 1000.\nTraining step III: CPD Task Training",
    "7. Before each day's training, test the Opto-Array. This can be done by manually activating an LED and recording the resulting change in temperature signature. If activating a light causes a change in the onboard temperature sensor, then the light is working. If it fails to elicit one, then the connection should be double-checked or that light may be burnt out and another light should be used.\n8. To speed learning, begin by showing only one image to the animal per day and using high light power (5 LEDs, each simultaneously illuminated with 10 to 12 mW). The trial structure is described in the introduction to this section.\n9. If the animal develops a choice bias, implement a “correction loop” procedure to the trial structure. A “correction loop” is the addition of a rule to the task that specifies that if the animal makes three wrong choices in a row, every subsequent trial will be delivered as the type opposite to what they have been choosing. The animal is “released” from the loop when they make a correct choice.\n10. Once the animal begins detecting cortical stimulations, increase the number of images shown to the animal each day. A doubling procedure (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) works well. The number of images should be increased whenever the animal's performance is above 85%.\n11. Concurrent with increasing image numbers, the power of stimulation should be decreased gradually while maintaining performance above 85%. A reasonable starting power is 5 LEDs at 10 to 12 mW, and a reasonable target power after a month of training is 1 LED at 5 mW.",
    "Throughout, but especially during early training when the light power is high, the temperature of the Opto-Array should be monitored by the experiment control system. If it exceeds 2°C to 3°C above baseline, the experiment should be immediately paused and the array allowed to cool. Experimental parameters should be chosen to avoid overheating."
