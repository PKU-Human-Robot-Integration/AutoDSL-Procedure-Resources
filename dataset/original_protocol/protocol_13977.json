Preparation of Human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC)-qualified Matrix Coated Plates and Coverslips\nNOTE: Perform all the steps under a sterilized tissue culture hood.\nThaw hESC-qualified matrix stock solution overnight on ice at 4 °C. Refer to the product specification sheet to determine appropriate aliquot volumes as this may vary depending upon the stock. Store these aliquots at -20 °C in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nIn order to use the matrix for coating plates or glass coverslips, first thaw an aliquot of hESC-qualified matrix at 4 °C for 30 min.\nAliquot 24 mL of cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM): nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F:12) media into a 50 mL conical tube.\nMix the cold DMEM/F:12 media with a 2 mL glass pipette in order to cool down the surface of the pipette.",
    "Using the same pipette, take up approximately 500−700 μL of cold DMEM/F:12 and mix with the hESC-qualified matrix aliquot within the microcentrifuge tube itself.\nOnce properly mixed, transfer the solution to the 50 mL conical tube containing the cold DMEM/F:12 and mix again.\nFor a standard 6 well plate, add 1 mL of this mixture to each well.

    "Transfer the solution with the disaggregated cells to the round bottom tubes with the cell strainer caps. Allow the cell solution to drain naturally or tap the bottom of the tube against a flat surface, as necessary, to ensure complete drainage and collection of the cells into the tube. Make sure to set the tube back on ice as soon as possible.\nRinse the cell strainer with 250 µL of PBS to recover any residual cells.\nMaintain the tubes on ice and cover with aluminum foil until flow cytometry analysis.\n8.

Assessment of Intracellular Ca2+ Transients",
    "Once the iPSC-CMs are at least 3 months old, have undergone metabolic selection (section 6), and have been plated on coverslips, treat them with 2 μL of Fura-2, AM (final concentration: 1 μM) and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Fura-2 is light-sensitive. Perform all loading procedures and experiments in the dark.\nPrepare the calcium and contractility acquisition and analysis system.\n\t\nPower the system ensuring that the arc lamp is initiated (Figure 1B).\nPlace the chamber on the system and connect the tubes from the pump to the appropriate inlet and outlets and the electric wire from the stimulator to the chamber as shown in Figure 1C.\nFill the perfusion tube that runs through the fluidic inline heater with 37 °C prewarmed Tyrode's solution.\nAdjust the camera and framing aperture dimensions to minimize background area.\nMount a glass coverslip with iPSC-CMs into the chamber and fasten.\nAdd 500 μL of Tyrode's solution directly on top of the fastened glass coverslip gently and start perfusing the chamber (1.5 mL/min) with Tyrode's solution.\nPace iPSC-CMs with 1 Hz field stimulation using the electrical stimulator (10 V, 4 ms).\nIncubate iPSC-CMs in the chamber with stimulation for at least 3−5 min for the cells to wash the Fura-2 dye and adapt to the environment and to wash out the fluorescent dye.\nAdjust the viewing window to the left upper area of the glass coverslip.\nBegin recording.\nAfter collecting a consistent stream of 5−10 peaks, click Pause to temporarily stop recording.\nEnsuring that neither the focus nor dimensions of the viewing window are altered, move the microscope's stage to the adjacent area, moving toward the opposite end, and resume recording.",
    "Repeat steps 11.9 and 11.10 to scan across the coverslip, initially moving to the left, then downwards in a zig-zag fashion to cover the whole coverslip area. This consists of 80−100 measurements per coverslip.\n\tNOTE: Restrict the total measurement time to 10 min as secondary factors cause a decrease in Ca2+ transient.\nOnce the Ca2+ transients are acquired, analyze the data with the fluorescence traces analysis software according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nSubscription Required.
