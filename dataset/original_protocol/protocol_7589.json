    "Cryopreservation of biopsies Two colonic biopsies are collected during colonoscopy into Eppendorf tubes containing 1 mL of biopsy collection medium and delivered to the lab immediately for cryopreservation.Washing of the tissue fragments (do not use vacuum aspirator):Note: This is particularly important to prevent contamination if establishing primary culture from the specimen (e.g., patient-derived colonoids). Remove the biopsy collection medium.Repeat the following three times: add 1 mL of DPBS, pipette up and down 5–10 times, aspirate the DPBS with a P1000 pipette.Using a P1000 tip, gently transfer both fragments of tissue into a labeled cryovial containing 1 mL of CryoStor (try to carry over as little PBS as possible) and let the tissue settle to the bottom of the cryovial.Place the cryovials into the cryopreservation jar.Place the cryopreservation jar in a -80 °C freezer.After an overnight incubation at -80 °C, samples should be moved to liquid nitrogen storage.Thaw the cryopreserved tissue Thaw the biopsy in a water bath and transfer it to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.Note: If using a bead bath, place a beaker with pre-heated water into the beads and place the cryovial in the water. Wash three times with 1 mL of thaw medium.Here and below, follow this procedure for one wash cycle: add 1 mL of appropriate wash solution (thaw medium here) and pipette up and down 10 times to wash the tissue without letting the fragment enter the pipette tip. Remove the spent wash solution.Isolation of crypts and lamina propria Wash twice with 1 mL of chelation buffer (Figure 5B) and discard the spent buffer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230904/20230904235403_0021.jpgFigure 5.

Demonstration of crypt scraping After this, add 80 μL of 0.5 M EDTA to the remaining ~20 mL of chelation buffer.Add 1 mL of chelation buffer + EDTA (final concentration 2 mM) to the tissue in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and rotate cold (in a tube revolver placed in a cold room, set to 10 rpm) for 15 min. During this time, label and chill on ice:35 mm round TC dish for scraping;15 mL conical for crypt collection;1.5 mL Eppendorf tube for stroma collection.Vortex the tissue on maximum speed setting for five cycles: vortex for 30 s followed by 30 s rest on ice.Note: For some samples, crypts begin separating during vortexing. Transfer the spent chelation buffer (may contain crypts) into the prepared 15 mL crypt collection tube.Use 1 mL of fresh chelation buffer to gently transfer the tissue into a prepared 35 mm dish (Figure 5C).Under a stereomicroscope, position the biopsy fragment with the luminal side (epithelium) facing up and scrape off the crypts (Figure 5A and 5D; Video 1).Note: If it is hard to see which side is up, the easiest way is to begin scraping. If no crypts separate, that indicates the lumen is facing down; flip the fragment over and try again. Transfer the crypt suspension from the 35 mm dish into the 15 mL crypt collection tube.Move the remaining tissue into the original Eppendorf tube and mark it with stroma (S).",
    "Use 1 mL of thaw medium to rinse the remaining crypts off the stroma fragments and transfer the suspension to the 15 mL crypt collection tube (leave as little liquid with the stroma as possible).Submerge the stroma in 1 mL of DPBS and place it on ice (Figure 5E).Use 2 mL of thaw medium to rinse the remaining crypts of the 30 mm dish and transfer the suspension to the 15 mL crypt collection tube.Spin the crypt collection tube at 700× g for 1 min.Note: Here and below, it is beneficial, but not critical, to keep the centrifuges chilled to 4 °C. Transfer the pellet to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and wash with extra HBSS (~500 μL).Reconstitute the crypt in 1 mL of cold IntestiCult (with 0.5 U/mL DNase).Optional: count the crypts (typical yield is 200–500 crypts per biopsy fragment).Place the crypt suspension to gently rotate in the cold room while processing the lamina propria.Digestion Lamina propria fractionPrepare the enzyme mix that will be used for three cycles of digestion.Cycle 1: Add 500 μL of enzyme mix to stroma fragments.Transfer the tube to ThermoMixer for 10 min (37 °C, 800 rpm).During this time, prime a 40 μm strainer, placed in a 50 mL conical, with 2 mL of FBS; this will be the collection tube.Force the supernatant through the strainer into the collection tube.Cycle 2: Add 500 μL of fresh enzyme mix to the remaining tissue fragments.Slowly pipette the tissue up and down 5–10 times through a P1000 tip to enhance breakdown.Transfer the tube to ThermoMixer for 10 min (37 °C, 800 rpm).Force the supernatant through the strainer into the same collection tube.Cycle 3: Add 500 μL of fresh enzyme mix to stroma fragments.",
    "Slowly pipette the tissue up and down 5–10 times through a P1000 tip to enhance breakdown.Transfer the tube to ThermoMixer for 10 min (37 °C, 800 rpm).Force the suspension through the strainer.Use a plunger from a 1 mL insulin syringe to force the remaining fragments through the strainer.Wash the strainer with 4 mL of thaw medium.Transfer the contents from the collection tube to a new 15 mL conical.Note: This step is optional, but the cell pellet is easier to see after the spin when in a 15 mL conical. Spin at 700× g for 3 min.Prime the FACS tube by forcing 50 μL of FBS through the strainer cap.Reconstitute the pellet in 0.5 mL of thaw Medium and strain into the primed FACS tube.Count the cells and viability using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion, either manually or in an automated device.Epithelial fractionSpin down the crypt suspension at 700× g for 1 min.Reconstitute the crypt pellet in 1.5 mL of TrypLE + 15 μL of DNase I.For efficient mixing, split into 3 × 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes each containing 500 μL of the crypt+enzyme suspension.Transfer the tube to ThermoMixer for 30 min (37 °C, 800 rpm).Prime the FACS tube by forcing 1 mL of FBS through the strainer cap. Critical:  large clumps could be formed at the end of digestion.Strain into the primed FACS tube and wash the strainer with 1 mL of thaw medium.Spin at 700× g for 3 min and reconstitute in 500 μL of HBSS-BSA supplemented with 5 μL of DNase I.Count the cells and viability using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion, either manually or in an automated device.For single-cell RNA sequencing, preparation of single-cell cDNA libraries and next-generation sequencing are carried out as outlined in the 10× Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ v3.",
