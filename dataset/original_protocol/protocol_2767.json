    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHarvesting of patient-derived cell lines for injection\nTiming: 1 h\n      This step describes the harvesting, counting, and resuspension of\n      patient-derived cultures prior to subcutaneous injection in the hind limb\n      of NSG mice. These steps are done outside the animal facility. It\n      generally takes 3–5 days since last passage until 081R or SiHa cultures\n      reach 80% confluence. Regarding patient-derived cell lines, it is advised\n      to take a low (<10) passage number to ensure highest possible\n      similarity to the patient tissue. Group sizes should be determined by\n      power calculations prior to starting the experiment.\n    \n      With SiHa cells, 1 × 106 cells were injected per mouse in a\n      volume of 50 μL. In this step we take 081R cells as an example, injecting\n      1 × 105 cells per mouse in a total volume of 50 μL.\n    \n        Calculate the volume and cells needed for the number of available mice,\n        taking the total number of mice × 50 μL + minimal 300 μL for loss in\n        syringe needle and spill.\n      \nNote: Example with 24 mice: 24 × 50 μL +\n      300 μL = 1500 μL total.\n    \n        Calculate the amount of Matrigel needed (50% of total volume). Example;\n        1500/2 = 750 μL.\n      \nAlternatives: Basement Membrane\n      Extract (BME) can be used instead of Matrigel.\n    \nThaw Matrigel on ice, allowing it to become liquid.\n        Harvest patient-derived cells.\n        \nRemove medium from cells.\n            Wash flask with 2 mL (T25) or 5 mL (T75) PBS.\n            \n                For cell lines that are hard to detach add 5 mM EDTA in PBS for\n                2 min at 37°C and remove.\n              \nAdd 1 mL (T25) or 3 mL (T75) 1× trypsin for 3–10 min at 37°C.\n            Carefully resuspend the cells with long reach filter tip.\n            \n                Check under microscope to make sure a single-cell suspension is\n                obtained.",
    "Critical: CSC medium contains no serum\n      to inactivate trypsin, and if using CSC medium, spin down cells at\n      300 × g for 3 min, remove all medium and resuspend in 1–3 mL CSC\n      medium.\n    \nCount the number of cells per mL, e.g., in a hemocytometer.\n        Take 1 × 105 cells in a total of 50 μL solution for\n        injection.\n        \n            Volume cell suspension = Total volume needed / (cells per mL /\n            1 × 105 cells).\n          \nExample with 24 mice: 24 × 50 μL + 300 μL = 1,500 μL total.\nVolume of cell suspension = 1,500 μL / 2 (50% Matrigel) = 750 μL.\n      750 / (1.16 × 106 counted cells / 1 × 105) = 64.7 μL\n      of cell suspension in 685.4 μL medium.\n    \n        Resuspend 50% of cell suspension with 50% Matrigel on ice in a 5 mL\n        round-bottom polystyrene tube.\n        \n            After counting, make sure to freeze down a subset of cells. Document\n            vials including passage number, so future mice experiments can be\n            done with similar passage cell lines.\n          \nTransport cell-Matrigel suspension on ice to the animal facility.\nCritical: Keep cells in Matrigel on\n      ice to avoid solidification. To avoid cell aggregation and clumps,\n      resuspend or flick the cell suspension tube right before mixing with\n      Matrigel. Resuspension of the cells in Matrigel solution is essential as\n      cells resuspended only in medium may fail to graft.\n    \nHind limb subcutaneous injection in mice\nTiming: 2 min per mouse\n    \n      This step describes the subcutaneous injection of patient-derived cells\n      into the hind limb of mice. This procedure can be performed on one to six\n      mice in a row, depending on personal skills, assistance and equipment\n      available.\n    \nWork inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC).\n        Randomize mice between different treatment groups.\n        \n            Distribute mice of one litter across different treatment groups and",
    "ensure a similar number of males and females per treatment group.\n          \nNote: Group allocations may be corrected\n      for randomization at the start of treatment (step 28).\n    \nAnesthetize mice with 2% Isoflurane in 100% oxygen for 5 min.\n        Mark animals for identification e.g., using earmarks or color marking\n        using a permanent marker.\n      \n        Carefully remove the hair on the right hind limb of all the mice by\n        shaving (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n      \nAlternatives: Depilatory cream can\n      be used.\n    \nDisinfect the skin with Virkon.\nResuspend pre-made cell suspension from previous steps 1–8.\n        Immediately fill the 1 mL syringe to ensure a homogeneous suspension and\n        attach 25G needle.\n      \n        Inject 50 μL cell suspension into the subcutis in the right hind limb.\n        \n            Inject below the kneecap, just under the skin to ensure subcutaneous\n            and avoid intramuscular or intracutaneous tumor growth.\n          \n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \n          Methods video S1. Subcutaneous injection of mice, related to step 13\n        \nMeasuring size of tumors\nTiming: 3 min per mouse\n    \n      This step describes measuring and calculating the volume of a tumor on the\n      hind limb of immunodeficient mice. Prior to measuring the tumor sizes,\n      body weights should be measured on a scale.\n    \nWork inside a BSC.\nDisinfect the digital caliper.\nNote: Check if caliper is zeroed\n      correctly: 0.00 should be indicated when the jaws are closed.\n    \n        Fixate a mouse in your left hand in such a way that the mouse right hind\n        limb is freely accessible.\n      \n        Measure the length, width, and depth of the right (grafted) hind limb\n        (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\n      \n        When measuring for the first time, also measure the left non-tumor\n        injected hind limb of each mouse.\n      \nNote: As the tumor volume on the hind limb\n      may be hard to assess, the other hind limb is used as internal control per",
    "mouse. In our experiments, most tumors grow subcutaneously as a distinct\n      nodule, though some tumors may grow flat and into the underlying muscle\n      making them difficult to measure. In most cases, the subtraction method to\n      determine tumor graft is required, so we advise to apply this method for\n      all mice.\n    \n        Calculate the average limb length for all female and the same for\n        all male mice.\n      \nNote: As the length of the limb does not\n      alter during tumor growth, this is a fixed number from this point.\n    \n        Calculate the volume of the tumor by measuring the tumor injected hind\n        limb using the formula: (length × width × depth)/2).\n        Example: (18 (average length) × 8.77 × 8.33)/2 = 657 mm3.\nAlternatives: Multiple measuring\n      approaches can be used to measure tumor size. Another option is the\n      formula π/6∗(length × width × depth).\n    \n        Subtract the volume of the non-tumor injected control limb. In our case\n        this was on average 107 mm3; 657–107 = 550 mm3.\n      \nRepeat measurements for all mice.\nDocument tumor measurements of each mouse over time.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \n          Methods video S2. Measuring subcutaneous tumors in hind limb, related\n          to step 21\n        \nLocalized irradiation of tumors on hind limb\nTiming: 20 min per radiation fraction\n    \n      This step describes a radiation setup to locally radiate on the\n      tumor-injected hind limb, while shielding the rest of the mouse. This\n      provides a method to safely treat a broad range of tumor xenografts in\n      immunodeficient mice that are unable to tolerate (scattering of) whole\n      body radiation. Mice radiation-shielding setup drawings for replication\n      are shown in\n      Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2461-Mmc1.pdf]\n      and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D technical files are available on Mendeley Data:\n      https://doi.org/10.17632/vfjjtwstw9.1[href=https://doi.org/10.17632/vfjjtwstw9.1].\n    \n        Begin treatment of mice when tumors reach approximately\n        50–100 mm2.\n      \nNote: With 081R or SiHa cells, this was",
    "the case after two to three weeks after injection. It is advised to start\n      treatment on a Monday, so 5 times daily radiation can be applied.\n    \n        Assess whether randomization should be adjusted based on the size of the\n        tumors, to ensure a similar mean tumor volume in each group at the start\n        of treatment.\n      \nSelect the mice to receive irradiation.\nNote: In the described setup there is room\n      for 4 mice at one time.\n    \n        Prepare 3 surgical tape sections of approximately 2–3 cm in length per\n        mouse.\n      \n        Work inside a BSC. Anesthetize mice with 2% Isoflurane in 100% oxygen\n        for 5 min.\n      \n        Assemble the main part of the transparent mouse restrainer; (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, 1).
