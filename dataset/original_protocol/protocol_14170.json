    "This prospective experimental trial with 21 anesthetized male and female domestic pigs (German landrace) at the age of 3–6 months with a body weight between 45-55 kg was approved by the Governmental Commission on the Care and Use of Animals of the City of Hamburg (Reference-No. 18/17). According to the ARRIVE guidelines, all experiments were carried out and all animals received care in compliance with the 'Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals' (NIH publication No. 86-23, revised 1996)11.\n1. Flow Probe Two-point Calibration\nPut flow probes in deionized water and connect the probe to the transonic flow probe system by putting the plug into the perivascular flow module.\nOpen the data analysis software (e.g., LabChart 8).\nFor a two-point calibration, start a measurement by setting the flow probe system to Zero and after a few seconds to Scale.\nIn the data analysis software window, go to Units Conversion and choose two-point calibration. Mark a baseline to set to zero. Then, mark an area with 10 L/min and set to 1 V as a preset value.\nRepeat the procedure for the other probe.\n2. Millar Catheter Calibration\nPrior to the zeroing and calibration, pre-soak the tip of the catheter in sterile body temperature warm water for 30 min.\nConnect the Millar catheter to the bridge amplifier by putting the plug into the bridge amplifier module.\nStart the data analysis software.\nPut the tip of the catheter into the pneumatic zeroing tool, set the value to 0 mmHg and start a measurement by clicking Start in the program.\nKeep the measurement running and set the pneumatic zeroing tool to 100 mmHg. Stop the measurement by clicking Stop.",
    "Run the data analysis software by pressing Start and then press Stop. Click Amplify in the window of bridge and choose Units. Set the baseline of 0 and 100 mmHg, accordingly. According to the preset value for calibration that the software provides, the catheter is now calibrated for all body pressures.\nRepeat the procedure for the other Millar catheter.\n3. Preparation of the Pig\nMedicate the pig by injecting 20 mg/kg of Ketanest, 4 mg/kg of Azaperon and 0.1 mg/kg Midazolam intramuscularly and place a 20 G IV-line into a vein of the ear.\nPlace ECG stickers on the chest and oxygen probe on the tail.\nAdminister pure oxygen (15–18 L/min) via the pig's nose using a mask and surgically prepare down to the trachea.\nPut a loop around the trachea, use a scalpel (11 blade) to make an incision into the trachea and place an 8.5 Mallinckrodt tube into it for a safe airway. Fix the tube with the preset loop and close the skin with sutures.\nBegin anesthesia with Sevoflurane using a MAC of 0.9 (in adolescent pigs equivalent to an endexpiratory concentration of 2.0%)  and infusion of 0.01 mg/(kg∙h) Fentanyl. Start mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg, a rate of 14/min, and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 mmHg. Set the inspiratory oxygen rate (fiO2) to 0.3. After 10 min depth of anesthesia is deep enough to perform surgery safely. No elevation of HR and BP should be detected.\nMaintain fluid balance at basal volume rate of 10 mL/(kg∙h) cristalloid using an infusion pump.\nGently clean the pig's skin using soap water. Use a skin disinfection solution containing povidone-iodine to decrease skin contamination.\n4. Vital Parameter Measurements",
    "Use an ultrasound for inserting a 5 F thermistor tipped arterial catheter into the right femoral artery, an 8 F introducer sheath into the left femoral artery, a central venous catheter and an 8 F introducer sheath into the jugular vein (Figure 1).\nPlace the catheter placement using Seldinger's technique12.\n\t\nPlace a needle into the target vessel under ultrasound vision.\nPut a wire through the needle into the vessel, verify the correct placement of the wire using ultrasound and keep the wire in the vessel throughout the whole procedure. Remove the needle and place a dilator onto the wire.\nWith gentle pressure, put the dilator through the skin into the vessel using the wire as guidance. Remove the dilator, put the catheter onto the wire, make sure to the end of the wire is seen at the end of the catheter and place the catheter it into the vessel.\nRemove the wire by gently pulling it out of the catheter.\nInsert a 7F pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) into the 8F introducer sheath and place it in the RV. If needed for taking mixed venous blood gas samples, insert the PAC further into the PA until a pulmonary artery curve is shown on to the monitor and pull it back after receiving the samples.\nInsert the first Millar-tip catheter into the 8F introducer sheath in the left femoral artery and placing it in the aorta.\nPerform a mini-laparotomy (approximately 5–10 cm is enough) above the symphysis by using the electrocautery for prepping down to the linea alba.\n\t\nOpen the linea alba with scissors and pull out the bladder very gently.\nPut a purse string suture in the bladder using a 3/0 suture and make an incision into the bladder with a scalpel (11 blade).",
    "Insert a urinary catheter into the bladder, inflate the catheter's balloon with water and fix it using the purse-string suture. Close the abdomen with a 3/0 suture.\n5. Surgical Preparation of the Heart\nBefore opening the chest increasing the fiO2 to 1.0 and administer 0.1 mg kg(-1) pancuronium initial bolus intravenously13.\nPerform a median sternotomy.\n\t\nUse the electrocautery for prepping down to the sternum. Gently dissect the sternum from the surrounding tissue before dividing the bone with an oscillating saw.\nUse the electrocautery to reduce bleeding and seal the sternum with bone wax. Place a sternal rib spreader between the two halves of the opened sternum and widely open the chest as much as needed for surgery by twisting the handle on the device.\nOpen the pericardium gently using scissors and forceps and fix it to the skin with a 2/0 suture.\nDissect down the pulmonary and the artery ascending aorta very gently to avoid bleeding. Carefully place the ultrasound flow probes around both arteries, respectively (Figure 2).\nPlace 2 purse string sutures in the pulmonary artery using a 5/0 suture. Use a scalpel (11 blade) to make a small stitch incision (approximately 1 mm) in the middle of the purse strings and place the Millar catheter into the pulmonary artery before fixing it (Figure 3).\nCarefully clamp the LAA and place 2 purse string sutures in it using a 4/0 suture. Make a small incision and place a central venous line into the left atrium before fixing it using the purse string sutures (Figure 3).\nClose the pericardium by suturing a sterile glove onto it, to maintain hemodynamics reliable (Figure 4). Perform the sternal closure with wires and close the skin with a 3/0 suture.\n6. Assessment and Data Acquisition",
    "Start each measurement with 2 min of AO and PA flow measurements, as well as AO and PA pressure measurements using the data analysis software by clicking Start and Stop button in the program.\nPerform transcardiopulmonary thermodilution to provide cardiac output (CO) as well as pulse pressure variance (PPV) and stroke volume variance (SVV) by using the PiCCO2 system. To start the measurement, click the TD | Start.\nConsecutive inject 15 mL of 10 °C cold saline into a thermistor at the central venous line in the jugular vein three times for thermodilution at each measurement step.\nTake an arterial, central venous and mixed venous blood gas sample after each transcardiopulmonary thermodilution measurement step.\n7. Volume Optimizing\nAfter a baseline measurement M0 (steps 6.1–6.4) of all parameters, administer a volume loading step using 5 mL/kg of colloidal infusion (Voluven) using an infusion pump that is connected to the central venous line.\nAfter 5 min of equilibration, start another measurement step M1 (steps 6.1–6.4). If the newly generated cardiac output measured by thermodilution using the PICCO2 system (see step 6.2–6.3) does not increase compared to the formerly measured CO by at least 10%, start another volume loading step (step 7.1).\nContinue with volume loading and equilibration steps until there is no more increase in CO of more than 10%. Now, a balanced fluid status is reached.\n8. Induction of ARDS with Right Ventricular Dysfunction\nIncrease the fiO2 to at least 0.5 to 0.8 as required to maintain a spO2 of at least 90%.\nInduce an ARDS with consecutive right ventricular dysfunction by infusion of oleic acid (OA) (0.03–0.06 mL/kg for about 2 h).",
    "Use continuous administration of adrenalin using a perfusor (3 mg of adrenalin in 50 mL of saline) to keep hemodynamics stable. Increase the infusion rate as required to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg.\nAdd calcium, magnesium and antiarrhythmics (1% Lidocain) as required during the infusion of OA to maintain a stable sinus rhythm.\n9. Volume Optimizing\nAfter induction of mild to moderate ARDS, perform another measurement of all parameters (M2) by completing steps 6.1–6.4.\n\tNOTE: Now, the baseline model for hemodynamic measurements in ARDS in a pig model is set. For further investigation on volume responsiveness in ARDS and right ventricular dysfunction start to reduce volume load by taking as much blood as need per protocol or increasing volume load by adding a defined amount of infusion.\n10. Finalization\nAfter finishing the measurements euthanize the pigs while under anesthesia by injecting 1mmol/kg potassium chloride intravenously.\nSubscription Required.
