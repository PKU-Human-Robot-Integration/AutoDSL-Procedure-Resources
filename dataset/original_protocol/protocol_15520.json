    "NOTE: The transmission electron microscopy sample preparation method used in this article has been reported previously16. It is important to note that the selection of reagents and the adjustment of dosage are necessary depending on the sample. There are many toxic chemical reagents used in the sample preparation process, therefore, the operator needs to take certain protective measures, such as wearing protective clothing and gloves and operating in a fume hood.\n1. Dissection, fixation and placement procedure\nDissection\n\t\nDissect the wandering late-3rd-instar larvae in Jan solution and obtain the entire body wall based on the standard procedures17. Prepare Jan's solution as following: 128 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 35mM sucrose, 5mM HEPES, pH 7.4\n\t\tNOTE: The body wall of Drosophila larvae refers to the outer covering or integument of the larval stage of the fruit fly Drosophila. This includes the cuticle, epidermal cells, and underlying tissues that form the larval exoskeleton. The body wall provides structural support and protection and serves as a barrier between the larval body and the external environment17.\nFixation\n\t\nFix the larval body wall in the dissection chamber at 4 °C overnight with the fixative. To prepare the fixative, mix 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4)\nRinse the samples several times with sodium cacodylate buffer.\nPrepare 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer. Fix the samples in 1% OsO4 for 2 h, followed by several rinses in distilled water.\n\t\tNOTE: Dual fixation with aldehydes and OsO4 provides better protection of cellular ultrastructure. Besides, OsO4 can stain the sample tissue, allowing for the contrast between the light and the sample to be more apparent18.\nStain the Drosophila neuromuscular junction samples with 2% saturated uranyl acetate for 2 h, followed by several rinses with deionized water (Figure 1A).\nSample placement",
    "Cut two round pieces of metal mesh of similar size (pore size 270 µm) with scissors.\nPlace a metal mesh (270 µm) at the base of a flat-bottomed bottle in advance.\nPlace the fixed larva samples on the mesh and then place another mesh on them so that the samples are placed between the two meshes.\n2. Dehydration\nNOTE In this paper, the ethanol gradient dehydration method was used.\nDehydrate the samples in an increasing concentration gradient of ethanol sequentially (50%, 70%, 85%, 95% once each, 100% twice), each for 20 min at 4 °C.\nRinse the samples twice with propylene oxide at room temperature for 5 min each time (Figure 1C).\n3. Infiltration\nNOTE: Infiltration is one of the necessary steps for the TEM sample preparation. Infiltration allows for the gradual replacement of dehydrating medium with the embedding medium in the sample to allow filling of the cell interstice with the embedding medium19.\nPlace the samples in the mixed solution of propylene oxide and epoxy resin at a ratio of 1:1 and 1:2 for 1 h each, followed by pure epoxy resin for 2 h at room temperature.\n4. Embedding\nPrepare a polyethylene film and cut it into a big square (approximately 5 × 5 cm) and a small hollow rectangular support (approximately 2 × 2 cm). Glue the small square with the big square.\nPre-position sufficient epoxy resin at the center of the big square.\nPlace the samples in the pre-positioned epoxy resin with the muscle side facing upwards. Use a stereoscope.\nAdd several drops of resin to the samples and then cover them with PE film (a little larger than the spacer) (Figure 1D-E).\nPolymerize the samples at 37 °C, 42 °C and 60 °C for 24 h respectively (Figure 1F).\n5. Sectioning procedure",
    "Remove the excess parts of the larval body wall with a sharp blade and retain a trapezoid, including the A2/A3 segment.\n\tNOTE: The top line should be near the 13th muscle, and the baseline should be away from the sample to the epoxy resin. The height between the topline and baseline is approximately 5-8 mm.\nRemove the trapezoid from the remainder of the sample and adhere it to the resin-filled capsule with the A/B glue.\nConfirm the position of the 6th and 7th muscles of A2 and A3 segments under the light microscopy (Figure 1G) and maintain the tangent plane parallel to the 6th muscle.\nCut away one-fifth of the sample along the two sides of the A3 segment.\n\tNOTE: Remove most of the 6th muscle, and retain 1/3 of the width of the 7th muscle.\nUsing an ultrathin microtome, prepare an ultrathin section of the sample starting with the 6th muscle.\n\tNOTE: Each slice is approximately 90 nm thick.\nAttached as many slices as possible to each copper mesh.\nPerform transmission electron microscopy as described previously16.\nSubscription Required.
