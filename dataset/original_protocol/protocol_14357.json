    "All methods described in this section have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Liege and all healthy subjects gave written informed consent for participation.\n1.Sputum Induction\nPre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry\nPerform a spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC] maneuver) according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) standard criteria12.\nAdminister 400 µg of inhaled salbutamol from a metered dose inhaler (MDI) through a spacer device.\n\t\tNOTE: In adults, adverse events of inhaled salbutamol include tremor and tachycardia13.\nRepeat spirometry (FEV1 and FVC maneuver) 15 min later, according to the ATS/ERS standard criteria12.\nPreparation of the ultrasonic nebulizer\n\tNOTE: The nebulizer must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before each use, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nFill the nebulizer chamber with distilled water up to the recommended level.\nPlace a clean cup in the nebulizer chamber.\nCover the cup with the appropriate lid.\nFill the cup with either 50 mL of hypertonic saline (5%) for a patient with post-bronchodilator FEV1 >65% predicted or 50 mL of isotonic saline (0.9%) for a patient with post-bronchodilator FEV1≤65% predicted.\nAdd 1.75 mL of salbutamol sulfate solution (5 mg/mL) to the cup.\nConnect the tubes and valves in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\nNebulization and sputum collection\n\tNOTE: Perform the technique under medical supervision.\n\t\nExplain the procedure to the patient.\nAsk the patient to use a nose clip.\nTurn the nebulizer on and select the lowest level of aerosol and fan settings.\nAsk the patient to inhale the aerosol through the mouth piece with tidal breathing for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Aerosol and fan settings may be increased depending on the patient's tolerance.\n\t\t\nIn case of unbearable cough or nausea, discontinue the procedure and go to step 1.3.5.",
    "In the event of chest tightness or respiratory discomfort, go to step 1.3.8.\nTurn the nebulizer off.\nAsk the patient to remove the nose clip, rinse his mouth with water, and gargle twice before discarding it in the sink.\n\t\tNOTE: Saliva cells may contaminate the sputum sample and lead to an unusable sample.\nAsk the patient to cough up sputum into a plastic container.\nPerform a spirometry (forced expiratory maneuver) to measure FEV1.\nEvaluate the FEV1 fall as follows: (FEV1 measured at step 3.8 [mL]) - (post-bronchodilator FEV1 measured at step 1.3 [mL]) / (post-bronchodilator FEV1 measured at step 1.3 [mL])*100.\n\t\t\nIf the FEV1 falls by 20% or more from the post-bronchodilator value, discontinue the procedure. Measure FEV1 again 10 min later. If the FEV1 falls 20% or more, ask the physician to administer nebulized ipratropium bromide (0.25 mg/2 mL) and keep the patient under medical observation. Go to step 1.3.10.\nIf the FEV1 does not fall by 20% or more from the post-bronchodilator value, repeat steps 3.2 to 3.9 one to three times to reach a total nebulization time of 10 to 20 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The total nebulization time will depend on quality (presence of plugs or viscous parts) and quantity of the sputum sample. If the sample quality and/or quantity is poor after 10 min of nebulization, the procedure should be extended to reach a total nebulization time of 15 to 20 min.\nKeep the sputum sample refrigerated until processing.\n2. Sputum Processing\nNOTE: Process the sputum within 3 hours of sampling for optimum cell viability.\nCaution: Wear a lab coat, protective gloves, and goggles.\nPreliminary Preparations\nMake a 10-fold dilution of the concentrated dithiothreitol solution (mucolytic agent) with sterile distilled water to obtain 10 mL of a 6.5 mM solution, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "NOTE: In order to prevent concentrated dithiothreitol solution mixing with ambient air, withdraw the solution from the vial with a sterile syringe and needle. Once opened, the concentrated solution vial must be kept at room temperature and used within 5 days. The diluted solution is prepared daily.\n\t\tCAUTION: Because of eye and skin irritation hazard, wear protective equipment (clothing, gloves, and goggles).\nMake a 5-fold dilution of the trypan blue solution (0.4%) with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) to obtain a 0.08% solution. Keep this diluted solution at room temperature and use within 2 weeks.\n\t\tCAUTION: Because of carcinogenic hazards, wear protective equipment (clothing, gloves and goggles).\nCollection of Sputum Supernatant\nTransfer the whole sputum in a 50 mL conical bottom plastic tube and weigh the sample.\nAdd a 3-fold weight of DPBS solution.\nSlowly vortex the sample for 30 s.\nCentrifuge at 800 x g and 4 °C for 10 min.\nFilter the sample through 2 single layers of sterile gauze and collect the supernatant in a 50 mL conical bottom plastic tube.\nAliquot the supernatant in 2 mL plastic tubes and store them at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Supernatant samples are useful to assay sputum fluid phase components.\nSputum Mucolysis\nIf necessary, add DPBS to the cell pellet to reach a total volume of cell suspension of 5 mL.\nDilute the cell suspension with 1 volume of 6.5 mM dithiothreitol. Use a bench rocker to rock the cell suspension for 20 min at room temperature.\n\t\t\nRepeat at least 3 times with DPBS.\nCentrifuge the diluted cell suspension at 550 x g and 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in around 1 mL of DPBS.",
    "Assessment of qualitative properties of the sputum sample (cell concentration, squamous cell contamination, and viability by Trypan Blue exclusion method) by hemocytometer count\nAssess and record the exact volume of the cell suspension.\nAdd 50 µL of cell suspension to 50 µL of the 0.08% trypan blue solution and homogenize.\nPut the sample under the coverslip of a hemocytometer (Thoma chamber) and place it under the optical microscope (400X).\nCount the squamous cells, the living non-squamous cells (uncolored cells), and the dead non-squamous cells (blue colored cells).\n\t\tNOTE: In case of too low or too high cell density, concentrate or dilute the cell suspension and repeat steps 2.4.1-2.4.3.\nAssess the cell concentration of the suspension, the percentage of squamous cells, and the percentage of viability of non-squamous cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Calculate the total non-squamous cell count/g of sputum: cell concentration of the suspension (step 5.4) * volume of the cell suspension (step 4.8) *% of non-squamous cells / weight of the sputum sample (step 2.2.1).\nPreparation of a stained cytospin slide with the cell suspension and storage of residual cells, if needed\n\tNOTE: If the cell suspension contains more than 80% squamous cells, the sample is considered poor quality and unsuitable for a cytospin slide14. In that case, discontinue the processing and consider this sample unsuccessful.\n\t\nDilute an aliquot of the cell suspension with DPBS to obtain at least 350 µL of a cell suspension at 500,000 cells/mL.\nAssemble the cell concentrator in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\nFill each of the 3 compartments of the cell concentrator with 100 µL of this cell suspension.\nIn a cytocentrifuge, spin for 2 min at 150 x g and room temperature. Discard the supernatants.\nDisassemble the cell concentrator in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\nAllow the slide to air dry.",
    "NOTE: At this stage, residual cells can be stored in an adequate buffer if needed for further experiments.\nStain the slide with a commercial staining kit (see the Table of Materials), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\nMount the slide with a suitable mounting medium and a cover slip.\nPlace the slide under the optical microscope (600X) with oil immersion.\nCount at least 500 non-squamous cells: neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Differential cell count is usually performed by only one or two dedicated and trained observers to limit interobserver discrepancies.\nRecord absolute values and percentages of each cell type."
