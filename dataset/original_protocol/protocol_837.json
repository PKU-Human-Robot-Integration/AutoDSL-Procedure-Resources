    "**A. Analysis of Ig-V\\(D)J-transcriptomes** \nThree different techniques are applicable to generate Ig-H and Ig-L transcriptome databases \\(**Fig. 2**). **Table 1** lists their advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, state of the art NGS techniques may be employed. A protocol that describes analysis of Ig repertoires has recently been published<sup>17</sup>. This method uses \"unique molecular identifier\" \\(UMI) sequences which are introduced during generation of cDNA and therefore allow for precise quantification of individual mRNA molecules. This protocol is recommended because it reveals the entire Ig-H- and Ig-L-chain repertoires quantitatively, whereas Sanger-sequencing and single cell sequencing may reveal only a limited spectrum of the repertoires.\nSecondly, traditional transcriptome analysis has been outlined earlier<sup>10</sup>. A detailed methodology of this Sanger sequencing based method is available^19. These steps describe isolation of RNA, RT-PCR, cloning and sequence analysis of Ig-H and Ig-L chains.\nThirdly, techniques for analyzing Ig chains from single B cells were recently advanced from traditional sequencing methods<sup>2,3</sup> to NGS techniques<sup>18</sup>. Although both Sanger-sequencing and NGS based methods directly will yield paired Ig-H and Ig-L chains, it will be uncertain how they will relate to distinct OCBs or other expanded Ig species. Moreover, it will not be clear whether or not a certain Ig-H and Ig-L pair will yield an OCB at all. This is an important issue, since only limited number of OCBs \\(usually less than 20) are observed in a patient, whereas the number of different B and plasma cell clones in the CSF often exceeds thousands. Thus, only a small fraction of B or plasma cells will ultimately produce an OCB. Therefore, alignment of Ig-H and Ig-L chain databases to peptides identified by mass spectrometry is indispensable.\n**PAUSE POINT** PCR products and isolated plasmids can be kept for long-term storage at -80 ° C.\n**B. Purification of individual expanded IgG species**",
    "**B.1: IgG Purification by Protein G affinity chromatography** \nSteps 1 to 6 have been outlined earlier<sup>10</sup>. Detailed methodology is available<sup>19</sup>. For clarity, we include these steps in the protocol described here.\n1. Thaw CSF supernatant on ice.\n  2. Check for precipitates by centrifugation at 17,500 g for 5 min at 4 ° C. In case of any precipitates transfer supernatant in a new microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice until further processing.\n  3. Wash Dynabeads® Protein G three times in 1 ml washing buffer.\n  4. Add required amount of Dynabeads® Protein G to CSF supernatant. Use 2 μl bead suspension for 1 μg of IgG.\n  **CRITICAL STEP** Ensure that your Ig of interest binds to protein G as binding strength is subtype- and species-dependent.\n5. Incubate for 60 min on a shaker at room temperature.\n  **CRITICAL STEP** To ensure efficient mixing split CSF supernatant in 1 ml fractions and use 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes each.\n6. Wash Dynabeads® Protein G three times in 1 ml washing buffer.\n  7. Elute IgG by resuspending the beads in 10 μl 1% SDS followed by incubation for 2 min at 37 ° C.\n  8. Repeat step 16 with 15 μl of 1% SDS.\n  **CRITICAL STEP** This step is required to elute residual IgG molecules still bound to Protein G after first round of elution.\n9. Pool all eluates in a protein low bind 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Final volume for purified IgG from 1 ml body fluid supernatant is thus 25 μl.\n  \n**B.2a: Deglycosylation** \n10. Incubate purified IgG at 95 ° C for 1 min.\n  **CRITICAL STEP** By these means IgG molecules get unfolded so that glycosylation sites are better accessible for the enzyme.\n11. Add 1 volume of deglycosylation buffer and mix.\n  12. Add 100 U/ml N-Glycosidase F recombinant.",
    "13. Incubate for 3 h at 37 ° C.\n  \n**B.2b: Dialysis** \n14. Dialyze sample against 6 M Urea in rehydrated D-tube<sup>TM</sup> Dialyzer Mini tubes for 2 h on a stirrer at room temperature.\n  15. Dialyze further against 6 M Urea for 15 min at 50 V in a flat bed gel electrophoresis chamber according to the manufacturer’s recommendations to remove residual SDS.\n  **CRITICAL STEP** Longer dialysis and higher voltages will cause more pronounced disassembly of H- and L-chains.\n**B.3: Isoelectric focusing** \n**CAUTION** Make sure that all steps are carried out under strictly non-reducing conditions.\n16. Rehydrate Immobiline<sup>TM</sup> Dry Strip \\(24 cm, pH 3-10) in rehydration buffer overnight at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\n  **CAUTION** Must be carried out the day before performing isoelectric focusing.\n17. Add 50 μl of IEF sample buffer to dialyzed IgG.\n  18. For isoelectric focusing use an Agilent 3100 OFFGEL Fractionator in the “in-gel” mode according to the manufacturer’s recommendations but with two essential exceptions:\n  18.a Instead of rehydrating the IPG strips together with the eluate, place a loading cup at position pH 4.5 onto the rehydrated IPG strip and thus load the sample.\n**CRITICAL STEP** Applying the sample at other positions than 4.5 lead to pronounced disassembly of H- and L-chains \\(if loaded at extreme pH values) or to insufficient migration of IgG molecules into gel matrix \\(if applied at pH values near isoelectric points of IgG).\n**CAUTION** Capacity of loading cup is 200 μl.\n18.b Modify the default focusing method to a slower voltage-increase and extended duration: for the first 30 min the voltage is limited to 500 V and then for 30 min to 1000 V. During electrophoresis allow maximum values of 8000 V, 50 μA and 200 mW until 120 kVh are reached.",
    "**CRITICAL STEP** Using different focusing methods than described above might lead to disassembly of H- and L-chains or insufficient focusing. If focusing is performed with other IEF equipments it might therefore be necessary to optimize the default focusing method.\n**B.4: Non-reducing SDS-PAGE** \n**CAUTION** Make sure that all steps are carried out under absolutely non-reducing conditions.\n19. Shake IPG strip in equilibration buffer for 20 min at room temperature.\n  20. Set up second dimension of IgG separation according to standard methods and cool the chamber during electrophoresis overnight.\n  **CRITICAL STEP** Use 9% acrylamide gels. Higher percentage gels will prevent IgG molecules from efficiently migrating into the gel matrix. Lower percentage gels are difficult to handle.\n**CRITICAL STEP** When starting electrophoresis, first apply 10 mA for 1 h to facilitate protein transmigration from IPG strip into SDS-PAGE gel. Then increase current to 30 mA.\n21. Stain 2D gel with Coomassie-Blue for 2 h on a shaker at room temperature.\n  22. Destain with 10% Acetic acid.\n  \n**C: Analysis of matched Ig-H and Ig-L chains**\n**C.1: In-gel digestion by Trypsin** \n23. Excise individual spots containing H<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub> Heterodimers \\(apparent molecular weight = 200 kDa) and transfer into 0.6 ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n  **PAUSE POINT** Spots can be stored covered by H<sub>2</sub>O at 4 ° C until further processing.\n24. Proceed with Trypsin digestion as previously described<sup>10,19</sup>.\n  \n**C.2: MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry**\n25. Desalt samples after Trypsin digestion using ZipTip® Pipettes according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.\n  26. Mix sample and MALDI-matrix 1:1 and spot 1 μl onto a MALDI target.\n  27. Let dry at room temperature.\n  28. Measure samples using the Proteomics Analyzer 4700 \\(MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer with a 355 nm Nb-YAG-laser in positive reflector mode with 20 kV acceleration voltage. For MS/MS measurements perform CID.",
    "**C.3: Alignment of peptide identified by mass spectrometry to the Ig-V\\(D)J trancriptome database** \n29. Analyze MS and MS/MS spectra with “Data Explorer” Software and copy peaklist in program “Mascot Peptide Mass Fingerprint” or “Mascot MS/MS Ions Search”, respectively.\n  30. Search for matching peptides with the patient specific Ig-V\\(D)J-transcriptome \\(generated in step A) using the following parameters:\n  30.a for MS spectra: Enzyme: Trypsin; Allowed missed cleavages: 1; Fixed modifications: Carbamidomethyl \\(C); Variable modifications: Oxidation \\(M), \\(W); Peptide tolerance: +/- 100 ppm; Mass values: MH+; Monoisotopic;\n30.b for MS/MS spectra: Enzyme: Trypsin; Allowed missed cleavages: 1; Fixed modifications: Carbamidomethyl \\(C); Variable modifications: Oxidation \\(M), \\(W); Peptide tolerance: +/- 100 ppm; Peptide charge: 1+; MS/MS tol: +/- 0.8 Da; Monoisotopic; Precursor: mass of interest.\n**C.4: Semi-quantitative analysis of MALDI-TOF data** \n31. To distinguish between relevant peaks from expanded antibodies and irrelevant peaks from polyclonal antibody background only consider matching peptides whose peak intensities are above the following thresholds:\n  · mass below 1.5 kDa: peaks exceeding background for factor of 5\n· mass range 1.5 – 2.5 kDa: peaks exceeding background for factor of 7\n· mass range 2.5 kDa – 4.0 kDa: peaks exceeding background for factor of 5\n· mass above 4.0 kDa: peaks exceeding background for factor of 3\n32. In order to unequivocally determine matching H- and L-chains of one expanded antibody out of the pool of “dominant” peptides from step 31 the following criteria must be fulfilled:\n  32a. Three or more peptides belong to only one H- and only one L-chain in the patient-specific Ig-V\\(D)J transcriptome, respectively.\n32b. At least one of three peptides contains SHM or comprises the hypervariable CDR3 region, i.e. is characteristic.\n32c. Peak intensities of peptides from V\\(D)J-regions are about as high as the intensities of peptides from the constant Ig-regions.",
    "33. Obtain the full-length sequence of Ig-chains with the help of the Ig-V\\(D)J-transcriptome.\n  **CRITICAL STEP** For H/L-identification do not consider spots with significant contaminations of peptides from other Ig-chains or spots where many peptides are detected that can be aligned to different Ig-chains."
