    "1. Planarian husbandry\nUse planarians purchased from a biological supply company or wild-caught if needed. The planarians used in this protocol are Dugesia tigrina, as listed in the supply list. This species is also referred to as Girardia tigrina31. Other aquatic planarian species are also acceptable2,3.\n\tNOTE: The protocol described is geared to animals purchased from a biological supply company. This assay system has not been tested with wild-caught planarians. However, if wild-caught planarians are used, it is recommended that they be habituated to the water used in the experiments, as well as the laboratory environment for at least 1 week before use.\nUpon arrival, transfer planarians to plastic food storage containers containing clean spring water and keep the lids ajar.\nMaintain planarians in a darkened environment.\nFeed newly delivered planarians after 24–36 h in their new environment.\nAllow planarians to acclimate to the laboratory at least 1 week prior to experimentation.\nFeed planarians on a regular twice-a-week schedule.\n\t\nAllow planarians to feed ad libitum on chopped organic boiled eggs or blended organic beef liver for 1–2 h.\nPlace fed planarians into a clean container after feeding.\n\t\t\nRemove the soiled water off the planarians.\nUse a small flat watercolor paintbrush (number 3–6) to transfer food debris and slime adhering to the container from around planarians to a paper towel.\nWith fresh spring water and gentle swirling or agitation, dislodge planarians and pour them into a clean container.\nAny planarians remaining adhered to the container can be transferred using a round watercolor paintbrush (number 3–6) or transfer pipette with a wide bore.\nDecant the transfer water.\nCover the planarians with clean spring water.\nAfter 24 h, remove the planarians from any expelled food waste by transferring them to a clean container as described above (steps 1.6.2.1–1.6.2.6).",
    "To clean containers and utensils used for planarian husbandry, do not use soap or detergent. Clean these items by rinsing them well with clean water (tap water is acceptable) and drying them with a clean cloth or paper towel.\n2. Preparation of planarians for experiments\nAllow newly delivered planarians to acclimate to their environment at least 1 week prior to experimentation.\nStarve planarians for 5–10 days prior to experimentation.\nChange the culture water at least 1x during the starvation period.\n3. Planarian locomotor velocity (pLmV) test: Stimulant behaviors\nPrior to experimentation, ensure starved planarians are fully formed, with a complete and pigmented head and tail.\nPrepare a glass or plastic 10 cm Petri dish and a habituation container for the pLmV test prior to starting the experiment.\n\t\nPlace a clean 10 cm diameter Petri dish to be used for the pLmV test on prelaminated grid paper (with 0.5 cm squares).\nAdd 20 mL of unadulterated spring water for controls, or spring water containing the appropriate concentration of the natural product being tested, to the 10 cm diameter Petri dish to be used for the pLmV test.\nPosition a camera (e.g., cell phone or high-resolution camera) above the prepared 10 cm diameter Petri dish to record planarian motility over the grid paper during the experiment. A ring stand is a convenient way to position the camera at a distance that can record the entire view of the 10 cm Petri dish and grid lines.\nPrepare a habituation container with 5–10 mL of unadulterated spring water (controls), or spring water containing the appropriate concentration of the natural product being tested. A container similar to a scintillation vial or small 5 cm Petri dish is suitable.",
    "Use a small, clean, flat, or round watercolor paintbrush to gently transfer a planarian from the stock container with spring water to the habituation container having 5–10 mL of unadulterated spring water or spring water containing the natural product being tested.\n\tNOTE: When manipulating planarians for the pLmV assay, use a small, clean, flat, or round watercolor paintbrush (number 3–6). When moving planarians, the brush should be placed under the animal to lift it gently. To ensure planarians are not damaged when using the brush, the bristles of the brush should not be splayed out under the animal. Spreading out of the bristles could harm the planarian if it is caught between the fibers of the brush.\n\tNOTE: A wide bore transfer pipette can also be used for transferring the planarian into a clean and dry habituation container.\n\t\nIf using the pipette, remove excess water moved with the planarian from the habituation container using the transfer pipette.\nCarefully add the habituation solution (i.e., spring water for controls or spring water containing the concentration of natural product being tested) to the habituation container containing the planarian.\nHabituation periods will depend on the stimulation dynamics assessed for the natural product being tested. A habituation time of 2 min proved acceptable to detect stimulation in this work1.\nFollowing the 2 min habituation period use a watercolor paintbrush to gently transfer the planarian to the center of the prepared 10 cm Petri dish for the pLmV stimulation experiment.\nStart the camera to record the movement of the planarian. Record 10–11 min of video.\nPrepare the habituation container and the 10 cm Petri dish for the pLmV experiment with fresh solutions for each planarian.",
    "Use dedicated pipettes, dishes, containers, and paintbrushes for each experimental concentration of the natural product being tested to avoid inadvertently exposing planarians to the wrong solution during experimentation.\nBecause planarians exhibit learned behaviors, each planarian (control or test) should only be used once21,22.\n4. Planarian locomotor velocity (pLmV) test: Withdrawal behaviors\nPrior to experimentation, ensure starved planarians are fully formed, with a complete and pigmented head and tail.\nPrepare a 10 cm Petri dish (glass or plastic) for the pLmV experiment, a 5 cm Petri dish (glass or plastic) for rinsing the planarian following habituation, and a habituation container prior to starting the experiment.\n\t\nPlace a clean 10 cm diameter Petri dish to be used for the pLmV experiment on prelaminated grid paper with 0.5 cm squares).\nAdd 20 mL of unadulterated spring water to the 10 cm diameter Petri dish to be used for the pLmV experiment.\nPosition a camera above the prepared 10 cm diameter Petri dish as in step 3.2.3 to record planarian motility over the grid paper during the experiment.\nPrepare the planarian rinse container by adding 5 mL of spring water alone to the 5 cm Petri dish.\nPrepare a habituation container with 5–10 mL of unadulterated spring water (controls) or spring water containing the natural product being tested. A container similar to a scintillation vial or small 5 cm Petri dish (glass or plastic) is suitable.\nUse a small, clean, flat, or round watercolor paintbrush to transfer a planarian from spring water to the prepared habituation container having 5–10 mL of unadulterated spring water (controls) or spring water containing the natural product being tested. Gently move the animal from the stock container to the habituation container. Ensure the planarian is not damaged by the brush.",

Ensure the planarian is not damaged by the brush.\nImmediately transfer the planarian to the center of the prepared 10 cm Petri dish containing spring water for the pLmV withdrawal experiment. Ensure the planarian is not damaged by the brush.\nStart the camera to record the movement of the planarian. Record 10–11 min of video.\nPrepare the habituation container, the rinse container, and the 10 cm Petri dish for the pLmV experiment with fresh solutions for each planarian.",

Data analysis\nPrepare a data collection table to document the behavior and the motility of planarians as the number of grid lines crossed for each minute during the pLmV run. The table should allow for the accumulated number of lines per minute crossed by the planarian to be documented as well. Include lines for notes and a table of definitions to tally the observation of behaviors during the experimental period, such as ‘wander’ and ‘stop’ (see Discussion).\nUsing the video, count the number of full grid lines crossed by the planarian per minute for 10 min, and record that number on the data table. Typical planarian behavior consists of continuous velocity, forward-directed, horizontal movement, with periodic turns, and without stops.\n\t\nBegin to time the experiment at the point that the planarian has moved off the paintbrush used to transfer it to the 10 cm Petri dish. Record this start time.\nTo determine when the animal crosses a full grid square, focus on the head and score one line when the head fully crosses a square.\nTo score a full grid when the worm moves around the edge of the dish, visualize a distance of 0.5 cm by referring to the lines as they extend out from the margins of the dish. If the planarian crosses the corner of a box, refer to the second line crossed to score one grid line. Again, focus on the head to make these determinations.\nStop the video after each minute to record the data.",
    "When restarting the video to count the next minute, if the head of the worm was between grid lines when the video was stopped, record the first line crossed as a full box.\nScore the number of grid lines crossed for 10 min.\nIf the animal stops moving during a pLmV test and no longer crosses grid lines during the 10 min recording time, document the behavior of the planarian in the behavioral chart (e.g., ‘wander’ or ‘stop’). Animals that cease their forward track during the pLmV assay should instead be taken note of and the data presented as a frequency of the total number of animals exposed to that reagent concentration. Coiling or convulsive behavior (known as a C behavior) preventing any forward movement during the habituation period indicates that the concentration of the natural product is not appropriate for use in a pLmV assay because the pLmV assay is motility-based. C-type behaviors can be analyzed using a different type of analysis (see Discussion).\nIf possible, test multiple experimental concentrations of the natural product using at least 9–12 worms on different days and different times of the day if determining the overall effect of the reagent on planarian physiology. However, if researchers endeavor to reduce circadian rhythm-induced variability, experiments can be conducted with constant lighting at a set time of day using worms that are cultured with timed light/dark cycles and set feeding times. Have at least two experimenters involved in the project to allow for the option of having one individual record data, while the second individual counts the grid lines ‘blind’ to the conditions used for data collection. Having different individuals involved in data collection, as well as statistical calculations and analysis, also reduces possible bias.",
    "Calculate grid line counts for each natural product concentration on each day as relative to control counts for each minute so that data from different days, times, and experimenters can be combined. These data can be averaged and then analyzed using Student’s T-tests. P-values for each test can be assessed per minute compared to the control and between reagent concentrations. ANOVA assessments using data sets derived from different experimental concentrations provide a further method of analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
