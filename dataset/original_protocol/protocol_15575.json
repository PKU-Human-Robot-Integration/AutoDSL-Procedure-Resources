    "All experimental procedures followed the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.\n1. Sample collection and preparation\nPrepare 500 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n\t\nUnder an extraction flux in a cabinet, add 20 g of PFA powder to 250 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a 1 L glass beaker. Place the beaker with a magnet on a magnetic stirring plate.\nStir while heating. With a thermometer, constantly check the temperature of the solution to keep it under 60 °C.\nWith a plastic Pasteur pipette, add drops of 1 M NaOH to the solution to dissolve the PFA. Once the PFA powder has completely dissolved, cool the solution at room temperature (RT).\nAdjust the volume to 500 mL with 1x PBS. Adjust the pH to 7.2-7.3 by adding drops of 1 M HCl with a plastic Pasteur pipette.\nUsing a paper filter and a glass funnel, filter the solution in a 1 L glass bottle.\nClose the glass bottle, remove it from the flux cabinet, and store in a refrigerator at -4 °C.\nCollect brain samples.\n\t\nTo obtain samples, sacrifice mouse neonates the morning following their birth, at 0.5 days of age (P 0.5), using surgical scissors to decapitate them.\nPlace the scissors in the neck of the neonate while holding the body, and perform a single and clean cut.\nFixate the samples in PFA.\n\t\nFill a 50 mL conical tube with 40 mL of 4% PFA.\nImmerse each head in the tube containing PFA as a fixation agent. For this action, use a Paton spatula or a spoon.\nStore the conical tubes in the refrigerator at -4 °C for 48 h, then change to 40 mL of 1x PBS with 0.1% sodium azide as a preservative. Maintain refrigerated at -4 °C.\n2. Sample staining",
    "Prepare Lugol's solution (3.75% w/v).\n\t\nUnder an extraction flux in a cabinet, in a 1 L glass beaker, dissolve 10 g of Kl and 5 g of I2 in 400 mL of distilled water, with constant mixing using a magnetic stirrer.\nImmerse each head in a 50 mL conical tube containing 40 mL of Lugol's solution.\n\t\nFor neonates of an approximate body size of 1.3 g, leave the samples immersed for 15-20 h with constant mixing using an orbital shaker.\nPlace the samples in a 15 mL conical tube containing 10 mL of 1% agarose for 30 min before scanning.\n3. Micro-CT scanning\nNOTE: Micro-CT scanning requires specific equipment. There are different options for this kind of scanner, and details on acquisition depend on the characteristics of the used equipment. Dr. Hallgrímsson's lab counts on some alternatives of micro-CT scanners. Here, the protocol is based on the use of a basic desktop scanner, which is among the more accessible small animal imaging machines used by labs around the world. If the scanning objective is the skull, skip the steps in section 2 of the protocol and proceed to section 3. After scanning the skull, the staining process and the scanning of the brain could be performed to obtain images from the same specimens of both the brain and the skull.\nPlace the sample in the micro-CT holder.\n\t\nPlace the sample in a 50 mL conical tube. Fix the sample to avoid movements during the scanner session. For this purpose, some polyurethane material can be used to fill the empty parts of the tube.\nOpen the equipment and place the tube with the sample in the micro-CT holder.",
    "Log into the micro-CT control panel and register the sample to be scanned. This will automatically generate a sample number. In addition to the number, fill out the \"Name\" field. Both the sample name and number should be recorded elsewhere (e.g., in a spreadsheet) in case the raw data needs to be retrieved again.\nStart the scanning program. Enter the sample name or number and select a Control file, which should contain the scanning parameters.\nScan the sample.\n\t\nIn the screen of the micro-CT software, set the following parameters: isotropic voxel size of 0.012 mm, 45 kVp, 177 lA, 800,000 ms integration time, and 500 projections per 180°.\nSet the scanning region by selecting Scout View. Once the reference image appears, press Reference Line to set the region. Move the solid green line to the edge of the sample, then hold Shift while dragging the cursor to extend the scan region to the other edge of the sample.\nSelect OK to begin the scan.\nEvaluate and export the scan.\n\t\nOpen up the micro-CT scanner Evaluation Program and click on Select Sample and Measurement. In the Filter field, type the sample name, select the sample, and select the measurement file.\nThe file will load up as slices, the number of which depends on the initial scanning window. Click on the Load All button, which will load every slice and facilitate movement between slices later on.\nSelect Tasks > Evaluation 3D to initialize a cropping box around the slices. A 3D-Evaluation prompt will appear with a number of fields, including Task/Evaluation, VOI (Volume of Interest), Start X, Y, Z, and Dimension X, Y, Z.",
    "Set the Task > Evaluation 3D field to the appropriate script, as a variety of evaluation tasks can be performed, such as reconstruction, segmentation, morphometry (e.g., bone mineral density), and file conversions or transfers. The Default Evaluation script can be used as a guide.\nAfter selecting the script, adjust the VOI box on the main image. Start on the first slice. Ensure that the box contains the anatomy to be evaluated. Move the VOI by right-clicking on one of the small white squares toward the box edge and resizing the VOI using the middle mouse button. Alternatively, adjust the Dimension fields numerically.\nPass through the sample using the scroll bar underneath the image to ensure that all of the anatomies have been captured in the VOI box. Click on XY, XZ, or YZ near the top left of the software to change the orientation.\nSelect Start Evaluation. Depending on the Task Evaluation script, this will generate a 3D .aim image file with a corresponding .txt header file. Additionally, a path can be specified in the script to File Transfer Protocol (FTP) the image to a particular location.\n4. Image processing\nOpen the images in the image processing software.",
    "NOTE: Image processing can be carried out using various software. This protocol includes the basic steps in a commercial software, which is widely accepted in the area and has versatile tools for basic and advanced processing. In addition, there are different acceptable formats for reconstructed micro-CT images. This aspect usually depends on the equipment used for acquisition and its software. Here, image processing is carried out with .bmp images. The same procedure can be applied for .tiff images and other types. Since the acquisition is carried out in a scanner with .aim as the default format, a conversion from .aim to .bmp is first presented.\n\t\nTo open .aim files, select File > Open Data and choose the file. After that, a window with the title File Format Selection will open. Select Raw Data.\nA window with the title Raw Data Parameters will open. On this window, fill in the parameters following the information on the header .txt file that is generated for each .aim file. For Data Type, choose 16-bit for header complete with the number after Image data starts at byte offset. Also, set the dimensions and voxel size using the information on the header .txt file. Once the parameters are complete, press OK.\nIf conversion from .aim to .bmp is needed, in Main Panel > Project View, right-click on the .aim object and select the option Convert > Convert Image Type. On Properties, select 8-bit as the Output Type. Select Apply.\nRight-click on the new 8-bit object. Select Save as. Choose .bmp and save.\nTo open the .bmp file, select File > Open Data and choose the file. After that, a window with the parameters of the image opens. Confirm the parameters and accept if correct.",
    "In Main Panel > Project View, a new object is created with the name of the .bmp files. Right-click on this object and select the option Ortho Slice. In Properties, select the slice number and the orientation plane to see.\nObtain 3D volumes of the complete head.\n\t\nIn Main Panel > Project View, right-click on the image object. Select Interactive Thresholding option > Create. In Properties, change the values for Minimum RGB and Maximum RGB until the part of the image corresponding to the head of the animal is selected. Select Apply.\nIn Main Panel > Project View, a thresholded object is created. Right-click on this object and, in Properties, select Isosurface. In Properties, choose a threshold to visualize the surface and click Apply. This threshold needs to be chosen empirically, then different values might need to be examined.\nDigitizing point coordinates\n\t\n3D point coordinates can be digitized both based on slices or extracted surfaces. For the first option, right-click in the image option and select Slice. In Translate, choose the desired slice in the axial plane. If the plane is not correctly placed, click Options > Rotate in Properties to establish the right orientation.\nTo digitize landmarks, right-click in Main Panel > Project View and select Create Object > Points and Lines > Landmarks. Right-click the new Object Landmarks and select Landmark View. In Landmark View, modify the size of the point in Size. To add landmarks in Properties, use the option Add in Edit Mode.\n\t\tNOTE: For neonates, a set of landmarks and semilandmarks around the axial and sagittal curves of the brain was previously published14.\nFirst, choose the axial plane that crosses the most rostral point of the olfactory bulbs and the most caudal point of the cortex.",
    "Select the Object Landmarks and, in Properties, select Landmark Editor. Using the arrow, click on the place the point is to be digitized.\nIn the proposed set of landmarks, 24 points are digitized in the selected axial plane. Digitize the first in the most caudal point of the brain at the midline.\nDigitize five points equally distributed around the curve (semilandmarks) until the next landmark at the intersection between the midbrain and the cortex.\nThen, digitize eight points (semilandmarks) around the cortex.\nDigitize a new landmark at the intersection between the cortex and the olfactory bulbs. Then, digitize four points (semilandmarks) around the olfactory bulbs.\nDigitize a new landmark at the most rostral point of the olfactory bulbs at the midline. Then, digitize two points (semilandmarks) in between both olfactory bulbs.\nDigitize a new landmark at the most caudal point of the olfactory bulbs at the midline.\nFor sagittal points, establish a slice in the right side of the brain at a parasagittal plane where the brain is most caudally prominent.\nIn the proposed set of landmarks, 33 points are digitized in the selected parasagittal plane. Digitize the first in the intersection between the diencephalon and the hindbrain. Then, digitize nine points (semilandmarks) in the ventral limit of the brain.\nDigitize a new landmark at the most rostral point of the olfactory bulb. Then, digitize three points (semilandmarks) around the olfactory bulbs.\nDigitize a new landmark in the intersection between the olfactory bulb and the cortex. Then, digitize three points (semilandmarks) around the olfactory bulbs.\nDigitize a new landmark in the intersection between the olfactory bulb and the cortex. Then, digitize seven points (semilandmarks) around the cortex.\nDigitize a new landmark in the intersection between the cortex and the midbrain. Then, digitize seven points (semilandmarks) around the cortex.",
    "Digitize a new landmark in the intersection between the cortex and the midbrain. Then, digitize six points (semilandmarks) around the midbrain.\nDigitize a new landmark in the intersection between the midbrain and the cerebellum. Then, digitize two points (semilandmarks) around the cerebellum.\nDigitize a new landmark in the intersection between the cerebellum and the hindbrain.\nSave the digitized points. Right-click on the Object Landmarks and choose the option Save Data.\nAnalyze the point coordinates.\n\tNOTE: Once the point coordinates are digitized for a set of specimens, basic analyses can be performed using geometric morphometrics tools to obtain size (centroid size) and shape variables (shape or Procrustes coordinates). Analyses are carried out in a free open software environment, which is especially suitable for statistical analyses.\n\t\nUsing a notepad, build a file containing the coordinates of all the digitized specimens. For this purpose, follow the TPS format, as described in https://morphometrics.uk/MorphoJ_guide/frameset.htm?index.htm.\nOpen the statistical software. Select File > Change Dir to choose the directory where the .tps file is saved.\nSelect Packages > Install packages. Choose one Cran Mirror. Look for geomorph and install it.\nLoad packages by typing in the console: library(geomorph) and library(Morpho).\nLoad the dataset by typing in the console: dataset <- readland.tps(file=\"NAME_OF_FILE.tps\", specID=\"ID\").\nPerform generalized Procrustes analysis by typing in the console: GPA<- gpagen(dataset).\nObtain the centroid size by typing in the console: CS<-GPA$Csize.\nObtain Procrustes coordinates by typing in the console: ProcCoord<- GPA$coords.\nPlot the Procrustes coordinates and the mean shape by typing in the console: plotAllSpecimens(ProcCoord).\nSegmentation of ROIs\n\tNOTE: To segment the brain and obtain a 3D reconstruction, manually identify the brain tissues in each slice. The same procedure can be applied to specific ROIs, such as the olfactory bulbs, cortex, etc.",
    "Right-click on Main Panel > Project View and select Create Object > Label Field.\nSelecting the Label Field object, press the Segmentation Editor option in Properties.\nIn Materials, add a new material and, if desired, rename it as Brain.\nIn Selection, choose the option Current Slice to segment the tissue corresponding to the brain in each slice.\nUsing the options present in Tools, select the brain tissue in each slice. For this case, the Magic Wand and the Brush are the most suitable.\nOnce the selection is made in each slice, press Add in Selection.\nWhen selection in all slices is finished, return to Project View in Main Panel and right-click on Label Field to select Generate Surface, then click Apply.\nOnce the surface is obtained, export it by applying Extract Surface.\nTo obtain the volume of the segmented structures, in Main Panel > Project View, select the object that contains the label, right-click, and select Measure and Analyze > Volume Fraction.
