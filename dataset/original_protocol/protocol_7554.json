    "Transgene design Key to this method is the removal of a Bpi1 restriction site from the coding region of the gene that is to be expressed as a transgene. This is frequently required for Golden Gate cloning (Engler et al., 2008; Weber et al., 2011) and has been described in previous protocols (Engler and Marillonnet, 2014). For other cloning methods, any suitable restriction site(s) can be removed.RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, qPCR This step is only relevant if using the inducible system as in Bezodis et al. (2022). This protocol may be used for any system in which a transgenic copy of an endogenous gene is expressed.Our validation experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana (described below) utilised an inducible expression system active in inflorescences (Bezodis et al., 2022; Schubert et al., 2022). At least four biological replicates are recommended for achieving highly reproducible results.Select Arabidopsis plants with at least four inflorescence apices; mark two inflorescences for pre-induction and two for post-induction expression, with small pieces of tape of different colours.Collect the two pre-induction inflorescence apices, harvesting all buds that have not clearly been fertilised. Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until all samples are ready for RNA extraction.Apply induction as described (Schubert et al., 2022) to the other two marked inflorescences, harvested 18 h after induction.Extract RNA using the method appropriate for the system being used. For the work in which this method was developed, RNeasy Plant Mini kit with on-column DNA digest was used, following manufacturer’s recommended methods (Note 1).Synthesize cDNA from the resultant RNA. The qPCRBIO cDNA synthesis kit and SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase have been tested; the resultant cDNA, following manufacturer’s recommended protocol, proved suitable for use with this method.cDNA digestion:Determine approximate cDNA concentration by NanoDrop (Note 2).",

The amplification product should be in the region of 70–200 bp with an annealing temperature of > 60 °C.For the housekeeping gene, such as ubiquitin or tubulin, the region amplified should not contain a Bpi1 site (or other restriction enzymes being used), whilst for the gene of interest the region amplified must contain a region that contains a Bpi1 (or other restriction enzyme) site in the endogenous copy that has been removed as described in section A. Selection of housekeeping genes as controls for qPCR has been discussed previously (Czechowski et al., 2005) and depends on the aims of the specific experiment and tissue being used (Dekkers et al., 2012). Protocol validation by Bezodis et al. (2022) used AtUBQ10 (AT4G05320), which is more stable than some other commonly used reference genes (Czechowski et al., 2005).Once a suitable region for amplification has been chosen, optimal primers can be designed using primer3 (primer3.ut.ee) (Untergasser et al., 2012).qPCR reactionPerform qPCR in Microamp Fast Optical 96-well reaction plates with Adhesive PCR plate seals in either 10 or 20 μL reactions; for the latter, volumes below should be doubled (Table 3).Table 3.
