    "NOTE: Always maintain RNase-free conditions when formulating mRNA-LNPs by wiping the surfaces and equipment with a surface decontaminant for RNases and DNA. Use only RNase-free tips and reagents.\nAll the animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at the University of Pennsylvania and a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Pennsylvania.\n1. Pre-formulation preparation\nFill a clean 4 L beaker with 200-300 mL of fresh 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\nDilute the 10x PBS in the beaker 10-fold with ultrapure water to obtain a beaker of 1x PBS. Ensure that the final volume of the 1x PBS is between 2-3 L.\nPlace dialysis cassettes (20 kDa molecular weight cutoff [MWCO]) of the appropriate capacity for the LNP formulation into the filled beaker to hydrate them.\n\t\tNOTE: Dialysis cassettes require a minimum of 2 min to hydrate before use.\nPlace a stir bar into the beaker, and cover the beaker with aluminum foil.\nPlace the covered beaker onto a magnetic stir plate. Turn on the stir plate, and set it to spin at 300-400 rpm.\nDilute a 100 mM citric acid buffer stock (pH 3) 10-fold with ultrapure water to create the 10 mM citric acid buffer used for mRNA dilution.\nMake C12-200 ionizable lipid, helper lipid, cholesterol, and lipid-anchored PEG (lipid-PEG) stock solutions by dissolving each lipid in 100% ethanol. The concentrations of the lipid components are detailed in Table 1.\n\t\nHeat and mix the stock solutions at 37 °C to ensure that they are fully dissolved.\n2. Preparation of the lipid and nucleic acid mixes",
    "Calculate the required volumes of ionizable lipid, helper lipid, cholesterol, and lipid-PEG based on the desired molar ratio and ionizable lipid to mRNA weight ratio (Table 1). Prepare 10% extra volume of the organic phase to account for dead volume in the syringes during formulation.\n\t\nCombine the calculated volumes of the different lipid components in a conical tube.\nDilute the lipids with 100% ethanol to a final volume, V, which represents 25% of the final volume of LNP.\nCalculate the amount of mRNA required for formulation based on the ionizable lipid to mRNA weight ratio and the total volume of mRNA-LNP needed (Table 1).\n\t\nThaw the firefly luciferase-encoding mRNA on ice.\nDilute the mRNA to a final volume, 3V, three times the volume of the organic phase, in 10 mM citric acid buffer.\n\t\t​NOTE: Every lipid volume, V, must contain enough ionizable lipid for the mRNA diluted in 3V. This corresponds to the desired ionizable lipid to mRNA weight ratio.\n3. Microfluidic formulation of mRNA-LNPs\nSpray a delicate task wipe with a surface decontaminant for RNases and DNA, and wipe the interior of the microfluidic instrument thoroughly.\n\t\nOpen a new microfluidic cartridge, and insert it with the inlet channels facing down and away.\nEnsure that the conical tube arm holds two 15 mL conical tubes and is in the position furthest to the right.\nConfigure two sterile 15 mL conical tubes on the holder with the caps off.\nFill a 5 mL syringe with the mRNA solution that contains mRNA diluted in 10 mM citric acid buffer.\n\t\nFill a 3 mL syringe with the lipid solution that contains the lipids diluted in pure 100% ethanol.\nFlip up the cartridge holder on the microfluidic device.",
    "Insert the 5 mL syringe, without the needle, that contains mRNA into the left inlet of the cartridge.\nInsert the 3 mL syringe, without the needle, that contains lipids into the right inlet of the cartridge.\nFlip the cartridge holder back down, and close the lid of the microfluidic instrument.\nTurn on the microfluidic instrument by using the switch located on the back of the instrument.\n\t\nSelect Quick Run.\nSelect the correct syringe types for the 5 mL and 3 mL syringes inserted.\nInput the parameters for mRNA-LNP formulation at a 3:1 aqueous to organic flow rate ratio as described in Table 2.\nPress the Next button to go to the next screen.\nConfirm that the correct parameters have been inputted.\nPress the Start button to formulate the mRNA-LNPs.\n4. Post-formulation processing and characterization of the mRNA-LNPs\nLoad the mRNA-LNPs collected in the right conical tube into the previously hydrated dialysis cassettes.\n\tNOTE: Do not puncture or damage the membrane of the cassette when loading the mRNA-LNPs. If the membrane is damaged, mRNA-LNPs will be lost upon loading.\n\t\nPlace the dialysis cassettes containing the mRNA-LNPs back into the beaker containing 1x PBS, and leave them to dialyze for a minimum of 2 h.\nAfter dialysis, bring the dialysis cassettes containing the mRNA-LNPs into a sterile biosafety cabinet, and remove the mRNA-LNPs using a syringe with a needle.\nSterile-filter the mRNA-LNPs using a 0.22 µm syringe filter, and collect them in a sterile conical tube.\nPlace 65 µL of the mRNA-LNP solution into a 1.5 mL microtube for characterization purposes.\nDilute 10 µL of mRNA-LNPs 1:100 in 990 µL of 1x PBS in a cuvette for the measurement of the hydrodynamic size and polydispersity index using dynamic light scattering.",
    "Assess the concentration and encapsulation efficiency of the mRNA-LNPs using a fluorescence assay (i.e., RiboGreen).\n\t\nPrepare a stock solution of 1x TE buffer by diluting 20x TE buffer with molecular biology water.\nPrepare a stock solution of 1% Triton X-100 buffer by diluting Triton X-100 with 1x TE buffer.\nPrepare the fluorescent reagent by diluting the reagent stock 1:200 with 1x TE buffer.\nDilute the mRNA-LNPs 1:100 in 1x TE buffer and 1% Triton X-100 buffer in a black-wall black-bottom 96-well plate in 100 µL.\nPrepare a low-range standard curve by diluting the RNA standard as per the manufacturer's instructions, and plate the standard curve in the 96-well plate.\nAdd 100 µL of diluted fluorescent reagent to each well containing diluted mRNA-LNP or diluted standard.\nPlace the 96-well plate inside a plate reader, and shake for 1 min, followed by a 4 min wait.\nMeasure the fluorescence intensity of each well according to the manufacturer's protocol at an excitation/emission of 480 nm/520 nm.\nUse the standard curve to convert the fluorescence values to concentrations.\n\t\nCalculate the encapsulation efficiency by subtracting the value obtained from diluting LNPs in TE buffer (unencapsulated mRNA) from the value obtained from diluting LNPs in 1% Triton X-100 (total mRNA) and dividing by the value obtained from diluting LNPs in 1% Triton X-100, according to equation 4.4.\nCalculate the mRNA-LNP concentration used for cell and animal studies by subtracting the value obtained from diluting LNPs in TE buffer (unencapsulated mRNA) from the value obtained from diluting LNPs in 1% Triton X-100 (total mRNA).\nMeasure the pKa of the mRNA-LNPs by performing a 6-(p-toluidino)-2-naphthalenesulfonyl chloride (TNS) assay.\n\t\nPrepare the TNS reagent by creating a 0.16 mM solution of TNS in ultrapure water.",
    "NOTE: When using the reagent, be sure to keep it on ice and away from light to avoid degradation.\nPrepare buffered solutions of 150 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 25 mM ammonium citrate, and 20 mM ammonium acetate adjusted to different pH values ranging from 2 to 12 in increments of 0.5.\nAdd 2.5 µL of the LNP to each pH-adjusted buffer solution in a black-wall black-bottom 96-well plate.\nAdd TNS reagent to each well so that the final TNS concentration is 6 µM.\nIncubate the 96-well plate in a dark location for 5 min.\nMeasure the fluorescence at an excitation/emission of 322 nm/431 nm using a fluorescence plate reader.\nFit the data to a sigmoidal curve, and calculate the pKa by using the fitted equation to find the pH at which 50% of the maximum intensity was observed.\nRepresentative results for the mRNA-LNP hydrodynamic size, PDI, encapsulation efficiency, and pKa are shown in Table 3.\n5. In vitro transfection of HepG2 cells\nNOTE: Various other cell lines, such as HeLa cells or HEK-293T cells, may be used for assessing the transfection efficiency of LNPs in vitro. All cells should test negative for mycoplasma prior to the LNP transfection studies.\nPlate 5,000 HepG2 cells in each well of a white-wall clear-bottom 96-well plate in 100 µL of complete cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin)\n\t\nLeave the cells to adhere overnight in a controlled CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nDilute the mRNA-LNPs in complete cell culture medium so that the total dose is delivered in 100 µL.\n\t\nRemove the complete medium from the wells.\nTreat the cells with either mRNA-LNPs diluted in complete cell culture medium at the desired doses or complete medium (control).",
