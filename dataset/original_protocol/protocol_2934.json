    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWe use a vibratome to slice fixed mouse brains into 50-μm-thick sections.\nPause point: We routinely keep the brain slices in a 12-well plate containing 3–4 mL/well of the anti-freeze storage buffer. The sections can be stored at −20°C for ∼1 year.\nNote: If the experimental aim is to observe neuronal morphology alone based on YFP signal, the procedure for immunostaining described below can be omitted because the YFP signals driven by the Thy1 promoter are sufficiently strong for observations under a confocal microscope. Thus, the enhanced visualization provided by immunostaining is not essential. Instead, you can skip ahead to step 12 to prepare brain sections for observations using a confocal laser-scanning microscope.\nPreparation for immunofluorescence staining\nTiming: ∼10 min\nThis section describes how to prepare mouse brain slices for the study of neuronal morphology.\nPrepare a paintbrush, customized transwells, 12-well plate, and 24-well plate, as well as the foil-covered plate lid and bottom to avoid light exposure during the immunofluorescence steps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: A paintbrush is used to transfer brain slices when needed. Customized transwells are used to hold the brain slices in the 12-well plate. To transfer brain slices between wells for washing, the entire customized transwells containing the brain slices are transferred. Doing so minimizes damage to the brain slices caused by the transfer. To save antibodies, 24-well plates are used for incubating antibodies with brain slices.\nPrepare the immunofluorescence staining buffers: TBS, TBST, and TNB buffers.\nImmunofluorescence staining using brain sections\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section is about the procedure of immunostaining using mouse brain sections.\nAdd 1–2 mL TBS to a 12-well plate containing the customized transwells and transfer the selected brain slices into the transwells using a paintbrush.",
    "Wash the brain sections three times with 1× TBS for 10 min each time. Gentle shaking on a shaker set at 10 rpm is highly recommended (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: Rocking and orbital shakers both work well for antibody incubation and washing. In this protocol, we use a rocking shaker for the washing, blocking, and secondary antibody incubation steps.\nFor permeabilization, transfer the customized transwells containing the brain sections into a 12-well plate containing 1 mL TBST and incubate for 15 min with gentle shaking.\nWash the brain sections three times with 1× TBS for 10 min each time with gentle shaking.\nFor blocking, add 300–400 μL TNB blocking buffer into a 24-well plate and transfer the brain slices with a paintbrush. Shake gently at ∼25°C for 2 h.\nNote: Here, we use a 24-well plate to incubate the brain slices to save reagents. The volume of 300–400 μL is adequate to freely float the brain slices in a 24-well plate.\nDilute the primary antibody in TNB blocking buffer and add it to a 24-well plate for incubation with the brain sections with gentle shaking at 20 rpm for 16 h at 4°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: Here, the primary antibody is “mouse anti-synaptopodin” diluted 1:500 with TNB blocking buffer.\nAdd 1–2 mL TBST to a 12-well plate containing the customized transwells and transfer the brain slices into it using a paintbrush.\nWash the brain sections three times with 1× TBST for 10 min each time and with gentle shaking.\nDilute the secondary antibody and DAPI in TNB blocking buffer and add the mixture into a 24-well plate. Incubate the antibody mixture with the brain slices for 2 h at ∼25°C with gentle shaking.\nNote: Here, anti-mouse Alexa-555 secondary antibody and DAPI are diluted 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively, with TNB blocking buffer.",
    "Wash the brain sections three times with 1× TBST for 10 min each time and with gentle shaking.\nPlace multiple brain slices on a microscope glass slide, and air-dry them until transparent.\nNote: It is possible to place up to eight mouse brain slices per slide, if you can arrange them well.\nAdd 170 μL anti-fade mounting medium onto each brain slice and carefully cover it with a glass coverslip. Avoid trapping air bubbles.\nNote: To minimize bubbles, the following tips can be considered: 1. Before adding 170 μm anti-fade mounting medium, centrifuge it with a high-speed rotor to collapse any bubbles. 2. Prune the head of tips with scissors to widen them, before adding the mounting medium on brain slices. 3. Hold the glass coverslip with a forceps and lower onto the brain slice slowly and gently.\nGently remove the excess mounting medium.\nNote: Prepare the tissue paper, invert the brain slide on it, and gently press the brain slide to remove excess mounting medium from the edge of the coverslip. Alternatively, you can simply place the brain slide upside down for more than 12 h without pressing on it.\nApply nail polish along the edges of the coverslip to seal the samples.\nPause point: The stained samples can be kept in a cardboard slide tray at 4°C for ∼2 weeks. The fluorescence signals may be reduced after long-term storage.\nImage acquisition of hippocampal CA1 neurons\nTiming: 20–25 min/neuron\nThis section describes how we use a confocal laser scanner to acquire the Z-series images of Thy1-YFP-positive neurons.\nClean the glass surface of the slides with a cotton swab dipped in 95% Ethanol, and place the slide on the microscope stage.\nMove the vision field to the hippocampus region and adjust the focus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2679-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Representative images of a dorsal hippocampus and dorsal CA1 neuron of the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic line\n(A) Representative images of the dorsal hippocampus. Upper, DAPI; middle, YFP; bottom, merged image of DAPI and YFP. The inset is enlarged in (B). Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(B) High magnification image of a dorsal CA1 neuron from the inset shown in (A). Scale bar, 10 μm.\nNote: Usually, first we use the 10× objective lens and then change to a higher magnification lens. In Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, we present a representative image of the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region showing the DAPI and Thy1-YFP signals using a 20× objective lens.\nNote: Thy1-YFP is expressed by neurons in the dentate gyrus and CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, in layers 2/3 and 5/6 of the cerebral cortex, and by projection neurons of the amygdala. Thus, the morphology of all these neurons can be outlined clearly based on YFP signals in the Thy1-YFP-H line. Here, we focus on dorsal CA1 neurons as an example.\nSearch for CA1 neurons displaying clear and continuous primary dendrites using a 63 × NA 1.4 oil objective lens under the microscope.\nNote: It takes time to identify suitable CA1 neurons. Two time-saving tips are to locate a region where the density of neurons is not too high and to prepare multiple brain sections. If sufficient numbers of suitable dorsal CA1 neurons in a given slice cannot be identified, then search for them in the other brain slices.\nRecord a Z-series image stack of the apical dendrites for analysis using Zen software.\nNote: Here, we use a laser at 405, 488, and 555 nm to excite DAPI, YFP, and Alexa fluor 555, respectively. An example of a dorsal CA1 neuron is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.",
    "Set the parameters of the Zen 2011 software for image acquisition.\nNote: If you use a different system, the following guidelines can also be used even though your software interface may differ from that of Zen 2011.\nOpen the Zen software and access the user interface panel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\n“Smart setup” → choose Laser 405, 488, 555 nm and click “Best signal” → “Apply” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: “Smart setup” is the interface for automatically configuring the light path to detect fluorescent dyes. If another confocal system is being used, make sure that the filter setting avoids any potential leak-through.\nFix all tracks with the same pinhole: 1 μm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\n“Region” → Select the region based on the considerations outlined below (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: Given that the size and density of dendritic spines are affected by their relative positions to the soma (proximal vs. distal) and the type of dendrites (apical vs. basal), it is essential to establish criteria for selecting dendritic spines for comparison. The neurons we show herein are CA1 neurons of the dorsal hippocampus. We chose the primary branch of the apical dendrite, with the branch point located ∼20–50 μm from the soma (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The basal dendrites of CA1 neurons are too dense to be analyzed. A dendritic segment of 20 μm in length starting from a point 5 μm away from the branch point is used to quantify the density and size of the dendritic spines. Selecting the aforementioned area for image acquisition accelerates data processing and significantly saves time.\n“Z stack” → Set the upper and lower border of the focus, and set 0.2 μm as an interval. The number of sections in the Z-series is 5–25 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Note: We set 0.2 μm as an interval to acquire images of the dendritic spine in much more detail.\n“Frame size” →High resolution: X: 2048, Y: 2048, Speed max, Averaging number: 2 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: We adopt this setting to acquire high-quality images of dendritic spines. If another confocal system is being used, you may refer to this protocol and make appropriate modifications for image acquisition.\nClick “Start experiment” to capture the Z-series images.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2679-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Click “Smart setup” to select laser sources (DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 555), and use the best signal condition.\n(C) The green inset of (A). Click “Channels” or “Region” or “Z stack” to adjust respectively the fixed 1 μm pinhole in all tracks, the range of the selected dendrite segment, or to set the Z stack with an interval space of 0.2 μm.\n(D) The blue inset of (A). Follow the settings framed by the red rectangles to acquire a high-resolution image.\n(E) The setting to obtain the Z-series projection image.\n(F) The setting for reusing the selected image set-up.\nNote: The duration of scanning one dendrite with the YFP and SYNPO channels is approximately 6–7 min, depending on the section number of the Z-series. The most time-consuming step is to find a suitable dendrite for imaging.\nProcess the Z-series images.\nClick “Processing” in the Zen user interface panel.\nSelect “Maximum intensity projection” → “Apply” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nSave the projection image and Z-series images.\nNote: The settings for image acquisition can be re-used as follows:\nRe-Open the Z-series image→ Click “Dimension” →” Reuse” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).",
    "Data analysis of the density and size of the dendritic spines\nTiming: 10–15 min/dendrite\nThis section is about the analysis and quantification of the density and size of the dendritic spines of CA1 neurons based on the YFP signals.\nDownload and install Fiji-Image J (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads[href=https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads]) and PRISM (https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/[href=https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/]).\nNote: PRISM is a non-free software package, but is also fine to use other software or online resources to analyze the data.\nOpen Fiji-Image J software and import the Z-series projection image (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2679-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Data analysis of the size and density of the dendritic spines based on YFP signals\n(A) Open Fiji-Image J software and import the Z-series projection image of the dendrite segment.\n(B) Click the segmented line and draw a 5-μm-long line from the base of the dendrite and a further 20-μm-long line along the dendrite segment.\n(C) The inset of (B) has been further enlarged to show measurement of the width and length of dendritic spines.\n(D) The results of spine width and length, as generated in ImageJ.\n(E) Flowchart of how spine size and density are analyzed.\nClick “Analyze” → “set scale” to obtain scale information for the image.\nNote: There is built-in scale bar information in the image file acquired by the Zen 2011 acquisition software.\nLabel the site 5 μm from the base of the primary branch of the apical dendrite and then 20 μm further along the dendrite segment (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nClick “Segmented line”.\nDrag the line along the dendrite and click “Control” +” M″ simultaneously to acquire the length information of the line.\nNote: “M” means keyboard M.\nAfter defining the point 5 μm from the base of the primary branch of the apical dendrite, click “D” to label this dendrite segment.",
    "Note: “D” means keyboard D. Typically, there are not many dendritic spines at the beginning of a branch. To minimize variation and standardize our quantification, the first 5 μm of a dendritic segment is not subjected to quantification.\nFollow step 27 (a-c) to label 20 μm further along the dendrite segment from the 5 μm point.\nMeasure dendritic spine width, length, and density within the 20-μm dendrite segment (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nClick “Segmented line”.\nDrag the line and click Ctrl +” M″ to acquire spine length and width (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nNote: After clicking “M” to acquire spine information, you may click “T” to show respective information in the region of interest (ROI) table and save it to keep a record.\nInput the length and width information of each spine into an Excel file (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nData processing and analysis of spine size and density.\nCritical: In this protocol, we show quantifications of spine size and density within a 20-μm-long dendrite segment of one neuron. For real experiments, we usually acquire data from at least 10 dendrite segments from 10 neurons in each of at least three mice to represent the features of spine morphology and density in a given genotype, as described previously.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Thus, the sample size (n) is ∼30 dendritic segments, i.e., 30 neurons, from a total of three mice (N). Below, we describe how we perform the quantification and statistical analyses:\nDetermine the mean spine width and length for all 20-μm dendrite segments.\nOpen PRISM software and create a “column table”.\nPaste the mean spine length or width data of dendrite segments into the column table.\nAnalyze the normal distribution of each group using a Normality test (D’Agostino and Shapiro-Wilk).",
    "Compare two genetically distinct groups using a two-tailed unpaired t-test for normally distributed data or a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test for nonparametrically distributed data.\nNote: Use a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc test for multiple genetically variant groups. A Dunnett’s or Bonferroni multiple comparison post-hoc test should be applied for normally distributed data. A Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test is appropriate for nonparametrically distributed data.\nMake a “scatter plot graph”.\nNote: Examples of a comparison of dendritic spine size and density no among multiple genetically variant groups is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C of our previous study1.\nData analysis of synaptic protein clustering and distribution\nTiming: 10–15 min/dendrite\nThis section describes how we use line scan to analyze the distribution of synaptic proteins along dendritic spines.\nOpen Fiji-Image J software and import the Z-series projection image (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2679-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Take spines 1,2 and 3 as examples, which are labeled pink.\n(D) Click the keyboard “T” in both the YFP and SYNPO channels of spine 1–3 to show the respective information in the ROI table.",
    "(E) “Multiplot” the data for spines 1–3 → “list” → export the SYNPO-signal distributed data to Excel. The SYNPO signal of spine 1 is < 20 pixels/μm, so it is a SYNPO– spine. The SYNPO signal of spines 2 and 3 is > 20 pixels/μm, thus representing candidate SYNPO+ spines, which are subjected to further analysis in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nNote: In this protocol, we use synaptopodin (SYNPO) as an example of a synaptic protein.\nUse line-scan analysis to monitor the distribution of SYNPO within dendritic spines. Here, we use one selected 20-μm-long dendrite segment as an example (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nDouble click “Segmented line” → adjust line width to 0.5 μm (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nNote: Follow step 26 to acquire the scale of the image. Since the majority of our neuronal samples have a spine width of ∼0.5 μm, selecting the line width of 0.5 μm covers most signals of synaptic proteins within the dendritic spines.\nDrag the line from the top to the base of the dendritic spine (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nClick “T” on the keyboard for both Thy1-YFP and SYNPO channels to show respective information in the region of interest (ROI) table (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nRight-click the SYNPO channel in the ROI table → “multiplot” →” List” → select all and copy the SYNPO distribution data to an Excel file (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nRepeat steps 31 (b-d) for all dendritic spines in a dendrite segment, and save the ROI table.\nDetermine SYNPO-positive (+) and -negative (-) spines.\nCritical: To monitor the distribution of SYNPO within dendritic spines, we only process the results of dendritic spines containing SYNPO. Thus, before we quantify the results of line scanning, we must first determine whether or not the spines contain SYNPO as follows:\nOpen the Excel file from step 31.\nDefine SYNPO+ and SYNPO– spines.",
    "Note: Spines possessing SYNPO signals of <20 pixels/μm are defined as SYNPO–, which are not subjected to quantification or statistical analysis of line scanning data. Spines exhibiting SYNPO signals of >20 pixels/μm are candidate SYNPO+ spines, which undergo further analysis as described below.\nNote: SYNPO signal of <20 pixels/μm is barely observable by the naked eye so we set 20 pixels/μm as the threshold.\nCritical: Because of the potential false-positive SYNPO signal, SYNPO+ spines must be validated as follows:\nImport the Z-series images containing SYNPO+ spines to Fiji-Image J software (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nOpen the ROI table saved in step 31 (e).\nGo through the Z-series images and establish if the signals of YFP and SYNPO indeed co-exist in the same dendritic spines (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nIf “yes”, categorize the spines as SYNPO+. If “not”, the spines are SYNPO–.\nNote: An example of the results of step 31 is shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A.\nData processing of SYNPO+ spine number.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2679-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Determination of SYNPO+ dendritic spines from the Z-series images\n(A) Flowchart of the process to determine SYNPO+ dendritic spines. The Z-series projection image is identical to that shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C.\n(B) The inset of (A) has been further enlarged and is shown as Z-series images to validate SYNPO+ spines (Spines 2 and 3). The results indicate that Spine 2 is SYNPO+, whereas Spine 3 is SYNPO– (<20 pixels/μm).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2679-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "(D) Quantification of spine width, length, and density of the dendrite segment shown in (A). Mean spine length and width are shown. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.\nDetermine the number of SYNPO+ and SYNPO– spines in 20 μm dendrite segments.\nOpen PRISM software and create “Parts of the whole table”.\nInput the numbers of SYNPO+ and SYNPO– spines.\nMake a vertical slices graph (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nProcessing the line scanning results of SYNPO signals within dendritic spines (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nOpen the Excel file from step 31 and select SYNPO+ dendritic spines.\nNormalize the SYNPO signal with averaged SYNPO intensity of the individual SYNPO+ spine.\nNote: The maximum projection image is used here. Therefore, it is possible that some of the pixels from SYNPO are present outside the spines. However, based on our experience, there are very few spines and the SYNPO signals outside of the recorded spines are also very weak. Since those signals do not affect the final quantification and statistical results, we do not exclude them from our analysis. However, different synaptic proteins may exhibit different properties. We suggest first analyzing a small number of samples to evaluate if those false positive signals affect quantification and statistical results.\nOpen PRISM software and create a “Grouped table”.\nPaste the data on normalized SYNPO intensity for each group in PRISM.\nMake a “Superimposed symbol” with a “Connecting line table”."
