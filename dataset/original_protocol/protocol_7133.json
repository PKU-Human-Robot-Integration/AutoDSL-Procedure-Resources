    "L cell conditioned medium preparation (source of M-CSF) Take a vial of L cells out of the liquid nitrogen tank. Plate the cells in 10 mL of basic cell culture medium in a T75 TC flask and culture in TC incubator until ~80% confluent.When the culture is 80% confluent, aspirate the supernatant and rinse cells with 10 mL of PBS. Trypsinize the cells as described above. Pipet the mixture up and down, to suspend into single cells.Transfer detached cells into 15 mL tube and add 8 mL of basic cell culture medium.Add 25 mL of basic cell culture medium to each of five T-225 TC flasks. Then add 1 mL of detached cells to each flask. Culture in TC incubator until ~80% confluent (~5 days).Harvest the supernatant in 50 mL tubes and store at -80°C. Replenish the T-225 flask with 25 mL of fresh basic cell culture medium and harvest the media after 2 days. Repeat this step until cells start to detach from the plate.After accumulating 500 mL, thaw L cell conditioned medium, pool, and filter sterilize (0.2 μm). Use directly, or refreeze in 45 mL aliquots for use in macrophage differentiation medium (MDM) preparation. We routinely use one large batch of L cell conditioned medium in a particular study. However, we have not noticed significant batch differences.Feeder cell preparation (inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts used for culturing ES cells in order to maintain their pluripotency) Coat one T75 TC flask with 4 mL of 0.1% gelatin in solution. Rock the plate to cover the bottom surface with gelatin. Incubate the flask in 37°C 5% CO2 incubator (TC incubator) for at least 1 h before use. Aspirate the 0.1% gelatin solution before use (no gel forms, gelatin protein simply adheres to the TC surface).",
    "Feeder cell cultureThaw one MEF vial (1 mL) in a 37°C water bath. Move thawed cells into a 15 mL tube and add 2 mL of basic cell culture medium.Spin the cells at 500 × g at room temperature for 5 min. A pellet should be seen on the bottom.Discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet evenly in 10 mL of basic cell culture medium.Add resuspended MEF cells into the gelatin-coated flask. Rock the plate side to side and culture in TC incubator. Cells tend to be ~70% confluent in ~5 days.Feeder cell freezing (when MEF cells are ~70% confluent)Discard the supernatant. Rinse cells with 10 mL of sterile PBS.Detach the cells with 4 mL of Trypsin-EDTA in TC incubator for 5 min. Pipette the mixture up and down to suspend into single cells.Transfer detached cells into a 15 mL tube and add 8 mL of basic cell culture medium to quench the trypsin. Spin the cells at 500 × g at room temperature for 5 min. A pellet should be seen on the bottom.Discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet evenly with 6 mL of MEF cell freezing medium (for culture in one T75 TC flask). Aliquot 1 mL of cells into each 1.2 mL freezing vial. Place vials in controlled-rate freezing jar and transfer the jar to -80°C overnight. Transfer frozen cells into the liquid nitrogen tank the next day.Feeder cell inactivation (when MEF cells are ~70% confluent, approximately 6 × 106 cells)Add 1 mL of 1 mg/mL mitomycin C to 100 mL of basic cell culture medium to make a final concentration of 10 μg/mL.Retrieve MEF cells in T75 TC flask. Aspirate the medium and rinse once with 10 mL of PBS. Add 20 mL of MEF medium with 10 μg/mL mitomycin C to the flask.",
    "Incubate for at least 2 h in TC incubator.Aspirate the medium and rinse cells with 15 mL of PBS 3 times to remove mitomycin C. Trypsinize, spin, and resuspend cells in 6 mL of MEF cell freezing medium. Aliquot 1 mL of cells into each 1.2 mL freezing vial. There should be approximately 1 × 106 cells in each vial. Label the vials as inactivated MEF cells (IMEF) to avoid error. Freeze cells as described above.Inactivated feeder cell plating (~7 days before the starting of differentiation)Coat each well of a new 6-well TC plate with 0.5 mL of 0.1% gelatin as described above. Aspirate the 0.1% gelatin solution before use.Thaw one IMEF vial in a 37°C water bath. Transfer thawed cells into a 15 mL tube and add 2 mL of basic cell culture medium.Spin the cells 500 × g at room temperature for 5 min. A pellet should be seen on the bottom.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 12 mL of basic cell culture medium for use in one 6-well TC plate.Add resuspended IMEF cells into the gelatin-coated 6-well plate (2 mL per well). Shake the plate side to side and culture in TC incubator. The IMEF cells should appear ~50% to 70% confluent the next day (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4318/bioprotoc-12-03-4318-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Suspended macrophage progenitor cells one day after replating onto a gelatin coated TC plate. 10× objective lens, scale bar = 100 μm.Mouse ES cell culture for differentiation Thaw one vial of ES cells (approximately 1.5 × 106 cells) in 37°C water bath.",
    "Transfer thawed cells into 15 mL tube and add 3 mL of mouse ES cell culture basal medium. Spin 500 × g at room temperature for 5 min.Aspirate supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 12 mL mouse ES cell culture complete medium.Retrieve the IMEF cells coated 6-well plate from incubator. Aspirate the basic cell culture medium.Add 2 mL of the resuspended ES cells into each well. Rock plate side to side. Culture in TC incubator. After 3 days, cells should be ~70% confluent (Figure 2B, approximately 1.5 × 106 cells per well).Differentiation of mouse ES cell into embryoid bodies (EBs) (stage 1, day 0) Removal of IMEF cells (important: small amount of IMEF cells can disrupt the differentiation)Trypsinize (0.5 mL per well) one well of the 6-well plate of ES cell/IMEF cell co-culture and resuspend into 12 mL of mouse ES cell culture complete medium. Plate 2 mL into each well of a gelatin-coated 6-well TC plate (no feeder cells, 6-fold dilution). ES reach ~60 to 70% confluency in five days in the absence of IMEF feeder cells (Figure 2C).Retrieve ES cells in 6-well plate from incubator when ~70% confluent. Aspirate the medium, rinse with PBS once (2 mL per well), and trypsinize (0.5 mL/well) for 5 min in TC incubator. Spin cells down and aspirate supernatant.Resuspend cell pellet in 12 mL of mouse ES cell culture basal medium and plate on another gelatin-coated 6-well TC plate, at 2 mL/well. Incubate ES cells with residual feeder cells in TC incubator for 30 min.Harvest the supernatant to obtain pure ES cells (residual IMEF cells adhere on the bottom). Spin and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of PBS.Count the cells with cell counter. Calculate the volume of the suspension needed to obtain 6 × 105 cells for each differentiation.",
    "Add 6 × 105 ES cells into a 15 mL tube, pellet the cells, and resuspend in 10 mL of MDM.Transfer the cell suspension to a 100 mm Petri dish (sterile not-TC treated bacteriological), which is designated as day 0 of the differentiation. Place dish on horizontal rocker, set at ~9 s per cycle, which is inside the TC incubator. The rocker prevents possible attachment and merging of EBs. Small EBs floating in medium should be visible after two days (Figure 3).Add an additional 10 mL of MDM in the Petri dish on day 4, and keep cells on rocker. Manage the rocker’s angle of tilt to avoid spilling.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4318/bioprotoc-12-03-4318-g003.jpgFigure 3. Light microscope bright field images during ESDM differentiation. Stages 1-3 at different days are shown (4× objective lens, scale bar = 200 μm). Stage 1. Multiple single ES cells aggregate as early EBs. The rocker prevents EBs from merging with each other or attaching to the Petri dish, ensuring independent development of large spherical EBs. Stage 2. EBs transferred to gelatin-coated TC dish spread cells out eccentrically until confluent. Stage 3. Macrophage progenitors released by the EBs are harvested and plated on a new gelatin-coated TC plate. The attached macrophage progenitors divide and differentiate.Differentiate large EBs to macrophage progenitors on day 7 (stage 2) On day 7, coat 100 mm TC dish with 4 mL of 0.1% gelatin for 1 h in TC incubator. Aspirate the gelatin solution before use.Retrieve the stage 1 Petri dish of large EBbs from the rocker (Figure 3). There should be >100 large spherical EBs floating in the medium.Transfer all floating EBs together with the original medium into the gelatin-coated 100 mm TC dish gently with a 10 mL pipette, to avoid dissociating the EBs.",
    "Gently rock the dish side to side to evenly spread the EBs. Put the stage 2 dish into TC incubator without the use of the rocker, which is not used in any subsequent steps. Culture from day 7 to day 14.The EBs will attach to the gelatin-coated dish on day 8. Aspirate the media and refeed with 10 mL of MDM on days 8 and 12. Outgrowth of adherent cells from the plated EB occurs during this phase (Figures 2D and 3).On day 14, the dish bottom should be fully occupied by growing EBs leaving no room for newly released macrophage progenitors to attach, promoting the macrophage progenitors to float in the medium.Harvest macrophage progenitors on day 14, and every three days thereafter, to differentiate into functional ESDM (stage 3) Retrieve stage 2 TC dish from TC incubator. Floating macrophage progenitors should be seen in the medium.Place a 30 μm sterile filter on top of a 15 mL tube. Gently collect the media containing floating macrophage progenitors with a 10 mL pipette and apply the media slowly into the filter for gravity filtration, to remove small EBs and cell clusters. Transfer the filtered macrophage progenitors to a new gelatin-coated 6-well TC plate, at a volume of 3 mL in each well, to start the stage 3 cultures. Refeed the 100 mm TC dish at stage 2 with 10 mL of MDM and return it to TC incubator.The stage 3 macrophage progenitors in the 6-well plate should be attached by the next day (Figures 2E and 3). Aspirate medium, wash gently once with PBS, and refeed with 2 mL of MDM. The attached stage 3 macrophage progenitors keep dividing during early stages of maturation. Replenish the MDM medium every five days.",
    "Success of ESDM differentiation can be simply screened seven days after stage 3 plating (assessed by acetylated LDL uptake, described below), when ~40% of the cells display a macrophage phenotype.Continue to harvest stage 2 macrophage progenitors every three days as described above. The harvesting can be sustained for up to seven rounds (~21 days after the first harvesting). The only difference we observed between different harvestings is the yield. The first two harvestings give lower yields and the later harvestings yield a larger number of macrophage progenitors.Feed mature ESDM (>13 days of stage 3 plating) with 3 mL of macrophage maintenance medium per well every five days. Mature ESDM remain healthy for up to 15 days after full maturation. Mature ESDM can also be detached using trypsin and a sterile cell lifter for replating. Ideally, the comparison of different ESDMs should be conducted within the same harvesting. However, we found no significant variation on comparing results between different harvestings."
