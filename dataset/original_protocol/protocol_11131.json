    "All animal procedures in this article were reviewed and approved by the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute Animal Ethics Committee (Approval number, SAM322).\n1. Tail vein injection of adeno-associated virus\nNOTE: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) should be handled as a biohazard under Biosafety Level 1 guidelines. Please refer to the published protocol for AAV preparation, purification, and titration33. Hepatocyte-tropic AAV, AAV834, encoding the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-Islr gene, was used in this study25. To induce AAV-mediated overexpression, AAV dosing might require optimization depending on the promoter activity, gene, and mouse weight.\nDilute AAV vector into 150 µL aliquots containing 1.0 x 1011 viral genomes, using sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and keep it on ice. Personal protective equipment should be worn to handle the AAV.\n\tNOTE: Repeated freeze and thaw cycle decreases virus titer and should be avoided. The stock viral solution should be stored in a -80 °C freezer.\nTurn on a heat box (animal warming chamber) to preheat to 35 °C.\nHold a mouse and apply a topical anesthesia cream to the whole length of the tail at least 15 min prior to the tail vein injection.\n\tNOTE: This is an optional step and might not be necessary if it is not required by the animal ethics committee of the institute. Follow the protocol approved by the local animal ethics committee. In this experiment25, a Rosa26-Cas9 mouse was used for AAV injection and subsequent portal vein injection of CRC organoids. Given that tumoroids used in this study were derived from a Rosa26-Cas9 mouse (C57BL/6 x 129 genetic background), this mouse strain was also used as immunocompetent, syngeneic recipients of the tumor transplant. Male and female Rosa26-Cas9 mice (6- to 24-week-old) were used.",
    "Place the mouse into the heat box. Leave the mouse for up to 15 min to warm and dilate the tail veins.\nGently secure the mouse in a rodent restrainer. Place the tail under a heat lamp to ensure full dilation of tail veins.\nDraw up 150 µL of diluted AAV (prepared in step 1.1) into a low dead space sterile syringe with a 27-30 G needle.\nMove the heat lamp and identify the lateral tail vein located on the sides of the tail. Put slight tension on the tail with the fingers so that the tail becomes straight.\nSlowly insert 2-3 mm of the needle, bevel up, into the vein. The needle should be almost parallel to the tail (up to 15° from the tail).\n\tNOTE: Blood influx into the syringe might be observed if the needle is successfully located into the vein.\nInject slowly. If a resistance is felt or skin swelling is observed, remove the needle and re-insert above the first site or to the other lateral vein.\nWait for about 5 s after the completion of the injection, and then slowly remove the needle. Immediately apply gentle pressure to the injection site with a clean gauze or paper towel until bleeding stops.\nGently release the mouse into its cage. Monitor the animal to ensure bleeding has stopped.\n\tNOTE: Gene overexpression in the liver can be assessed 1 to 2 weeks after AAV tail vein injection. This can be confirmed, for example, by RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting, or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR; Figure 1A,B). In a previously published study25, AAV8-Islr was used to overexpress mouse Islr gene in hepatocytes and the overexpression was detected by RNA ISH (Figure 1A,B).\n2. Cell preparation for colorectal cancer organoids",
    "NOTE: CRC organoids used for this experiment solely contain epithelial cells. Culture and generation of CRC organoids has been previously described25,35. In short, normal colonic epithelial cells were isolated from the colon of a Rosa26-Cas9 mouse using a crypt isolation buffer (5 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate) in ice-cold PBS), and then embedded in basement membrane matrix medium, and cultured in organoid growth medium as described in reference35. Then, Apc and Trp53 mutations were introduced to the colonic epithelial cells by overexpressing single-guide RNAs that target Apc and Trp53 using lentivirus expression protocol. Single organoid clones were handpicked25. ApcΔ/Δand Trp53Δ/Δ colon cancer organoids (AP tumoroids), were injected as 5.0 x 105 single cells in 100 µL of PBS with 10 µM Y-27632 into the portal vein per mouse, with organoid culture and single-cell preparation described below.\nCulture the CRC organoids in the basement membrane matrix medium domes in a 24-well plate or 10 cm dish 3-5 days before the portal vein injection to obtain 50-400 µm diameter organoids.\nPrepare sufficient amount of cell detachment solution by adding Y-27632 to 10 µM concentration, enough to digest the number of organoids being cultured for the injection. Pre-warm in a 37 °C water bath.\n\tNOTE: The cell detachment solution used in this protocol is a recombinant cell-dissociation enzyme mix and is used as a substitute for trypsin in organoid culture (see Table of Materials). It reduces cellular damage caused by cell dissociation compared to trypsin36. Y-27632 is a Rho kinase inhibitor and inhibits dissociation-induced cell death, thereby increasing single-cell survival37.",
    "For injection into up to five mice, prepare two tubes containing 40 mL of the cell detachment solution to digest 10-24 x 50 µL of basement membrane matrix domes with each dome containing approximately 300 organoids (50-400 µm diameter), i.e., each mouse is injected with 2-4.8 domes of organoids (equivalent to about 600-1440 organoids). The number of organoids necessary to obtain sufficient cell number is dependent on the organoid line, and thus should be optimized.\n\t\tNOTE: The second 40 mL tube enables a repeat digestion with fresh cell detachment solution to obtain dissociated single cells.\nCarefully aspirate the organoid medium from each well.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold PBS to each well in a 24-well plate. If a 10 cm dish is used, add 10 mL of ice-cold PBS to the dish.\nScratch off the basement membrane matrix medium using a P1000 pipette tip. Transfer the PBS/medium slurry to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nRinse each well with the same amount of PBS to collect basement membrane matrix fragments and add to the 15 mL tube(s).\nIncubate for 5 min on ice. This incubation helps dissolve the basement membrane matrix medium.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant ensuring not to disturb the pelleted medium and cells.\nAdd 5 mL of pre-warmed cell detachment solution prepared in step 2.2 to the pellet, resuspend the pellet 10 times, and transfer it back into a 50 mL tube containing fresh, pre-warmed cell detachment solution.\nPlace the tube in the 37 °C water bath. Incubate for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nRepeat steps 2.9-2.11.\n\tNOTE: Repeated enzymatic digestion allows for the efficient cell dissociation into single cells.",
    "Check whether the organoids are dissociated into single cells by pipetting 100 µL into a 96-well plate and observing under a microscope. If many organoids show cell clumps consisting of more than four cells, longer incubation with the cell detachment solution and physical dissociation by trituration with a 10 mL pipette may be necessary.\nOnce most cells are single cells, add 4 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) into the 40 mL cell suspension to stop the digestion. Rinse a 40 µm cell strainer with 5 mL PBS.\nPass the cell suspension through the cell strainer into a 50 mL collection tube to remove any cell clumps.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant. Add 10 mL of cold PBS to the cell pellet and transfer it to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 500 µL cold PBS with 10 µM Y-27632. Count the cells.\nAdjust the cell concentration to 5.0 x 105 single cells/100 µL, using PBS with 10 µM Y-27632. Place the tube on ice until portal vein injection is performed.\n\t​NOTE: It is recommended to inject dissociated cells within 4 h of dissociation.\n3. Portal vein injection of CRC organoids\nNOTE: All surgical instruments and surgical gauzes must be autoclaved or sterilized before surgery. This protocol is modified from a previous protocol17. In this experiment25, portal vein injection was performed using Rosa26-Cas9 mice treated with AAV-mRuby2 or AAV-Islr in step 1.\nPrepare an aseptic surgical area using sterile drapes on a heating pad.",
    "Prepare surgical instruments (scissors and forceps), surgical and hemostatic sponge, 4-0 polyglactin suture, cotton buds, skin staplers, stapler applicator, saline, buprenorphine, and 33 G needle attached to a Hamilton syringe. Cut the hemostatic sponge into 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm pieces.\nAdjust the position of the light source to illuminate the surgical area.\nInject 0.1 mg/kg body weight of buprenorphine subcutaneously to a mouse for surgical pain management.\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane in an anesthesia chamber. Isoflurane concentration for induction and maintenance are usually 5% and 2.5%, respectively. Check for the absence of a reaction to toe pinch before commencing the next procedure.\nShave the middle to the upper abdomen of the mouse with an electric shaver. Shaving should be performed in an area distant from the aseptic surgical area to avoid hair contaminating the site.\nClean the incision site alternating with Betadine and 80% ethanol to sterilize the surgical area. Repeat three times.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad in a supine position with maintenance isoflurane anesthesia. Place a surgical drape with a hole over the abdomen of the mouse.\nLift the abdominal skin with forceps and make a 2-3 cm skin incision at the midline with scissors, cutting the skin only (not underlying peritoneum). The incision should range from the mid-abdomen to the xiphoid process of the sternum. The incision should not go above the lower end of the xiphoid process.\nFully lift the peritoneal wall with forceps and make a similar 2-3 cm incision to the peritoneum with scissors. Avoid cutting the intestine and the diaphragm.\nSoak the surgical gauze with warm saline and place it on the left side of the incision (on the left side of the mouse's body; to the surgeon's right).",
    "Gently pull the internal organs (small and large intestines) out using a cotton bud soaked with saline. Place the intestines on the gauze soaked with saline.\n\tNOTE: The mouse's left-side intestines (i.e., intestines on the surgeon's right) should be pulled out first, and then the mouse's right-side intestines (i.e., intestines on the surgeon's left) can be pulled out.\nAdjust the position of the intestines to visualize the portal vein. Cover the intestines with additional wet gauze to keep the intestines moist.\nGently pull the intestine to the left side with the wet gauze and apply gentle tension to the left. This facilitates visualization of the portal vein (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: If visualization of the portal vein is difficult, gently adjusting the position of the stomach with a wet cotton bud might help the visualization.\nGently pipette tumoroid suspension several times to obtain a homogenous cell suspension. Slowly draw up 100 µL of the cell suspension into a Hamilton syringe attached to a 33 G needle. Avoid air bubbles.\nSlowly insert the needle, bevel up, into the portal vein. The insertion depth along the needle should be 3-4 mm, with the needle angle almost parallel to the portal vein.\n\tNOTE: Injection should be performed into the well-visualized part of the portal vein (usually up to 2 cm away from the hepatic hilum). Avoid movement of the needle after it is fully inserted into the portal vein.\nInject tumor cells for 30 s. The injection should be slowly performed to prevent occlusion of the portal vein. If the injection is successful, the color of the liver temporarily changes from red to white.\nRemove the needle slowly. Immediately apply gentle pressure to the injection site with a dry cotton bud and wait for 5 min.",
    "Remove the cotton bud and simultaneously apply a hemostatic sponge to the injection site. Hold hemostatic sponge with a cotton bud or forceps and apply gentle pressure for 5 more min.\nRemove the pressure to the hemostatic sponge and confirm that there is no bleeding from the injection site.\n\tNOTE: The bio-absorbable hemostatic sponge does not need to be removed. Trying to remove the gauze could cause re-bleeding from the injection site.\nIf bleeding occurs, immediately perform pressure hemostasis with a cotton bud for about 10 min. Then, apply an additional hemostatic sponge for a further 5 min.\n\tNOTE: If uncontrollable blood loss is observed, the mouse should be euthanized according to the protocol approved by the animal ethics committee of the institute.\nRemove the surgical gauzes on the intestines. Using a syringe filled with 5 mL saline, squirt saline to the intestines to prevent organ adhesion.\n\tNOTE: Do not apply saline to the portal vein injection site. This could cause re-bleeding.\nGently place the intestines back inside the abdominal cavity.\nSuture the peritoneum using 4-0 polyglactin sutures.\nLift up both sides of the skin with forceps. Apply skin staplers to close the skin incision. Be careful not to staple the intestine.\nTurn off the isoflurane but keep the oxygen flow running. Carefully monitor the mouse. When the mouse awakens, place the mouse in an empty cage on a heating pad. The mouse typically awakens within 5 min.\nCarefully monitor the mouse until it is conscious and ambulating normally.\nSubcutaneously inject 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine to the mouse 4 h after the surgery.\nInject 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine to the mouse every 24 hours for the subsequent 2 days.\nCarefully monitor the mice daily for a week after surgery. Check sutures and wound healing.",
    "days after the surgery, remove skin staplers using a stapler remover.\n4. Assessment of tumor growth kinetics by in vivo bioluminescent imaging\nNOTE: If Firefly-expressing tumoroids are used for injection, metastatic tumor progression can be monitored weekly by in vivo imaging as described38,39. Luciferase expressed by cancer cells could elicit immune responses against the cancer cells and limit tumor growth40. Thus, caution is warranted in analyzing immune phenotypes and cancer progression in a mouse model using luciferase-expressing tumor cells.\nPrepare a 30 mg/mL solution of D-luciferin using sterile PBS. Protect it from light. D-luciferin should be stored in aliquots at -20 °C until use.\nShave the abdomen and thorax with an electronic shaver. This can be done up to 1 day before in vivo imaging.\nInject 150 mg/kg body weight of D-luciferin intraperitoneally into mice (i.e., if the mouse body weight is 30 g, inject 150 µL of the D-luciferin solution).\nPlace the mice in an anesthesia chamber and anesthetize them. Use 5% of isoflurane for induction and 2%-3% for maintenance.\nmin later, place the mice in a lateral position (right side up). Acquire bioluminescence images using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) as described previously38,39.\n\tNOTE: Mice are more stable in a lateral position compared to the supine position. Therefore, a lateral position is preferable to obtain a luminescence image from a consistent focal plane.\nPlace the mice in an empty cage and monitor their recovery.\nDefine regions of interest on the upper abdomen using Living Image Software as described38. Quantify total flux as a surrogate for tumor cell number.\n5. Survival analysis and tissue collection\nMonitor mice carefully for clinical symptoms of metastases such as a distended abdomen.\nEuthanize a mouse by CO2 inhalation once it reaches humane endpoints.",
    "NOTE: Use a study endpoint approved by the animal ethics committee of the institute. To determine a humane endpoint, a clinical record sheet was used; scores were calculated by one point being given for the presence of each of the following observations: weight loss > 15%, hunched posture, ruffled coat, dehydration, decreased movement, distended abdomen, or facial grimace. Once a score of 3 was reached, the mice were humanely euthanized.\nImmediately following euthanasia, perform transcardial perfusion fixation with 30-50 mL of 10% formalin in a fume hood, as described41. Make several small incisions (up to 1 cm each) with scissors into the normal part of the liver before perfusion to generate outlets for blood and formalin. Upon perfusion, the liver color will change from red to brown.\n\tNOTE: If micrometastases in macroscopically normal liver areas are a subject of study, we recommend researchers to not cut the liver, but to snip the superior vena cava instead. However, when we have used this method, fixation of the liver seems poorer when compared with cutting the liver. Especially if RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) is planned to be performed on liver sections, we recommend making incisions into the liver before intra-cardiac injection of formalin, as described above. This enables sufficient fixation of the liver tissue, resulting in preservation of RNA integrity for ISH.\nPlace the liver and lung tissues into 10% formalin and fixate overnight. Replace the formalin with 70% ethanol, followed by paraffin-embedding.\nPerform hematoxylin and eosin staining to histologically evaluate tumor area. Perform immunohistochemistry for stromal markers of interest. Perform Picro-Sirus Red staining to evaluate collagen-positive areas.",
    "NOTE: The ImageJ software42 can be used to quantify immunohistochemistry and Picro-Sirius Res staining data. A color deconvolution function and the MRI fibrosis tool can be used to evaluate 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB)-positive areas and Picro-Sirius red-positive areas, respectively.\nSubscription Required.
