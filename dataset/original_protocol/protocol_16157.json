    "The following protocol is designed for generating fetal lung progenitors from hESC/iPSC lines. The protocol is optimized from our previous protocol (Wong et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.341#cpz1341-bib-0032]; Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.341#cpz1341-fig-0001]). hPSC are induced into definitive endoderm using the STEMDiff definitive endoderm (DE) kit (following manufacturer's protocol exactly). This is followed by the anterior ventral foregut endoderm (AVFE) stage, which expresses NKX2-1 indicating lung lineages, then fetal lung progenitors (fLEP), which express high CFTR levels.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c30a410c-9c8d-4fed-a84e-b255ef229809/cpz1341-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nRefined in vitro step-wise differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to generate definitive endoderm (DE), anterior ventral foregut endoderm (AVFE), fetal lung epithelial progenitor (fLEP) cells, airway epithelial spheroid (AES) culture, and mature air-liquid interface (ALI) culture (Stage 5).

Add 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the pelleted AES and incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nProtocols for trypsinization are found in Phelan & May (2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.341#cpz1341-bib-0025]).\n6. Collect the cells in 1 ml of sorting buffer and strain cell suspension using 0.4-µm strainer.\n7. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature. Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\n8. Resuspend the cells in S5A medium with 10 µM Y-27632 at 2000 cells/µl.\n9. Gently seed 250 µl of the cell suspension onto the apical side of each transwell evenly.",
    "10. After 24 hr, remove old medium and add fresh S5A medium on the apical side. Change medium every other day for a total of 5 days.\nAfter 5 days, a confluent monolayer should form.\n11. When confluent, remove medium from apical chamber and add 1.5 ml per transwell of S5B medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 on the basolateral side.\n12. Medium change with 1.5 ml per transwell of S5B medium two times per week on the basolateral side for at least 5 weeks."
