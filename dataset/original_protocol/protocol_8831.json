    "All procedures and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Experiments described here are acute non-survival experiments, and there was no use of eye ointment. Maintenance of sterile conditions only occurs when surgical instruments are washed with 70% ethanol in DiH2O. Sacrifice of rats at the end of the experiment occurred via overdose of IV ketamine/xylazine.\n1. Preparation of Instruments and Chemicals\nPrepare stock solution of 0.05 M of 5-HT HCl in PBS. Then dilute stock with PBS to a final 5-HT concentration of 0.203 mM.\nDilute dronabinol in sesame oil at a concentration of 20 µg/µl.\nCut 20 cm length of polyethylene (PE)-50 tubing (I.D. 0.58 mm, O.D. 0.965 mm). At one end of the tubing, cut a bevel tip using scissors, and at the other square end, insert a 23 g needle. Connect this 23 g needle to a 1 ml syringe, and fill it up with 0.3 ml of 50 u/ml heparin.\nCut four pieces of 4-0 braided silk thread and set to the side.\nSterilize surgical scissors, 2 curved Graefe forceps, and 3 micro clamps with 70% ethanol in diH2O.\n2. Catheterization of Femoral Vein\nProtocol for catheterization is modified from Jespersen et al.21\nAnesthetize a Sprague-Dawley rat with intraperitoneal (IP) ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg:10 mg/kg). Pinch the toe of the rat and observe any movement to confirm a proper level of anesthesia. Shave the ventral aspect of the left thigh, and the ventral aspect of the neck. If necessary by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, apply eye ointment to prevent dryness.\nSecure rat in a supine position on a surgical board. Use surgical scissors to cut away skin in the left hind thigh.",
    "Using forceps, conduct blunt dissection of the superficial muscle to expose the femoral vein. Use the forceps to separate the vein from the femoral artery, and place 2 threads around the femoral vein.\nUse the curved Graefe forceps to pull-up the vein to stop blood flow. Using a 22 G syringe needle, puncture the femoral vein and then insert the beveled end of the PE-50 tubing into the vein.\nCheck if the PE-50 tubing was inserted correctly by retracting the plunger of the syringe. Blood should be seen entering the PE-50 tubing. Tie 2 knots around the vein and PE-50 tubing using the 2 threads.\n3. 5-HT-induced Apnea via IV Infusion\nPlace a piezoelectric strain gauge around the rat to measure respiration.\nChange settings for amplification level of the electronic amplifier via amplifier software on the computer: to amplify (100x) and band-pass filter (1-10 Hz) the respiratory signals obtained from the strain gauge, set “highpas filter” at “AC @ 1 HZ” and “Lowpass Filter” at “10 Hz,” and set the amplification by inputting “10” for the “Initial Gain” and “100” for “Total Gain.”.\nChange settings for sampling rate by opening “Analog Input” via recording software on the computer. To digitize (500 Hz sampling rate) using an analog-to-digital converter, “sample” at “1,000 Hz” and “skip” every other recording point by “1” (effective sampling rate 500 Hz), and then record the signal using recording software.\nRemove the 1 ml syringe from the catheter and insert a 500 µl precision glass syringe filled with 0.203 mM of 5-HT into the catheter.",
    "Place the 500 µl precision glass syringe into an infusion pump. Infuse 12.5 µg/kg per 350 µl/kg of 5-HT solution at a rate of 63 ml/hr. Perform multiple infusions and observe apnea in rat, which is seen as a pause in breathing (≥ 2.5 sec) in the recorded respiratory signals on the computer monitor.\nBefore proceeding with neck surgery, monitor breathing pattern and check for pain reflex from toe pinch in the rat. If breathing is irregular, or if there is a pain reflex from toe pinch, administer IP ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg:5 mg/kg) and then re-confirm a proper level of anesthesia.\n4. Neck Surgery to Expose Nodose Ganglia\nSecure rat in a supine position on a surgical board. Make a midline longitudinal cut using surgical scissors at the neck.\nUsing blunt dissection on the platysma muscle (using 2 micro clamps to keep this muscle clear of the surgical site), expose the sternohyoideus and omohyoideus muscles. Separate these muscles to expose the internal carotid artery and one of its branches, the pterygopalatine artery.\nObserve the vagus nerve as it runs along the internal carotid artery and then along the pterygopalatine artery. Observe how the vagus nerve and pterygopalatine artery, along with the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) and the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI), enter the posterior lacerated foramen at the base of the skull.\nNotice that the nodose ganglion is displayed as a swelling of the vagus nerve right before it enters the posterior lacerated foramen. Also notice that the pharyngeal and laryngeal nerve branches come off the anterior and posterior aspects, respectively, of the nodose ganglion.5",
    "Using the Graefe forceps, separate the vagus nerve from the arteries, and place a piece of thread around the vagus nerve. Place a clamp on the thread to apply slight tension on the vagus nerve, and clean the nodose ganglion of any connective tissue to provide less resistance when injecting.\nRepeat 5-HT-induced apnea as stated in section 3 to confirm that no damage was done to the nodose ganglia.\n5. Intranodose Ganglia Injection of Dronabinol\nFill a 10 µl gastight precision glass syringe affixed with a custom-made 28 g half-inch syringe needle with a 35° beveled tip with 5 µl of dronabinol in sesame oil.\nPlace a micro clamp on the thread to apply slight tension on the vagus nerve, and puncture the nodose ganglion taking care not to puncture through it. Depress the syringe slowly (≥ 60 sec) to inject the entire contents of the syringe. Note that some of the syringe contents will leak out of the ganglion.\nRepeat 5-HT-induced apnea as stated in section 3.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
