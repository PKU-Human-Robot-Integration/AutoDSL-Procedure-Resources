    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOverall method summary\nTiming: 1 week\nWe describe a systematic high-copy suppression screen using fluorescence microscopy to identify regulators of meiosis and meiotic commitment. First, a yeast strain is transformed in 96-well plates with individual plasmids from the Yeast Genomic Tiling Collection, which consists of 1588 2μ plasmids encompassing 92% of the yeast genome (Gavade et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Gietz, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Jones et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Tsuchiya et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Second, meiosis is induced in 96-well plates. For screens for meiotic commitment, nutrient-rich medium is added after cells have passed the meiotic commitment point. The cells are incubated for several hours to allow cells to either complete meiosis or return to mitosis. Finally, the cells are fixed, imaged, and scored for the phenotype of interest.\nHigh-throughput transformation of the overexpression library\nThis step details the transformation of individual plasmids from the overexpression library into yeast in a 96-well dish format.\nNote: Use of the Yeast Genomic Tiling Collection will require the transformation of 1588 plasmids in approximately 17 96-well plates. This protocol is written for transformation of one plate but should be scaled to the number of plates that the operator feels comfortable undertaking so that the screen can be performed faster.\nNote: Sterile technique is required throughout the protocol. All glassware should be autoclaved and kept sealed prior to use. All reagents and media should either be autoclaved or filtered (as noted).\nInoculate a 20 mL culture of YPD with a colony of your yeast strain of interest and let grow for 12 h at 30°C with agitation.",
    "Note: We prefer to use 125 mL glass culture flasks with baffles for 20 mL cultures and 250 mL glass culture flasks with baffles for 50 mL cultures to allow efficient culture aeration. Ensure that the incubation has a constant source of agitation. We use a platform shaker set to 200 RPM.\nDilute 2.5 × 108 cells in 50 mL of pre-warmed YPD.\nIncubate cells at 30°C for 4 h with constant agitation.\nBoil the salmon sperm DNA for 5 min and then put on ice.\nPrepare 35 μL of the transformation mix for each well, add 15 μL of 1 M Lithium acetate and 20 μL of the boiled salmon sperm DNA. Keep this mix on ice until use.\nNote: Since 35 μL of transformation mix is added to each well, calculate the amount of mix required for adding to each well of the 96-well plate and prepare a master mix of the transformation mix.\nTransfer 200 μL of the cell suspension into each well of a 96-well round bottom plate.\nNote: The use of a multichannel pipette and sterile reagent reservoir can speed up the allocation of media/reagents into each well of a 96-well plate.\nCentrifuge the 96-well plate at 1,300 g for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant using a multi-channel pipette.\nAdd 5 μL of miniprep DNA from the Yeast Genomic Tiling Collection to each well (100–400 ng per μL).\nAdd 35 μL of the transformation mix (15 μL of 1 M Lithium acetate + 20 μL of 2 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA) to each well.\nAdd 100 μL of 50% PEG to each well using a multi-channel pipette.",
    "Note: 50% PEG is viscous and requires slow pipetting to ensure accurate volumes. Check your pipette tips for the correct amount of fluid prior to adding to the wells.\nNote: Only use the PEG at molecular weight 3350. Other molecular weights do not allow efficient transformation.\nCover the 96-well plate and shake for 10 min at 75 rpm.\nNote: This step will ensure mixing of contents in each well.\nIncubate at 42°C for 2 h.\nCentrifuge the plate at 1,300 g for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 μL of sterile water by slowly pipetting up and down.\nSpot 5 μL of cells on SCD-leu plates.\nIncubate the plates at 30°C for 2–4 days.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2106-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Controls used for our experiment\n(A) As a negative control, the low Ndt80 strain with an empty vector plasmid is unable to stay committed to meiosis with the addition of nutrient-rich medium (t=0). The cell shown undergoes meiosis I and then buds and forms two spindles.\n(B) As a positive control, the low Ndt80 strain with a plasmid containing NDT80 will stay committed to meiosis upon addition of nutrient-rich medium (t=0). The cell shown completes meiosis, even in the presence of nutrient-rich media. Scale bar 5 μm.\nNote: We used 100 mm petri plates and spotted 48 wells (6 columns × 8 rows) on 1 plate. One 96-well plate was spotted onto 2 SCD-leu plates. Alternatively, rectangular petri plates can be used to spot all 96-wells onto 1 plate.\nNote: You should have confluent growth of the spots after the incubation.",
    "Pause point: You can store the spotted SCD-leu plates at 4°C for 1–2 weeks after step 13. Plates should be stored upside down, wrapped with parafilm. However, if a strain other than W303 is used, the strain should be checked that it remains a stable diploid during this time and does not go petite.\nCritical: A positive and negative control should be added to the genetic screen. As a negative control, we transformed cells with a 2μ plasmid that did not have additional yeast genes. As a positive control, we added a 2μ plasmid with NDT80, which will rescue meiotic commitment in the low Ndt80 strain (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nInducing meiosis in cells in 96-well plates\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step describes the culturing of yeast cells to initiate meiosis prior to imaging.\nAdd 1 mL of SCD-leu to each well of a sterile 96-well block.\nNote: The medium and the block should be pre-warmed to 30°C.\nUsing a pipette tip, scrape the cells from a single spot on the SCD-leu plates and swirl the tip into the appropriate well of the 96-well block from step 17.\nNote: To reduce errors, the cells on the spots should be picked up from the pipette tips of a multichannel pipette by carefully lifting a portion of the colony and inoculating it in the SCD-leu containing block.\nCover with an air permeable seal. Incubate the 96-well block at 30°C for 24 h.\nNote: The block can be kept sitting without agitation.\nIn an empty sterile block, add a 2 mm × 5 mm sterile magnetic stir bar to each well of a sterile 96-well block.",
    "Note: The 2 mm × 5 mm magnetic stir bars fit within the 96-well blocks and agitates the cells on the shaker. Alternatively, glass beads can be used instead of the magnetic stir bars to agitate the yeast within each well.\nAdd 1 mL of SCA-leu to each well in the block.\nNote: The medium and the block should be pre-warmed to 30°C.\nTransfer 40 μL of SCD-leu grown cells from step 17 into each well of the 96-well block.\nCover the block with a sterile air permeable cover.\nIncubate the block at 30°C for 15 h on a shaker set at 200 RPM.\nNote: Alternatively, you can use a stir plate to agitate the cells for facilitating proper aeration.\nNote: We taped the blocks onto a shaker. However, 96-well plate clamps can also be used to clamp the plates on the shaker.\nSpin the 96-well block at 1,300 g for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant using a multi-channel pipette.\nWash the cells twice with 1 mL of sterile water, by adding the water, spinning down the cells and aspirating after each wash.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of SPM by pipetting up and down.\nSeal the block with a sterile air permeable cover.\nIncubate the cells at 25°C on a shaker set at 200 RPM until the cells reach the stage of meiosis that you are interested in observing.\nNote: The time will vary depending on the stage of meiosis that you are studying. Furthermore, both the time and temperature will vary depending on the yeast strain that you are using.\nFor analysis of meiotic commitment or return-to-growth, spin the 96-well block at 1,300 g for 1 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of 2×SCD -leu media.",
    "Place the block on the magnetic stir plate at 25°C and stir at a low speed for 8 h.\nNote: This step is only for studying meiotic commitment or return-to-growth. SCD medium should not be added to cells if studying the normal process of meiosis.\nNote: Alternatively, plates can be placed on a shaker at low speed.\nCentrifuge the block at 1,300 g for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, removing 950 μL of media.\nResuspend the cells in the remaining 50 μL of media.\nTransfer the cells to a 96-well round bottom plate.\nTo fix the cells, add 150 μL of freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde.\nNote: Paraformaldehyde is toxic and gloves should be worn when handling.\nNote: Fixation times can vary depending on the fluorescent markers. We fixed the cells for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the 96-well plate from step 33 at 1,300 g for 1 min.\nDiscard the paraformaldehyde and resuspend the cells in 150 μL of sterile PBS.\nNote: The paraformaldehyde needs to be collected in a hazardous waste container for proper disposal.\nCentrifuge the plate at 1,300 g for 1 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 150 μL of sterile PBS.\nPause point: The plates can be stored at 4°C for 2–3 weeks. Wrap the plates with an aluminum foil to decrease the loss of the fluorescence signal.\nImaging cells in 96-well plates\nTiming: 1–5 days depending on the number of plates to image\nThis step outlines the imaging of cells from each well of a 96-well glass-bottom plate.\nAdd 5 μL of fixed cells to each well of a 96-well imaging plate.\nNote: The 96-well plates should be specific for imaging, such as those with a cover glass bottom. We used Cellvis plates (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).",
    "Note: It is important to spread cells into a monolayer so that individual cells can be easily imaged. We spread out the cells by adding a premade agar pad to the top of the cells. We heat 1.2% agarose in 1× PBS (pH 7.4) in the microwave until the agarose goes into solution. We then add 150 μL of the molten agarose into each well of a clean flat-bottom 96-well plate. Once the agarose is solidified, this plate is inverted and placed over the 96-well plate with the cells, such that the agar pad can transfer to the wells with the cells. The plates are centrifuged at 100 g for 1 minute to transfer the agarose pad from the top plate to over the cells.\nImage cells on a fluorescence microscope.\nScan through each well and select at least 10 fields per well for imaging.\nNote: For the imaging, using brightfield or DIC, identify fields in which the cells form a monolayer and are on the same focal plane.\nImage using the appropriate excitation wavelengths for the fluorescent tags within the strains. Take at least five z-steps for each wavelength (1.2 μm). Also include a brightfield or DIC image.\nCritical: Exposure time must be optimized for your imaging system and tagged proteins of interest to ensure adequate signal and to avoid photobleaching. These parameters should be identified prior to the high-throughput imaging.\nNote: This protocol is written for use of an inverted fluorescence microscope to image cells at the bottom of the wells of a glass-bottom 96-well plate.",
    "Note: We used a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescence microscope and a 60× oil objective (PlanAPO CB, 1.4NA) with filters for mCherry and GFP. We moved to each well and found 10 fields within each well to image with 5 z-stacks of both mCherry and GFP. It took us approximately 4 h to image each plate. However, use of an automated high-throughput screening fluorescence microscope can save time during image collection.\nAnalysis\nTiming: 1–5 days depending on the number of plates imaged\nThis step describes how to analyze the cells after imaging.\nAnalyze the acquired images for the phenotype of interest using a software system compatible with the images taken on the microscope (like Nikon NIS Elements or ImageJ).\nNote: For our analysis we used Nikon NIS Elements. We opened each image set and made a maximum projection image from the z-stacks, overlaying GFP and mCherry fluorescence. We used the DIC image to ensure that we were analyzing cells in a monolayer and to see whether cells had budded.\nNote: In our screen, we were looking for cells that stayed committed to meiosis. Therefore, we scanned 10-fields per-well of the 96-well plates and counted the number of cells that had remained in meiosis, and those that had formed buds."
