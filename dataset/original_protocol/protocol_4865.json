  "procedures": [
    "Kinase reactionPrepare 10x kinase buffer.Note: 10x kinase buffer should always be prepared freshly. It can be mixed together from higher concentrated stock solutions. We recommend freezing small (one time use) aliquots of ATP and DTT. Thaw recombinant proteins on ice.In a clean microtube, mix PINK1 with ubiquitin (monomers or chains) or Parkin: use 0.1-1 µg of PINK1 per µg of ubiquitin or Parkin.Notes:We recommend using 1 µg of substrate in a 20 µl reaction as a starting point. We typically use 20-100 µl as a total reaction volume. If biotinylated ubiquitin is used, HRP-coupled streptavidin can be used for detection on phos-tag gels. Otherwise an ubiquitin antibody is necessary.Compared to poly-ubiquitin chains, free monomeric ubiquitin is simpler to analyze on phos-tag gels since there is only one band (and therefore only one band-shift). While polymeric K48- and K63-linked chains represent physiological substrates of PINK1 (when attached to mitochondrial substrate proteins), phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated bands may at least partially overlap in particular if chains of various lengths are used.Optional: Prepare negative control sample as above but use inactive PINK D359A instead of the wild-type enzyme.Add kinase buffer to a final concentration of 1x.Spin reactions for 10 sec at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.Incubate the reactions for 60-120 min (or 24-48 h to achieve 100% substrate phosphorylation) in a heated shaker at 37 °C.Stop the reactions by adding 6x SDS loading buffer to a final concentration of 1x.Incubate the reactions for 15 min at 56 °C.Note: This lower temperature prevents the unwanted spontaneous formation of ubiquitin 'dimers'. Detection using phospho-specific antibodiesAssemble SDS gel into an electrophoresis chamber.Fill the chamber with 1x SDS running buffer.Load samples on the gel. Use 20-500 ng per lane.Note: As a starting point we recommend using 50 ng. Depending on the detection method (antibody, dilution etc.",
    ") and equipment the amounts may be changed.Add 5-10 µl of pre-stained protein ladder in one lane as molecular weight marker.Run gel using standard conditions (for the gels/equipment listed below use constant 125 Volt for 90 min).Transfer gel onto methanol-activated PVDF membrane in 1x blotting buffer using standard conditions (for the gels/equipment listed below use constant 100 Volt for 50 min).Block membrane in 5% dry milk powder in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, shaking.Note: We routinely use TBST for Western blots. Other wash buffers might work as well, however phosphate-based buffers are generally not recommended for the detection of phosphorylated proteins.Incubate membrane with phospho-specific ubiquitin or Parkin antibodies diluted in 5% BSA in TBST overnight at 4 °C.Note: The phospho-specific antibodies listed below have not been tested for this particular method. The final concentration of antibody will depend on the amount loaded and must be determined empirically.Wash membrane 4 x 10 min in TBST at RT.Incubate membrane with secondary antibodies diluted 1:10,000 in 5% dry milk powder in TBST for one hour at RT.Wash membrane 4 x 10 min in TBST at RT.Incubate membrane with detection reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions.Develop Western blot by exposing X-ray films or using a camera detection system.Detection using phos-tag gelsNote: This method is independent of the availability/performance of phospho-specific antibodies. Phosphorylated proteins migrate slower in phos-tag gels compared to non-modified proteins, resulting in a band shift. They can be visualized with specific antibodies against the unmodified protein of interest or with HRP-coupled streptavidin if biotinylated recombinant substrates were used for the kinase reaction. Prepare phos-tag polyacrylamide gels of desired density: 8% for Parkin and 14% for mono ubiquitin, respectively.Proceed with SDS-PAGE as above.",
    "Notes: Run gels in ice or with cold water perfusion of the apparatus [for the equipment listed below use constant 125 Volt for 90 min (8% gel) and 120-140 min (14% gel), respectively].Pre-stained protein markers generally cause distortion because they contain EDTA or phosphorylated proteins. At least one lane should be left blank between the marker and the samples. Please note that the molecular weight of pre-stained markers will not be accurate on phos-tag gels.After electrophoresis incubate phos-tag gels in phos-tag washing buffer 1 for 20 min followed by two incubations, each 20 min, in phos-tag washing buffer 2 at RT.Transfer gel onto methanol-activated PVDF membrane in 1x blotting buffer (for equipment listed below use constant 105 Volt for 60 min).Note: Nitrocellulose membrane might be used instead of PVDF.For some primary antibodies, antigen retrieval is necessary. Ubiquitin antibody VU-1 requires washing of the membrane with ultrapure water prior to 0.5% glutaraldehyde treatment for 20 min, shaking, followed by three brief washes with PBS.Block membrane for 1 h at room temperature in 5% dry milk powder in TBST for VU-1 and Prk8 antibodies and in 5% BSA in TBST for streptavidin linked to HRP. Proceed with Western blot as above.Note: For 50 ng of substrate use a 1:5,000 dilution of VU-1 antibody to detect ubiquitin and 1:150,000 dilution of Prk8 antibody to detect Parkin. In case of biotinylated ubiquitin, use streptavidin-HRP at a dilution of 1:100,000. For other amounts, dilution of antibodies should be adjusted accordingly. For dilutions > 1:50,000 a predilution is recommended (e.g., dilute antibody 1:100 and then 1:1,000 for a 1:100,000 dilution). If sodium azide is added predilutions can be stored at 4 °C. However, sodium azide will inhibit HRP and is therefore not recommended for streptavidin-HRP."
