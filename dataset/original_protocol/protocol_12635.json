    "1. Cell line construction\nClone the gene of interest into a PiggyBac vector pPiggyBac-FLAG-bio-[cDNA of interest]-(Hygromycin-resistant) plasmid that carries a FLAG-biotin epitope13,21 to express a FLAG-biotin tag fused RBP (FBRBP).\nCotransfect the FBRBP expressing vector with the pBase vector into a cell line expressing the BirA enzyme22.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the FBRBP gene was transfected into mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) carrying an integrated BirA expression vector21. Alternatively, the FBRBP expressing vector can be cotransfected into cells with pBase and pPiggyBac-BirA-V5 together.\nGrow the cells in mESC on gelatinized dishes and maintain in mES culture medium (Table of Materials) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Select the transfected cells with hygromycin b (100 µg/mL) for 1 week.\nAfter drug selection, harvest cells by SDS loading buffer (Table 1) and use a Western blot23 to confirm the tagging and expression of the gene with a FLAG antibody and streptavidin-HRP, respectively.\n2. Cross-linking\nPlate ~3 x 106 mES cells in a 10 cm plate 1 day before the experiment so that the cells will grow to 70−90% confluence when harvested (~5−10 million cells per sample).\nRemove the medium with a vacuum. Treat the cells with 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 2 min at room temperature (RT) and quench the trypsin by 4 mL of fresh mESC medium. Transfer the cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Spin down the cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 3 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant.\nSuspend the cells with 4 mL of cold PBS and plate the cells back to the 10 cm plate for cross-linking. Cross-link the cells by radiation with 254 nm UV light (set the UV cross-linker with a parameter of 400 mJ/cm2).",
    "NOTE: For cell monolayers, the cells can be cross-linked with UV light directly on the plate before trypsin treatment.\nTransfer the cross-linked cells to a 15 mL tube.
