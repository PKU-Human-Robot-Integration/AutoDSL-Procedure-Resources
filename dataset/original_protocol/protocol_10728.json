    "1. Microcoil Fabrication\nObtain a commercially available microcatheter (e.g. 2.3F Rapid Transit Cordis Neurovascular Catheter, Raynham, MA) for a substrate.\nEnsure catheters have no ferrous components, are considered MR-safe, and range in size 2.3-3.0 F.\nSputter a titanium adhesion layer followed by a copper seed layer unto a 1 to 2 mm OD insulating tube. Possible materials include polyimide or alumina (Ortech Advanced Ceramics, Sacramento, CA).\nElectrodeposit a positive photoresist layer using Shipley's PEPR-2400 (currently being sold by DOW Chemical under the name Intervia 3D-P). Electrodeposition results in a uniform coating on the non-planar cylindrical surface.\nPhotoresist is exposed by a unique laser direct-write system (laser lathe, a non-commercial system developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) in the pattern of the desired coil form (Figure 2A). This is a modification of the technique originally described in Malba et al.14\nDevelop the exposed photoresist in a 1% solution of potassium carbonate at 35 °C.\nCopper is electroplated through the remaining resist mask to form the desired coil. The system can fabricate both solenoid and Helmholtz (racetrack) copper patterns (Figures 2C and 2D).\nAfter copper electrodeposition, remove the resist with hot developer. Remove the copper seed layer, followed by the titanium adhesion layer.\nAttach the insulating tube to the catheter tip using shrink wrap to complete the assembly. Ensure that the shrink wrap covers the entire coiled tip. To assemble multi-axis catheters place insulating tube structures inside each other as shown in Figure 2E.\nThread copper wires through the lumen of the microcatheter and solder to the coils at the tip.\nModify and shorten a 6 ft RJ11 phone cable to 3 ft in length.\nConnect the copper wires emanating from the back end hub of the microcatheter to the modified 3 ft phone jack transmission line.\n2. Waterbath Setup",
    "Make a small hole in the center of the side of a plastic basin about 5 cm from the bottom.\nInsert a 9F Avanti Cordis vascular sheath (Cordis Endovascular, Miami Lakes, FL) through the hole.\nCut the distal tip of the vascular sheath leaving a 4 cm-long piece extending in to the basin.\nAt the end of the sheath, attach a rotating hemostatic or Thuoy-Borst valve to stabilize the location of the microcatheter.\nFill the basin with distilled water ensuring complete submersion of the apparatus.\nInsert the catheter with coiled tip through the vascular sheath and valve.\nMeasure and record the unrestrained length of the microcatheter extending from the valve in to the waterbath.\nPlace the waterbath with microcatheter system within the magnet of the MR scanner and orient with respect to the bore of the magnet.\nConnect the modified 3 ft phone cable attached to the catheter to a 25 ft RJ11 phone cable transmission line using a 2-way phone jack.\nConnect the other end of the 25 ft phone cable to a Lambda LPD-422A-FM dual regulated power supply to deliver up to 1 A of current to the device.\nPlace the transmission lines through a waveguide and the power source outside of the MR scanner room outside of the 5 Gauss line.\n3. Vessel Phantom Setup\nConstruct a hollow vessel phantom with a Y-shaped intersection from rubber tubing prior to experimentation.\nFill the vessel phantom with a 0.0102 M solution of gadopentetate dimeglumine (GdDTPA) (Magnevist, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Montville, New Jersey) in distilled water to create contrast between the phantom vessels and background.\nAssemble the microcatheter system as outlined in steps 1.1 through 1.9. Connect the catheter to the power supply and position as described in steps 2.9 to 2.11.",
    "Position the tip of the microcatheter at the base of the vessel opening.\nPlace the phantom within the magnet of the MR scanner and orient with respect to the bore of the magnet.\n4. Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nPerform imaging with a 1.5T clinical MR system (Siemens Avanto, SW: Syngo B13, Erlangen, Germany; Philips Achieva, SW release 2.1, Cleveland, OH).\nApply <50 mA of current to visualize the catheter tip position. Under MRI, a small magnetic moment will be produced at the catheter tip to visualize a distinct artifact of varying shape depending on which coils are energized.\nApply variable amounts of current in the range of ±100 mA from the Lambda dual power source to the coils and observe tip deflection (Figures 3A-3C) in the water bath setup. Because tip deflection is almost instantaneous, current need only be applied for ~1-2 sec to visualize maximum deflection.\nRepeat and record consecutive applications of set amounts of current.\nRepeat step 4.2 while simultaneously pushing the catheter by hand allowing mechanical advancement through the vessel phantom (Figures 4A and 4B). Apply current at the branch point to deflect the catheter tip into the desired vessel. Advance the catheter into the branch vessel by manually pushing the catheter end (Figure 4C). Retract the catheter to the vessel bifurcation and repeat in the opposite branch (Figure 4D).\nAcquire MR images using a 2D snapshot-FLASH sequence (TR=30 msec, TE=1.4 msec, a matrix of 256 x128 and flip angle ~30 °).\n5. Deflection Measurements\nAnalyze and measure angle deflections of images captured during water bath experiments with various computer applications (any Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Viewer).Subscription Required.
