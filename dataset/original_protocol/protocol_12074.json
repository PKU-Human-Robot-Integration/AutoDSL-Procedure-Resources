    "All animals and procedures used in this study were handled according to Washington State University (WSU) Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines and in compliance with WSU-approved animal protocols #4702 and #4735.\n1. Mice\nUse standard C57BL/6J adult male mice or other strains of interest. Maintain animals under a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment, with ad libitum access of water and food.\nUse male breeders ranging from 8 weeks old to 10 months old. Use only proven breeders in the experiments.\nUse adult female mice with a tissue selective deletion of reproductive tract estrogen receptor α (encoded by Esr1 gene) in the epithelial cells10 (Wnt7aCre/+;Esr1f/f, called knockout or \"KO\") and control littermates (Esr1f/f, called \"CTRL\") in this study.\nUse 8 week-old females. Ages of females varied depending on the experiment of interest.\nDetermine the stages of the estrous cycle in the morning at 08:00h. Use only females at the estrus stage of the cycle. For detailed methods of vaginal smearing and cytological analysis, refer to the previously published procedures11.\n2. Mating and Assessing Copulatory Plugs\nAt the day of estrus (16:00h), house the female in a male's cage.\nThe next morning (08:00h), separate the female from the male mouse.\nUse an adaptation of a previously published method12 to access the presence or absence of a vaginal or copulatory plug as an indication of mating.\nHold the female mouse from the base of the tail to briefly lift the hind limbs.\nFind the copulatory plug by the presence of an off-white seminal coagulum at the vaginal opening using a toothpick. If the copulatory plug is present, the toothpick will not be able to be inserted into the vaginal canal.\n3. Preparation Before Tissue Collection",
    "Prepare 10 mL of Leibovitz's L-15 media, supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (called L15 media + 1% FBS) in a 15 mL tube. Incubate the media at 37 °C for 15 min in a waterbath.\nIn order to preserve the viability of the tissue and sperm for downstream applications, aliquot 2 mL of pre-warmed L15 media + 1% FBS in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube for tissue collection.\nWarm the stage of the stereomicroscope to 37 °C. Set the heat-block to 37 °C and place an empty 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube in the block.\nIf the downstream applications require imaging of sperm motility, warm the glass slide to 37 °C.\n4. Tissue Collection\nBring pre-warmed L15 media + 1% FBS aliquot to the tissue collection area.\nEuthanize the female (~08:30h) using carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.\n\tNOTE: This is approximately 8 h after mating, assuming that mating takes place at midnight.\nPlace the animal in a supine position to expose the abdominal area.\nSpray 70% alcohol on the abdomen near hind limbs.\nUse the dissecting scissors to make a small cut (~1 cm) on the skin of the lower abdomen.\nUse the dominant hand to pull the tail (and hind limbs if necessary) while non-dominant hand pulls the skin in the opposite direction (toward the head) to expose the abdominal muscle. This method is used to minimize the amount of hair contamination to the visceral organs.\nCut the abdominal muscle in a V-shape at the base of the abdomen, adjacent to the vagina, to expose the visceral organs.\nMove intestines and abdominal fat to the side to expose the reproductive tract.\nTrim off bladder and other tissues above the vaginal area.\nCut pubic symphysis apart to gain access to the vaginal tissue.",
    "Lift the vaginal tissue at the vaginal opening and using scissors to separate the vaginal canal from the rectal tissue.\nCarefully trim off the mesenteric fat from both sides of the uterus using spring scissors.\n\tCAUTION: The uterus is very fragile with the semen inside. Be careful not to puncture the uterus, or else the semen will be lost.\nLift the lower reproductive tract and cut the ovarian fat pad off of both sides.\nTransfer the whole reproductive tract into the tube of pre-warmed Leibovitz's L-15 media + 1% FBS.\n5. Measurement of Semen Liquefaction (Viscosity) from Uterine Content Collection\nOn the heated stage of the stereomicroscope, transfer the tissues into a 35 mm sterile tissue culture dish filled with 3.5 mL pre-warmed L-15 media + 1% FBS to clean the tissues of blood and other contaminants.\n\tCAUTION: While washing, grab the tissues by the fat, not the uterus. At this point, the semen is expected be intact inside the uterus.\nBlot the tissues of excess media using laboratory wipes.\nHold the tissue at the vaginal end while placing the ovarian ends in the pre-heated microcentrifuge tube. While holding the vaginal end, cut the uterine horns at the base of the uterus, allowing the uterine horns to fall into the microcentrifuge tube.\nLet the semen flow out of the uterine horns into the tube. Use toothless forceps to gently squeeze the uterine horns from the ovarian end to the vaginal end, expelling out leftover semen.\nDiscard the tissues in biohazard bag and incinerate.\nBriefly spin down the semen in a minicentrifuge (~1-2 s).\nLay the tube, parallel to the heated stage - semen will not spill out.\nHave the timer ready and set to 'count up'.",
    "Insert a 25 µL capillary tube into the semen sample at a 180° angle (parallel to the tube wall). This is to minimize the variability between each investigator from holding the capillary tube at different angles.\nPress the timer as soon as the capillary tube makes contact with the semen.\nRecord the time (s) it takes for the semen to reach the 25 µL line.\nWhen the measurement is finished, immediately put the tube containing semen back in the dry heat block for further functional analysis, such as video imaging of sperm motility.\nDisinfect the capillary tube containing semen by immersing the tube in 10% bleach solution for 20 min and discard the capillary tube in the sharps container.\n6. Video Imaging of Sperm Motility\nTurn on the microscope and video imaging software.\nPipette 20 µL of the remaining semen onto the pre-warmed glass slide, while the glass slide is placed on the heated stage.\nCover with a glass coverslip.\nPlace the slide coverslip side down on the microscope.\nUse 20X objective lens to find area of interest.\nChange to 100X objective lens for video imaging.\nRecord the video at 12 frames/s (fps) for 30 s.\nRandomly record the videos in at least 3 different areas per animal.\nPerform the imaging quickly and minimize light exposure to the slide in order to preserve sperm motility and viability.\n\tNOTE: This imaging procedure should be done within 2-3 min.\nPerform the data analysis using ImageJ software as previously described8.\nSubscription Required.
