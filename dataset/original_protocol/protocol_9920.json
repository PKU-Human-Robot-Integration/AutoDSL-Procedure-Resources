    "1. Tunable cell culture substrate preparation and characterization\nSubstrate preparation\nMix the PDMS base elastomer and curing agents using a pipette tip vigorously at a ratio between 10:1 and 60:1 until bubbles are homogeneously dispersed within the mixture. Remove bubbles using vacuum desiccation until bubbles are dissipated.\n\t\tNOTE: During PDMS polymerization, curing agent crosslinks with the base elastomer to provide final polymer desired mechanical properties. Crosslink ratios can be adjusted to alter PDMS stiffness.\nPlace a drop (~0.2 mL) of desiccated PDMS mixture on a square or circular coverslip (e.g., 22 mm x 22 mm) and rotate the coverslip on a spin coater at 2500 rpm for 30 s.\nIncubate the coverslip in either an oven at 60 °C for 1-2 h or room temperature overnight for PDMS to solidify.\nTreat the coverslip using UV-Ozone cleaner for 7 min (UV wavelength: 185 nm and 254 nm) to increase the surface hydrophilicity. Place it into a sterilized 6-well plate.\nBefore using for cell culture, incubate substrates in 70% ethanol for at least 30 min.\n\t\tCAUTION: UV-Ozone cleaner can generate Ozone that is harmful to humans. Work in a chemical fume hood or with some form of ventilation.\nImmerse coverslips in the protein solution (10 µg/mL collagen I, fibronectin, or laminin) for 60 min in a sterile incubator at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Following UV-Ozone treatment, the PDMS surface may still be hydrophobic. Rotate the well plate to ensure each coverslip is covered with the protein solution.\nAspirate the protein solution and wash the coverslip with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 3x.",
    "Re-suspend RT4-D6P2T Schwann cell line (SCs) from passaging dish using commercially available EDTA solution (1x) with 2.5% trypsin and count cells with hemocytometer. Seed SCs on the tunable PDMS surface at the desired cell density. SC seeding densities may vary for each different application.\nMaintain cells in the desired cell culture parameters (90% humidity, 5% CO2, 37 °C, etc.) for the length of experiment. Use Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin as the cell culture medium.\nMicropatterned substrate preparation\nDraw the desired geometry and cell adhesive areas (900 µm2, 1,600 µm2 and 2,500 µm2) using computer-aided design (CAD) software. Create a chrome photomask based on those patterns from a commercial supplier.\nIn a clean room or dust free environment, use standard photolithography techniques to fabricate silicon wafers (protocols are detailed elsewhere31). Critical parameters for this particular application are as follows: Photoresist: SU-8 2010; Spin profile to disperse the photoresist: 500 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 100 rpm/s, then 3500 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 300 rpm/s; Exposure energy of UV light: 130 mJ/cm2.\n\t\tNOTE: The height of patterns on the silicon wafers is approximately 10 µm following these parameters. Potential cracks around the edge outside of the rectangular or triangular patterns can be seen using a light microscope after step 1.2.2. Baking the silicon wafer at 190 °C for 30 min helps to eliminate the cracks.\nPlace the patterned silicon wafer inside a circular 150 mm diameter x 15 mm height Petri dish and pour de-gassed PDMS (mixing ratio 10:1) as prepared in step 1.1.1 onto the silicon wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the thickness of PDMS is at least 5 mm for ease of handling during microcontact printing steps.",
    "Solidify PDMS on silicon wafer in an oven at 60 °C overnight. Allow PDMS to cool to room temperature. Precisely cut stamps of 30 mm x 30 mm squares containing the correct patterns from the silicon wafer using a surgical scalpel. Do not damage the silicon wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: Silicon wafers can be reused many times at this point to produce more stamps following cleaning with isopropanol.\nSterilize PDMS stamps and the tunable coverslips (prepared in step 1.1.1 to 1.1.3) by immersing them into 70% ethanol for 30 min.\nTo confirm the efficacy of micropattern by PDMS stamps after microcontact printing, dry the surface of PDMS stamps using a filtered air stream and pipette 50 µg/mL BSA (Texas Red conjugated) solution to cover the entire patterned side of the PDMS stamp.\nIncubate PDMS stamps with BSA solution for 1 h at room temperature to allow for protein adsorption.\nDry the surface of tunable coverslips using a filtered air stream, increase surface hydrophilicity as described in step 1.1.5.\nAir dry the PDMS stamps to remove the remaining BSA solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care that BSA solution is completely removed from the stamp because any remaining solution will cause stamps to slide on the coverslip during microcontact printing.\nBring the patterned side of the stamp into conformal contact with the tunable coverslip for BSA adsorption on the coverslip surface. Gently press the stamp against the coverslip for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not apply excessive force on the stamp since it will bend and cause non-specific contact between stamp and coverslip. The appropriate amount of force applied on the stamp is essential for successful microcontact printing.\nExamine the micropattern using fluorescence microscope with a FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) filter.",
    "To print cell adhesive areas rather than fluorescent patterns, substitute laminin for BSA protein and repeat step 1.2.5 to 1.2.10.\nRemove stamps from coverslips, transfer coverslips into a sterilized 6-well plate. Add 2 mL of 0.2% w/v Pluronic F-127 solution into each well to cover the surface of the coverslip and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Pluronic F-127 can be adsorbed to PDMS surface increasing the hydrophobicity of PDMS surface to block cells from adhesion.\nAspirate Pluronic F-127 solution and wash 5x with PBS and 1x with the cell culture medium before seeding cells. A typical seeding density for SCs is 1,000 cells/cm2.\n45 min following cell seeding, remove the cell culture medium and wash coverslips with PBS 2x to prevent multiple SCs from adhering to the same pattern. Maintain cells in desired cell culture environment for 48 h before quantification.\nTo create line-patterned cell culture substrates to examine aligned cells, follow step 1.2.1 to 1.2.4 to create stamps for microcontact printing.\n\t\tNOTE: The dimensions of the groove/ridge of the lined patterns on stamp is 50 μm x 50 μm for the cells outlined. The total dimensions of the stamp are 10 mm x 10 mm.\nCut stamps into dimensions containing only desired line patterns.\n\t\tNOTE: When creating stamps in CAD, the unpatterned area of the stamp around the line patterns will correspond to cell adhesive area following microcontact printing. Thus, it is necessary to eliminate unpatterned areas when cutting out the stamp to ensure every SC seeded on the surface follows the patterns.\nFollow step 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 to prepare tunable PDMS surface coating two Petri dishes.\n\t\tNOTE: This will be PDMS covering the Petri dish surface itself and not on a coverslip.",
    "Follow step 1.2.5 to 1.2.10 to perform microcontact printing to print line-patterned cell adhesive areas on one of the PDMS coated Petri dishes.\n\t\tNOTE: The surface area of a 60 mm x 15 mm Petri dish can contain line-patterned areas from 6 PDMS stamps.\nRemove stamps and fill the Petri dish with 4 mL of 0.2% w/v Pluronic F-127 solution and incubate for 1 h.\nAfter microcontact printing, rinse each side of the PDMS stamps with 70% ethanol 3x and dry with air. Rotate PDMS stamps and follow step 1.2.5 to 1.2.10 to print unpatterned cell adhesive area using the unpatterned side of the stamp on the second Petri dish. Repeat step 1.2.13.\nAspirate F-127 solution from dishes, wash 3x with PBS followed with 1x wash using fresh cell culture medium. Seed SCs on dishes.\n\t\tNOTE: The seeding density for a line-patterned dish is 5,000 cells/cm2 and for an unpatterned dish is 10,000 cells/cm2.\nMaintain SCs at desired conditions for 48 h and follow protocols to prepare SC lysates32.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell seeding density for unpatterned dishes is 2x higher than that for line-patterned dishes, as the line-patterned dish has only half the cell adhesive area of the unpatterned dish.\n\t\t\nTo prepare lysates, transfer adequate radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer to a 10 mL conical centrifuge tube. Dilute protease and phosphatase inhibitor (100x) at a ratio of 1:100 in RIPA buffer, mix well by pipetting.\nWash cells with ice cold PBS (1x) for 2 min, add 80 µL of the solution prepared from step 1.2.23.1 onto each cell adhesive area (the area that contacted with PDMS stamps and adsorbed protein) within petri dishes. Incubate cells with the solution on an ice block for 15 min.",
    "NOTE: The solution will only stay on cell adhesive area due to the hydrophobicity of Pluronic F-127 adsorption elsewhere. This feature enables a successful and sufficient protein extraction for line patterned SCs.\nScrape SCs with a cell scraper for 5 min. Collect lysate into a labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nMicrocentrifuge lysate at 12, 000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. Collect supernatant with a 1,000 µL pipette and transfer to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Store cell lysate at -20 °C.\nSubstrate characterization\n\tNOTE: To characterize mechanics of the polymer on the coverslip, multiple methods are generally employed including bulk compression testing11,33 or atomic force microscopy testing34. This protocol will outline bulk compression testing.\n\t\nPour the PDMS precursor of the desired mixing ratio (step 1.1) into a 30 mm Petri dish, ensure the thickness of the PDMS layer within the Petri dish is at least 20 mm.\nRemove the Petri dish with solidified PDMS from 60 °C oven after 1 h and allow to cool at room temperature. Cut polymer into 10 mm x 10 mm squares. Measure the thickness of PDMS using calipers.\nPlace PDMS on stage of the compression force measuring machine. Plug in compression force sensor (model: 112C) to sensor port and fix the sensor to the axis of the test machine.\nAdjust the height of the sensor to approximately 0.5 cm above the PDMS stamp using “jog” control on front panel of instrument.\nOpen the associated software using “Test Setup” window, select “Servo profile”, and open the “Segment” window. In the “Segment” window, input desired “Control Rate” and “End Amount” for the test.\n\t\tNOTE: Control rate determines the rate at which the sensor travels down towards the PDMS. End amount determines the total distance the sensor travels.",
    "Use the “Z” button located on control panel of the software to reset all measurements at this point.\nMove the sensor down to lightly contact PDMS until 1-2 newtons (N) are loaded. The loading and the distance that the sensor travels will be displayed in the software.\nAfter utilizing the “Z” button, run measurement using “Play”, and save the file recording force and distance.\nRepeat steps 1.3.3 to 1.3.8 for each experimental condition of PDMS.\nOpen the file and use the following formula to calculate the Young’s modulus (E) of PDMS for each ratio. (F = compression force, A = area of PDMS stamp, ∆L = traveling distance of sensor, and L0 = original thickness of the PDMS stamp).imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61496/61496equ01.jpg\n2. Quantification of cellular properties on tunable substrates\nProliferation assay\nSeed SCs on substrates prepared from step 1.1.9 at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 in a 6-well plate. Allow SCs to incubate for 48 h in standard cell culture conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2).\nDilute 12 µL of 10 mM Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) stock solution into 12 mL of 37 °C cell culture medium, mix well with pipette to make 10 µM BrdU labeling solution.\nRemove the cell culture medium and wash SCs 2x with PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of BrdU labeling solution into each well and incubate SCs for 2 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The incubation time of BrdU labeling solution depends on the specific cell proliferation rate. The RT4-D6P2T SC line has a high proliferation rate so 2 h of incubation time was used.\nRemove BrdU labeling solution and wash SCs 3x with PBS. Add 1 mL of 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS to each well and incubate at room temperature for 15 min for cell fixation.",
    "CAUTION: Formaldehyde is a human carcinogen; therefore, carry out all work inside a chemical fume hood with appropriate protection.\n\t\tNOTE: When washing with PBS, there is no cell culture medium in the well, and thus the PDMS surface may be hydrophobic. Take precautions to not completely dry the surface of the substrate to prevent cell damage.\nAspirate formaldehyde solution and wash 3x with PBS (3 min each). Remove PBS and add 1 mL of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS to each well to permeabilize cell membrane. Incubate SCs with Triton X-100 solution for 20 min at room temperature.\nRemove Triton X-100 solution and wash SCs 3x with PBS (3 min each).\nAdd 1 mL of 1 N HCl into each well and incubate on ice for 10 min. Remove 1 N HCl and add 1 mL of 2 N HCl into each well and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. HCl treatment is for DNA hydrolysis.\nMix 182 mL of 0.2 mM Na2HPO4 and 18 mL of 0.1 mM citric acid to produce a phosphate/citric acid buffer for antigen retrieval. Remove 2 N HCl and add 1 mL phosphate/citric acid buffer into each well and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nWash SCs 3x with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Add 2 mL of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS into each well and incubate for 30 min at room temperature to clock nonspecific binding of the antibody.\nDilute BrdU primary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 in 3% BSA solution at a ratio of 1:300 for BrdU staining solution. Incubate SCs with staining solution overnight at room temperature while plate is covered in aluminum foil.",
    "To quantify proliferation, image SCs using the FITC and DAPI channel of a fluorescent microscope to detect BrdU and nuclei, respectively.

    "In the top panel, select “ROI” and select “Draw Rectangular ROI”. Draw a rectangular area containing the nuclear area of a single cell.\n\t\tNOTE: c-Jun expression is concentrated within nuclei35.\nIn top panel of software, select “Binary” and “Define Threshold”, a new window will appear to precisely define c-Jun fluorescent area.\nIn new window, click “Full Image/Use ROI” to switch program from full image model to the ROI model. Use “Intensity” to adjust the lookup table located on the left side of the window for adjustment of size/shape of the highlighted area within the rectangular ROI.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to ensure the size/shape of the highlighted area is identical to the nucleus.\nClick the “OK” button, to get the mean FITC intensity in the window of “Automated Measurement Results” and then click “Store Data”.\nIn the window of “Automated Measurement”, “Delete Object” to remove red highlighted area.
