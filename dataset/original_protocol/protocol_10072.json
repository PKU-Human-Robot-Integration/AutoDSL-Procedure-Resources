    "1. Hydrogel components preparation\nSynthesize the fluorescent protease-degradable peptides as described elsewhere8, utilizing fluorescein as the fluorescent molecule and dabcyl as the quencher. Dissolve the peptide in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mM and store in a -80 °C freezer in small (~30 µL) aliquots to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n\tNOTE: These peptides can also be purchased commercially. This protocol requires a C-terminal cysteine in the peptide sequence to enable covalent incorporation into the hydrogel polymer network.\nPrepare 8 arm 40 kDa poly(ethylene glycol) amine (PEG)-norbornene (NB) as described17. Verify end group functionalization of greater than 90% using 1H NMR. Dissolve PEG-NB in sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at 25% w/v and store in -80 °C freezer in (~300 µL) aliquots.\n\tNOTE: PEG functionalized with norbornene can also be purchased commercially.\nSynthesize the photo-initiator lithium phenyl 2,4,6 trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) as described elsewhere18. Dissolve LAP in sterile water to a concentration of 68 mM and store in a -80 °C freezer in (~300 µL) aliquots.\n\tNOTE: As an alternative, Irgacure (2-Hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone) can be used as the photo-initiator. LAP and Irgacure can be purchased commercially.\nDissolve the MMP-degradable peptide crosslinker (KCGPQG↓IWGQCK) and the cell adhesion peptide (CRGDS) in sterile water to a concentration of 200 mM and 100 mM respectively, and store them in a -80 °C freezer in (~300 µL and ~30 µL) aliquots, respectively.\n2. Assay media preparation\nPrepare the heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS) for the MMP assay:\n\tNOTE: Proteases in FBS can produce a high background signal with the MMP assay; therefore, it is recommended to heat-inactivate and charcoal strip the FBS for the assay media.\n\t\nInactivate 100 mL of FBS by heating for 30 min at 55 °C.",
    "NOTE: 100 mL of FBS was utilized here for aliquoting and storage at -20 °C for future use. Smaller volumes can be used as needed.\nAdd 0.25% w/v of activated charcoal and 0.025% w/v of dextran to a small amount of FBS (approximately 5 mL) and stir until a slurry is formed. Then, add the rest of the FBS and stir for 30 min at 55 °C.\nCentrifuge at 1,962 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Then transfer the supernatant to another vessel.\nRepeat step 2.1.2 but at 37 °C followed by step 2.1.3. Sterilize the supernatant using a 0.45 µm filter and then a 0.2 µm filter.\nPrepare assay media using media supplemented with 1% charcoal stripped FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 U/mL penicillin, 10 µg/mL streptomycin.\n\tNOTE: Media without phenol red is recommended because it has less fluorescence interference. Other additions to the assay media such as insulin, growth factors, etc. may be added as long as the absorbance and fluorescence spectrum peaks do not overlap with the sensor (494 nm/521 nm).\nDilute bacterial collagenase enzyme type I at 10 and 1,000 µg/mL in the assay media as a positive control.\n3. Hydrogel preparation and cell encapsulation\nPrepare the hydrogel precursor solution.\n\t\nAdd the reagents to a 1.5 mL tube in the following order, vortexing after addition of each component: 20 mM 8 arm 40 kDa PEG-NB, 12.75 mM crosslinker MMP-degradable peptide, 17.8 mM NaOH, 1 mM CRGDS, 2 mM LAP, and 0.25 mM fluorogenic MMP-degradable peptide.",
    "NOTE: Table 1 shows hydrogel precursor solution contents, stock concentrations, working concentrations, volume calculation formulas and the required volumes needed to make 120 µL of hydrogel precursor solution, which is sufficient to conduct an experiment with 10 hydrogels. To account for loss of the hydrogel solution due to pipetting, increase the total volume by 20%. The commercial peptides are often supplied in an acidic hydrogen chloride solution; therefore, NaOH is added to achieve a final pH of 7. pH of the final solution should be confirmed by the user.\nDivide the hydrogel precursor solution into multiple 1.5 mL tubes, one tube per condition being tested.\n\t\tNOTE: Several control conditions in which hydrogels are prepared without the addition of cells are suggested. For a negative control, to account for non-specific degradation of the fluorogenic sensor, one hydrogel condition can be incubated with the vehicle control or the experimental media alone if there are no treatment conditions. For a positive control and for calibration between experiments, hydrogels can be incubated with a protease known to cleave the fluorogenic sensor. For example, two concentrations of bacterial collagenase were used here.\nEncapsulate cells in hydrogels.\n\t\nPrepare a single cell suspension as appropriate for the cell type being used. For example, wash a 10 cm dish of A375 melanoma cells with 10 mL of PBS. Trypsinize cells using 0.05% trypsin and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 min. Count cells with a hemocytometer to determine total cell number.",
    "Centrifuge the cell solution at 314 x g for 3 min, aspirate culture media, then re-suspend cells in PBS at approximately three times the highest required seeding density for the experiment. For example, a cell suspension with a density of 21 x 106 cells was used here to achieve a final encapsulated density of 7 x 106 cells/mL.\nCount the cells again to ensure an accurate cell concentration.\nAdd suspended cells and PBS to each tube of hydrogel precursor solution according to the required seeding density (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 x 106 cells/mL in this example). Add PBS to conditions with no cells in lieu of suspended cells.\n\t\tNOTE: All conditions should have the same final hydrogel precursor solution volume to ensure the ratio between the hydrogel components and PBS is constant. Do not vortex tubes that have cells in them, pipette up and down vigorously without creating bubbles in order to mix the precursor solution.\nDispense 10 µL of the hydrogel precursor solution into a sterile black round bottom 96-well plate, ensuring that the tip is centered in the middle of the each well while dispensing.\nPolymerize hydrogel precursor solution by exposing the plate to ultra violet (UV) light at 4 mW/cm2 for 3 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The UV lamp (UVL-56 Handheld UV Lamp, UVP, Upland, CA) produces UV-A light at a long UV wavelength (365 nm), which does not affect cellular viability.\nAdd 150 µL of assay media to all wells except for the positive control conditions without encapsulated cells. To the positive controls, add 150 µL of collagenase enzyme solution.\nAdd 150 µL of PBS to the outer wells of the plate to reduce evaporation during incubation.\n4. MMP and metabolic activity measurement",
    "Measure fluorescence immediately post-encapsulation to establish a baseline fluorescence measurement and ensure uniformity in hydrogel polymerization. Read the plate using a fluorescence microplate reader utilizing an opaque 96-well plate protocol with an area scan setting at 494 nm/521 nm (excitation/emission). This will be the 0 h read.\nIncubate plate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 18 h.\nAdd metabolic activity reagent (resazurin) at 1:10 (v/v) for each well.\nIncubate plate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for an additional 6 h.\n\tNOTE: This incubation time may vary depending on cell type.\nMeasure fluorescence at 24 h post-encapsulation. Read the plate using a fluorescence microplate reader utilizing an opaque 96-well plate protocol with an area scan setting at 494 nm/521 nm (excitation/emission) for MMP activity and 560 nm/590 nm (excitation/emission) for metabolic activity.\nSubscription Required.
