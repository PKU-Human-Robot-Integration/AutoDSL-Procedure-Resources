    "Chick Embryo Extract Preparation Spread out bench coat and/or diapers to contain the mess.Fill three 15 cm Petri dishes with ice-cold HBSS and put the dishes on ice.Stab a hole into each chick egg using the pointed end of a pair of scissors, and then cut a window out of each eggshell.Remove the embryo and place it in 15 cm Petri dish with ice-cold HBSS.Decapitate embryo using sterile scissors, leaving as much of the neck as possible.Rinse embryos two times in another two 15 cm Petri dishes with ice-cold HBSS to remove blood. Refresh HBSS as necessary.Store embryos in a sterile beaker with HBSS on ice until all embryos have been collected.Transfer the embryos (no HBSS) into a 50 mL syringe (no needle) and macerate embryos by pushing through the 50 mL syringe into an ice-cold, sterile graduated cylinder.Add an equal volume of ice-cold HBSS, transfer to another sterile beaker with a stir bar, cover with aluminum foil, and stir gently at 4 °C for 1 h.Transfer 45 mL to sterile 50 mL centrifuge tubes and spin at 4 °C for 1 h at 10,000 rpm.Collect supernatant (Chick Embryo Extract) and store in aliquots at -80 °C. Five dozen eggs make approximately 200–250 mL final Chick Embryo Extract.Maintenance of Human iPSCs (hiPSCs) Maintain the hiPSCs in matrigel-coated 6-well plate in StemMACS iPS-Brew X medium at 5% CO2/37 °C /5% CO2 incubator and change the medium every day.Passage of hiPSCCheck the hiPSCs confluence. When the hiPSCs grow to 95% confluence, it is time to passage the cells. We usually passage the cells every four to five days.6-well plate matrigel coating: aliquot 250 μL of matrigel per tube and store at -80 °C. When coating plates, thaw aliquoted matrigel on ice and then dilute matrigel with 25 mL of cold DMEM/F12 (1:100).",
    "Add 1mL of diluted matrigel to each well of a 6-well plate and keep the plate in the incubator for more than 30 min before use; and then aspirate the matrigel and add 2 mL of StemMACS iPS-Brew XF supplemented with 10 μM of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.Aspirate the medium supernatant and wash the cells with 2 mL of DMEM/F12.Add 1 mL of StemMACS passaging solution XF per well and incubate the plate in the incubator until the cells detach from the plate. It takes approximately 1.5–2 min for the cells at colony edges to start to lift off.Aspirate the StemMACS passaging solution XF and add 3 mL of StemMACS iPS-Brew XF supplemented with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.Gently detach the colonies using a cell lifter and gently pipette up and down two to three times (1 mL pipette setting 900 μL) to break up the colonies into smaller cell clusters.Transfer the cell clusters into a fresh coated 6-well plate with a splitting ratio between 1:5 and 1:20. Transfer the plate into the incubator and gently shake the plate to evenly distribute the cell clusters.After 48 h, replace medium with fresh StemMACS iPS-Brew XF without ROCK inhibitor and continue with daily medium changes.hiPSC Myogenic Differentiation A commercial skeletal muscle differentiation kit, including SKM01 Skeletal Muscle Induction Medium, SKM02 Myoblast Medium, and SKM03 Myotube Medium, was selected for hiPSCs myogenic differentiation. The myogenic differentiation was completed based on the kit instructions with modifications.hiPSCs myogenic progenitor cell induction (S1 cells)Dissociate hiPSCs into single cells after the cells have reached 60%–80% confluence, aspirate the medium, and wash the cells with DMEM/F12. Add 1 mL of TrypLE:0.5 mM EDTA (3:1) per well and incubate in a 37 °C incubator for approximately 5 min.",
    "Neutralize the enzymatic reaction by adding 2 mL of HMP medium and collect the cells in a 15 mL PP centrifuge tube, and then centrifuge the cells at 168 × g for 3–5 min.Aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend cells in 1 mL of warm Skeletal Muscle Induction Medium (SKM01).Count the number of viable cells.Plate 25,000 cells onto collagen I-coated 6-well plate with the density of 2,500 cells/cm2 in SKM01 medium.Place the cells in 5% O2/5% CO2/37 °C incubator and gently shake the plate to evenly distribute the cell clusters.Change fresh SKM01 medium every other day.Passage the cells at day 6Aspirate the medium and wash with PBS.Add 1 mL of TrypLE per well and incubate the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 3–5 min until all of the cells detach from the plate.Neutralize the enzymatic reaction by adding 2 mL of HMP medium and collect the cells in a 15 mL PP centrifuge tube, and then centrifuge the cells at 168 × g for 3–5 min.Aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend cells in 1 mL of warm Skeletal Muscle Induction Medium (SKM01).Replate the cells onto collagen I-coated 6-well plate with a ratio of 1:4 in SKM01 medium.Change SKM01 medium every other day until day 10 during maintenance of cultures in 5% O2/5% CO2/37 °C incubator.Commitment of S1 cells to myogenic progenitors (S2 cells)After 10 days in SKM01 Skeletal Muscle Induction Medium, dissociate S1 cells and replate into Skeletal Myoblast Medium (SKM02) for S2 myogenic progenitor induction.Aspirate the medium and wash with PBS.Add 1 mL of TrypLE per well and incubate the plate at 37 °C incubator for 5 min until all of the cells detach from the plate.",

The remaining cells can be frozen in aliquots for future use (see note 1 “S1 cell cryopreservation and thawing” for more detail).Aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend cells in 1 mL of warm SKM02 medium.Replate the resuspended cells to collagen I-coated 6-well plate (Corning, catalog number: 356400) and add another 1 mL of SKM02 medium.Place the cells in 5% O2/5% CO2/37 °C incubator and gently shake the plate to evenly distribute the cell clusters.Change fresh SKM02 medium every other day until the cells reach confluence. It usually takes 7–8 days.Skeletal Muscle DifferentiationAfter 7–8 days in SKM02 medium, aspirate the SKM02 medium and add 2 mL of warm SKM03 Myotube Medium.Move the plate to 5% CO2/37 °C incubator and change SKM03 medium every other day until day 7 (Figure 1A).Reserve Cell Isolation and iMyoblast Expansion After 7 days in SKM03 medium, dissociate S3 cells and replate directly onto gelatin-coated dishes in HMP medium to stimulate growth of iMyoblasts and isolate iMyoblast lines. HMP medium includes chick embryo extract enriched with FGF and growth factors (Seed et al., 1988) required to activate reserve cells and then maintain iMyoblast growth and expansion. Representative images of proliferating S3 iMyocytes and iMyoblasts are shown in Figure 1.Aspirate the medium and wash with PBS.Add 0.",
    "5–1 mL of TrypLE per well and incubate the plate in a 37 °C incubator. Approximately 5 min later, most of the cells detach from the plate, and there are still some single cells attached to the plate.Neutralize the enzymatic reaction by adding 2 mL of HMP medium and gently detach the cells using a cell lifter.Collect the cells into a 15 mL PP centrifuge tube, and then centrifuge the cells at 168 × g for 3–5 min.Aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend cells in 5 mL of warm HMP medium.Replate 0.5–1 mL of cell suspension onto 0.1% gelatin-coated 10 cm dishes in 10 mL of HMP medium.Culture plates in 5% CO2/37 °C incubator after gently shaking plates to evenly distribute the cells.The next day iMyoblasts should attach to the plates; change fresh HMP medium daily.After 4–6 days in HMP medium, dissociate the cells from plate for expansion.Aspirate the medium and wash with PBS.Add 1.5 mL of TrypLE per 10 cm dish and incubate the plate at 37 °C for approximately 5 min until all of the cells detach from the plates.Neutralize the enzymatic reaction by adding 2 mL of HMP medium.Collect the cells into a 15 mL PP centrifuge tube, and then centrifuge the cells at 168 × g for 3–5 min.Aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend cells in 2 mL of warm HMP medium.Count the number of viable cells.Plate 150,000–200,000 (0.15–0.2 M) cells onto 0.1% gelatin-coated 10 cm dishes in HMP medium.Move the plate into 5% CO2/37 °C incubator and shake the plate gently to evenly distribute the cell clusters.Change fresh HMP medium daily until day 4.Passage the cells again to expand the reserve cells.After initial S3 cell dissociation and replating, cultures include iMyoblasts and residual fiber-like cells.",
    "These fiber-like cells do not survive several passages, providing enriched cultures of iMyoblasts (Figure 1B) that can either be further expanded or frozen in aliquots for future use.Aspirate the medium and wash with PBS.Add 1.5 mL of TrypLE per 10 cm dish and incubate the plate at 37 °C for approximately 5 min until all the cells detach from the plates.Neutralize the enzymatic reaction by adding 2 mL of HMP medium.Collect the cells into a 15 mL PP centrifuge tube, and then centrifuge the cells at 168 × g for 3–5 min.Aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend cells in 2 mL of warm HMP medium.Count the number of viable cells.Add an equal volume of 2xHMP freeze medium and mix well.Aliquot to cryovials according to 1 mL per cryovial.Transfer the cryovials to freezing container and put the freezing container into a -80 °C freezer.Transfer the cryovials to a liquid nitrogen tank for long time storage the next day.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4500/bioprotoc-12-17-4500-g001.jpgFigure 1.
