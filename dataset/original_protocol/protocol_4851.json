    "Human tumor cells are cultured in fresh RPMI medium at a cell density ≥ 0.5-0.7 x 106 cells/ml in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For each experiment are required 0.5 x 106 tumor cells.Wash adherent cells with PBS (5 ml) and detach cells by adding 833 μM EDTA (1 ml for T25 flask and 2 ml for T75 flask) for 3-5 min in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Wash cells twice with PBS (2 x 5 ml in 15 ml tube) by centrifugation at 468 x g for 7 min and re-suspend them in cold FACS buffer.Count total viable cell number with Trypan-blue exclusion method.Seed cells in round-bottom 96 well plates at a cell density of 1 x 106 cells/well. Prepare 1 well for the control (without KIR-Fc fusion-proteins) and 1 well for each fusion protein to be tested.Spin cells at 832 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and add 100 µl/well of cold FACS buffer containing single KIR-Fc fusion proteins (KIR2DL1-Fc, KIR2DL3-Fc, and KIR3DL1-Fc) diluted 1:5 and 100 μl of cold FACS buffer with none in control cells.Incubate for 1 h at 4 °C.Wash cells with 150 µl of cold FACS buffer and centrifuge at 832 x g at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and re-suspend cells in 50 µl of cold FACS buffer containing Goat anti-Human secondary antibody, RPE conjugate antibody (diluted 1:100) and mix carefully avoiding formation of bubbles.Incubate for 25 min on ice in the dark.Wash cells with 150 µl of cold FACS buffer and centrifuge at 832 x g at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and re-suspended cells in 150 µl of cold FACS buffer in FACS tubes and perform flow cytometric analysis.",
    "Viable human single cells will be selected by gating in forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot and the binding of KIR-Fc fusion proteins will be evaluated by mean fluorescence intensity (Figure 1).Acquire data using DIVA software and analyse using FlowJo software.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160918/20160918181019_8249.jpgFigure 1.
