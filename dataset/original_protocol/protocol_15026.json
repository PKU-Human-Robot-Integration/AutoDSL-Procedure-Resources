    "1. Animal Preparation\nObtain mice that are older than 8 weeks and more than 20 g (smaller mice can be intubated by an expert).\nAnesthesia\n\t\nInject mice with  20 mg/kg, each, of ketamine and xylazine intraperitoneally as a preanesthetic. (This dose is insufficient to fully anesthetize the mouse, but facilitates the safe transfer, after intubation, to mechanical ventilation.) However, adjustment of the dosages may be necessary according to the anesthetic response in consultation with the institutional veterinarian.)\nInduce anesthesia in mice with 3.5% isoflurane/oxygen in an induction chamber for 90-120 sec.\nObserve the respiratory rate carefully. It should slow progressively to not less than 45 bpm.\n2. Preparation for Intubation\nRemove the mouse from the induction chamber and scruff tightly.\nUse cushioned fine forceps to gently extend the tongue from the mouth.\nMaintain extension of the tongue by holding the tongue between two fingers and applying gentle force.\nPull the mouse up on the speculum of the otoscope with a vertical motion.\nLook through the ocular of the otoscope while scruffing tightly and pull the mouse up gently by the tongue and the scruff.\nLook carefully for the vocal cords. They should be easily visible at this time. The laryngis aditus (the structure of the laryngeal opening) should look relatively white. There should be movement of the cords with each breath. If the cords are not moving or are poorly visualized, rotate the animal slightly and gently hyperextend the neck.\nWith the dominant hand, hold the 20 G, 1 in catheter, with a 1 cm length of the PE10 tubing extending through the tip of the catheter, like a pencil and insert it into the side of the speculum. The PE tubing serves as a stylet or bougie.",
    "Direct the PE10 tubing (stylet) through the vocal cords and advance the 20 G catheter (endotracheal tube) over the PE tubing until the hub is at the level of the lower incisor. Remove this stylet quickly.\nGently take the animal off of the speculum and verify the tube location by placing the animal on a mechanical ventilator with continuous 2% isoflurane to maintain general anesthesia throughout the experiment. Visualize expired air (bubbles) going through a PEEP trap to confirm intubation. Although esophageal intubation may result in a few bubbles, it will not be as pronounced or as consistent with endotracheal intubation. Also, observe an airway pressure tracing for negative deflections (Figure 1). These confirm proper placement of the tube. Alternatively, place a small amount of water into IV tubing and connect it to the ET tube. Verifying movement to and from the mouse with respiration2. In the case of esophageal intubation, the pressure tracing will reveal significantly higher pressures and no negative deflections. Although end-tidal CO2 would be helpful, technically this would be very difficult given the small tidal volumes (~200 µl) and the equipment to do this would be very expensive. The simple techniques described are fully sufficient and much less expensive. If isoflurane anesthesia is not available, all procedures can be conducted using ketamine 80-120 mg/kg in conjunction with xylazine 10-20 mg/kg for general anesthesia.   \n3. Alternative Technique: Direct Laryngoscopy with the Otoscope Technique is Used Readily for Other Purposes, Mainly for Direct Instillation of Study Substances into the Lung.\nInduce anesthesia in the animals with isoflurane alone for this procedure at 3.5% for 90-120 sec in the induction chamber.\nScruff the animal tightly at the base of the skull and extend the tongue gently with fine forceps.",
    "Holding the tongue gently, pull the animal straight up on the speculum (unmodified) until the animal cannot be pulled up further.\nThe vocal cords can be visualized most often by this technique alone, but rotate the animal and hyper-extended the neck to bring them into full view.\nAdvance a gel-loading pipette containing the instillate to the glottis and instill the fluid. Because the speculum makes a seal with the hypopharynx the mouse will aspirate any residual liquid that does not go through the cords. This is easily verified by the rhonchorous sounds the mouse now makes when breathing until the fluid is distributed fully in the lungs.\nAlternatively, connect PE10 tubing to a 0.5 ml syringe containing 50 µl of fluid with an air bolus behind the liquid. Advance the PE tubing carefully through the vocal cords for 0.5 cm and discharge the contents into the airway slowly. However, occasional trauma to the lower airway occurs using this technique without better delivery of the sample.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
