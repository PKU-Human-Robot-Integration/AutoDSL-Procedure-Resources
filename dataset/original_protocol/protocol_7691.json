    "Culture the mycobacterial cells aerobically in 7H9 broth at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) till mid- log phase (OD600 of 0.3). Filter the required volume of PBS (Component C) through a 0.22 μm pore size membrane, preparing enough for culture dilution and 500 μl per test.Allow the 3 mM DiOC2 (Novo et al., 2000) and 500 μM CCCP solutions (Components A and B) to come to room temperature before use.Wash the cells with 1 ml filtered PBS twice. Spin down at a speed of 4,000 rpm for 5 min for each wash.Dilute the mycobacterial culture to approximately 1 x 106 cells per ml in filtered PBS. Aliquot 500 μl of the bacterial suspension into a flow cytometry tube for each staining experiment to be performed. Prepare two additional tubes for a depolarized control and an unstained control.Add 25 μl of 500 μM CCCP (Component B) to the depolarized control sample and mix.Add 3 μl of 3 mM DiOC2 Component A) to each flow cytometry tube and mix (do not add stain to the unstained control sample). Incubate samples at room temperature for 30 min. Stained samples can be analyzed after 5 min, but signal intensity continues to increase until about 30 min.Stained bacteria can be assayed in a flow cytometer equipped with a laser emitting at 488 nm. Fluorescence is collected in the green and red channels; filters used for detecting fluorescein and the Texas Red dye, respectively, are generally suitable. The forward scatter, side scatter, and fluorescence should be collected with logarithmic signal amplification.Instrument adjustments are especially critical for detecting relatively small particles such as bacteria. Use the unstained control sample to locate bacterial populations in the forward and side scatter channels. Use the side scatter as the parameter for setting the acquisition trigger.",
    "After adjusting the flow cytometer as described above, apply the depolarized control sample. Gate on bacteria using forward versus side scatter and adjust fluorescence photomultiplier tube voltages such that the green and red MFI values are approximately equal. Do not set compensation.While the relative amount of red and green fluorescence intensity will vary with cell size and aggregation, the ratio of red to green fluorescence intensity can be used as a size-independent indicator of membrane potential. The data can also be processed by gating on bacteria using forward versus side scatter, and analyze gated populations with a dot plot of red versus green fluorescence reporting MFI values as linear values, not as channels.On a ratiometric histogram, set markers around the peaks of interest and record the mean ratio values (Figure 1). For a dot plot of red versus green fluorescence, set regions around the populations of interest and record red and green MFI values for each. To evaluate the data, divide the red population MFI by the green population MFI.In the flow cytometer, bacteria are identified solely on the basis of their size and stain ability.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130527/20130527081135_8958.jpgFigure 1. Detection of membrane potential in mycobacteria. Red/green ratios were calculated using population mean fluorescence intensities for mycobacteria, incubated with 3 μM DiOC2 for 30 min in either the presence or absence of 25 μM CCCP."
