    "Swarming bacteria culturePrepare the LB broth, Solarbio LB agar and soft LB agar culture solution according to the Recipes. First, add weighed reagents into 300 ml Milli-Q H2O until completely dissolved. After that, put the dissolved culture solution into the autoclave under 121 °C, 20 min. Next put them in the microwave until boiling. Finally place them in the 4 °C refrigerator for later use.Note: While putting the glass bottles into the autoclave, for safety make sure the caps are not too tight. In addition, the prepared culture medium has a shelf-life even if stored in the refrigerator. Stop use it if you find that it cannot maintain the quality as before. Prepare the soft agar plates for bacterial swarming. First boil the soft LB agar solution to 100 °C in the microwave oven. After cooling down to 60 °C, add 3 ml solution to the 60 mm Petri dishes. Continue to cool down in the ultra-clean workbench until the liquid solidifies into the gel state.Prepare the solid agar plates with Solarbio LB agar solution for bacterial strain activation and transmission. The procedures are like Step A2.Note: The flatness, hardness as well as the wetness of the agar surface have great influences on the growth and the movements of bacterial colonies. In addition, the thickness of the agar plates is essential for the bacteria culture. For the LB solid agar plates, the thickness is usually 2/3 height of the Petri dishes. For the soft agar plates, we need ensure that the thickness of soft agar plates fits the working distance of the objectives. In addition, the degree of transparency of agar is an important factor affecting microscopic observation. To revive the frozen bacteria strains, dissolve the purchased B.",
    "subtilis 3610 powder which were sealed in a vacuum glass vial in the proper amount of LB broth solution and put it into the bacterial culture shaker under 37 °C, 200 rpm overnight. Then incubate the next generation on the Solarbio LB agar with streaking method using transfer needles.To obtain the swarming bacterial colony, 5 µl of the bacteria overnight culture is inoculated at the center of the soft agar plates. Then the plates are placed in the laminar flow bench air drying for 5-8 min. After that, store it in the incubator at 30 °C and at least 90 %rh humidity for about 2-4 h.Note: Make sure the humidity in the incubator are more than 90 %rh. Because the bacterial colony would not exhibit collective swarming behavior in the environment without enough humidity. Preparation of AuNR solutionsTo examine uniformity of the size and shapes of the particles, measure the UV-Vis spectrum of the SH-PEG AuNRs to characterize the positions of plasmonic resonance absorption peaks and acquire the transmission electron microscope images of the SH-PEG AuNRs. There exist two peaks in the UV spectrum. One is located around 650 nm and the other is around 522 nm. Under electron microscopy, AuNRs should be rod-shaped and uniform in size, with an average size of 40 × 84 nm.Note: To prepare AuNRs samples for TEM examination, pipette 5 μl of undiluted AuNRs (145.36 μg/ml) and drop it on the copper grid. Evaporate naturally at room temperature. Repeat 2 or 3 times. Dilute the SH-PEG AuNR solutions (145.36 μg/ml) for 20-fold with Milli-Q H2O.Micro-spraying techniquePut the AuNRs tracers into the upper surface of swarming bacteria fluid. First add 50 µl of the diluted AuNRs solution on the high-frequency vibrating atomizer.",
    "Spray the atomized AuNRs aerosol out in a direction parallel to the surface of the swarming colony.Note: The spraying direction and the distance to the surface of the colony should be adjusted to avoid the damages to the collective moving bacteria. In general, the automizer are placed about 8 cm above the Petri dish. The direction of the spraying is preferably parallel to the colony surface or slightly inclined so that the aerosol could fall naturally onto the surface of the colony. Avoid spraying vertically to the colony. ImagingExamine the moving states of the bacterial colony using phase contrast microscope under 20x or 40x objectives.The area of the swarming bacterial colony will continuously expand with the number of bacteria increasing gradually. In the lag phase, the bacteria cells remain stationary. After a lag time of about 2 h, we can observe that the bacteria near the edge of the colony begin to swarm actively in swirls and jets. Once the bacteria start swarming, immediately take the specimen to the inverted microscope (Figure 2A).Note: Special imaging dishes are not needed. Tune the positions of the dark-field condenser and the working distance of the 20x objectives (Figure 2B) until the red color AuNRs and brown color bacteria could be imaged simultaneously.Capture the images for 40 s with a frame rate of 60 fps using  DP74  color CMOS camera (Figure 2C) in RGB channel under dark-field mode. Three parallel experiments are required.Note: The environmental temperature and humidity (30 °C, 90 %rh) should be maintained just as in the incubator during the process of imaging. In addition, the intensity of light source of the microscope should not be too high to avoid the photodamages to the specimens. Damage to the cells would cease the collective movements of bacteria. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3812/bioprotoc-10-21-3812-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "A. The inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope. The specimens are placed under a dark-field air condenser. B. 20x long working distance objective. C. The Olympus  DP74  color camera.Localize the z-axis position of AuNRsMeasure the distance between the bacteria layer and the AuNRs layer under the cross-polarization mode of the upright metallographic microscope.Capture the time-lapsed images of the focal plane of the bacteria layer and the AuNRs layer respectively. Record their z-axis positions.Record the 3D images of optical slicing starting from the bacteria layer to the AuNRs layer through tuning the piezo-Z positioning stage. The z-axis resolution of the piezo-Z positioning stage is 0.01 µm. The z-increment steps typically chosen are about 0.2 µm.Repeat the experiments in at least three different colonies.Note: More elaborate procedures could be found in the section of “transparent methods”-3. Cross polarization microscopy for distance measurements between the AuNRs layer and the bacteria layer” of original paper. Other control experimentsTo obtain the motions of 90 and 120 nm gold nanospheres on the upper fluid of swarming bacteria, use the same tracing and imaging method as AuNRs particles.To obtain the motions of PS spheres on the upper fluid of swarming bacteria, use the same tracing and imaging method as AuNRs particles.To obtain the motions of AuNRs in the suspensions which are filtered out of bacteria, first filter the cells from the cultured bacteria suspensions with a 0.22 μm diameter syringe filter. Then pipette the 50-fold diluted AuNRs solution to the single concave glass slide. After covering the cover slides, take the specimen to the upright dark-field microscope equipped with 20x Nikon objectives. Then acquire the images with  DP74  color CMOS camera.",
    "To obtain the motions of AuNRs in the non-swarming bacterial colony without swarming, irradiate the swarming bacterial colony with a UV lamp for at least 10 h until the collective motions completely stops. Then spray the AuNRs aerosols as the procedures described in Procedure C. Observe the colony under Nikon LV 100D microscope in the reflective dark-field mode."
