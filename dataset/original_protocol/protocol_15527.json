    "The \"CBLE Performance Estimation\" GUI was applied to two datasets: \"BrainInvaders\" dataset and Michigan dataset. For the \"BrainInvaders\" dataset, the data collection was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Grenoble Alpes20. Michigan data were collected under the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approval19. Data were analyzed under Kansas State University exempt protocol 7516. If collecting new data, follow the user's IRB-approved process for collecting informed consent. Here, the proposed protocol is evaluated using offline analysis of previously-recorded, de-identified data and therefore did not require additional informed consent.\nThe graphical user interface (GUI) included in this article is proficient in managing two distinct dataset formats. The first format is associated with the BCI2000 software, while the second format is referred to as the \"BrainInvaders\" dataset. In order to utilize the \"Brain Invaders\" format, data must be pre-processed as described in step 1 of the protocol section. However, when dealing with the \"BCI2000\" dataset format, step 1 can be omitted.\n1. Data preparation\nBrainInvaders only: Generate the input data file in \".mat\" file format that can be used with the \"CBLE performance Estimation\" graphical user interface (GUI). For a sample script, refer to Supplementary Coding File 2.\n\tNOTE: Each data file consists of a two-dimensional matrix comprised of rows that represent observations recorded at distinct time samples. The matrix columns numbered 2 to 17 are recordings derived from 16 EEG electrodes. The first column of the matrix denotes the timestamp of each observation, while column 18 encompasses information related to experimental events. In column 19, there are mostly zeros, but when a non-Target (or Target) flash starts, the numbers change to one (or two) at that specific time. A detailed description may be found in the reference20.\n2. Downloading and installing the GUI package",
    "Download and install the \"CBLE Performance Estimation\" GUI.\n3. Storing the dataset in a subfolder of the GUI location\nEnsure that the dataset folder remains within the same directory as the GUI.\nFor instance, create a new folder and place the \"CBLE Performance Estimation\" GUI inside it. Keep all the datasets in a subfolder within \"CBLE GUI\" named \"Dataset.\"\n4. Opening the installed GUI\nOpen MATLAB (see Table of Materials), change the current directory to the folder where the GUI is placed, click on APPS tab, and select MY APPS.\nUnder the \"MY APPS\" tab, select CBLE Performance Estimation.\n5. Choosing the dataset format\nSelect a dataset format from the dropdown Select dataset format.\n6. Loading the EEG data file\nClick on the Select input folder button to choose the directory where the dataset is located.\nObserve the count of data files present in that selected folder.\n\tNOTE: In the \"Brain Invaders\" format, each participant is represented by a single data file. Therefore, the total number of data files indicates the number of participants in the study. However, this is not the case for the \"BCI2000\" format, as each participant may have multiple train and test files.\n7. Setting the parameters\nType the number of participants that the user intends to use for the estimation process in the \"No. of participants\" text box.\nBrainInvaders only: Specify the sampling rate of the dataset.\n\tNOTE: BCI2000 files include the sample rate.\nChoose a decimation value to downsample the dataset to approximately 20 Hz in order to improve classification performance21. For example, if the sampling frequency is 256 Hz, then select a decimation value of 13.\nSpecify the time window for the classification in milliseconds.",
    "NOTE: The recommended initial window size is specified, allowing the starting point to vary from 0 to 100 ms and the ending point from 700 to 800 ms. However, it is important to avoid making the window size excessively large to prevent overlapping with another P300 event.\nDefine the shift window for CBLE in milliseconds.\n\tNOTE: The 'shift window' refers to the expanded time range that the CBLE method searches to find the P3 response.  The classifier will be applied to the epoch starting at the first element of the shift window.  The classifier is then sequentially applied to epochs starting one sample later, until the epoch extends outside the shift window.  Thus, the shift window must be larger than the original window; empirically, values less than 100 ms from each side perform well.  In any case, the margin should be held to less than half the ISI.\nBC2000 only: Enter the length of the subject ID indicated in the dataset files within the \"ID length\" field.\n\tNOTE: The GUI expects the first sub_len characters of the filenames to encode the subject ID.\nBCI2000 only: In the \"Channel ID\" field, indicate either the total number of channels or specify the specific channel numbers to be used for the analysis.\nClick on the Set parameters button to set all the parameters required for the analysis.\n8. BrainInvaders only: Splitting the dataset into training and test set\nSelect a number of targets that represents the size of the training set. The remaining portion of the dataset will be considered as the test dataset.",
    "NOTE: To ensure proper training of the model, it is essential to have a sufficiently large training sample. The recommended minimum training sample size is 20, though this may vary depending on the overall dataset size. If regression errors occur during training sessions, it is advisable to increase the training sample size.\nPress the \"Split the dataset\" button to divide the dataset into the training and test sets.\n\t​NOTE: Each participant will have an equal amount of training data. However, the number of test data may not be equal for all participants due to the possibility of multiple attempts during the task. Consequently, the total number of targets or flashes presented may vary from person to person.\n9. Training a model with the training dataset\nNOTE: Step 9.1 is applicable for \"Brain Invaders\" format, and step 9.2 is applicable for \"BCI2000\" format.\nBrainInvaders only: Click on the Train a model button to apply linear regression on the training dataset using Equation 2 for training a classifier model.\nBCI2000 only: Indicate training and testing filenames along with their data format (.dat) to distinguish the training and testing files from all files. Then, click on the Train a model button to apply linear regression on the training dataset.\n10. Predicting the accuracy of the test set\nClick on Predict accuracy to apply the trained classifier model to the test feature set and predict accuracy using Equation 1.\n11. Getting X-target accuracies\nSelect a maximum target number, X, to consider in the test set.\nBCI2000 only: Select a test file number if the user has multiple test files.\nPress Find X target accuracy.\n12. Calculating vCBLE\nClick on the Find vCBLE button to get the vCBLE for all targets.\n13. Calculating the Root mean square error (RMSE) of BCI accuracy and vCBLE",
    "Click on the Calculate RMSE button to calculate the RMSE between both predictions based on vCBLE with BCI accuracy, and X-target accuracy with BCI accuracy.\n14. Visualizing the analysis results\nClick on the Accuracy vs vCBLE button to observe the relation between total accuracy and total vCBLE for all participants.\nPress on the RMSE of BCI & vCBLE button to show the RMSE curve of BCI accuracy and vCBLE.\n15. Predicting the performance of an individual participant\nTo predict the accuracy of an individual participant, place the subject ID in Sub ID.\n\tNOTE: Here, the dataset of all participants, excluding the test participant, will be used to train a linear regression model. The vCBLE scores of all other participants and their corresponding test accuracies will be utilized as predictors and labels, respectively, for the classifier.\nSelect a target number, n. The prediction will be made based on the accuracy of n-testing characters.\nClick on the Predict button to get the predicted accuracy of the test participant.\nSubscription Required.
