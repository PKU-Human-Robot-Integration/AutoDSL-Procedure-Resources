    "1. Isolating Lipid Droplets from (Fission) Yeast Cells\nIsolation of droplets from the popular model organism budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is almost identical to the following protocol6. Differences in the preparations are noted.\n1. Growing yeast cells\nPrepare the media. Combine 36 g of YE5S powder per liter of dH2O in glass bottles or culture flasks. About 2 L of media will be needed. Autoclave the media at 121 °C for 20 min. Allow the media to cool to room temperature. For S. cerevisiae replace YE5S with YPD.\nPlace 10-20 ml of the cooled YE5S media into a 250 ml culture flask using sterile techniques. Inoculate the media with a small amount of yeast cells from an agar plate using a sterile wooden stick or equivalent. Let the cells grow to the desired optical density at 30 °C. Measure the optical density at a wavelength of 595 nm using a spectrophotometer.\nPlace the remaining media in the 2.8 L flasks. Use no more than 1 L of media per 2.8 L flask to ensure proper mixing during cell growth in the shaking incubator. The final yield of wet cells should be about 10 g to be able to acquire enough lipid droplets for proteomic and lipidomic analysis.\nIntroduce the cells from step 1.2 into the 2.8 L flasks each having 1 L of media that were prepared in step 1.1.\nGrow the cells to the desired density at 30 °C.",
    "Make sure that the cells have lipid droplets. Reserve 1 ml of the cells. Measure the optical density (O.D.) of the sample. Add 0.1 ml of a 100 mM stock of BODIPY 493/503 in ethanol per O.D. of cells to the sample. Place 3 μl of the sample between a glass slide and a glass cover slip. Visualize under a fluorescent microscope with a GFP filter (Figure 1A).\nPellet the cells from step 1.5 at 4 °C at 3,800 x g for 10 min. Work in batches depending on the capacity of the centrifuge tubes.\nPour off the YE5S media and wash the cells with a buffer of EMM + 600 mM sorbitol. Sorbitol provides osmotic support.\nTransfer the cells to a sterile 50 ml centrifuge tube and pellet the cells at 4 °C at 2,000 x g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant. Weigh the wet cells. Resuspend the cells in 2 ml of (EMM + 600 mM sorbitol) buffer per gram of cells.\n2. Converting fission yeast cells into spheroplasts and subsequent lysis\nAdd 5 mg each of 1) yeast lytic enzyme and 2) yeast lysing enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum per gram of wet cells that were weighed in step 1.9. For S. cerevisiae augment these enzymes with the same amount of Zymolyase.\nIncubate the cells at 30 °C under gentle shaking at 100 rpm for 60 min.\nCheck to make sure that the spheroplasts have lipid droplets. By repeating step 1.6 (Figure 1B).\n3. Density gradient centrifugation\nPellet the spheroplasts by centrifugation at 4 °C at 2,000 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant using a plastic transfer pipette.",
    "Gently resuspend the pelleted spheroplasts with ice cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, 600 mM sorbitol, and 200 μM EDTA. Keep in mind that the spheroplasts are very fragile.\nPellet the spheroplasts again using the same settings as in step 3.1. Carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the spheroplasts using a plastic transfer pipette in 12% Ficoll, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 200 μM EDTA at a concentration of 2 ml/g-cells.\nTransfer the resuspended spheroplasts to a glass homogenizer and gently homogenize on ice, 20-30 strokes, with the loose fitting pestle of the glass homogenizer.\nTransfer the lysed spheroplasts to centrifuge tubes and overlay with same volume of 12% Ficoll, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 200 μM EDTA buffer. Choose the number of centrifuge tubes to use so that each tube is about two-thirds full.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C at 100,000 x g for 1.5 hr in an SW28 rotor or equivalent. Allow rotor to coast to a stop (rotor deceleration = 0).\nGently transfer the top floating white layer (Figure 2A), which contains the droplets, to a new centrifuge tube(s) using either a pipettor or a bent Pasteur pipette. Add enough volume of 12% Ficoll, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 200 μM EDTA buffer to the sample so that it fills roughly one-third of the centrifuge tube.\nAdd the equivalent volume of 8% Ficoll, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 200 μM EDTA buffer to the top of the sample(s) in the new centrifuge tube(s). After addition of this buffer the tubes should be about two-thirds full.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C at 100,000 x g for 1 hr in an SW28 rotor or equivalent. Allow rotor to coast to a stop (rotor deceleration = 0).",
    "Gently transfer the top floating white layer (Figure 2B), which will contain the droplets, to a new centrifuge tube(s) using either a pipettor or a bent Pasteur pipette. Add 600 mM sorbitol, 8% Ficoll, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 200 μM EDTA buffer to the sample so that it fills about one-third of the centrifuge tube.\nAdd the equivalent volume of 250 mM sorbitol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 200 μM EDTA buffer to the top of the sample(s) in the new centrifuge tube(s). After addition of this buffer the tubes should be about two-thirds full.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C at 100,000 x g for 1 hr in an SW28 rotor or equivalent. Allow rotor to coast to a stop (rotor deceleration = 0).\nTransfer top white layer (Figure 2C), which should contain only the lipid droplets and bound proteins, to dialysis tubing, and dialyze O/N into 10 mM Tris-HCl and 200 μM EDTA buffer to eliminate the Ficoll.\n2. Isolating Lipid Droplets from Human Placental Villous Cells\nPlacentas were collected from healthy women with singleton pregnancies undergoing elective cesarean section delivery prior to the onset of spontaneous labor at term. Subjects gave written, informed consent for the collection of their placenta. The collection, and subsequent use, of placentas was performed with approval from the University of Tennessee and University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine in Knoxville Institutional Review Board (#8757B and #3338, respectively).\n1. Isolating human placental villous cells\nPart 1 of the protocol is a modification of an earlier published protocol by Petroff et al.26\nPrepare following solutions:\nNaCl (1 L): dissolve 9 g NaCl (M 58.4 g/mol) in dH2O to yield a 1 L solution. Filter sterilize (0.2 μm membrane).",
    "10x Hank’s balanced salt solution (10x HBSS) (1 L): 4 g KCl (M 74.5 g/mol); 0.6 g KH2PO4 (M 136.086 g/mol); 80 g NaCl (M 58.44 g/mol); Na2HPO4 (M 141.96 g/mol); 10 g D-glucose (M 180.16 g/mol). Dissolve each of the constituents in dH2O to yield a 1 L solution. Filter sterilize (0.2 μm membrane).\nEnzyme digestion buffer (0.6 ml): combine 70 ml 10x HBSS with 3.3 ml 7.5% Na Biscarbonate, 17.5 ml 1 M HEPES, and 266.1 ml dH2O; filter sterilize (0.2 μm membrane). Store at 4 °C.\nDNase I: just before use, add 5 ml sterile 0.9% NaCl to a vial of DNase. Keep on ice until use or store at -20 °C.\nPreparing placenta for dissection\n\t\nObtain a human placenta and process as close to the time of delivery as possible. Use a sealed vessel such as a cooler to transport the placenta. Always use caution when handling human biological materials.\nIn the biological safety hood, transfer the placenta to a sterile autoclavable container, and carefully wash blood from placenta and membranes using sterile 0.9% NaCl (saline) solution. Discard bloody saline in the 1 L beaker as liquid biological waste.\nPlace the placenta on a sterile field, with the smooth surface bearing the umbilical cord facing up. With sharp, fine-point scissors and forceps remove fetal membranes and umbilical cord.\nFlip the placenta over so that the maternal surface (rough surface) is facing up. Remove the overlying basal plate tissue, about 3 mm from the surface.\nDissecting the placenta\n\t\nDissect one cotyledon at a time avoiding the chorionic plate. Collect villous tissue into a 250 ml beaker with saline.\nRinse tissue several times in a separate beaker with 0.9% NaCl by swirling with forceps, using the 1 L beaker for liquid waste.",
    "Transfer one cotyledon at a time to a 150 mm Petri dish. Hold with forceps and scrape tissue with razor blade from vessels on Petri dish. Place scraped tissue into separate beaker containing 0.9% NaCl. Repeat for all tissue pieces.\nTransfer small portion of the tissue to the cell dissociation sieve and rinse with 0.9% NaCl extensively until the eluate becomes clear. Repeat for all the tissue.\nAfter rinsing the scraped tissue in the cell dissociation sieve, drain it of excess liquid and weight.\n\t\tAt this point the tissue may be stored O/N in a sterile Erlenmeyer flask at 4 °C in DMEM.\nEnzymatic digestion of the placental tissue\n\t\nPrepare the tissue digestion mixture: 100 ml of prewarmed enzyme dilution buffer, 1 ml DNase I and 20 ml 2.5% 10x trypsin.\nDivide the tissue, transferring 60 g from total collected tissue (usually about 250-300 g) to a 500 ml sterile Erlenmeyer flask.\nAdd the tissue digestion mixture to the Erlenmeyer flask containing the tissue, and incubate at 37 °C in a shaker for 45 min at 150 rpm.\nCollecting the dissociated cells\n\t\nAfter the first 45 min dissociation, set the digestion flask at a tilt until tissue settles.\nCollect the supernatant, taking care not to collect undissociated tissue. Add an equal amount of HBSS to the collected supernatant and transfer into sterile 15 ml centrifuge tubes. For additional portions of undissociated tissue, repeat procedure starting from step 3.2 with the undissociated tissue.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at 4 °C at 1,000 x g for 15 min.\nFor each batch, following centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. The placental villous cells are predominantly in the white portion of the pellet, overlying the red blood cells.",
    "Transfer the villous cells (white portion of the pellet) to a sterile 50 ml conical centrifuge tube and keep on ice.\nAfter collecting the cells from all three digestion stages, filter the suspension using a 100 μm Nylon cell strainer inserted in the top of a sterile 50 ml conical centrifuge tube. If the filtration of the cell suspension slows, lift upward on the filter to draw a vacuum within the tube.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C at 1,000 x g for 10 min. Carefully remove supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\n2. Homogenizing placental villous cells\nBefore starting with the isolation process, prepare 50 ml of Hypotonic Lysis Medium (HLM) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 1 mM EDTA. Add protease inhibitors to HLM just before use and keep the medium on ice.\nIn the biological safety hood, add 4 times the cell pellet volume of ice-cold HLM to the cells. Gently and thoroughly resuspend the cells by pipetting the cells up-and-down using a 10 ml pipette.\nIncubate the suspended cells on ice for 10 min.\nTransfer the cells to the Dounce homogenizer, which should be on ice. Slowly homogenize the cells by applying 20-25 gentle strokes with the loose-fitting pestle of the homogenizer.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 4 °C at 3,000 x g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells, cellular debris and nuclei.\nCollect the supernatant and transfer to a SW28 tube (or alternative that can be centrifuged at 25,000 x g). Centrifuge at 4 °C at 25,000 x g for 20 min to remove the mitochondria.\n3. Isolating lipid droplets by ultracentrifugation",
    "Prepare 50 ml of 100 mM sodium carbonate (M 106 g/mol) buffer (pH 11.5) and 50 ml of 60% sucrose (w/w) solution. Add protease inhibitors to the sodium carbonate buffer just before use and keep on ice.\nCollect the supernatant from step 2.6 into a 50 ml centrifuge tube, adjust to 20% of sucrose and transfer into the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube for an SW28 rotor, or equivalent. Overlay density adjusted supernatant with ~10 ml of ice-cold 100 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 11.5) and 0.5-1 ml of ice-cold HLM to fill the tube.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C at 130,000 x g for 45 min using SW28 swinging bucket rotor. Allow rotor to coast to a stop (rotor deceleration = 0).\nCollect the floating layer, adjust to 10% sucrose and transfer into the bottom of a 13.2 ml ultracentrifuge tube for an SW41Ti rotor, or equivalent. Overlay density adjusted supernatant with about 5 ml of ice-cold 100 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 11.5) and 0.5 ml of ice-cold HLM.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C at 274,000 x g for 60 min using SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor. Allow rotor to coast to a stop (rotor deceleration = 0) to minimize disruption of the lipid droplet layer.\nCarefully collect the top floating layer (Figure 2D) containing lipid droplets with a 1 ml pipette and repeat step 3.4.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C at 274,000 x g for 30 min using SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor. Allow rotor to coast to a stop (rotor deceleration = 0).\nCarefully collect the top white-colored floating layer containing lipid droplets with a bent Pasteur pipette into three 1.5 ml tubes containing 100 μl HLM.\nCharacterizing lipid droplets fraction (Protocols 1 and 2)",
    "The recovery and purity of the lipid droplet fraction can be verified by Western Blot combined with light or electron microscopy. In addition, aliquots after different centrifugation steps can be collected and retained for determining purification efficiency. In Western Blotting, it is more appropriate to compare a volume of the lipid droplet fraction that represents an equivalent of the whole cell lysate than comparing lipid droplets to other membrane fractions on the basis of total protein content24.\nSubscription Required.
