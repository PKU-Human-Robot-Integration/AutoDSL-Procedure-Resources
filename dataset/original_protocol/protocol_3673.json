    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n4T1 tumor inoculation and growth\nTiming: 30 days if end-stage 4T1 tumors (i.e., on day 24 post-cancer inoculation) are utilized\nMouse preparation:\nUse healthy, 9–12-weeks-old female BALB/c mice.\nRemove the fur around and below the right nipple of the 4th mammary gland of each mouse (Eriksson et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) by depilation or shaving, to expose the injection site. Cancer cells can be inoculated on the following day.\nCancer cell inoculation:\nCulture Mus musculus 4T1 mammary gland cancer cells in complete DMEM media in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37°C, under sterile conditions. The cells should not be allowed to become confluent and should be subcultured at 80% confluence. A subcultivation ratio of 1:5 is recommended. After thawing, passage at least twice before injecting the cells in mice.\nRemove the media from cell culture flasks, quickly rinse the cells with PBS and incubate them with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution at 37°C until they detach. Next, add fresh culture medium and collect the cells into 50 mL falcons. Spin down for 5 min at 300 g and wash the cell pellets twice in PBS by means of centrifugation (5 min, 300 g) to completely wash away the cell culture medium.\nResuspend the pellets in PBS at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per 50 μL. Keep the cellular suspensions on ice at all times.\nNote: It is recommended to prepare an excess volume of cell suspension (10%–20%) to ensure there is sufficient volume for injections.\nInject 1 × 106 cells into the right nipple of the 4th mammary gland.",
    "Hold the syringe with the needle tip turned upwards to enter the skin subcutaneously at 10 mm from the inoculation nipple, between the 4th and 5th mammary gland. When inserted, move the needle along the skin towards the inoculation nipple until the tip of the needle is located right under that nipple. While still holding the needle parallel to the skin, move it slightly in all directions around the nipple (within a 3 mm radius). Carefully move the needle tip up into the mammary fat pad till the needle eye comes under the nipple tip. Inject the cells at once, but slowly, so that a visible flat thickening forms around the nipple. After injection, turn the needle 45 degrees to the right and slowly pull it out, while still pressing on the plunger.\nTumor growth:\nMeasure tumor growth with a caliper, 3 times per week for up to 24 days. An exemplary tumor growth curve is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/598-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Exemplary tumor growth curve of 4T1 breast cancer cells implanted orthotopically in WT→WT or Pdpn KO→WT bone marrow chimeras\nFigure reprinted with permission from (Bieniasz-Krzywiec et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTumor collection and digestion\nTiming: 2 h\nProceed in the following way when tumors reach the growth endpoint or a desired size.\nNote: It is recommended to always use tumors of the same stage in order to ensure consistency and comparability of experimental outcomes.\nSacrifice the tumor-bearing mice using a method approved by an ethical committee of your institution (e.g., cervical dislocation, CO2 inhalation) and immediately collect the tumors in cold PBS.\nNote: The draining lymph node can often be found in close proximity to the tumor. Thus, ensure that it is appropriately separated from the tumor.",
    "Place each tumor in a plastic dish and chop it with a scalpel into 2–4 mm long pieces.\nTransfer the tissue into a gentleMACS C Tube containing 5 mL of sterile digestion buffer (RPMI medium containing 0.1% collagenase type I, 0.2% dispase type I and 1% DNAse I stock).\nNote: The powders can be weighed in advance. However, dissolve the powders, add the DNase I stock and pass through a 0.22 μm filter immediately before use.\nTightly close the C Tube and attach it upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator.\nNote: Ensure that the sample is located in the area of the rotor/stator, covered with digestion buffer, and that there are no tumor pieces on the tube walls.\nRun the gentleMACS program with the heating function suitable for hard tumors, i.e., ‘37C_m_TDK_2’.\nNote: If softer tumors are used (e.g., E0771 mammary tumors), the ‘37C_m_TDK_1’ program should be used for tissue dissociation.\nAlternatively, when no tissue dissociator is available, mince tumors in 5 mL RPMI medium containing 0.1% collagenase type I and 0.2% dispase type I to very small pieces using a scalpel. Tumor pieces should be then maintained in the same solution for the following 30 min at 37°C, and vortexed every 5 min.\nCritical: If multiple samples are to be processed, make sure they are all digested for the same amount of time, i.e., transfer each sample to ice exactly after 30 min.\nAdd 10 mL of FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA) into the gentleMACS C Tube containing the sample in tumor digestion solution and apply the cell suspension to a 70 μm cell strainer placed on a 50 mL tube. Filter the digested tissue using the strainer.",
    "Critical: Wash the strainer with FACS buffer to a uniform final volume of 30–40 mL in each tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 350 g. Discard the supernatant.\nCritical: At this point the pellets are very fragile and do not form a firm mass. Therefore, the supernatants should be removed with extreme caution in order not to disrupt and accidentally discard the pellets, i.e., through pipetting rather than aspirating.\nIncubate the resulting pellets in 1 mL of the red blood cell lysis buffer for 3 min at 37°C.\nImmediately place the samples on ice and resuspend them in 10 mL of FACS buffer in order to neutralize the red blood cell lysis buffer. Pipet up and down and pass through a 40 μm cell strainer placed on a 50 mL tube.\nNote: Make sure that pellets are well covered by the red blood cell lysis buffer. For 4T1 tumors up to 1 g, 1 mL of the buffer is sufficient, however, for other tumor types this volume might need to be optimized.\nAn exemplary picture of the pellet covered in red blood cell lysis buffer is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/598-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A representative photo of a 4T1 tumor pellet following digestion and straining through a 70 μm strainer, where the volume of the red blood cell lysis buffer can be appreciated (marked with a black arrow).\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 350 g. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL FACS buffer and calculate the number of viable cells in each sample using a counting chamber and a light microscope.",
    "Critical: Manual cell counting is recommended, as it is crucial to distinguish cells from debris present abundantly in the sample. If an automatic cell counter is used, adjust settings to ensure a precise cell count.\nFlow cytometry antibody staining\nTiming: 2 h\nThe cell suspensions are stained with indicated antibodies for flow cytometric analysis.\nResuspend each sample in the blocking solution (dilute the Fc block CD16/CD32 antibody in the FACS buffer in the ratio 1:25, i.e., 4 μL of antibody in 96 μL of FACS buffer) in the following ratio: 1 × 106 cells per 10 μL of the blocking solution.\nTransfer the samples to FACS tubes.\nIncubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nFrom each sample, collect a small equal volume (e.g., 10 μL) and pool in FACS tubes for the following controls (as detailed in point 18). Ensure to note down the final volumes of your controls:\nUnstained\nFluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls - the experimental cells stained with all the fluorophores except for one fluorophore.\nCritical: FMO controls should be done for all the fluorophores in your panel when starting a new multicolor experiment. This will allow you to assess the spread of all the fluorophores into your missing channel and set your gates accordingly. For detailed information on the FMO controls in the context of tumor microenvironment, please refer to (Young et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nLive cells compensation controls.\nCell staining:",
    "Prepare a 2× concentrated master mix of the appropriate antibodies/dyes in an Eppendorf tube. To each sample (cells in the blocking solution) of a given volume, add the same volume of the 2× concentrated master mix. In this way, the final concentration of the staining mix in each sample is 1× (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Vortex briefly and incubate for 20 min at 4°C (protected from light). Centrifuge (5 min, 350 g) and resuspend the pellets in 3 mL PBS, then centrifuge again (5 min, 350 g) to wash the samples. Resuspend the pellets in the FACS buffer, at a concertation of 20 million cells per 1000 μL. Keep at 4°C protected from light until detection and sorting.\nControl stainings:\nUnstained: add the volume of FACS buffer equal to the volume of that sample. Vortex briefly and incubate for 20 min at 4°C (protected from light). Keep at 4°C protected from light until detection.\nFMOs: Prepare a 2× concentrated staining mix for each FMO control (containing all the antibodies except for one). Add the volume of 2× mix to each FMO control equal to the volume of that FMO control sample, so that the final concentration of the staining mix in each sample is 1×. Vortex briefly and incubate for 20 min at 4°C protected from light. Centrifuge (5 min, g and resuspend the pellets in 3 mL PBS, then centrifuge again (5 min, 350 g) to wash the samples. Resuspend the pellets in 100–200 μL of the FACS buffer. Keep at 4°C protected from light until detection.\nPrepare single stained compensation controls:\nFor fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, use UltraComp beads or equivalent beads following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nFor the viability dye, use either ArCTM amine reactive beads (following the manufacturer’s instructions) or use any cultured cells as follows:",
    "Detach any cultured cells (e.g., 4T1 cells) with Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%);\nTake an aliquot and incubate at 65°C for 1 min in order to kill the cells and place them on ice immediately afterward;\nMix an equal volume of viable and heat-killed cells;\nSpin down and wash once with FACS buffer;\nIncubate the cell mixture with a viability dye diluted in FACS buffer (the same concentration as your cells) for 20 min on ice protected from light;\nWash the cells twice with FACS buffer to ensure a complete removal of excessive viability dye.\nPrepare cell collection tubes (15 mL Falcon tubes containing 4 mL of sterile complete RPMI medium) and store them on ice.\nNote: The collection tubes can be prepared a day in advance.\nCell collection and data acquisition\nTiming: approximately 30 min per sample\nThe cells are collected using the BD FACSAria™ III Cell Sorter with the BD FACSDivaTM software.\nSelect parameters including FSC-A, FSC-W, FSC-H, SSC-A, SSC-W, SSC-H, eFluor-506 (viability), eFluor-450 (CD11b), AlexaFluor488 (F4/80), PE (PDPN).\nUse the unstained control to set appropriate photomultiplier tubes voltages for FSC-A and SSC-A parameters.\nNote: given inherent differences between instruments, we encourage to test the panel in advance with your instrument to ensure that all the populations are inside of the axis and/or titrate the antibodies to ensure that the panel is optimal. We strongly discourage the use of the unstained control to adjust the voltages of the fluorochrome detectors.\nCalculate the compensation matrix with the single stained compensation controls.\nUse the unstained or the appropriate FMO control to create gates for various populations of interest, e.g., total TAMs (single, viable, CD11b+, F4/80+), PoEMs (single, viable, CD11b+, F4/80+, PDPN+) and non-PoEMs (single, viable, CD11b+, F4/80+, PDPN-) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/598-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure3. Gating strategy for the isolation of various populations of 4T1 tumor-infiltrating TAMs, including total TAMs (single, viable, CD11b+, F4/80+), PoEMs (single, viable, CD11b+, F4/80+, PDPN+) and non-PoEMs (single, viable, CD11b+, F4/80+, PDPN-).\nSort different TAM populations into corresponding collection tubes, i.e., 15 mL Falcon tubes containing 4 mL of sterile complete RPMI medium (see point 20). Store isolated cells on ice for up to 2 h. If possible, the sorting and collection tubes should be kept at 4°C during the sorting. Use a 100 μm nozzle and sort at a 1-3 flow rate.\nCritical: It is important to gradually process the already sorted cells withing a 2 h time frame, as after that time, live cells are progressively being lost. Therefore, the processing should be done in parallel to the sorting of remaining samples.\nAnalyze the data with the FlowJo software (optional).\nProcessing of isolated cells\nWash the collected cells with PBS and put them in culture in DMEM complete in Sterilin 30 mm Petri Dishes (0.5 million cells per dish) or in 96-well cell culture plates (up to 3 × 104 cells per well). Alternatively, spin the cells down (5 min, 300 g), wash them in PBS (5 min, 300 g), aspirate the supernatant and collect the cells in RLT lysis buffer (according to the manufacturer’s instructions) and immediately store at −80°C until the RNA isolation.\nNote: An alternative lysis buffer for RNA extraction can be used."
