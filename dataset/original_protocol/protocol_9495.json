    "1. Metabolite Extraction\nExtraction from dish\nCulture cells in a 6-well plate in triplicates in stable isotope labeled culture media + dialyzed supplements (serum or other growth supplements) until cells become 75% confluent.\n\t\tNOTE: Here culture HeLa cells for 48 h in RPMI containing 40% U-13C-Glucose and 70% U-13C, 15N2-Glutamine and 5% dialyzed FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum). Dialyzed FBS is used to get rid of the small molecular weight metabolites which might contaminate the labeled media. Culturing cells in dialyzed supplement prior to the real experiment is recommended to ensure cells are growing normally in the medium. Supplements are dialyzed in 0.15 M NaCl solution overnight using snake skin dialysis tubing.\nAt the day of extraction discard culture media, rinse wells twice with 500 µL cold HBSS and then discard it.\n\t\tNOTE: Here use HBSS containing 40% U-13C-Glucose since it is also in the culture media.\nAdd 600 µL 100% methanol pre-cooled on dry ice.\nTransfer the dish to dry ice and remove cell material with a cell scraper.\nCarefully pipette the cell extracts to a microcentrifuge tube and store at -80 °C until mass spectrometry analysis.\nExtraction of mock sorted cells\nCulture cells in a 100 mm dish in triplicates in stable isotope labeled culture media + dialyzed supplements.\n\t\tNOTE: Here culture HeLa cells for 48 h in 100 mm dish because a high number of cells (~4 x 106) are needed to obtain 500,000 sorted cells. This number of HeLa cells extract was required to obtain good measurement of metabolites. The culture media used was RPMI containing 40% U-13C-Glucose and 70% U-13C, 15N2-Glutamine and 5% dialyzed FBS.\nAt the day of extraction, discard culture media, rinse wells with 1.5 mL warm HBSS and then discard it.",
    "Detach cells by adding 1.5 mL trypsin/EDTA for 4 min at 37 °C. Perform the following steps in 4 °C or in ice.\nDeactivate trypsin by adding 3 mL ice cold HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution) + dialyzed supplement.\nCollect cells in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 750 x g for 3 min.\nResuspend the pellet in HBSS + dialyzed supplement + 1 mM EDTA at a concentration 1-2 x 106 cells/mL, pass through 40 µm cell strainers to obtain single cells, and transfer to a 5 mL tube.\nSort cells through cell sorter gating only for singlets, and centrifuge sorted cells at 750 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Here sort HeLa cells at a rate 1,000 events/s, with instrument pressure 27 psi, and using a 100 µm nozzle. HeLa cells are big so they should be sorted at a slow event rate and large nozzle to get as intact pellet as possible. Keep the cells in cold blocks throughout sorting to decrease the metabolism. A thorough description of sorting procedure is described previously12.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 µL ice cold dH2O to obtain a homogenous pellet before adding methanol. Addition of cold methanol directly to pellet forms a solid pellet which is hard to resuspend.\nExtract metabolites by adding 540 µL methanol kept in dry ice and keep extracts at -80 °C until liquid chromatography – high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis.\nExtraction of cell cycle sorted cells\nCulture cells in a 100 mm dish in triplicates in culture media + dialyzed supplements.",
    "NOTE: Here culture HeLa cells containing Geminin Fucci Green (mAG1-hGem) probe13 which allows for sorting of G1 (negative) and SG2M (positive) cells. Cells can be cultured in stable isotope tracing media for as long as required. Here we have cultured them for 46 h in unlabeled media, then we have switched to RPMI containing 40% U-13C-Glucose and 70% U-13C, 15N2-Glutamine 2 h before starting sorting. This was done in order to be able to study the cell cycle phases which requires a short pulse labeling.\nAt the day of extraction, discard culture media, rinse wells with 1.5 mL warm HBSS and then discard it.\nDetach cells by adding 1.5 mL trypsin/EDTA for 4 min at 37 °C. Perform the following steps in 4 °C or in ice.\nDeactivate trypsin by adding 3 mL ice cold HBSS + dialyzed supplement.\nCollect cells in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 750 x g for 3 min.\nResuspend the pellet in HBSS + dialyzed supplement + 1 mM EDTA at a concentration 1-2 x 106 cells/mL, pass through 40 µm cell strainers to obtain single cells, and transfer to a 5 mL tube.\nSort cells through the cell sorter gating out debris and doublets, then gating for the cell marker of interest, and centrifuge sorted cells at 750 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Here sort HeLa cells at a rate 1,000 events/s, with instrument pressure 27 psi, and using a 100 µm nozzle. Keep the cells in cold blocks throughout sorting to decrease the metabolism rate.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 µL ice cold dH2O to obtain a homogenous pellet before adding methanol. Addition of cold methanol directly to pellet forms a solid pellet which is hard to resuspend.",
    "Extract the metabolites by adding 540 µL methanol kept in dry ice and keep extracts at -80 °C until LC-HRMS analysis.\n2. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\nNote: Here we describe the protocol for analyzing cell extracts on a LC-HRMS system. Any metabolomics methods for analysis of cell extracts can be used. Full scan analysis might be useful for detecting a wide range of metabolites.\nCalibrate the instrument using a mass spectrometry reference calibration mix.\nThaw cell extracts on ice for 30 min and vortex for 15 s.\nTransfer 100 µL of the cell extract to a spin filter and centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 x g at 4 °C.\nInject 12.5 µL of the filtrate onto the LC-HRMS system.\nSeparate metabolites using a Zwitterionic Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size) fitted with a ZIC-HILIC guard column (20 mm × 2.1 mm) using a gradient elution of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). Start the gradient elution at 20% of solvent A and increase up to 80% in 17 min. Maintain this percentage during 4 min with a flow of 400 µL min-1 and column temperature and sample tray at 23 °C and 4 °C, respectively.\nUse an instrument coupled to the chromatographic separation for metabolites detection, a heated electrospray (H-ESI II) in both positive and negative modes as ionization source, and a full scan acquisition mode at a mass resolving power of 70,000 Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) (m/z 200).\nUse nitrogen (purity >99.995%) for the sheath gas and auxiliary gas at a flow rate of 45 and 10 a.u. (arbitrary units) and set vaporizer temperature at 350 °C and the electrospray voltage at 4 kV in positive mode and -3.5 kV in negative mode.",
    "3. Data Analysis\nSelect a number of metabolites for which standards are available and which show good quality peaks in the samples. Good quality peaks have high signal to noise ratio. It is important to verify peak quality and make sure not to include false isotopes. Isotopic peaks which differ in shape and/or retention time are likely false.\nFor isotope-labeled samples calculate mass isotopomer (MI) fractions by dividing the peak area of each MI with total peak areas of all MIs.\nCalculate the labeled carbon/nitrogen fractions, enrichment of 13C and 15N, respectively, as\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55011/55011eq1.jpg\n\twhere n is the total number of carbons (or nitrogens, respectively) in the metabolite, and MIx is the MI fraction of x.\n\tNOTE: All calculations can be performed using programming languages.\nSubscription Required.
