    "Cell-free extract reaction (Time for Completion: 1 h)Set-up a cell-free reaction in a 60 µL reaction volume with 10 nM of the DNA template, which should contain a promoter, the rbs followed by the inserted gene of interest, and the transcription terminator [a pGal plasmid is used for the reaction in Figure 3A (Wang, X. et al., 2014)], 25 µL of the reaction buffer (Bioneer), 14 µL of E. coli extract (S30) (Bioneer), 0.5% (w/v) galactose, and DEPC water up to the final volume.Note: Dissolve 100 g galactose in 500 mL RNase-free water to make a 20% (w/v) galactose stock solution. Stir/mix thoroughly at room temperature to dissolve, then filter sterilize the solution. A final galactose concentration of 0.5% (w/v) is used for the reaction. Incubate at 30°C in a stationary incubator for 30 min.Note: We recommend setting up the cell-free reaction in a stationary incubator. Add an equivalent amount of PCI (Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol) and centrifuge at 12,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min, to stop the reaction.Note: At this stage, three distinctive phases can be seen. The upper aqueous phase will retain the total RNA, whereas the yellowish-interphase and the lower organic phase contain the protein. Carefully use a pipette to take 25 µL of the upper aqueous phase, which contains the RNA, without disturbing the inter/organic phase.Apply the sample to the upper side of the G-50 resin column and centrifuge at 2,650 × g for 2 min. The purified RNA is collected at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube.Note: To prepare the G-50 column, vortex the resin to resuspend and centrifuge at 2,650 × g for 1 min. Place the column in a new sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Quantify the purified RNA (usually 1.0–1.2 µg/µL) and store it at -70°C (Pause step).",
    "CRITICAL STEP: Use RNase-free filter tips to avoid RNase contamination. RNA ligation (Time for Completion: 3.5 h)Set-up the RNA ligation reaction in 1.5 mL sterile microcentrifuge tubes to a volume of 25 μL, comprised of 2.5 µL of 10× RNA ligase buffer, 1 µL of 100 nM RNA oligo (27 mer) (Table 1), 2.5 µg RNA, 0.5 µL of 40 U/µL RNasin, 1.5 μL of 3U DNase I, and 2 μL of T4 5 U/µL RNA Ligase.Note: If there is any DNA carryover from the previous step, DNase I ensures full eradication. Incubate at 37°C in a stationary incubator for 3 h.Clean the subsequent ligation mix using a G-50 column by centrifugation at 2,650 × g for 2 min.Note: To prepare the G-50 column, vortex the resin to resuspend and centrifuge at 2,650 × g for 1 min. Place the column in a new sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Reverse transcription (RT) (Time for Completion: 2.5 h)Set-up a reverse transcription reaction in 1.5 mL sterile microcentrifuge tubes to a volume of 20 μL containing 2 µL of 10× RTase buffer, 1 µL of 25 µM 3RP-R primer (Table 1), 2 µL of 5 mM dNTP mix, 0.25 µL of 40 U/µL RNasin, 1 μL of 4 U/µL RTase, and 4 µg ligated RNA.Incubate at 37°C in a stationary incubator for 2 h.Note: cDNAs can be stored at -20°C until the next step (Pause step). PCR (Time for Completion: 2 h)Set-up a PCR reaction in 0.2 mL PCR tubes to a final volume of 50 μL, containing 5 µL of 10× PCR buffer, 1 µL of 10mM dNTP mix, 2.5 µL of 10 µM 3RP-R primer, 2.5 µL of 10 µM gene of interest (GOI) primer (Table 1), 0.5 µL of 5 U/µL HotStarTaq plus DNA polymerase, 2.",
    "5 µL of cDNA, and 36 µL of RNase-free water.Move PCR tubes to a thermo-cycler machine. Pre-heat the block to 105°C.Start the thermocycling process with the following parameters: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, and 30 cycles of: denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, hybridization at 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 60 s. Cool the samples down to 4°C.Store the PCR tubes at -20°C (Pause step).CRITICAL STEP: PCR purification ensures that the PCR reaction components are removed. Primer end labeling (Time for Completion: 1.5 h)Set-up a 20 µL reaction in 1.5 mL sterile microcentrifuge tubes as follows: 2 µL of 10× Kinase buffer, 2 µL of 10 µM gene-specific extension primer, 2 µL of [γ-32P] ATP, 1 µL of 10U/µL Kinase, and 13 µL of RNase-free water.CRITICAL STEP: Use gloves and protective gear, as well as a plexiglass shield to avoid radiation. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min in a heat block.Note: The enzyme can be inactivated at 65°C for 10 min. Dilute the reaction mixture with 30 µL of RNase-free water and purify the labeled primer using a G-50 column by centrifugation at 2,650 × g for 2 min. Store at 4°C (Pause step).Primer extension (PE) (Time for Completion: 2 h)Set-up a 20 µL PCR reaction in 0.2 mL PCR tubes, as follows: 2 µL of 10× PCR buffer, 0.3 µL of 10 mM dNTP mix, 0.75 µL of 5’ end-labeled gene-specific extension primer, 0.2 µL of 5 U/µL HotStarTaq plus DNA polymerase, 2 µL of DNA template, and 14.75 µL of RNase-free water.CRITICAL STEP: Use gloves and protective gear, as well as a plexiglass shield to avoid radiation.",

Schematic of the components of an assembled electrophoresis apparatus. The illustrated output of the 3′ RACE assay on gal transcripts generated in E. coli MG1655 wild-type (WT) cells showing the 3’ end of galETKM mRNA (previously called mM1) at 4,313 (the number represents the position of the nucleotide from the gal transcription initiation site); GATC: DNA sequencing ladder.Gel electrophoresis and analysis (Time for Completion: 16 h)Assemble spacers (0.4 mm), inner and outer glass plates (W × H: 31 × 38.5 cm) in the gel-casting chamber according to the manufacturer’s description (Labrepco) (Figure 2) (Video 1).CRITICAL STEP: Coat the inner glass plate with a hydrophobic Sigmacote solution, to facilitate removing the gel from the outer glass plate after electrophoresis. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Gel-casting procedure. Prepare 50 mL of polyacrylamide solution from the 8% sequencing solution (see Materials and Reagents).Add 300 µL of ammonium persulfate (10%) and 30 µL of TEMED to the polyacrylamide solution. Mix well by stirring.Using an automated pipette, gently pipette the solution between glass plates, without introducing any air bubbles.Allow 1 h after inserting the gel comb (4 × 0.4 mm, 14 cm), for the gel polymerization to occur.Remove the polymerized gel from the gel-casting chamber and transfer it to the gel sequencing electrophoresis apparatus (Labrepco) (Figure 2).Fill the bottom and upper buffer chambers with 1× TBE buffer (submerged by at least 2–3 cm).Detach the comb from the gel and use a pipette to rinse the wells.",
    "CRITICAL STEP: As urea gets seeped into the wells, pipette them thoroughly every 2 min. Add 15 µL of 2× stop buffer (see Materials and Reagents) to the sample and denature at 95°C for 5 min.Place the samples on ice for 2 min to cool.Load 2.5 µL of the sample carefully, avoiding any air bubbles.CRITICAL STEP: Always keep samples on ice. Close the lid of the apparatus, attach the cords to a high-voltage power source, and run the gel at 60 W for 2–3 h.Remove glass plates from the gel electrophoresis device by removing the clamps. Carefully disassemble the glass plates after they have cooled down completely.Note: Check and wait for the glass plates to cool down. Cut a piece of Whatman paper (3 mm) to the same size as the gel and carefully remove the gel after attaching the Whatman paper to the outer glass plate.Cover the gel with saran wrap and seal it with scotch tape.CRITICAL STEP: Check the radiation level often with a Geiger counter, focusing on the front of the protective screen and your gloves, in case of contamination. Transfer the saran wrap-sealed gel to a gel cassette containing the Whatman paper, cover the gel with an X-ray film, and expose it at -80°C for 12–16 h.Note: At -80°C, the film exposure period can be adjusted. Scan the film once it has dried from development and fixing. ImageJ software can be used to calculate relative band intensities."
