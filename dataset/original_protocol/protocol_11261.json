    "This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of US Common Rule and was approved by the Institutional Committee on Human Research.\n1. Microdissection\nNOTE: FFPE metastatic CRPC tissues with adenocarcinoma features (CRPC-Adeno) or NE differentiation (CRPC-NE) were obtained from the Prostate Cancer Biorepository Network (PCBN). Ten-micron PCa sections on glass slides were prepared for manual microdissection as discussed previously18. To briefly summarize:\nDeparaffinize the tissue sections by soaking the slides in xylene (2x, 10 min each). Then rehydrate the sections by incubating the slides for 5 min each in graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70%), followed by a distilled water wash and staining with hematoxylin (30 s soak).\nFollowing hematoxylin staining, wash the tissue sections with water. Then dehydrate the tissue sections by placing them in graded ethanol (70%, 80% 90%, 95%, 100%) (5 min each) followed by xylene (5 min).\nAnalyze the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides to identify the tumor areas (i.e., adenocarcinomas or NED) and mark these tumor areas and normal adjacent areas with the assistance of a board-certified pathologist. Using these H&E slides as roadmaps, mark the hematoxylin-stained tissues obtained in the above step to distinguish between the tumor and normal areas.\nDissect the marked tissue slide carefully under the microscope using a scalpel blade.\nCollect the dissected tissue from normal and cancerous areas in separate tubes using electrostatically charged gel loading pipette tips. The charged tip attracts the dissected tissue and allows for maximum tissue recovery after dissection. Once the tissue sticks to the charged tip, cut the tip into an empty 2 mL collection tube.\n2. Isolating Serum-derived EVs",
    "NOTE: Frozen patient serum samples collected from patients with metastatic CRPC with adenocarcinoma characteristics (CRPC-adeno) or NE differentiation (CRPC-NE) were procured from PCBN using an approved IRB protocol and stored at -80 °C prior to their use. Serum samples were collected from the same set of patients as those used for microdissected tissues to allow comparison between the corresponding tissues and the serum-derived EVs. A commercially available serum EV isolation reagent was used to collect the EVs.\nThaw frozen patient serum samples at 4 °C.\nUse 110 μL of thawed serum sample and spin at 2,000 x g for 30 min.\nCollect the supernatant for subsequent EV/exosome isolation and discard the debris pellet. Add 30 μL of serum exosome isolation reagent to the supernatant and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min.\nSpin at 10,000 x g for 10 min. Collect the EV-depleted serum carefully without disturbing the pellet in a separate 1.5 mL tube and store at -80 °C for future analysis, if needed.\nResuspend the EV pellet in 70 μL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prepared in nuclease-free water. Keep an aliquot for the particle tracking analyses system to assess the quality and number of particles. Store the rest of the sample at -80 °C until further analysis.\n3. RNA Isolation from Microdissected Prostate Tissues and EVs\nNOTE: Total RNA was isolated from microdissected tissues and purified EVs using a commercially available kit (Table of Materials) per the manufacturer's instructions with a few modifications. The following sections briefly describe these procedures with special emphasis on the important steps:\nIsolate the RNA from the microdissected tissues.\n\t\nResuspend the microdissected FFPE tissue in 150 μL of proteinase K buffer. Mix by vortexing and pipette out the residual tissue from the tip. Spin at 11,000 x g for 1 min.",
    "Add 10 μL of proteinase K to the pellet. Wait for 2 min until the pellet turns white. Pipette up and down a few times.\nIncubate at 56 °C for 16 min. Vortex every 3 min.\nRemove samples and let the heat block reach 80 °C. Incubate the samples on the block for 16 min. Vortex every 3 min.\nIncubate on ice for 3 min.\nSpin at 20,000 x g for 15 min. Transfer the supernatant to a new 2 mL tube.\nAdd 16 μL of DNase booster buffer followed by 10 μL of DNase I. Mix by inverting the tube gently and incubate at room temperature (RT) for 15 min.\nAdd 320 μL of red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer. Mix by inverting the tube and then add 1,120 μL of 100% ethanol. Immediately transfer on spin columns stored at 4 °C. Spin at 8,000 x g for 30 s.\nWash the columns 2x with wash buffer and spin the columns at 20,000 x g for 5 min to remove residual wash buffer.\nAllow the spin column to air dry for 2−3 min, then elute with 19 μL of RNase-free water. Quantitate the purified RNA on a spectrophotometer and normalize the sample to 40 ng/μL.\nRNA isolation from serum-derived EVs.\n\t\nIsolate the exosomal RNA using a kit. Add 75 μL of lysis buffer A and 9.3 μL of lysis buffer B to 50 μL of the purified EV suspension.\nNOTE: Keep mixing the sample by inverting the tube for about 10 min to allow complete lysis of the EVs.\nAdd 130 μL of 100% ethanol and immediately mix by inverting the sample. Transfer on a spin column and then spin at 3,300 x g for 1 min.",
    "Wash the column 2x with the wash buffer. Spin the column at 1,300 x g for 3 min to completely remove the wash buffer.\nAllow the column to air dry for 2 min. Add 18 μL of elution buffer to the column and let it sit for 2 min. Spin at 400 x g for 1 min followed by a second spin at 5,800 x g for 3 min.\nRepeat step 3.2.4 with the eluted buffer included in the kit to increase the yield of the RNA from the sample.\nQuantify the sample on a spectrophotometer and normalize it to 40 ng/μL.\n4. Library Preparation for Small RNA Sequencing\nNOTE: A small RNA library prep kit (Table of Materials) was used to generate cDNA libraries from the isolated RNA samples. The steps to generate libraries, purify, and quality check them prior to running on a sequencer are crucial to any sequencing protocol as they eventually determine the quality of output data from a run. Therefore, proceed carefully with each step. The guidelines from the manufacturer suggest using a minimum of 50 ng of RNA. Given the poor quality and low amounts of total RNA usually obtained from these two sample sources, this protocol is optimized for RNA concentrations as low as 100 ng. The protocol below is for one sample of a library.\nGenerate adapter-ligated cDNA.\n\t\nUse 5 μL of a normalized (40 ng/μL) RNA sample. Add 1 μL of 3' adaptor. Preheat the thermal cycler to 70 °C prior to incubating the samples. Incubate for 2 min. Immediately transfer the samples on ice prior to moving onto the next step.",
    "In a separate tube, mix 2 μL of ligation buffer, 1 μL of RNase inhibitor, and 1 μL of T4 RNA Ligase 2, a deletion mutant. Mix by pipetting up and down and add 4 μL of this mix to the tube with the RNA/3' adaptor.\nTransfer to the thermal cycler that has been preheated to 28 °C and incubate for 1 h.\nAdd 1 μL of stop solution while keeping the samples on the thermal block. Incubate at 28 °C for another 15 min.\nRemove the tubes and keep on ice immediately after this step.\nIn a separate tube, add 1 μL of 5' adaptor.\nTransfer to a thermal cycler that has been preheated to 70 °C and incubate for 2 min.\nImmediately place the tube on ice to prevent re-annealing of the adaptors.\nAdd 1 μL of 10 mM ATP to the tube of denatured 5' adaptor. Mix by pipetting and add 1 μL of T4 RNA ligase to the mix. Mix by pipetting and add 3 μL of this mix to the tube containing the 3' adaptor-ligated RNA. Transfer on the thermal cycler that has been preheated to 28 °C and incubate for 1 h.\nImmediately transfer to ice and either proceed further with the samples or store at -20 °C for future use.\nTo perform RT-PCR, use 6 μL of each adaptor-ligated RNA and add 1 μL of RNA RT primer to it. Transfer to the thermal cycler that has been preheated to 70 °C. Incubate for 2 min.",
    "In a separate tube, mix 2 μL of 5x strand buffer, 0.5 μL of 12.5 mM dNTPs, 1 μL of 100 mM DTT, 1 μL of RNase inhibitor, and 1 μL of reverse transcriptase. Add 5.5 μL of this mix to the adaptor-ligated RNA and transfer to the thermal cycler that has been preheated to 50°C. Incubate for 1 h.\nTransfer the adaptor-ligated cDNA immediately to ice.\nIn a separate tube, mix 25 μL of PCR mix, 2 μL of RNA PCR primer, 2 μL of RNA PCR primer index, and 8.5 μL of RNase-free water. Add 37.5 μL of this mix to 12.5 μL of adaptor-ligated cDNA. Transfer to the thermal cycler that has been preheated to 98 °C. Program the thermal cycler as suggested in the manufacturer's protocol with the cycle number modified to 15 instead of 11.\nNOTE: Sequences of all the primers used are listed under Table of Materials.\nKeep the samples at 4 °C after completion. Proceed with them or store at -80 °C for future use.\nPurify and perform quality control for the ligated cDNA.\nNOTE: Amplified cDNA was gel-purified by following the manufacturer's protocol except for a few modifications to improve the quality and yield of purified cDNA samples as explained below.\n\t\nUse 6% TBE polyacrylamide gels to purify the amplified cDNA. Dilute the high-resolution ladder (HRL) and custom RNA ladder (CRL) with equal volumes of DNA loading dye.\nAdd 10 μL of DNA loading dye to each cDNA sample. Run 30 μL of each sample in two separate lanes adjacent to each other with CRL and HRL in the intermediate space between the two different samples.\nRun the gel in 1x TBE buffer at 145 V for approximately 30−40 min.",
    "NOTE: Keep track of the lower blue front of the loading dye. Stop the electrophoresis when it approaches the bottom of gel.\nTransfer the gel in 1x TBE buffer with Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) at 0.5 µg EtBr/1 mL 1x TBE.\nCAUTION: EtBr is a known carcinogen and each step from here until the excision from the gel should be performed with extreme caution.\nVisualize the gel in a transilluminator and cut the gel precisely between the 145 bp and 160 bp marker.\nNOTE: The adaptor dimers run very close to the 145 bp marker. Therefore, cut the gel slightly above the 145 bp marker to avoid contamination with adaptor dimer.\nTransfer the gel to DNA breaking tubes kept in 2 mL collecting tubes. Spin at 20,000 x g for 2 min. Add 300 μL of RNase-free water and allow it to rotate gently on a rocker overnight at RT.\nTo perform the DNA precipitation, on the following day transfer the contents of the tube to 5 μm filter tubes. Spin at 600 x g for 10 s.\nNOTE: Do not let tubes spin longer than 10 s as the gel passes through the filter.\nAdd 2 μL of glycogen, 30 μL of 3 M NaOAc, 2 μL of 0.1x pellet paint, and 975 μL of 100% ethanol to the eluted DNA. Spin at 17,000 x g at 4°C for 20 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 75% ethanol to wash the pellet. Spin at 17,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and incubate the tubes at 37 °C to completely evaporate the ethanol.\nResuspend the pellet with 12 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5.",
    "Perform a library quality check by diluting the purified cDNA by 10x (1:10) and using 1 μL of diluted cDNA to run on a bio-analyzer.\nMake sure the cDNA product size corresponds to the range of small RNA (136−160 bp) in the electropherogram. Calculate the total molarity for each sample. Normalize each sample to 2 nM using Tris-HCl pH 8.5.\nDenature and sequence the purified cDNA.\n\t\nPool the libraries by mixing equal volumes of each 2 nM sample in a single 200 μL PCR tube. Add 10 μL of freshly prepared 0.2 N NaOH to 10 μL of pooled library.\nMix immediately by vortexing, and spin at 280 x g for 1 min. Incubate at RT for 5 min.\nAdd 10 μL of 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 to 20 μL of the denatured library. Mix by vortexing and spin at 280 x g for 1 min.\nAdd 970 μL of prechilled hybridization buffer to the library and mix well by vortexing. The library is at a concentration of 20 pM. Keep on ice until it is finally diluted.\nNOTE: The final dilution is done right before running on sequencer.\nAdd 117 μL of the denatured library to 1,183 μL of prechilled hybridization buffer. Mix by inverting the tube and pulse centrifuge. The final concentration of the library is now 1.8 pM.\nAdd 1.3 μL of PhiX to the 1.3 mL of final library. To initiate a run on a sequencer, follow the on-screen steps on the software interface, review the run parameters, including read type (single read), read length (number of cycles for each read), library ID, and select Start.\n5. Data Analysis\nAt the end of the sequencer run, obtain the resulting sequencing data as fastQ files. Use the appropriate software to analyze the resulting sequencing data.",
    "Open the fastQ toolkit application and press the Launch button.\nSelect the files from the list of samples in the software and select where the data will be saved.\nAdd a string name that applies to each trimmed sequence. Keep the stringency to 0.9. Input the adapter sequence to trim as \"TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG\" from the 3' end of each sequenced sample. Expand the Read Filtering tab and select a minimum read length of \"5\". Select the Acknowledge box and press the Continue button to start trimming. The trimmed files will be saved in the project folder upon the end of the analysis.\nOpen the small RNA v.1.0 application on the software and press the Launch button.\nSelect the project where the files will be saved and sent after the analysis.\nSelect the Novel miRs and Differential miRs function in the application. Segregate the groups as \"Control\" and \"Test\" for differential analysis and add the trimmed files to be analyzed in their respective groups.\nSelect the Launch button for initiating the analysis. Following the analyses, download the resulting files.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
