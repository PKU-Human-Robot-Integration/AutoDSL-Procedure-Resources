    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research (IRB) at Stanford University, USA.\nCAUTION: This protocol is a guide for qualified ophthalmic surgeons. In the context of intraocular malignancies, extraocular tumor seeding in the setting of aqueous humor or vitreous liquid biopsies cannot be ruled out. However, the risk of extraocular extension and orbital involvement is extremely low in transvitreal choroidal tumor biopsy, that is done in safety enhanced manner and with careful entry site consideration6. This protocol does not cover and may be contraindicated in cases of retinoblastoma or tumors with high metastatic risk.\n1. Before sample collection\nInstitutional review board approval\nObtain the approvals from the local IRB before the start of the experiment and perform sample collection accordingly.\nStudy population\nInclusion criteria: Include all patients (ages 0 - 99 years) that undergo intraocular surgery at the institution that will provide an adequate quantity of aqueous humor or vitreous liquid in excess of that required for appropriate diagnostic tests to evaluate the patient's condition and patients who wish to participate.\nExclusion criteria: Exclude patients who decline to participate and pregnant women.\nInformed consent\nObtain written informed consent from each patient following the IRB approved protocol.\nArchive the signed consent in a secured database.\nTrain involved personnel (surgeons, laboratory technicians, operating room (OR) staff, scientists) as described in this protocol.\nSet up a sample managing database. Use REDCap as a HIPAA-compliant web-based sample database that is designed to support data capture for research studies5.\n\t\tNOTE: This article describes the use of the web-based interface provided by REDCap to design forms, define fields, set up branching logic, and apply data validation rules without the need for extensive programming knowledge. Alternatively, other software, such as standard spreadsheet applications, may also be suitable.",
    "Ensure the availability of a cooling box, dry ice, syringe for sample collection, and cryovials (see Table of Materials). Use cryovials with barcodes that are permanently etched onto the vials. This eliminates the need to add patient identifiers on the vial and the possibility of losing a label under freezing conditions.\nNotify the surgeon on the case and the lab technician who will help with the sample collection in the OR at least 24 h prior to the scheduled surgery.\n2. Acquisition of surgical specimens in the operating room\nMobile operating room lab interface (MORLI)\nEstablish a MORLI in the operating room. MORLI includes a flat lab bench surface, a computer/tablet with a barcode scanner with access to the REDCap database, and a cooling box with dry ice (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tCAUTION: Dry ice is extremely cold. Always wear gloves when handling dry ice, and avoid touching it.\nPreparation of sample collection in the OR\nLog in to the computer/tablet on MORLI and open the REDCap database.\nCheck that informed consent has been signed by the patient and confirm that with the surgeon. Remind him/her that an undiluted sample is required.\nWear gloves. Obtain the appropriate number of barcoded cryovials (0.5 mL for aqueous humor and 1.9 mL for vitreous samples) and place them where they are easily accessible.\nCollection of aqueous humor liquid biopsies\n\tCAUTION: Consider human tissue samples as biohazardous material, which requires appropriate precautions such as a lab coat and gloves to assure the safety of the involved personnel.\n\tNOTE: The following steps should only be performed by a trained ophthalmic surgeon. Aqueous humor liquid biopsies can be obtained, for example, at the beginning of cataract surgery, one of the most frequent surgeries worldwide.",
    "NOTE: A sterile field is maintained as per standard of care protocols in the operating room. Preoperative procedures related to patient anesthesia follow standard of care steps for anterior chamber and vitreoretinal surgeries.\n\t\nPrepare and drape the eye for surgery and place a sterile lid speculum for optimal visualization of the sterile field.\nUse an operating microscope to perform an anterior chamber paracentesis perpendicular to the limbus using a 30-32 G needle connected to a 1 mL syringe. Use a cotton tip or small forceps to stabilize the eye during this procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the needle and the syringe are locked and that there is no pressure in the syringe (by moving the plunger). Ensure that the tip of the needle remains over the peripheral iris in the mid-anterior chamber to avoid damage to intraocular structures. In the case of cataract surgery, the needle to obtain the liquid biopsy can also enter the anterior chamber via one of the paracenteses that are created for the cataract surgery.\nUnder direct visualization via the microscope, manually aspirate approximately 100 µL of undiluted aqueous humor using a 1 mL syringe. Move the syringe plunger with the surgeon's non-dominant hand or by a trained assistant without moving the needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Obtain less than 100 µL of aqueous humor in case the anterior chamber should collapse.\nCarefully remove the needle from the anterior chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: In a phakic eye, keep the needle over the iris to avoid touching the lens. Positive pressure on the globe can increase reflux. Releasing the cotton tip before the needle is withdrawn helps reduce reflux.\nPull back the plunger and see how the air and the collected fluid are moving.\nInject the syringe into the cryovial. The extra air clears the syringe's dead space.",
    "Use the barcode on the cryovial to scan the sample to the REDCap form on a computer in the operating room (more details in steps 3.1 to 3.9).\nImmediately transfer the cryovial to dry ice in the cooling box.\nContinue with the surgery scheduled for the patient (e.g., a cataract surgery as previously described7 ).\nCollection of vitreous liquid biopsies\n\tNOTE: The following steps should only be performed by a trained vitreoretinal surgeon. Vitreous liquid biopsies can be obtained at the beginning of a vitrectomy8. Since the goal is to collect an undiluted vitreous sample, the vitrectomy cutter will not be primed with fluid1.\n\tNOTE: A sterile field is maintained as per standard of care protocols in the operating room. Preoperative procedures related to patient anesthesia follow the standard of care steps for anterior chamber and vitreoretinal surgeries.\n\t\nPrepare and drape the eye for surgery and place a sterile lid speculum for optimal visualization of the sterile field.\nCreate sclerotomies with a 23-, 25-, or 27-G trocar cannula, following the standard of care procedures. Insert the infusion cannula and visually confirm the appropriate placement in the vitreous cavity.\nIn the vitreous cavity, activate the vitreous cutter without infusion to collect an undiluted vitreous sample. Manually aspirate 0.5 to 1.0 mL of vitreous using a syringe that is connected to the vitreous extrusion cannula1.\nRemove the vitreous cutter from the eye and turn on the fluid infusion.\nAspirate the remaining fluid within the tubing into the syringe.\nDisconnect the syringe.\nProcess the sample as described for an aqueous humor specimen in section 2.3 (step 2.3.5 to step 2.3.9).\n3. Processing of samples in the OR and adding samples to the database",
    "Ask the lab technician to take the prepared cryovial (0.5 mL for aqueous humor and 1.9 mL for vitreous samples) and walk to the surgeon without touching any sterile OR equipment.\nAsk the lab technician to open the cryovial.\nUnload the syringe directly into the cryovial.\nAsk the lab technician to immediately recap the cryovial.\nAsk the lab technician to walk back to the MORLI and immediately transfer the sample onto dry ice in the cooling box (-80 ˚C). Close the lid of the box.\nOpen a new sample collection form. Enter the following information in the respective field of the form: case surgeon, location and date of collection, patient identifier number, and other basic information, such as age, sex, right or left eye, diagnosis, preoperative history (free text), information about the procedure (e.g., type of surgery), as well as information about the samples, such as number of samples collected, type of samples (aqueous humor, vitreous), and other details such as volumes. Add the tube barcode using the barcode scanner.\nClick on Submit/Next.\nRepeat steps 3.1 to 3.7 if any additional samples are collected.\nWhen all samples are secured, click Save and submit on the REDCap sample collection form. Then log out of the database and the computer/tablet.\n4. Transferring cryovials to storage\nTransport the samples on dry ice in the cooling box from the OR to the lab and place it on a lab bench next to a lab computer.\nLog in to REDCap on the lab computer using your login ID and password.\nWear gloves. Take one of the collected samples and scan the barcode of the cryovial into the database (more details in section 5). Immediately place the sample back on dry ice.\nObtain a second container filled with dry ice.",
    "Obtain a rack for the cryovials from the -80 °C freezer. Place it in the second container on dry ice.\n\tNOTE: A 96-format rack will be needed for the 0.5 mL aqueous humor tubes and a 48-format rack for the 1.9 mL vitreous tubes.\nScan the barcode of the rack to the database (more details in section 5).\nTransfer the sample to the rack.\nAdd the position of the vials in the rack to the database (more details in section 5).\nClick Save and submit.\nTransport the rack with the vials on dry ice to the fridge for storage at -80 °C. Add the rack to a specific position in the fridge using a coordinate system. This will later allow to retrieve samples for downstream analysis easily.\n5. Sample storage form\nComplete a storage form for each sample that is collected during the entry form phase. Click on the empty circle or the \"+\" under Sample Storage to create and open a new storage form.\nEnter the date that this form has been completed under Record Archival Date.\nScan or type the tube barcode under Specimen Tube Barcode. Immediately place the sample back on dry ice.\nSelect whether a sample is transferred out or if the sample is going into internal biorepository storage.\nVerify that written informed consent was obtained from the patient and select the box under Verify Consent Compliance and enter your name under Consent verified by.\nSelect a free and suitable location for the cryovial in the rack. Transfer the cryovial at this position into the rack (e.g., position A1). Keep the rack on dry ice.",
    "In the Location phase, enter the following information: the location of the freezer under Freezer, the shelf number where the sample will be stored under Shelf, the box barcode under Box Barcode, the tube position in the box by row (Tube Position (Row)) and column (Tube Position (Column)).\n\tNOTE: Optionally, a box label can also be entered under Box Label, which may facilitate to find the box in the freezer.\nUnder the Usage section, enter the following information: the name of the project that the sample is used for (Project Name), the specimen volume in one of the following categories: full, partial, near-empty, or empty (Specimen Volume), and storage notes if applicable under Storage Notes.\n\tNOTE: The date, time and user that last accessed the form is auto populated to ensure a chain of custody that can be reviewed and audited as needed.\nConfirm that the form is completed by clicking Complete under Complete?.\nClick Save & Exit Form. This will bring you back to the patient overview.\nFor every tube that was collected, generate another sample collection form by clicking on the \"+\" under Sample Storage. Then repeat steps 5.1 to 5.10.\nClick Save and Exit to complete the form and log out of the database and the computer/tablet.\nTransfer the sample rack (on dry ice) to the fridge at the prespecified position.\n6. Retrieval of surgical specimens for downstream analysis\nNOTE: Specimens are often archived for several years before they are analyzed. The barcoded cryovials and the searchable REDCap database system allow to find and locate each sample easily for downstream analysis.\nIdentify samples of interest for the experiment by using the search function of the database. This will allow finding e.g., all aqueous humor samples from patients between 20 and 40 years with diabetic retinopathy.",
    "Obtain the location of the cryovials of interest (freezer, shelf/rack, sample rack, coordinates within the rack). Write them down, print them, or have them available on a mobile computer/tablet to facilitate the finding of the samples in the freezer.\nMark the samples as used in the database.\nClick Save and Exit to complete the form and log out of REDCap and the computer/tablet."
