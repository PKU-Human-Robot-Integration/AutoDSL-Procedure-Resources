    "Transfection of HBV 1.2mer replicons   One day before transfection, plate 3 x 105 Huh7 cells per well in 2 ml of growth medium (DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin-streptomycin) on 6 well plate.    Two hours before transfection, change 2 ml of growth media per well at 80% cells confluence.   Dilute the 2 μg of HBV 1.2mer replicons in 125 μl of Opti-MEM and gently flick.   Dilute 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 125 μl of Opti-MEM and gently flick. Then, incubate for 5 min at room temperature.   After 5 min incubation, combine the diluted HBV 1.2mer replicons with the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 and gently mix by pipetting. Then, incubate for 20 min at room temperature.   After 4~6 h transfection, change 2 ml of growth medium per well mixed with appropriate concentration anti-HBV drugs (see Figure 2).   Replace the growth medium with anti-HBV drugs every day for 4 days and, then harvest the cells in 1.5 ml tube by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C.      Extraction of core particle relative HBV DNA   Add 100 μl of cold HEPES lysis buffer in cell pellet and incubate on ice for 20 min.   Centrifuge the lysates at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and transfer supernatant (cell lysate, cytoplasm fraction) into new 1.5 ml tube.   Mix 5.67 μl of nuclease buffer (I) by pipetting and incubate for 30 min in 37 °C water bath.   Briefly spin down, add 40 μl of 26% PEG solution and incubate for 2 h on ice (vortexing every 30 min) and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C.   Discard the supernatant and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.   Completely remove the supernatant (using pipet and KIMTECH Science Wipers).",
    "Add 100 μl of nuclease buffer (II) and physically resuspend the core particles.   Incubate for 20 min in 37 °C water bath and briefly spin down.   Add 282.5 μl of 0.5% SDS solution and 12.5 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubate for 2~4 h in 37 °C water bath (inverting every 30 min).   After spin down, add 400 μl of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and vigorously vortex for 10 sec. Then, centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.   Transfer aqueous upper layer into new 1.5 ml tube.   Add 40 μl of 3 M NaOAc and 800 μl of 100% ethanol. After inverting several times, precipitate the mixture overnight at -20 °C.   Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and throw away the supernatant.   Add 800 μl of 70% ethanol and gently inverting.   Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and throw away the supernatant.   Add 800 μl of 100% ethanol and gently inverting.   Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and throw away the supernatant.   Dry the HBV DNA pellet for 5~10 min (air-drying) and dissolve in 15 μl of TE buffer. Store HBV DNA at 4 °C until use.      Southern blot assay (gel transfer)   Separate HBV DNA (procedure B, step 18) on 0.8% agarose gel for 2 h at 89 V.   After electrophoresis, transfer the gel to tray and add transfer solution (I) to soak the gel.   Incubate for 10 min on shaker and rinse the gel with distilled water.   Add transfer solution (II) and incubate for 45 min on shaker.   Rinse with distilled water and add transfer solution (III).   Incubate over 30 min on shaker and rinse the gel with distilled water.",
    "Transfer the gel to Hybond-N+ membrane for overnight using capillary method (Figure 1) and bake the membrane to fix the HBV DNA for 2 h in 80 °C dry oven.   Place membrane in hybridization bottle contained with 25 ml hybridization solution and incubates the membrane for 4 h in 42 °C hybridization chamber (pre-hybridization step).       The construction of the HBV probe   To construct a template for the HBV specific probe, digest HBV 1.2mer replicon with Aat II and Hind III for 2 h at 37 °C and gel purification (Ahn et al., 2015).   To synthesis HBV specific probe, mix the 48 ng of template (step 8) and 80 ng of random primer in 50 μl of distilled water.  Note: Step 10 should be carried out during pre-hybridization step.   Heat the probe mixtures for 5 min at 100 °C and snap cooling on ice for 5 min.   After spin down, add 5ul of 10x Klenow buffer, 2.5 μl of the dNTPs mixtures (2.5 mM, except dCTP), 5 μl of 32P-labled dCTP (50 μCi=5 μl/labeling), and 1 μl of Klenow fragment in probe mixtures.   Incubate the probe mixture for 30 min at 37 °C.   Remove the non-labeled probe using Quick Spin Columns for radiolabeled DNA purification.      Southern blot assay (membrane hybridization)   Replace pre-warmed 25 ml of hybridization solution with 32P-labled HBV probe and incubate overnight in 42 °C hybridization chamber.   After hybridization step, wash the membrane with washing solution (I) for 15~20 min in 63 °C hybridization chamber.  Note: If need more washing step, repeat wash with washing solution (II). Steps 9~16 should be performed in the Radio isotope room.   Expose membrane to film and incubate overnight at -80 °C deep freezer. Then, develop the film."
