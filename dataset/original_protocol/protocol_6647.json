    "Collagen I coatingCoat the 35 mm glass bottom cell culture dish with 1 ml rat-tail collagen I diluted in PBS (25 µg/ml). Incubate the 35 mm glass bottom cell culture dish coated with 1 ml collagen I at 37 °C, for 1 h.Wash the 35 mm glass bottom cell culture dish twice with 1 ml pre-warm PBS and aspirate off PBS buffer.Note: Collagen I must be kept on ice to avoid polymerization and PBS must be kept at 37 °C.Cell transfection and seedingRetrieve culture plate from incubator, aspirate off media, and wash twice cells with 1 ml pre-warm PBS.Detach SKBr3 cells (80-90% confluency) by adding 1 ml Trypsin-EDTA and incubate the cells at 37 °C, for 5 min.Neutralize trypsinization reaction with supplemented culture medium (10% FBS) when most of the cells (> 90%) are detached.Determine cell density with hemocytometer.Transfer (1 x 106 cells per sample) into the microcentrifuge tubes.Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Gently resuspend cell pellet in 100 μl nucleofector solution V at room temperature. The solution V is provided with the nucleofector Kit V.Combine 100 μl of cell suspension with 3 μg DNA of GFP-Rab4.Transfer cell/DNA suspension into certified cuvette provided with nucleofector Kit V (sample must cover the bottom of the cuvette without air bubbles). Close the cuvette with the cap.Select the appropriate Nucleofector® Program X-005 on the Nucleofector® 2b device.Insert the cuvette with cell/DNA suspension into the Nucleofector® Cuvette Holder and apply the selected program by pressing the X-button.Take the cuvette out of the holder once the program is finished.Immediately add 500 μl of the culture medium (10% FBS) to the cuvette.",
    "Use the supplied pipettes to transfer the sample (600 µl final volume) into the collagen I pre-coated 35 mm glass bottom cell culture dish prepared in Procedure A.Add 2 ml supplemented culture medium with 10% FBS per 35 mm glass bottom cell culture dish and incubate at 37 °C, for 24 h.Note: Avoid repeated aspiration of the sample in Step B14.Cell washing and stimulationRetrieve the 35 mm glass bottom cell culture dish from incubator, aspirate off media, and wash twice cells with 1 ml pre-warm PBS.Add 2 ml pre-warm culture medium (10% serum)Add HGF at 0.5 nM (or any other growth factor) for 20 min to stimulate the cells. An unstimulated condition is needed as a negative control, to evaluate the effect of Met receptor tyrosine kinase activation with HGF.Note: HGF must be kept on ice and PBS and supplemented culture medium at 37 °C.Microscope setup for time-lapse imaging in 3D (Figure 1 and Video 1)Microscope setupTurn on the motorized Inverted microscope Axiovert 200 M and the connected computer.Select the appropriate stage holder and the 100x plan Apochromat NA 1.4 objective.Turn on the temperature unit and the CO2 control module, set temperature at 37 °C, humidity > 80% and CO2 at 5%. Warm up for approximately 2 h.Live-cell imaging in 3D Open the AxioVision software and choose Multidimensional Acquisition module.Place the 35 mm glass bottom cell culture dish on the plate holder. Focus on the selected cells.Set up the cell duration of acquisition for 2 min with a capturing interval of 4 s and 10 of Z sections with 0.5 μm spacing.Acquire single cell images in 3D (X, Y, Z) and analyze them in real-time.Note: The exposure time parameter varied slightly between experiments and depends on the transfection efficiency.",
    "Depending of the size of the cell additional Z sections may be required.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201015/20201015105614_6390.jpgFigure 1.
