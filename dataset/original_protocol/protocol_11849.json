    "All the procedure including animal subjects have been approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University.\n1. Bioluminescence reporters\nNOTE: The luciferase reporter is suitable for measuring the rapid dynamics of promoter activity by fusing the degradation signal. Moreover, the luciferase fusion reporter enables monitoring of the protein dynamics in the single cell. Both types of reporters are available for mono-layer culture (dissociation culture) and tissue culture (slice culture) experiment.\nReporter for monitoring Dll1 promoter activity17\n\tNOTE: To monitor the rapid changes in gene expression, the rapid-response and unstable reporter is essential. Firefly luciferase (Fluc) shows rapid maturation compared with fluorescein reporters. Because ubiquitin fused luciferase reporter (Ub-Fluc) shows rapid degradation and rapid-turnover, it is very useful to monitor the dynamic gene expression in living cells20.\n\t\nUse Dll1 promoter-driven destabilized luciferase reporter, ubiquitinated luciferase (pDll1-Ub-Fluc, Figure 1A upper panel), to monitor rapid changes in Dll1 expression at a transcriptional level17.\nGenerate a transgenic mouse line carrying pDll1-Ub-Fluc for the stable expression of this reporter.\nReporter for monitoring Dll1 protein dynamics17.\n\t\nFor generation of knock-in mice, insert the luciferase cDNA into the 3´ termini of the Dll1 coding region so that Dll1-luciferase fusion protein is expressed (Dll1-Fluc reporter, Figure 1A, lower panel)17.\nMonitor the expression dynamics of Dll1 at protein levels by measuring the luciferase activity.\nFor monitoring Dll1 protein dynamics at tissue levels, introduce the Dll1-Fluc reporter into NPCs in the embryonic telencephalon by in utero electroporation.\n2. Bioluminescence imaging system\nConstruct a bioluminescence live-imaging system using an inverted microscope installed with a highly sensitivity, water-cooled CCD camera. In order to reduce the noise and obtain high sensitivity, cool the camera with chilled water provided by the water circulator at an optimized temperature of -90 °C.",
    "For the live cell/tissue imaging, install the incubation system, controlling the temperature and mixed gas, to the microscope stage.\nFor imaging the expression of destabilized luciferase reporter, use high numerical angle (NA: 1.30) 40x oil-immersion objective lens. The working distance of this lens is 0.2 mm, it is available for not only mono-layer cell culture but also slice culture.\nFor dual monitoring of luciferase and fluorescein reporter expression, install the LED illumination device to the light path of the microscope.\nControl the time-lapse imaging with a software associated with the microscope (e.g., Multidimensional acquisition program of MetaMorph software).\nPrepare the entire system in a dark room, because the signal of the destabilized luciferase reporter is very faint, and to avoid the extraneous light prevent the acquisition.\n3. Neural Stem/Progenitor Cell (NPC) dissociation cultures\nPreparation of culture media, dishes, and reagents for NPC dissociation culture\n\t\nPrepare N2/B27 media for culturing neural stem/progenitor cells with a final concentration of 1x N2, 1x B27, 1 mM N-acetylcysteine, 10 ng/mL bFGF and 50 U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin in DMEM/F12 media.\nPrepare papain solution for dissociation containing 7 U/mL papain, 0.006% DNase and 1 mM N-acetylcysteine in EBSS media.\nPrepare 100 mM of luciferin sodium solution for luminescence imaging. Dilute 100 mM luciferin solution in N2/B27 media to a final concentration of 1 mM.\n\t\tNOTE: Luciferin shows auto-fluorescein itself. In the case of luciferase-fluorescence dual imaging, especially EGFP, lowering the concentration of luciferin to 0.5 mM is better.\nCoat a 35-mm glass bottom dishes (glass diameter 27-mm) with 40 μg/mL of poly-L-lysine (PLL) solution for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, wash the plates 3x with PBS and let it dry.\nDissection of embryos and dissociation of NPCs",
    "After euthanizing a pregnant pDll1-Ub-luc transgenic mouse (embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5)) by CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation, cut through the abdomen and take out the uterus.\n\t\tNOTE: Researchers must follow the regulations and guidelines of animal research committee of their institution. If anesthesia or pain relief drugs are used, use them properly.\nTransfer the uterus in a 10 cm Petri dish containing 25 mL of ice-cold PBS. Take out the embryos from the uterus in ice-cold PBS, using micro scissors and fine forceps.\nCut off the head of each embryo using scissors and transfer it to 10 cm Petri dishes containing ice-cold DMEM/F12. Remove the epidermis and cartilage surrounding the brain and transfer the brain to 35 mm Petri dish containing ice-cold 3 mL of N2/B27 media.\nCut off the right and left telencephalon from diencephalon (Figure 1Ba-f, C,D). Remove the meninges covering the surface of telencephalon using fine forceps (Figure 1Bi). Using fine forceps again, take out the dorso-lateral part of cortex from the telencephalon (Figure 1Bg,h,j-l E).\nTransfer the tissues to new 1.5 mL tubes using a P1000 pipette and remove any extra medium with a P200 pipette. Add 0.1 mL of papain solution per brain tissue (a pair of the cortex). After 15 min of incubation at 24 °C, gently pipette the samples 10 times with P1000 pipette. Incubate the samples again for 15 min at 24 °C.\nGently pipette the samples 10 times with P1000 pipette. Centrifuge the samples for 3 min at 400 x g and room temperature (RT). Discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM/F12 media to the pellet. Gently pipette 10 times with P1000 pipette. Centrifuge the samples for 3 min at 400 x g and RT. Discard the supernatant. Repeat this at least 2 more times.",
    "To the pellet, add 0.5 mL of N2/B27 media containing 1 mM luciferin and mix well. Seed the cells (1 x 106 cells) to a PLL-coated glass bottom dish. Culture the cells in the CO2 incubator for 1 h. Once the cells adhere to the dish, add 2 mL of N2/B27 media, containing 1 mM luciferin.\nVisualization of luciferase reporter expression in NPC dissociation culture\n\t\nStart up the luminescence live-imaging system before performing the dissection. For NPC culture, set the temperature of the stage incubator at 37 °C and set the setting of the gas mixture 20% O2, 5% CO2.\nPut the immersion oil to the objective lens.

Stretch a grass capillary with heat and cut and polish the tip of it with the polishing machine.",
    "Prepare a mixture of DNA with dye (e.g., Trypan blue). The concentration of each DNA is 1 μg/μL in PBS and add the dye to a final concentration of 10%.\n\t\tNOTE: Use the mixture of DNA for visualization of Dll1 protein dynamics as follows: Dll1-Fluc (Dll1 protein reporter, Figure 2E upper) and pEF-EGFP (EF promoter driven EGFP expression vector, Figure 2E lower), monitoring the location and morphology of transfected cells.\nPrepare two types of anesthetics: 3.88 mg/mL of pentobarbital and 0.12% of xylazine, in sterile 1x PBS.\nUse the sterile instruments and surgical gloves during operation.\nIn utero electroporation\n\t\nAnesthetize a time pregnant ICR mouse (E12.5) by intraperitoneal administration of anesthetics with 500 μL of 3.88 mg/mL pentobarbital and 500 μL of 0.12% xylazine.\n\t\tNOTE: Researchers must follow the regulation of animal experiments. If one needs to use anesthesia or pain relief drugs, use them properly.\nClip the hair and disinfect the skin with surgical scrub.\nCheck for the lack of toe pinch response. Once pedal reflex is not observed, make a 2-3 cm cut through the abdomen along the midline. Put gauzes around the dissected part and wet the gauzes with warm PBS not to dry up the incision. Take out the right uterine horn gently with ring-shaped forceps and count the number of embryos.\nInject 1-2 μL of the mixed DNA into the ventricle of the telencephalon of embryos gently with micro capillary.\n\t\tNOTE: When the injection is successful, one can see the blue color of the dye over the surface of the uterus.",
    "Wet the uterus and the electrode before providing the voltage pulses, and then hold the head of an embryo gently. Set the positively charged electrode to the side of the hemisphere, in which the DNA was injected. Ensure that the condition of the pulse of electroporation is 30-50 V for 50 ms, the interval of the pulses is 1 s (50 ms charge and 950 ms non-charge). Provide 5 pulses to one embryo and check that bubbles are generated from the negatively charged electrode.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the direction of the electrode: DNA is incorporated into cells on the side of positive electrode. During this procedure, do not move the position of the electrode.\nRepeat the steps 4.2.3-4.2.4 for other embryos and return the uterine horn to the abdominal cavity. Carry out the same procedure to the embryos in the left uterine horn.\nAfter putting back the left side, suture the incision by a silk suture (4-0) with a needle (17 mm). Before closing the incision completely, put warm PBS into the abdominal cavity\n\t\tNOTE: The interval between sutures is around 2 mm.\nAfter finishing the surgery, place the mouse on a heating pad for post anesthesia recovery. House the mouse individually.\n\t\tNOTE: Researchers must follow their local instiutional regulation of animal experiments. If one needs to use pain relief drugs, use them properly.\n5.

    "NOTE: To use oxygen gas safely, store the O2 cylinder in the cylinder cabinet and monitor the oxygen concentration in the air by an oxygen concentration meter.\nDilute 100 mM luciferin sodium solution in enriched media to a final concentration of 1 mM.\n\t\tNOTE: Luciferin shows auto-fluorescein itself. In the case of luciferase-fluorescence dual imaging, especially EGFP, lower concentration of luciferin (0.5 mM) is better.\nSet the multi-gas incubator at 37 °C by 40% O2 and 5% CO2.\nDissection of embryos and examination of the expression of fluorescent reporter\n\t\nAfter euthanizing the pregnant mouse to which the reporters (E13.5) are introduced by in utero electroporation (step 4.2), cut through the abdomen and take out the uterus.\n\t\tNOTE: Researchers must follow the regulation of animal experiments. If using anesthesia or pain relief drugs, use them properly.\nTransfer the uterus to a 10 cm Petri dish containing PBS. Take out the embryos from uterus in PBS, using micro scissors and fine forceps. Cut off the head of each embryo and transfer to a 10 cm Petri dish containing DMEM/F12 media bubbled with 100% O2 gas. Remove epidermis and cartilage surrounding the brain in DMEM/F12 media.\nPut the brain on the lid of the Petri dish with ring-shaped forceps and set the lid on the fluorescence stereoscopic microscope stage.
