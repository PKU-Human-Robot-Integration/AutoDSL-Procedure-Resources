    "1. Preparation of solutions and materials (see Table of Materials)\n6-well tissue-culture plate substrate-coating\nThaw the coating substrate on ice or at 4 °C.\nPrepare a 1:100 coating substrate dilution in cold DMEM/F12 medium. Mix the solution by slow pipetting.\nTransfer 2 mL of the coating substrate solution (step 1.1.2) per well of a 6-well tissue culture plate.\nImmediately place the coated tissue culture plate in the cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 7 h and use within 7 days.\nhiPSC-CM culture medium\nAdd 10 mL of CM media supplement thawed at 4 °C to 500 mL of CM base medium. Store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nAliquot required amount of media for the day and bring to room temperature before use.\nhiPSC-CM thawing medium: Prepare fresh by mixing hiPSC-CM culture medium (step 1.2) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Bring the media to room temperature prior to thawing of CMs for suspension.\nFibronectin 1 mg/mL stock solution: Aliquot 200 µL into 1.5 mL sterile microfuge tubes and stored at 4 °C for later use. Prepare working solution of 50 µg/mL concentration freshly on ice.\nMultiwell cleaning solution: Combine 0.5 g of enzymatic detergent with 50 mL of sterile double distilled water (ddH2O). Vortex to mix the contents. Filter and store at 4 °C for up to a week.\n2. Pre-plating of cryopreserved hiPSC-CM for maturation (Figure 1)",
    "NOTE: This section is intended for thawing and culturing hiPSC-CMs that were differentiated using the feeder-free monolayer method3,16 and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen 10 days post-differentiation at 1-2 million cells/vial. Cells from one vial are plated into two substrate-coated wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate. Cardiomyocytes tend to settle at the bottom of the tube so gentle mixing at the time of pre-plating is important for achieving even cell density across wells.\nAliquot 2 mL of FBS per vial of hiPSC-CMs being thawed into a 15 mL conical tube and bring to room temperature.\nThaw vials of cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs by placing them in a 37 °C water bath and swirl gently for even thawing for no more than 3 min.\nImmediately transfer the vial contents to the tube containing FBS (see step 2.1), mix by swirling and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of hiPSC-CM thawing medium (see step 1.3) per vial thawed. Use a transfer pipette to resuspend the pellet by gentle trituration. Assess cell viability.\nAdd additional 3 mL of thawing medium per vial of hiPSC-CM thawed in step 2.4 and suspend gently using a transfer pipette to further dissociate cell clumps.\nDispense 2 mL of cell suspension gently into each well of substrate-coated 6-well plates (see step 1.1). Place in cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nReplace with fresh hiPSC-CM culturing medium after 24 h and 3 times weekly thereafter for 20 days.\n\tNOTE: Cells should adhere to the substrate coating by 24 h and beat spontaneously at 48 h post-plating (See Video 1 and Video 2).\n3. Multiwell MEA plate sterilization and coating (Figure 2 and Figure 3)",
    "NOTE: The protocol described here is for preparing 24-well MEA plates with 12 micro gold PEDOT-coated electrodes on glass for hiPSC-CM plating. Avoid touching the bottom of the plate as this may damage the electrodes.\nTwo days prior to cell plating, add 0.5 mL of hiPSC-CM culture medium (see step 1.2) to each well and perform a baseline recording to verify signal-to-noise ratio for quality check of the MEAs.\nAspirate the media, rinse with sterile ddH2O and sterilize under UV light inside a laminar flow hood overnight.\nThe day prior to cell plating, add 0.1 mL of FBS to each well for hydrophilic treatment of MEA surfaces. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. This step is necessary for cell attachment.\nAspirate the FBS and rinse with 0.5 mL of sterile ddH2O per well. Repeat one more time.\nLeave the plate to dry in the laminar flow hood overnight.\nPrepare a working dilution of 50 µg/mL fibronectin in cold DMEM/F12 medium from the stock (see step 1.4). Keep the solution on ice.\nPipette 5 µL of the working fibronectin dilution (see 3.6) and carefully dispense the droplet to the center of each well to cover all 12 electrodes. It is important to work swiftly across the 24 wells to prevent the droplet from drying.\nImmediately place the fibronectin-coated multiwell MEA plate on a raised surface inside a humidifying chamber containing sterile ddH2O to cover the entire dish surface. Place the chamber with the multiwell MEA plate for 3 h in the cell culture incubator.\n\tNOTE: Placing the 24 well MEA plate in a humidifying chamber is critical to prevent fibronectin droplets from drying out during the incubation period.\n4. hiPSC-CM dissociation and plating on Multiwell MEA plate (Figure 3)",
    "NOTE: Start this step about 1 h prior to MEA fibronectin incubation is complete. Ensure that the cell dissociation solution is at 37 °C and the iPSC-CM thawing medium is at room temperature. Dissociation methods have been optimized for 30 days post-differentiated hiPSC-CMs cultured on substrate-coated 6-well plates (see step 2) to obtain about 90% viable CMs for MEA plating. Care should be taken not to introduce air bubbles while trituration to prevent cell death.\nAspirate the culture medium from each well of the 6-well tissue culture dish with 30 day post-differentiated hiPSC-CM culture (see step 2.7) and wash with 2 mL of sterile D-PBS per well.\nAdd 1 mL of pre-warmed cell dissociation solution (see Table of Materials) per well and incubate for 4 min at 37 °C. Use a transfer pipette to gently triturate to loosen cells for dissociation. If most of the cells are still adherent, incubate for another 3 min at 37 °C and triturate again. This additional incubation should help for maximal cell recovery. Do not incubate for more than 7 min as this might result in low cell viability.\nUsing a transfer pipette, pool all the dissociated cells into a conical tube containing hiPSC-CM thawing medium (see step 1.3). It is recommended to suspend the cells in at least twice the volume of media (2 mL per well being harvested) to block the activity of the cell dissociation solution.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the solution carefully as the pellet is loosely attached to the surface and resuspend in 0.1 mL of hiPSC-CM thawing medium. Use a transfer pipette to resuspend the pellet a few times by gentle trituration.",
    "Aliquot 2 µL of dissociated cells and dilute with 18 µL of media in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube. Add 20 µL of Trypan Blue and mix for cell count and viability assessment.\nAdjust the cell density to 6,000 cells/µL by adding the appropriate volume of hiPSC-CM thawing medium. Suspend the pellet by gentle flicking a few times. The hiPSC-CMs easily detach from glass surfaces especially when plated at high densities. We have optimized the seeding density and plating conditions to achieve 15 days of electrical recordings.\nWhen ready, bring the multiwell MEA plate into the laminar flow hood for cell seeding. It is critical to perform the following two steps one well at a time to prevent the fibronectin from drying.\n\t\nCarefully remove the fibronectin droplet using a P10 pipette without touching the electrodes.\nImmediately dispense a 5 µL cell droplet (30,000 cells) to the center of the well of the MEA plate covering all 12 electrodes. Repeat the step until all the 24 wells are plated. Intermittent mixing of cell suspension by flicking is recommended.\nPlace the multiwell MEA plate back in the loosely covered humidifying chamber and return to the cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h for cell attachment.\nCarefully add 200 µL of hiPSC-CM thawing medium to each well without disturbing the cells using a P200 pipette. Add the media dropwise to the side of the well.\nPlace the multiwell MEA plate back in the cell culture incubator.\nReplace with fresh hiPSC-CM culture medium at 24 h post plating. Spontaneous beating of cardiomyocytes can be observed at this point (See Video 3).\nChange the media every 2 days until the end of experiments.\n5. hiPSC-CM electroporation and signal acquisition (Figures 4 – 6)",
    "NOTE: This protocol is for simultaneous recording of high-throughput electrode signals (12 sites for each of the 24 wells). The 24-well multiwell MEA system is used with the acquisition software (see Table of Materials). All MEA recordings are conducted at 37 °C.\nTurn on the interface board and initiate the acquisition software. Allow enough time for the multiwell MEA headstage to reach 37 °C temperature (see arrow no. 1 in Figure 4).\nInsert multiwell MEA plate from step 4 into the multiwell MEA headstage by placing it covered over the recording platform and click the Insert button (see arrow no. 2 in Figure 4). Allow for temperature to stabilize before starting recordings.\nAdjust acquisition and electroporation settings\nClick on the Define Experimental Flow icon (see arrow no. 3 in Figure 4) and set recording time to 2 min or as desired.\nClick on the Data Acquisition Setup icon (see arrow no. 4 in Figure 4) and set sampling rate to 20 kHz, high-pass filter to 0.1 Hz and low-pass filter to 3500 Hz.\nClick on the Stimulator Settings icon (see Figure 5). Under the Stimulus Definition tab, define stimulation as biphasic symmetric voltage pulses of 1 mV, 1 ms and 1 Hz. Under the Stimulation Electrodes tab, select electroporation sites by highlighting all relevant electrodes.\nClick the Explore button to visualize signals in all wells. Verify signal quality and steady state conditions. Take notes on electrodes with FP signals in the mV range. Click the same button to stop the exploration. No data has been recorded up to this point.",
    "Start recording by clicking on the Go! button. The electrodes in each well will show FP signals in the raw data window (Figure 6). After 30 s of recording, click on the Stimulate button and allow electroporation to take place on the selected sites for 30 s; then, click on the same button to stop stimulation and continue recording for the remaining 60 s.\n\tNOTE: The recorded file can be played back by switching to ‘Replayer Mode’ in the ‘Application’ dropdown menu.\n6. Multiwell MEA plate cleaning for reuse\nAfter final experiments, clean all the wells in the multiwell plate by aspirating all media contents from each well and carefully avoiding touching the electrode surface.\nAdd 1 mL of sterile ddH2O per well. Aspirate and repeat once.\nAdd 0.3 mL of multiwell cleaning solution (see step 1.5) per well. Incubate overnight at room temperature to dislodge cells and debris.\nThe following morning, aspirate the solution and rinse with 1 mL of sterile ddH2O. Incubate for 5 - 7 min and aspirate. Repeat 5 times.\nAdd 0.5 mL of sterile ddH2O per well. Record the baseline of the cleaned multiwell plate for quality check of the cleaned MEAs (Figure 7).\nStore at 4 °C until ready to use.\n7. Data file conversion and export\nNOTE: Four data files will be generated for every recording: MWR, MWC, MWD, and MWS files. Using the converter software, the MWD file can be converted to H5 file for subsequent analysis using custom-built script (see Supplementary File 1).\nInitiate the converter software (see Table of Materials).\nSelect Set Input Path from the File menu. Select folder containing data files of interest.\nSelect Set Output Path from the File menu. Select folder where converted files are to be saved.\nHighlight MWD file of interest.",
    "Click the EXPORT to HDF5 button.\n8. Data segmentation and analysis (Figures 8-10)\nNOTE: Matlab-based custom software is used to segment and extract various FP and AP data parameters. Software is available on demand.\nRun the Waveform Analysis code using Matlab (see Figure 8 for a view of the GUI’s main window).\nClick on File and select Process .h5.\nFind and select the mwd.h5 file created according to step 7 above.\nClick on the Save Directory button to change the storage location of the output files.\nCreate a signal processing queue by selecting electrode/well combinations of interest and then clicking on the Queue button. Repeat this step to append more electrode/well combinations to be processed to the queue.\nEdit the queue by clicking directly on Med Name / Med Concentration if cells were treated with drugs (Figure 8).\nOnce the queue is final, click the Initialize Waveforms button. This will start the preliminary processing in which signals are identified and extracted for segmentation.\nClick on the Zoom In button and select the action potential area of interest with the cursor (Figure 9).\nClick the Keep button and review the panels. Peaks (red ‘x’) and troughs (yellow circles) are detected for every waveform and the normalized action potentials are superimposed. Click the Keep button and move on to the next trace in the queue (Figure 10).\nRepeat steps 8.8-8.9 for the rest of the electrode/well combination signals in the queue.\n\tNOTE: A .csv file will be generated with APD parameters measured for every waveform. A .mat file for each .h5 file is also saved to allow additional processing of segmented data."
