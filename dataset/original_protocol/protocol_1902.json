To make it easier to find HeLa cells undergoing mitosis and to ensure the experimental efficiency, incubate cells for 2–3 h after rinsing.\nNote: Make sure to rinse the cells to remove any debris that could block the micropipette.\nPrepare and mount micropipette\nTiming: 15–30 min\nMake micropipette from borosilicate glass capillary tubes (TW150-4, World Precision Instruments, Inc.) using the micropipette puller and microforge, as described in the following. Then mount the micropipette onto the pipette holder that allows fine control of the pipette movements in three dimensions.\nFabricating glass micropipettes (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]\nStretch the micropipette from a glass capillary (i.d./o.d. = 1.12 mm/1.5 mm) using a micropipette puller. To fabricate a pipette with an inner diameter of 1–2 μm and a taper length around 2 mm, we adopt the two-stage pull mode and use the following settings—Distance 1: 3 mm, Distance 2: 6 mm, Heat 1: 65 V, Heat 2: 60 V, Weights: 250 g.",
    "Note: The shape of micropipette depends strongly on its properties and the parameter settings of micropipette puller.\nCut the taper of the pulled micropipette at the desired micropipette radius (about 1.5–2 μm) by placing it against a hot metal wire in microforge. Then polish the end of micropipette by bringing it close to the heated bead to remove the sharp edges.\nCritical: For micropipette tip with a radius too large, the whole cell can be easily swallowed into the micropipette even for a small aspiration pressure. By contrast, membrane-cortex detachment occurs frequently due to the higher aspiration pressure needed to suck the cell into the micropipette tip with a radius too small. It thus goes against the experiment measuring for the tip radius which is set too large or too small. According to our experience, the appropriate radius of the micropipette tip, depending on the cell type, ranges from 1/4 to 1/3 of the radius of the HeLa cell.\nPlace the micropipette in micropipette puller. Adjust the position of micropipette so that its tip protrudes about 5 mm beyond the spiral-shaped heating elements of micropipette puller, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nHeat up the tip of the micropipette and bend it using another obsolete micropipette to an angle (typically 35–40 degrees) at which the tip will be allowed to approach the cell at a very shallow angle, as close to horizontal as possible.\nOptional: Micropipette can be passivated with, e.g., a β-casein solution to reduce adhesion of cells to the glass.\nCritical: The micropipette tip should be smooth to make a good seal to the plasma membrane.\nCritical: Keep the length of the bent part of micropipette tip as short as possible (5–8 mm) to increase the operating space as much as possible.",
    "Note: When handling a micropipette, great care should be taken to avoid touching the tip. This will break the fragile tip and lead to the risk of inserting it into the body.\nNote: The fabricated micropipette can be stored for months at room temperature in a dust-free container. If no dust-free storage container is available, micropipettes have to be prepared on the day of the experiment. We recommend having extra on hand in case one is broken.\nNote: The micropipette tip can be also bent by using the microforge. In this approach, the filament of the microforge is heated up and progressively brought closer to the micropipette tip until it bends to the required angle (Backholm and Bäumchen, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. The process of fabricating glass micropipettes (speed 2×), related to step 4 in the section of Step-by-step method details\nFilling the micropipette.\nPrepare a solution composed of 70% PBS and 30% FBS (10 mL).\nNote: The solution should be supplemented with 30% FBS so as to allow the cell membrane to move smoothly into the micropipette.\nImmerse the micropipette tip in the solution, which rises up to fill the tip by capillary action.\nBackfill the shank of the micropipette using a microelectrode filling needle and a syringe until a hemisphere droplet is formed at the back end of the micropipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: Great care must be taken to ensure that there are no air bubbles in the micropipette. When backfilling the micropipette, make sure that a hemisphere droplet is finally formed at the back end of the micropipette. This will avoid trapping air bubbles at the joint where the micropipette and the pipette holder meet.",
    "Note: The micropipette can also be filled from the back end by gently tapping on its shank to get rid of the air bubbles in the tip.\nMount the micropipette onto the pipette holder. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]\nDismount the pipette holder from micromanipulator and take it out from the living cell workstation.\nPosition the pipette holder so that its outlet is flush with the liquid level in the water reservoirs.\nSwitch the hand valves #1 and #2 to connect the micropipette holder to one of the water reservoirs.\nLoosen the micropipette holder tip and squeeze out a hemispherical water droplet at the holder outlet by slowly lowering the height of the micropipette holder (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nInsert the micropipette to the micropipette holder, and tighten the micropipette holder to ensure firm grip and good sealing. Wipe off any excess fluid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCritical: Make sure that there are no air bubbles trapped during the micropipette installation.\nNote: Do not tighten the knob of micropipette holder too much to avoid breaking the micropipette.\nRemount the micropipette holder onto the micromanipulator.\nCritical: Make sure that the micropipette holder is tightly clamped to reduce fluctuations of the micropipette during the experiment.\nCritical: Control the hand valves #1 and #2 to prevent water from flowing out before remounting the micropipette holder.\nNote: Carefully monitor the position of the micropipette in case it is broken during the entire experimental procedure.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1497-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Micropipette fabrication and installation\n(A) Heat up the tip of the micropipette with the spiral-shaped heating elements of micropipette puller and bend it to a required angle using another obsolete micropipette.\n(B) Fill the micropipette until a hemisphere droplet is formed at the back end of the micropipette.\n(C) Insert the micropipette to the micropipette holder.",
    "(D) Assembly of components including micropipette holder, micropipette, and connecting tubing.\nLocate the micropipette and calibrate the micropipette aspiration system\nTiming: 15 min\nMove the micropipette tip into the center of the field of view, and focus on the tip. Then calibrate the micropipette aspiration system to ensure a null-pressure condition when the micropipette tip contacts with the cell surface.\nLocate the micropipette in the microscope field. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7]\nTurn on the anti-vibration table.\nPut the culture dish with HeLa cells on the stage of the microscope, and observe using the 10× objective in the phase contrast mode.\nAdjust the angle (40–45 degrees) of the pipette holder to ensure the micropipette tip is positioned approximately parallel to the bottom of the plate.\nBring the micropipette to a safe distance above the culture dish and into the field of view using the coarse adjustment on the micromanipulator. Then set this reference point as the home position and store this position on the micromanipulator keyboard.\nSlowly bring down the micropipette until it enters the culture medium.\nUse the micromanipulator in fine adjustment mode to lower the tip to a point just above the cell layer (50–100 μm). And then move the micropipette tip to the center of microscope field.\nCritical: Once the micropipette tip is immersed into the culture medium, use the fine adjustment on the micromanipulator to lower the tip to minimize the potential for breaking it on the bottom of the dish.\nSet this reference point as the target position, and store this position on the micromanipulator keyboard.\nCheck the micropipette.\nFocus on the micropipette tip by adjusting the 10× objective.\nSwitch the hand valves #1 and #2 to connect a water reservoir #1 to the micropipette.",
    "Note: Make sure that the two water reservoirs are isolated from each other in this inspection.\nApply a pressure (e.g., 1,000 Pa) to the micropipette by raising the water reservoir to check whether the tip is blocked, damaged or poorly polished.\nCritical: Ensure the pressure is large enough to form a conical-shaped jet at the micropipette tip (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) especially when checking whether the tip is damaged or poorly polished. Specifically, the shape of the jet changes if the tip is damaged or poorly polished (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: Alternatively, one can also switch the objective to higher magnification (e.g., 100×) to check whether the micropipette is damaged (right panel in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nReturn the water reservoir #1 to its original position after the inspection.\nCalibrating the micropipette aspiration system. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.11]\nAdd 25 μL polystyrene microbeads (1 μm, 5% w/v; NanoMicro Tech., China) diluted 1 : 400 in filtered sterilized water to the culture dish.\nCarefully move and position the micropipette tip next to a suspended microbead.\nSwitch hand valve #1 to connect the water reservoir #2 to both water reservoir #1 and micropipette.\nNote: Make sure that the two water reservoirs connect to each other during calibrating the micropipette aspiration system.\nAdjust the height of the water reservoir #1 so that this microbead does not move toward or away from the micropipette tip.\nSwitch the hand valve #1 so that only the water reservoir #2 connects to the micropipette after calibrating the micropipette aspiration system.\nCritical: During this calibration process, care should be taken that no microbeads stick to the walls of the micropipette. If the microbeads stick to the walls of the micropipette, connect the 50 mL syringe to the micropipette by switching the hand valve #2, and then gently pump the syringe to flush out the microbeads.",
    "Critical: Remember to switch the hand valve #1 to disconnect the two water reservoirs and to allow water only flow from the water reservoir #2 to the micropipette once the micropipette aspiration system has been calibrated. Forgetting this operation will directly lead to errors in calculating aspiration pressure.\nNote: Calibrate the micropipette aspiration system before each experiment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1497-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Check the micropipette\nCheck the micropipette by directly observing the shape of the jet at the micropipette tip (left) and by closely scrutinizing with higher-magnification objective (right). Here, it shows a finely and a poorly polished micropipette tip in (A) and (B), respectively.\nScale bars, 100 μm (left), 10 μm (right).\nMeasure the Laplace pressure of HeLa cells undergoing cytokinesis in media with different osmolarities using micropipette aspiration experiment\nTiming: 1 day\nDetermine the Laplace pressure of cytokinetic cells incubated in hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic medium by virtue of the micropipette aspiration experiment, the image and data analysis, as well as the medium replacement device.\nPrepare the experimental media with different osmolarities.\nDetermine the mass of sucrose for the sucrose solutions with different osmolarities according to the equations: mass of solute = molar mass × moles of solute, and osmolarity = molarity × n, where molarity = moles of solute / liter of solution, the van’t Hoff factor n = 1 for sucrose. For example, to prepare 1L of sucrose solution with osmolarity of 300 mOsm/L, we need dissolve 102.69 g (342.3 × 0.3) of sucrose in water.\nWeigh out sucrose of required mass into the beaker, then pour 500 mL of deionized water into the beaker and dissolve sucrose using magnetic stirrer.\nTransfer the sucrose solution into a 1L graduated cylinder, and then fill the graduated cylinder to the 1L mark with deionized water.",
    "Pour the solution back into the beaker followed by full agitation, and then store the sucrose solution for use.\nRepeat the steps 11a - 11d to prepare sucrose solutions with osmolarities of 120, 210, 300, 390, and 480 mOsm/L.\nMix the sucrose solutions with the isotonic culture medium (300 mOsm/L) in a ratio of 2 : 1 to establish 180, 240, 300, 360, and 420 mOsm/L media, wherein the osmolarities of the mixture is calculated by (osmolarity of sucrose solution × 2 + osmolarity of isotonic culture medium) / 3.\nPerform the micropipette aspiration experiment.

Then place it in the center of the visual field.\nCritical: In the process of moving the microscope state to find the desired cells, care the culture dish not to contact the micropipette tip.\nNote: Do not select the cells close to the blunt tips of syringe needles inserted in the cut lid.\nPosition the micropipette to the target position using the micromanipulator.\nSwitch to the 100× oil-immersion objective.\nNote: Add a drop of immersion oil on the 100× objective before switching.\nSlowly move the micropipette until its tip gently touches the cell membrane.",
    "When this cell starts forming cleavage furrow and enters into cytokinesis, grab the cell by applying suction with the water reservoir #2.\nCritical: Gently adjust the position of the water reservoir during the micropipette aspiration experiment.\nNote: The initially applied pressure for grabbing cell depends strongly on the cell type. For HeLa cells studied here, 10–15 mm of water pressure is a good choice.\nIncrease the suction pressure stepwise by changing the position of the water reservoir #2 until it reaches a critical value Pc, at which the aspirated part of the cell forms a hemisphere with the radius of the micropipette tip (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Start imaging and record the displacement of the water reservoir #2.\nNote: Start imaging and record the displacement at the same time.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S2. Aspirating a cell under the microscope (speed 2×), related to step 12\nFill the syringe #1 of the medium replacement device with prewarmed hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic media (37°C) as required.\nNote: Prewarm the hypotonic and hypertonic media to 37°C in a water bath kettle before using.\nPump out the original media with syringe #2, then inject the hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic media with syringe #1 as required. Keep adjusting the suction pressure to make the aspirated part of the cell in the micropipette to be roughly hemispherical in shape during exchanging media and throughout cytokinesis (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5C).\nCritical: Rapidly exchange media within, e.g., 20 s.\nRelease the cell when the contractile-ring contraction completes, and shift the micropipette to the home position.\nRepeat the steps c–m as many times as required for other cells undergoing cytokinesis.",
    "Critical: The cell culture dish needs to be replaced every time the micropipette aspiration experiment is repeated. Remember to replace the original medium in the syringe #1 with fresh, prewarmed medium as well.\nAfter the experiment, switch the hand valve #1 to disconnect the two water reservoirs from the micropipette, then unmount and empty the micropipette.\nCalculate the cortical tension and the Laplace pressure.\nOpen images using ImageJ, an open source image analysis software.\nSet the scale to micrometers using the Set Scale command from the main menu.\nNote: Do not skip step b.\nMeasure the radius Rp of the micropipette and the radius Rc of curvature of the interface in contact with micropipette, as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D.\nRetrieve the displacement data of water reservoir #2, and calculate the critical pressure Pc corresponding to each image processed above with ImageJ.\nNote: Make sure the points in time for both the processed images and retrieved displacement data are the same.\nCalculate the cortical tension from the Laplace equation Tc = Pc / [2(1 / Rp – 1 / Rc)] with the measured parameters (Maître et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Tinevez et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCalculate the Laplace pressure of the cell undergoing cytokinesis according to the equation PL = 2 Tc / Rc.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1497-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
