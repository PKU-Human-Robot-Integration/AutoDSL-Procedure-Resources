    "20 mg of fresh or frozen tumor tissues were resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer, on ice. The extaction buffer contains protease inhibitors.Tissues were mechanically ground using a homogenizer such as an ultraturax or a Precellys. With ultraturax an antifoam solution (Sigma-Aldrich - antifoam Y-30 Emulsion) is used.The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 6,000 rpm, at 4 °C.The supernatant was recovered. 10 μl supernatant is used to determinate the protein concentration using a protein assay such as BCA. The sample can be stored at -80 °C.Reconstitute a vial of Drabkin's reagent in 1 L of water, add 0.5 ml of Brij 35 solution 30%. This solution can be stored at room temperature for 6 months, protected from light.In parallel, resuspend hemoglobin (concentration of stock solution is 10 mg/ml) in the extraction buffer.Achieve an eight point standard curve using 2-fold serial dilutions of hemoglobin, in extraction buffer, and a high standard of 2,000 pg/μl is recommended. To obtain the concentration of 2,000 pg/μl, the working solution (10 mg/ml) must be diluted 5 times.Add 10 μl of sample or standards per well in triplicate.Add 100 μl of Drabkin’s reagent/Brij 35 solution 30%.Incubate 15 min at room temperature. The reaction is stable a couple of hours.Determine the optical density of each well, using a microplate reader set to 540 nm.Average the triplicate readings for each standard, control, and sample and subtract the average zero standard optical density.Create a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance for each standard on the y-axis against the concentration on the x-axis and draw a curve through the points on the graph.Hemoglobin concentration of samples must be divided by the protein concentration determined by BCA to obtain a result in microgram per micro liter per microgram of protein."
