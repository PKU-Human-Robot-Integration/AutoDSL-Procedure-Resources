  "procedures": [
    "All animal protocols and studies were approved by the University of Washington Office of Animal Welfare.\n1. Pre-operation (for All Surgeries)\nAnesthetize the rabbit with 30 mg/kg ketamine and 1.5 mg/kg xylazine by intramuscular injection (IM) in the paraspinous muscles.\n\t​NOTE: Food and water are not restricted before surgery.\nWhile waiting for sufficient depth of anesthesia, set up the tables in the preparation room and operating room (OR).\n\t\nPrepare the preparation room for shaving the rabbit's neck and the placement of the intravenous (IV) port in the ear (survival surgery only). Place the ophthalmic ointment, fentanyl patch (survival surgery), hair clippers, alcohol prep pad, 24-G x ¾\" catheter, injection port, and surgical tape on the preparation table.\nIn the OR, set up the monitoring equipment and associated probes (electrocardiogram (EKG), pulse oximetry (SpO2), and temperature). Prepare the IV pump with a 100 mL saline IV bag with an 18-G or 19-G needle and set the flow rate as 10 mL/h/kg (survival surgery only). Set up the oxygen and isoflurane equipment with a nosecone (vein grafting or harvest surgeries).\n\t\t\nTo help secure the nosecone to the rabbit, loop a gauze strip around the tube that supplies gas to the nosecone. This loop should surround the tube where it attaches to the nosecone. The free ends of the gauze strip should both be approximately 45 cm long. Place the nosecone (with attached gauze) on the head end of table.\nTurn on the circulating water and/or forced air warming blanket on the OR table. On the warming blanket, position a rolled towel as a neck support and place the electrocautery dispersive electrode plate.",
    "As a local analgesic, combine in a syringe 1 mL of 2% lidocaine HCl and 1 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine HCl. Dilute the virus to the desired concentration (here, use 2 x 1011 viral particles/mL for HDAd) in sterile DMEM and keep on ice (gene transfer surgery only).\nAfter an adequate anesthetic depth is reached, prepare the rabbit for surgery.\n\t\t​NOTE: Test for the lack of a pedal withdrawal reflex to ensure adequate anesthetic depth. Continue to monitor the pedal reflex throughout the surgery.\n\t\t\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the rabbit's eyes.\nTo allow for the placement of a rectal temperature probe, press with gloved fingers just above the rectum and move fingers towards the anus to remove stooling from the rabbit's rectum.\nShave the rabbit from the sternal notch to the edge of mandible. Shave one ear for IV placement and the opposite ear for fentanyl patch administration (survival surgery only). Shave the left rear middle toes for the placement of the SpO2 probe.\nFor vector infusion surgery, intubate the rabbit. Use a 4 mm O.D./3 mm I.D. uncuffed endotracheal tube, threaded over an arthroscope. Place the rabbit in sternal recumbency and hyper-extend the neck. Hold the rabbit's mouth wide open and use the arthroscope to visualize the glottis and laryngeal folds. During the inspiration, gently insert the endotracheal tube through the larynx and into the trachea.\nFor the survival surgeries, place and secure a 24-G IV catheter into the rabbit's left ear vein and cap it with an injection port. Apply a 25 µg/h fentanyl patch to the rabbit's right ear.",
    "NOTE: The protocol is for a surgeon positioned on the rabbit's right side. If the surgeon will be on the rabbit's left side, reverse the sides in this step to keep the wires and IV opposite of the surgeon. Switch the sides in future steps as needed.\nFor the vein grafting and harvest surgeries, administer general anesthesia with a nosecone; for the vector infusion surgery, administer general anesthesia via an endotracheal tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Intubation can be used for all surgeries.  In our experience, however, the risks of complications from tracheal and laryngeal trauma during intubation can outweigh the benefits of intubation.  The surgery that includes gene transfer to a graft (particularly in cholesterol-fed rabbits) is the only surgery in which intubation seems to provide a net benefit.\nCarry the rabbit into the OR. Place the rabbit in a supine position on the operating table with the neck support towel positioned just below the rabbit's head. Gently extend the rabbit's neck until it is straight and approximately horizontal.\nPlace the nosecone to the rabbit (vein grafting and harvest surgeries) or connect the endotracheal tube (vector infusion surgery) with O2 at 1 L/min, and start isoflurane. If using a nosecone, secure it by wrapping the ends of the attached gauze strips around the rabbit's neck support towel. Adjust the isoflurane concentration as needed (typically 1-2%) to maintain a surgical level of anesthesia.\nCenter the electrocautery dispersive electrode plate under the rabbit's back. Insert the rectal temperature probe and apply the SpO2 probe and EKG leads to the rabbit.\nConnect the saline IV line to the catheter port in the rabbit's left ear and start the IV infusion pump at 10 mL/h/kg. After 1 h, reduce the saline infusion rate to 5 mL/h/kg.",
    "Loosely tie the rabbit's front legs to the operating table as a restraint.\n\t\t​NOTE: Optionally, a small plastic table can be placed over the rabbit to prevent the surgeon from pressing on the rabbit's chest/abdomen, and potentially causing gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration.\nInject lidocaine/bupivacaine (2 mL, 50/50 mix, step 1.2.4) subcutaneously (SQ) in the neck along the planned incision line, for local anesthesia.\nHave the assistant disinfect the surgical site with 3 alternating scrubs of chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropanol, then spray the site with povidone-iodine. Have the surgeon scrub, gown, and glove, following aseptic principles.\n\t\t\nPerform survival surgeries under aseptic conditions. Have the assistant handle any non-sterile items, and aseptically pass sterile materials to the surgeon or aseptically place them on the draped instrument table.\nHave the surgeon use sterile towels to aseptically manipulate non-sterile equipment such as the microscope. Have the surgeon wear 2x surgical loupes while performing the first half of the surgery.\n2. Vein Graft Surgery (Survival)\nPrepare the instruments and sterile field.\n\t\nHave the assistant open sterile packs (a table drape, a paper drape, and 6 towels) and aseptically transfer the contents to the surgeon.\nDrape the instrument table. Place the paper drape and sterile towels onto the draped instrument table. With 4 towels, drape the rabbit, leaving only the surgical site on the neck exposed. Lay the paper drape over the rabbit. One towel will be used later, and the last one is a backup.\nHave the assistant open the sterilized instrument pack and aseptically pass the instrument tray to the surgeon. Arrange the instruments on the instrument table.",
    "Have the assistant open the following equipment and aseptically either pass it to the surgeon or place it onto the instrument table: one 1-mL syringe, one 3-mL syringe, one 20-mL syringe, one 21 G needle, 3-0 polyglycolic acid (PGA) suture, 5-0 PGA suture, 7-0 polypropylene suture, and one 24 G IV catheter.\nSecure the electrocautery cable to the drape covering the rabbit, using a 7.25\" Kantrowitz forceps. Drop the plug end of the cable over the edge of the operating table to be connected to the electrosurgery unit and turned on by the assistant.\nFill a 20-mL syringe with sterile saline from a saline bag or vial held by the assistant. Use this saline as needed to prevent the dehydration of exposed tissue during the operation.\nPrepare 5 mL of heparinized physiologic saline solution by adding 0.1 mL of 5,000 IU/mL heparin to 5 mL of saline solution, i.e., 100 IU heparin/mL, in a small surgical bowl. Use this solution to flush the carotid artery and vein graft regularly during the grafting procedure.\nCut a hole in the paper drape over the surgical site on the rabbit's neck. Use towel clamps to clamp the corners of the hole in place to the underlying towels.\nVascular dissection\n\t​NOTE: Use 2x surgical loupes to aid with this part of the surgery.\n\t\nCut the skin with electrocautery along the midline between the sternal notch and the mandible (approximately 7-9 cm in length) and clamp the rabbit's neck skin to the towels with the towel clamps. At the caudal end, make a short lateral cut through the fascia with electrocautery. Bluntly dissect under the fascia along the entire midline using large scissors. Cut through the dissected fascial layer along the midline with electrocautery.",
    "Start on the right side. Dissect between the sternohyoid muscle overlying the trachea and the V-shaped sternocephalic muscle, to expose the common carotid artery.\nCarefully dissect a 4-5 cm segment of the common carotid artery and its larger branches (typically 1-2 per side) free from surrounding tissues. Extend the dissection from the base of neck proximally to the crossing of the pharyngeal nerve distally. Use surgical silicon loops to aid in the retraction of the carotid artery during the dissection. Ligate the larger branches of the common carotid artery with 5-0 silk sutures before cutting each branch distally.\n\t\t​NOTE: Be careful not to disturb the vagus nerve that parallels the common carotid artery, or the smaller nerves that cross over the artery.\nRepeat the dissection on the left side (step 2.2.3).\nUse tissue-holding forceps to temporarily close the subcutaneous tissue layer. Dissect the superficial fascia from the skin on the right side until the external jugular vein is exposed. Dissect a 4-5 cm segment of external jugular vein and free its branches from the surrounding tissue, ligating small branches with 5-0 silk sutures before cutting the branch.\nRepeat the dissection on the left side (step 2.2.5).\nInject heparin (150 IU/kg) in the IV catheter and flush with 10 mL of saline.",
    "Measure a 3-cm segment of external jugular vein on the right side and ligate the caudal end of the segment with 5-0 silk suture. Allow the vein to fill with blood, then ligate the cranial end of the vein segment. Divide the cranial end of the external jugular vein segment, carefully flush the vessel with heparinized normal saline (100 U/mL) using a 3-mL syringe attached to a 24-G IV-catheter. Divide the vein segment at its caudal end. Place the vein segment in a standardized position, in which the caudal and cranial ends are unambiguously identifiable.\nVein grafting\n\t\nLet the assistant remove the surgical loupes from the surgeon and move the surgical microscope (25X) into position.\n\t\tNOTE: The surgeon should drape a sterile towel over the microscope. This allows the surgeon to manipulate the microscope while maintaining sterility.\nClamp the right common carotid artery at each end of the isolated segment with mini-clamps, placing the cranial clamp first to allow for artery filling, then placing the caudal clamp.\nCut a 1 × 2 cm piece of stiff paper (available from sterile suture packaging) and place it beneath the common carotid artery, to improve the exposure.\nPerform an arteriotomy just cranial to the caudal clamp (the caudal arteriotomy). The arteriotomy length should be equal to the diameter of the cranial end of the vein segment. Insert the syringe with the IV catheter through the caudal arteriotomy and flush the carotid artery lumen with heparinized normal saline.\nSuture the cranial end of the vein to the caudal arteriotomy, using 7-0 polypropylene suture with single stitches (Figure 1).",
    "Place the first stitch to suture the caudal end of the caudal arteriotomy to the cranial end of the vein segment. Place the second stitch 180° from the first stitch, to suture the cranial end of the caudal arteriotomy to the cranial end of the vein segment.\nPlace the third stitch at a point equidistant from the first two stitches, on the lateral side of the anastomosis. Place the fourth stitch on the medial side of the anastomosis, equidistant from the first two stitches and across from the third stitch. Place 4 additional stitches (stitches 5-8) between each of stitches 1-4.\nPerform the cranial arteriotomy on the caudal side of the cranial clip. The distance between the cranial end of the cranial arteriotomy and the caudal end of the caudal arteriotomy should be the same as the length of the vein segment. The length of the cranial arteriotomy is equal to the diameter of the caudal end of the vein segment.\nExtend the vein cranially from the anastomosis, laying it on top of the carotid, without introducing any twists. Flush the carotid artery and vein with heparinized normal saline via the cranial arteriotomy. The saline will flow through the artery, into the vein via the caudal anastomosis and will exit from the free and unsutured end of the vein. Flushing the vein also prevents it from twisting.\nSuture the caudal end of the vein to the cranial arteriotomy (Figure 1).",
    "Place a first stitch to suture the caudal end of the cranial arteriotomy to the caudal end of the vein segment. Place a second stitch to suture the cranial end of the cranial arteriotomy to the caudal end of the vein segment. Complete the anastomosis as described in step 2.3.5.2. Just before the last knot is tied on the cranial anastomosis, briefly open the clamp on the cranial end of the dissected common carotid artery segment, to allow back-bleeding that washes out the air in the carotid artery and grafted vein. Then, tighten the last knot.\nRelease the cranial clamp to allow vein graft filling with blood and then release the caudal clamp. Brisk pulsations should be seen in the vein graft. Apply gentle pressure with dry gauze to stop any bleeding at the anastomoses.\nLigate both ends of the common carotid artery segment that connects the anastomoses with a 3-0 silk suture and divide the carotid halfway between the ligatures (Figure 1). Apply several drops of papaverine (3.5 mg/mL) to the carotid artery adjacent to each anastomosis.\nInject heparin (75 IU/kg) into the ear IV catheter and flush with 10 mL of saline. At this time, inject buprenorphine (SQ, 0.02 mg/kg) to provide postoperative analgesia until the fentanyl patch has provided analgesic plasma levels of fentanyl.\n\t\tNOTE: An additional buprenorphine injection (SQ, 0.02 mg/kg) may be necessary 6 h after the first injection to maintain analgesia until plasma fentanyl reaches a therapeutic concentration.\nRepeat grafting on the left side (steps 2.2.8, 2.3.2-2.3.9).\nClose the subcutaneous tissue with 5-0 PGA suture using a continuous pattern. Close the skin with 3-0 PGA suture using an intradermal pattern. Bury the knots on both ends.\nPost-operative recovery, cleanup, and care",
    "​NOTE: Allow the rabbit to recover from anesthesia in a calm, quiet environment. Monitor the rabbit continuously for proper oxygenation and body temperature until it has fully recovered.\n\t\nTurn off isoflurane and oxygen and disconnect the anesthesia machine from the rabbit. Disconnect the IV fluid tubing from the rabbit, but leave the IV port in the ear vein for emergent access.\nTransport the rabbit to a recovery cage and place it on its side. Provide thermal support with a warm water blanket (or forced-air warming). Give O2 by nosecone until SpO2 is stable.\nUntil the rabbit can sit up and ambulate in its cage, flip the rabbit to its other side every 15 min. Then remove the ear IV cannula and return the rabbit to its cage. Return the rabbit to the company of other animals only after it is fully recovered from anesthesia.\nDispose of any waste following appropriate protocols for biohazard and sharps waste disposal.\nPostoperatively, check the rabbit's health and surgical wound each day. Administer buprenorphine as need for pain not managed by the fentanyl patch. Remove the fentanyl patch on post-operative day 3.\n3. Transcutaneous Ultrasound\nTo assess graft patency, perform ultrasound exam on non-anesthetized rabbit 5-7 days after the vein-graft surgery and gene-transfer surgery.\n\t\nWrap the non-anesthetized rabbit securely in a blanket and place the rabbit supine in a veterinary V-trough with its neck extended. Shave the neck, or if needed, remove the hair with a depilatory agent. Apply ultrasound gel to the neck and perform an ultrasound exam.",
    "NOTE: An ultrasound exam is also performed on anesthetized rabbits at the time of both the gene transfer surgery and the terminal graft harvest surgery to examine graft patency and to measure graft lumen diameter. The exam is done just before the neck scrubbing and is performed in a similar manner as for the non-anesthetized rabbits.\n4. Gene Transfer Surgery Performed ~ 28 Days After the Graft Placement (Survival Surgery)\nPrepare the instruments and the sterile field.\n\t\nFollow steps 2.1.1-2.1.3. in vein graft surgery.\nLet the assistant open the following equipment and either aseptically pass it to the surgeon or place it onto the instrument table: six 1-mL syringes (with needle), one 3-mL syringe, one 20-mL syringe, one 21 G needle, one 19-G needle, 3-0 PGA suture, 5-0 PGA suture, 7-0 polypropylene suture, two 24 G IV catheters, and a sterile blood flow probe.\nFollow steps 2.1.5-2.1.6. in vein graft surgery.\nPrepare one 1-mL syringe with 1 mL DMEM for washing the artery and vein graft and prepare two 1-mL- syringes with virus solution (~ 0.5-0.7 mL virus solution/vein graft). Let the assistant thaw the virus and dilute it in DMEM. Prepare one 3-mL syringe with 0.5 mL of lidocaine/bupivacaine (50/50 mix, step 1.2.4).\nFollow step 2.1.8 in vein graft surgery.\nIsolation of vein grafts and adjacent carotid arteries\n\t​NOTE: 2x surgical loupes should be used for this part.\n\t\nCut the skin with electrocautery along the midline between the sternal notch and the mandible (approximately 7-9 cm in length) and clamp the skin open with towel clamps. Apply 0.5 mL of lidocaine/bupivacaine (50/50 mix, step 1.2.4) to the subcutaneous tissue.",
    "At the caudal end, make a short lateral cut through the fascia with electrocautery. Bluntly dissect under the fascia along the entire midline. With electrocautery, cut through the dissected fascia along the midline.\nStart on the right side. Dissect between the sternohyoid muscle overlaying the trachea and the V-shaped sternocephalic muscle, to expose the vein graft. Carefully isolate the vein graft and 1.5-2.0 cm of the carotid artery adjacent to the graft on both the cranial and caudal sides.\nRepeat the dissection on the left side following step 4.2.3.\nMeasure the blood flow in the vein grafts.\n\t\nFill the surgical wound cavity on the right side with normal saline to enable the transmission of sound waves. Immerse a 2-mm perivascular flow probe (connected to a volume-flow meter) in the saline in the wound cavity and set the flow rate to zero.\nPlace the flow probe around the carotid artery caudal or cranial to the vein graft. Record data from the flow probe with an electronic data acquisition system.\nRepeat the flow measurement on the left side following step 4.3.2.\nCalculate the pulsatility based on peak systolic flow rate, minimum diastolic flow rate, and mean flow rate. Also calculate laminar shear stress, based on the flow rate and lumen diameter (measured with transcutaneous ultrasound).\nInfuse vector solution into the vein grafts\n\t​NOTE: A surgical microscope (16X) is used as needed for the puncturing, infusion, and repair of the carotid artery.\n\t\nHave the assistant remove the surgeon's surgical loupes and move the surgical microscope into position. Have the surgeon drape a sterile towel over the microscope. The sterile towel allows the surgeon to manipulate the microscope while maintaining sterility.\nHave the assistant inject heparin (150 IU/kg) in the IV catheter and flush with saline.",
    "Use a large needle driver to bend the 21 G needle to approximately 80° just above the bevel (do not bend the bevel; Figure 2A).\nClamp the common carotid artery at each end of the vein graft with mini-clamps, placing the cranial clamp first to allow for artery filling, then placing the caudal clip. Place the caudal clip approximately 10 mm caudal to the anastomosis, to leave some room for the arteriotomy.\nPut two silk ties around the artery just caudal to the graft and tie a single overhand knot on each - without tightening them.\nPuncture the carotid caudal to the graft with the bent 21 G needle just cranial of the caudal vascular clip. Be careful to not puncture the back or side walls. Advance the needle into the lumen back-and-forth twice to ensure that the lumen is clear, then carefully withdraw the needle.\n\t\tNotes: Common carotid puncture can be aided by grasping the arterial adventitia with fine forceps and gently lifting the front wall while inserting the tip of the needle just caudal to the lift point (Figure 2A). This reduces the risk of hitting the back wall with the needle.\nWith several unfolded gauze pads, create a nest to place the syringe used for infusions. Place this gauze nest caudal to the surgical site.\nPut a 24 G IV-catheter on the syringe with DMEM-only and tighten the catheter on the syringe just enough to prevent leakage (the syringe will be removed later in this surgery) and bend the catheter ~ 4 mm from the tip so that the bend holds at about 75° after it is released.",
    "Insert the IV catheter into the common carotid arteriotomy up to the bend point and wash the vein graft lumen twice with 0.5 mL of DMEM. For each repetition, fill the vein graft with DMEM. Then remove the DMEM from the graft by lightly pressing with a gloved finger at the cranial end of the graft. Carefully slide the finger toward the caudal end of the graft to flush the luminal contents out via the arteriotomy.\nRemove the DMEM syringe from the catheter, leaving the catheter in the vessel. Connect the syringe containing the virus solution, making sure that no air enters the catheter. Move the loosely knotted silk ties down the artery until they are around the catheter tip, but do not tighten them.\nInfuse 0.03 mL of virus solution to push the remaining DMEM out of the catheter. Remove all fluid from the vein graft lumen with a finger, pressing gently from cranial to caudal.\nTighten the two ties around the artery and catheter tip to seal the lumen. Infuse the virus solution until the vein is distended. Gently lay the syringe down on the nest of gauze.\n\t\tNOTE: It is vital that the vein graft expands to its pre-transduction caliber and remains inflated during the virus infusion. If not, the amount of gene transfer will be significantly decreased.\nLeave the virus-containing solution in the vein graft lumen for 20 min, and then replace the virus-containing syringe attached to the catheter with an empty syringe. Gently aspirate the virus-containing solution from the graft until the vessel collapses. Remove the syringe, leaving the catheter in place. Cut and untie the silk sutures and withdraw the catheter from the vessel. Remove the catheter from the carotid artery carefully to avoid damaging the endothelium.",
    "With the aid of the surgical microscope, close the arteriotomy with 7-0 polypropylene suture using an X-pattern (Figure 2B).\n\t\t\nGrasp the suture with a needle-holder, enter the vessel at the bottom-right of the arteriotomy, and exit the vessel at the bottom-left. Cross the opening outside the vessel and make the second pass from top-right to top-left.\nBefore tightening the suture, briefly release the cranial vascular clip to flush air and residual virus from the vein graft and artery. Blood will flow out of the arteriotomy when the clamp is released.\nClose the arteriotomy by gently pulling the suture ends and tie them together with 2 square knots.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Pulling the suture too tight will cause bunching of the tissue which will disturb the flow, increase thrombosis risk, and potentially introduce uncontrolled variables.\nRelease the cranial vascular clip, then the caudal clip. Stop any bleeding by using gauze to apply light pressure.\nAround this time, inject buprenorphine (SQ, 0.02 mg/kg) to provide postoperative analgesia until the fentanyl patch has provided analgesic fentanyl plasma levels.\n\t\t​NOTE: An additional buprenorphine injection (SQ, 0.02 mg/kg) may be necessary 6 h after the first injection to maintain analgesia until plasma fentanyl reaches a therapeutic concentration.\nRepeat the virus infusion protocol on the left side, following steps 4.4.5-4.4.15.\nWound closure\n\t\nClose the subcutaneous tissue with 5-0 PGA suture, using a continuous pattern. Close the skin with 3-0 PGA suture using an intradermal pattern. Bury the knots on both ends.\nPost-operative recovery, cleanup, and care\n\t\nFollow step 2.4.\n5. Harvest Surgery (Terminal)\nPrepare the instruments and the surgical site.\n\t\nFollow steps 2.1.1-2.1.3 in vein graft surgery.\nLet the assistant open and aseptically place on the instrument table (or pass to the surgeon): one 20-mL syringe, one 21G needle, 3-0 silk suture, and a sterile blood flow probe.",
    "Follow steps 2.1.5-2.1.6 and 2.1.8 vein graft surgery.\nIsolation of common carotid arteries and vein grafts\n\t\nCut the skin with electrocautery along the midline between the sternal notch and the mandible (approximately 7-9 cm in length) and clamp the rabbit's neck skin to the towels with towel clamps.\nAt the caudal end, make a short lateral cut through the fascia with electrocautery. Bluntly dissect under the fascia along the entire midline. Cut through the dissected fascia along the midline with electrocautery.\nStart on the right side. Dissect between the sternohyoid muscle overlying the trachea and the V-shaped sternocephalic muscles to expose the common carotid and vein graft.\nDissect the right vein graft and common carotid artery free from the surrounding tissues. Use surgical silicon loops for the retraction of the artery and the vein graft during the dissection.\nRepeat the dissection on the left side following steps 5.2.3-5.2.4.\nMake flow measurements following steps 4.3.1-4.3.3 in gene transfer surgery.\nHarvest of the vein grafts\n\t\nWith 3-0 silk suture, ligate the right common carotid artery cranial to the graft. Then ligate the carotid caudal to the graft.\nExcise the right vein graft by dividing the adjacent carotid artery between each of the ligations and the adjacent anastomosis. Remove the vein graft from the rabbit and flush the lumen with saline.\nTrim the carotid artery and anastomoses from both ends of the vein graft. Trim away excess adventitial tissue from the vein graft and cut the graft into segments as needed for different endpoint analyses.\nHarvest the left vein graft by repeating steps 5.4.1-5.4.3.\nInject 1 mL of phenytoin/pentobarbital IV to euthanize the rabbit.\nDispose of any waste following appropriate protocols for biohazard and sharps waste disposal.\nSubscription Required.
