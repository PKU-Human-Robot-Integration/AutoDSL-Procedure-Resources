    "1. Growth and maintenance of C. elegans\nPouring Nematode Growth Media (NGM) plates\n\t\nGrow C. elegans on standard 2% agar plates with Nematode Growth Media (NGM) consisting of 1 mM CaCl2, 5 µg/mL cholesterol, 25 mM KPO4 (pH 6.0), 1 mM MgSO4, 0.25% w/v Peptone, and 51.3 mM NaCl.\nFor 1 L of NGM-agar plates, measure out 2.5 g of Peptone, 3.0 g of NaCl, and 20 g of agar into a 1 L flask with a stir bar.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to standardize a specific agar source, as we have seen variability in stiffness between brands, which may affect reproducibility. Here, Bacto-Agar is strictly used. Additionally, it is recommended to add agar directly into the flask being autoclaved, as agar will not dissolve completely without heating, and transferring solution containing agar will result in loss of agar and errors in concentration.\nAdd dH2O up to 970 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: 30 mL of liquid additives post-sterilization will bring the final volume to 1 L. In our hands, ~951 mL of dH2O will be required to reach 970 mL of the final volume.\nSterilize NGM-agar solution using a standard autoclave or media sterilizer for efficient sterilization.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, sterile NGM-agar can be stored for several months at room temperature. If stored, NGM-agar can be reliquefied in a microwave with 15-45 s pulses to prevent the solution from boiling over, or in a heated water bath.\nLet the solution stir until it is cooled to 60-75 °C. Stirring while cooling is important to prevent uneven cooling, which may cause some agar to solidify.\nWhile the solution cools, heat a water bath or bead bath to 65-70 °C.",
    "Once the solution cools to 60-75 °C, add liquid additives: 2.0 mL of 0.5 M CaCl2, 1 mL of 5 mg/mL cholesterol, 25 mL of 1 M KPO4 (pH 6.0), and 0.5 M MgSO4 (see Table 1 for recipes for all reagents), and allow solution to mix for ~5 min to ensure complete mixing.\n\t\tNOTE: Drugs can also be included in plates here (e.g., add 1 mL of 100 mg/mL carbenicillin and 1 mL of 1 M IPTG; add 10 mL of 2.5 mg/mL tunicamycin; add 10 mL of 400 mM paraquat).\nSubmerge flask containing NGM-agar in a 65-70 °C water bath to prevent NGM-agar from solidifying while pouring into plates.\nPipette 9-11 mL of solution into each 60 mm plate, or 20-30 mL of solution into each 100 mm plate.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use the smallest pipette volume available to avoid NGM leaks caused by air expanding in the pipette. Pipetting up 1-2 mL more media than will be added to each plate to avoid completely emptying the pipette will help prevent bubble formation. Alternatively, plates can be hand-poured directly from the bottle into a plate, but pipetting is highly recommended to ensure plates with equal volume. Equal volume plates are important to ensure similar concentrations of solutions when using methods where solutions are applied directly on top of a plate (see step 1.1.17). Equal volumes also allow for easy microscopy to maintain a similar focal plane across plates.\nPlace the pipette back in the heated solution to maintain the temperature and to prevent NGM-agar from solidifying.\nRepeat the above two steps for all the plates.\nAllow NGM-agar plates to solidify overnight.",
    "After plates have solidified, store plates for up to 3 months at 4 °C or move on to step 1.1.14 for seeding plates with bacteria. Store plates in sealed containers to help retain moisture to maintain plate quality.\nGrow a culture of OP50 in lysogeny broth (LB) or equivalent media of choice for 24-48 h at ambient temperature (~22-25 °C) or grow a culture of HT115 in LB + antibiotics (ampicillin/carb + tetracycline is recommended for HT115) with shaking at 37 °C for 12-16 h.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to grow OP50 at room temperature because a more aggressive growth of OP50 has been found at 37 °C, which affects C. elegans lifespan. In contrast, HT115 has a slower growth rate and makes less dense cultures; thus, it is recommended to grow HT115 at 37 °C with shaking.\nSeed a volume of 100-200 µL of a saturated OP50/HT115 culture onto a 60 mm plate, or 1 mL for a 100 mm plate.\nLet plates dry overnight on a benchtop and allow for an additional day to dry if plates are still wet. Store plates in sealed containers at 4 °C for ~2 months.\nOptional: Add drugs directly onto seeded NGM-agar plates (e.g., 100 µL of 10 mg/mL FUDR solution) to chemically sterilize worms.\nMaintaining C. elegans stocks\n\t\nProperly label the bottom of a seeded NGM-agar plate. Label the edges on the bottom of the plate to prevent obstructing the passage of light on standard dissection microscopes.\nUsing a standard dissection microscope, scoop bacteria of choice onto C. elegans pick.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, a pick comprised of a 90%/10% platinum/iridium wire attached to the end of a glass Pasteur pipette was utilized.",
    "Using the bacteria, collect 10-20 eggs, L1, L2, or L3 animals, and transfer them onto a newly labeled seeded NGM-agar plate.\n\t\tNOTE: It is best to collect younger animals; in the authors' experience, for standard wild-type animals, moving 10-20 eggs/young animal will allow the plate to grow at 15 °C without starvation. For transgenic or mutant animals with decreased fecundity, more animals should be moved into the plate.\nFor animals with wild-type fecundity and grown at 15 °C, repeat steps 1.2.1-1.2.3 every 7 days to maintain a weekly stock. For animals grown at 20 °C, repeat steps 1.2.1-1.2.3 every 4-5 days to prevent starvation.\nSynchronizing worms via bleaching\n\tNOTE: A full, 60 mm NGM-agar plate (e.g., 1-week-old stock plates grown at 15 °C) will provide a sufficient number of animals for most standard assays described. Generally, one gravid adult (adult full of eggs) will provide 10-15 eggs42, and a full, 60 mm NGM-agar plate has anywhere from 100-200 gravid adults, providing ~1000-2000 eggs.\n\t\nFor larger-scale experiments requiring more animals, cut a full 60 mm NGM-agar into four to six equal pieces and chunk them onto seeded 100 mm plates for expansion.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, chunking refers to cutting a piece of the NGM-agar plate containing worms and moving the entire chunk of agar + worms onto a new plate, worm-side down to allow the worms to crawl onto the new plate. As a frame of reference, animals with wild-type fecundity will produce a full 100 mm plate if grown at 20 °C for 2-3 days after chunking.\nTo begin collecting the nematodes, pour a small amount of M9 solution (Table 1) onto plates containing worms, taking care not to overfill the Petri dish. Swirl the M9 solution gently to loosen worms off bacterial lawns.",
    "Collect gravid adult worms with a serological pipette, taking care not to pierce the agar with the pipette tip.\n\t\tNOTE: Glass serological pipettes are recommended, as C. elegans tend to stick to plastic. If glass pipettes are not available, it is recommended to start with a larger number of animals than needed, as some will be lost due to sticking to plastic pipettes.\nPellet the animals by centrifugation for 30 s at 1,100 x g. Aspirate the supernatant.\n\t\tNOTE: The C. elegans pellet is very loose, so take care not to shake or disrupt the pellet while aspirating the supernatant.\nWhile animals are centrifuging, prepare 5 mL of bleaching solution per strain (see Table 1 for recipe details); for 5 mL of solution, mix 1.5 mL of 6% sodium hypochlorite (bleach), 0.75 mL of 5 M NaOH or KOH, and 2.75 mL of dH2O.\n\t\tCAUTION: Sodium hypochlorite and high concentration hydroxide solutions are corrosive, and thus it is recommended to wear gloves and a lab coat when handling.\nAdd 5 mL of bleaching solution to the worm pellet/M9 mixture.\nCheck the worms under a dissecting microscope every few minutes until all the adult worm bodies have been dissolved and only eggs are left in the mix. Shake the worm/bleach mix vigorously to speed up the bleaching process.\n\t\tNOTE: Leaving eggs inside a bleach mix for extended periods will result in damaging the eggs and will affect the viability of the animals. For wild-type animals, bleaching usually takes 4-6 min with shaking. Thus, it is recommended to check the animals under a microscope at 30 s intervals starting from the 4 min mark.\nPellet the eggs by spinning down the egg/bleach mix for 30 s at 1,100 x g.",
    "NOTE: Some 15 mL conical tubes have gradient lines on the inside of the tube. For these tubes, it is recommended to spin eggs at a higher speed (e.g., 30 s at 2,000 x g) to ensure that eggs pellet to the bottom of the tube and do not remain on gradient lines.\nAspirate out the bleaching solution.\n\t\tNOTE: An egg pellet is stiffer than a worm pellet, but can still be disrupted easily. So, take care not to shake the tube after centrifuging.\nWash eggs by adding M9 solution up to 15 mL and inverting the tube four or five times to ensure that the eggs are fully dispersed in the M9 solution.\nPellet eggs by centrifuging for 30 s at 1,100 x g and aspirate out M9 solution.\nRepeat the above two steps for a total of four washes to eliminate any bleach from the egg mix.\nResuspend the eggs in 100 µL to 2 mL of M9 solution (i.e., depending on the total number of worms bleached) after the final wash. Shake eggs thoroughly to break up clumps and ensure that the pellet is fully resuspended.\nAlternatively, animals can be L1 arrested for a tighter temporal synchronization; for L1 arresting, add M9 solution to the egg pellet to ~10 mL in a 15 mL conical tube. Let the worms spin in a rotator for up to 24 h at 20 °C or ambient temperature. L1 animals generally take half a day less to reach adulthood compared to the timing of eggs described in step 1.3.16.",
    "Approximate the egg concentration (or L1 concentration; see step 1.3.14) by pipetting 4 µL of egg/M9 mixture onto an NGM-plate seeded with bacteria. Count and calculate how many eggs are present per µL plated. Repeat the counting three or four times to improve the approximation.\n\t\tNOTE: Approximating the egg concentration will ensure that enough animals are plated for appropriate sample size for experiments without overplating, which will cause starvation.\nBased on the approximation, plate the appropriate number of eggs onto NGM-agar plates seeded with bacteria of choice. For OP50 plates, plate a maximum of 200 animals on a 60 mm plate and 1,000 animals on a 100 mm plate. For HT115 plates, plate a maximum of 150 animals on a 60 mm plate and 600 animals on a 100 mm plate.\n\t\tNOTE: These are approximated numbers based on our lab conditions, and numbers may change based on thickness of bacterial lawn. Eggs grown at 15 °C will take ~5 days to reach day 1 adulthood (~140 h to reach egg-laying maximal, gravid adult stage). Eggs grown at 20 °C will take ~4 days to reach day 1 adulthood (~96 h to reach egg-laying maximal, gravid adult stage). Eggs grown at 25 °C will take ~3.5 days to reach day 1 adulthood (~62 h to reach egg-laying maximal, gravid adult stage).\nEgg-lay as an alternative method to synchronize C. elegans populations\n\t\nIf bleaching protocols are not feasible (e.g., no centrifuge available), as an alternative method to synchronize populations of C. elegans, perform an egg-lay procedure. Keep in mind that this protocol is more labor-intensive and will result in smaller yields of animals.\nFor egg-laying, place 8-12 gravid adults onto a standard NGM-agar plate seeded with bacteria of choice and document the exact number of animals placed onto a plate.",
    "NOTE: Egg-lay procedures should be performed at the temperature that will be used for experimentation.\nAllow animals to lay eggs for 4-8 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The duration animals are left on the plate can be adjusted when needed. For example, a larger number of animals can be put on a plate for a shorter egg-lay duration when less time is available. C. elegans generally lay eggs in bursts, which can be estimated at a rate of approximately five eggs/h for animals with wild-type fecundity43. Follow recommendations in step 1.3.16 to avoid overplating animals.\nRemove all adult animals from the plate.\n\t\t​NOTE: Any adult animals left on the plate will continue to lay eggs, resulting in an unsynchronized population.\nPlace eggs at 15 °C for ~5 days or 20 °C for ~4 days to reach day 1 adulthood.\n2. Measuring longevity in C. elegans\nStandard lifespan\n\t\nPrepare NGM-agar plates by seeding plates with 100 µL of bacteria of choice. For consistency, ensure that the same bacteria is used across all replicates. Since worms are moved every day during the egg-laying stages of adulthood, seed five to seven sets of NGM-agar plates for the duration of the lifespan, and two to four plates per strain to grow animals to adulthood (i.e., if using eight plates of 15 animals for lifespans, one needs to seed 40-56 plates per condition).\nAllow plates to dry overnight before storage.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended that the plates be stored at 4 °C, and the required number of plates be removed from cold storage daily to prevent bacteria from making thick lawns that can make moving/counting lifespans difficult. Ensure that plates are warmed up prior to plating worms.\nCollect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4.",
    "Move 10-15 day 1 adult animals onto 8-12 plates each. For a standard lifespan, start with ~120 animals to ensure that sample size does not drop too far below 100 after censorship events (e.g., eight plates of 15 animals = 120 animals; 12 plates of 10 animals = 120 animals).\n\t\tNOTE: In the current case, 10-15 animals are a manageable number for most investigators, although six plates of 20 animals is also feasible to decrease the cost of consumables.\nFor the first 7-8 days or until progeny are no longer visible, move adult animals away from their progeny every 1-2 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Animals can be moved every other day to save materials, but care must be taken to ensure that eggs/larval animals are not transferred with the adult to prevent contamination of adult populations with progeny. In this study, the simplest method is to move animals every day from days 1-3 when egg-laying is at its maximal, and then switch to moving animals every other day for days 5-8 when egg-laying is minimal. With this method, it is not imperative to prevent transfer of eggs/larval animals during days 1-3 since the adults will be moved every day, and eggs/larvae cannot develop to adulthood in 1 day.\nAfter animals have stopped producing progeny, score the lifespans every other day until all animals have been scored as dead or censored. Remove all dead or censored animals from the plate to avoid confusion and recounting the same animal.\n\t\tNOTE: Death is scored as animals that exhibit no movement when gently touched with a pick. Censorship is scored as animals that are bagged, exhibit vulval/intestinal protrusions, or crawled up to the sides of the plate where they desiccate.\nLifespans with chemical sterilization using FUDR",
    "Prepare NGM-agar plates by seeding plates with 100 µL of bacteria of choice. For consistency, ensure that the same bacteria is used across all replicates. Seed 8-12 plates per strain for lifespan experiments, and two to four plates per strain to grow animals to adulthood. Allow plates to dry overnight.\nAdd 100 µL of 10 mg/mL FUDR onto the middle of bacterial lawn for the 8-12 plates that will be used for lifespan assay. Remember to leave two to four plates without FUDR as starter plates to allow animals to grow to adulthood. Let plates dry overnight.\n\t\tCAUTION: FUDR blocks DNA synthesis, and thus it is recommended to wear gloves when handling.\nCollect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4.\n\t\tNOTE: These animals need to be grown on plates without FUDR, as FUDR will cause animals to arrest/die.\nMove 10-15 day 1 adult animals onto 8-12 plates each, containing FUDR. For a standard lifespan, start with ~120 animals to ensure that sample size does not drop too far below 100 after censorship events (e.g., eight plates of 15 animals = 120 animals; 12 plates of 10 animals = 120 animals).\n\t\tNOTE: Animals can also be moved onto FUDR at the L4 stage if it is imperative that progeny formation be completely avoided, but animals must not be moved too early as this will cause animals to be at higher risk for vulval/intestinal protrusions and will increase censorship.\nScore lifespans every other day until all animals have been scored as dead or censored. Remove all dead or censored animals from the plate to avoid confusion and recounting the same animal.\n\t\tNOTE: For FUDR lifespans, any progeny can be ignored as they will arrest at the L1 stage and eventually die.",
    "Lifespans using temperature sensitive sterile mutants\n\t\nPrepare NGM-agar plates by seeding plates with 100 µL of bacteria of choice. For consistency, ensure that the same bacteria is used across all replicates. Seed 8-12 plates per strain for lifespan experiments, and 2-4 plates per strain to grow animals to adulthood. Let plates dry overnight.\nCollect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4. Remember to grow animals at the restrictive temperature of 25 °C to ensure that animals are sterile.\nMove 10-15 day 1 adult animals onto 8-12 plates each. For a standard lifespan, start with ~120 animals to ensure that sample size does not drop too far below 100 after censorship events (e.g., eight plates of 15 animals = 120 animals; 12 plates of 10 animals = 120 animals).\nScore lifespans every other day until all animals have been scored as dead or censored. Remove all dead or censored animals from the plate to avoid confusion and recounting the same animal.\n\t\t​NOTE: When dealing with short-lived strains, it is recommended to score lifespans every day as lifespans at 25 °C are much shorter and thus the dynamic range is limited. In authors' experience, animals can be shifted back to 20 °C after day 2, and animals will remain sterile if it is preferable to score lifespans at 20 °C.\n3. Measuring healthspan in C. elegans\nMeasurements of locomotory behavior via thrashing\n\t\nCollect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4.\nMove a small colony of day 1 adult worms onto an NGM-agar plate under a dissecting scope onto 10-20 µL of M9 solution. 10-15 animals are recommended as a manageable number of animals to count.",
    "Focusing on one worm at a time, count the number of times the specimen switches from a concave to convex formation in 15 s. Use a hand counter and a timer so focus can be placed on the worm for the duration of the assay.\n\t\tNOTE: A video of the plate may be recorded for more thorough/easier analysis. For example, standard microscope eyepiece attachments are available for most smartphones and digital cameras ($15-$30), and these are a great option to video thrashing at a low cost.\nRepeat step 3.1.3 for the other worms in the liquid, averaging out a total motility rate for 10-15 worms. For higher sample size, repeat steps 3.1.2-3.1.4.\nAge out worms to desired age. Similar methods for lifespan assays described in steps 2.1-2.3 can be used for aging out worms. Repeat steps 3.1.2-3.1.4 to assay thrashing at desired ages.\n\t\tNOTE: An alternative method for step 3.1.2 is to add ~30 µL or more of M9 solution onto a group of worms on a plate. This will save time from having to manually transfer worms, although due to random chance of where the worms are on a single plate, there is no guarantee that a group of worms will remain at a single point on the plate.\nMeasurements of fecundity (egg count) in C. elegans\nCollect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4. Assays for egg count start at the L4 stage, which is ~1 day prior to day 1 adulthood (~3 days at 15 °C or ~2 days at 20 °C after L1 arresting).\nSingle out L4 worms onto separate NGM-agar plates seeded with bacteria of choice. It is recommended that ~10-15 animals be used for a fecundity assay.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to dilute the bacteria of choice by 50% (i.e., not a saturated culture) to improve the egg visibility in the bacterial lawn.\nAllow animals to grow overnight at 20 °C. Ensure that a newly seeded batch of plates is ready for the next day.\nOn day 1 of adulthood, transfer adult worms onto fresh NGM-agar plates seeded with the diluted bacteria of choice.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use freshly seeded plates, or to store plates at 4 °C until use to prevent thick bacterial lawns.\nCount the total number of eggs laid on each NGM-agar plate.\n\t\tNOTE: To aid in scanning the plate, a grid can be drawn on the lid of a plate and placed under the plate being scored for eggs. The plate can then be scanned along the grid lines to maintain orientation as the plate is moved and prevent recounting of any eggs.\nRepeat steps 3.2.4-3.2.5 for 7-8 days or until eggs are no longer visible on the plate.\n\t\tNOTE: For days 1-3 when egg-laying rates are high, it is recommended to move animals at least every 12 h and assay egg counts twice a day. However, this increases the amount of work and costs of consumables, and thus moving animals and measurements can be limited to once per day, but care must be taken to ensure all eggs and hatched animals are counted properly. Any hatched animals are counted as eggs for the purpose of this assay.\nMeasurement of brood size (development) of C. elegans progeny",
    "Collect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4. Assays for brood size start at the L4 stage, which is ~1 day prior to day 1 adulthood (~3 days at 15 °C or ~2 days at 20 °C after L1 arresting).\nSingle out L4 worms onto separate NGM-agar plates seeded with bacteria of choice. It is recommended that ~10-15 animals be used for a fecundity assay.\nAllow animals to grow overnight at 20 °C. Ensure that a newly seeded batch of plates is ready for the next day.\nOn day 1 of adulthood, transfer adult worms onto fresh NGM-agar plates seeded with bacteria of choice.\nEvery 12-24 h (2x a day or 1x a day), transfer adult worms onto fresh NGM-agar plates seeded with bacteria of choice for 7-8 days or until progeny are no longer visible. Keep all the plates containing eggs at 20 °C.\nRepeat step 3.3.5 for 7-8 days or until progeny are no longer visible. Keep all the plates containing eggs at 20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Progeny plates may also be stored at 15 °C to extend the time before they need to be scored.\nTwo days after transferring worms, count the developed progeny on the plates. Count developing worms at the L4 stage (i.e., 2 days after hatch at 20 °C) or earlier to ensure that the F2 generation (i.e., progeny of progeny) does not confound results. Count all worms that are alive.\n\t\t\nRemove all worms from the plate as they are counted. Maintain the plates for an additional 1-2 days before scoring them again to ensure that any animals with delayed hatching/development are not missed.\nRepeat step 3.3.7 for every egg-lay plate collected.",
    "​NOTE: The brood size assays can be conducted in conjunction with egg count assay (step 3.2) to minimize labor and costs of consumables by collecting two sets of data from one experiment. This will also allow for direct comparison of brood size and egg count within the same animals.\n4. Measuring stress resilience in C. elegans\nMeasurements of ER stress sensitivity using tunicamycin\n\t\nPrepare NGM-agar plates by seeding plates containing tunicamycin (see step 1.1.7, NOTE) with 100 µL of bacteria of choice.\n\t\tCAUTION: Gloves should be worn when handling tunicamycin.\nFor consistency, ensure that the same bacteria is used across all replicates. Seed 8-12 tunicamycin plates per strain for survival assays, and two to four plates without tunicamycin per strain to grow animals to adulthood. Let plates dry overnight.\nCollect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4.\n\t\tNOTE: Animals must be grown on plates without tunicamycin until day 1 of adulthood, as animals will arrest/die on tunicamycin.\nMove 10-15 day 1 adult animals onto 8-12 plates each. For a standard survival assays, start with ~120 animals to ensure that sample size does not drop too far below 100 after censorship events (e.g., eight plates of 15 animals = 120 animals; 12 plates of 10 animals = 120 animals).\n\t\tNOTE: Similar to FUDR assays, tunicamycin survival assays can be performed without moving animals, as tunicamycin causes death/arrest of L1 animals. However, when performing a DMSO control, progeny will develop on DMSO plates, so animals need to be moved daily or a sterilization technique will be required (identical methods used in section 2 for lifespans can be used for survival assays).",
    "Survival assays are scored similar to lifespans. Remove all dead or censored animals from the plate to avoid confusion and recounting the same animal.\n\t\tNOTE: Although it is possible to score animals every other day, since death occurs rapidly on tunicamycin, it is recommended to score survival assays daily.\nMeasurements of mitochondrial/oxidative stress sensitivity using paraquat\n\t\nPrepare NGM-agar plates by seeding plates containing paraquat (see step 1.1.7; NOTE) with 100 µL of bacteria of choice.\n\t\tCAUTION: Gloves should be worn when handling paraquat as it is an environmental hazard. Check with institution's environmental health and safety for requirements of discarding, as many research institutions will require specific discarding instructions for environmental hazards.\nFor consistency, ensure that the same bacteria is used across all replicates. Seed 8-12 plates per strain for survival assays, and two to four plates without paraquat per strain to grow animals to adulthood. Allow plates to dry overnight.\nCollect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4.\n\t\tNOTE: Remember to grow animals on plates without paraquat until day 1 of adulthood; however, it is necessary to perform a sterilization technique or move adults away from progeny, as some animals can develop to adulthood on paraquat plates (see steps 2.2-2.3).\nMove 10-15 day 1 adult animals onto 8-12 plates each. For a standard survival assay, start with ~120 animals to ensure that sample size does not drop too far below 100 after censorship events (e.g., eight plates of 15 animals = 120 animals; 12 plates of 10 animals = 120 animals).\nSurvival assays are scored similar to lifespans. Remove all dead or censored animals from the plate to avoid confusion and recounting the same animal.",
    "NOTE: Although it is possible to score animals every other day, since death occurs rapidly on paraquat, it is recommended to score survival assays daily. This is especially true when using glp-4(bn2) animals grown at 25 °C as death will occur very rapidly.\nMeasurements of heat stress sensitivity (thermotolerance) using elevated temperatures\n\t\nCollect a synchronized population of C. elegans using a standard bleaching assay as described in steps 1.3 and 1.4.\nPre-warm NGM-agar plates to 37 °C prior to moving animals onto plates by placing plates into a 37 °C incubator for at least 1 h.\nMove 10-15 day 1 adult animals onto four to six pre-warmed plates each. For a standard thermotolerance, start with ~60 animals (e.g., four plates of 15 animals = 60 animals; six plates of 10 animals = 60 animals)\nPlace animals into a 37 °C incubator and score for death every 2 h. Death is defined as animals that exhibit no movement when gently touched with a pick. Remove all dead or censored animals from the plate to avoid confusion and recounting the same animal.\nEnsure that plates are removed from the 37 °C incubator for the minimal amount of time possible, as plates that are left at ambient temperature for long durations while scoring will alter thermotolerance results.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to pull out only one strain at a time to score, as the temperature of the agar should not change dramatically in the time it takes to score one strain.\nMedian thermotolerance is generally accomplished in 7-9 h; so, ensure a proper assay at 7 h, 9 h, and 11 h.",
    "NOTE: While 1-5 h can be skipped, due to variability of incubators, the thickness of plates, and other confounding factors in each lab, it is important that timing is titrated carefully in each lab if timepoints are planned to be skipped. See reference 44 for a full guide on thermotolerance.\nAlternatively, perform the thermotolerance assay at 34 °C instead of 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Median thermotolerance at 34 °C occurs much later (10-14 h in this study), which allows for thermotolerance assays to be prepared late at night (placed in a 34 °C incubator), and for scoring to begin early the next day. This allows for ~8 h of continued scoring rather than the typical 12 h period required for a 37 °C thermotolerance assay."
