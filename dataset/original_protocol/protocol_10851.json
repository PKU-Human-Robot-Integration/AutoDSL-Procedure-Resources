    "1. Establishment of fibroblast cultures from skin explants\n4 mm punch biopsies acquired from human forearm are placed in MEM supplemented 100 units / ml penicillin, 100 μg / ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg / ml Fungizone.\nTrim any subcutaneous fat and finely chop the biopsy into small pieces by rocking a number 24 scalpel blade against the bottom of the petri dish.\nPlace tissue slurry in a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask with primary fibroblast growth media (MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units / ml penicillin, 100 μg / ml streptomycin, and 25 μg / ml Fungizone) added until the surface of flask is covered but liquid depth is insufficient for tissue to float.\nFollowing 3 days incubation at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 , add 3 ml of primary fibroblast growth media.\nFollowing another 3 days incubation change media with fresh primary fibroblast growth media, or if cells are nearly confluent they may be split 1:4 into fresh media. (Fungizone can be omitted from this point onwards).\n2. Stage I - Preparation of collagen I from rat tails\nNote: Protocol for approximately 12-14 adolescent (fresh or frozen) rat tails\nPrepare rat tail by washing in 70% ethanol and remove tendons as follows:\nRemove skin from rat tail by slicing in the middle of the tail from top to bottom with a scalpel and pealing along the length of the tail.\nDetach tendon from the core of the proximal region of the tail.\nRemove tendon toward the distal region of the tail avoiding the sheath using toothed forceps.\nExtract 1 g of tendon / 250 ml of 0.5 M acetic acid by stirring at 4°C for 48 h.\nCentrifuge the extract (7,500 x g) for 30 mins and discard the pellet.",
    "Add an equal volume of 10% (w/v) NaCl to the supernatant, and stir for 30-60 min.\nCentrifuge (10,000 x g) for 30 mins, discard the supernatant, and re-dissolve the precipitate in 0.25 M acetic acid at ˜ 1:1 ratio by stirring for 24 h at 4°C.\nDialyze the collagen solution against 6-8 changes of 6L ˜17.5 mM acetic acid (1 ml glacial acetic acid per liter of cold water, change 2 x daily).\nCentrifuge dialysed collagen at 30,000 x g for 1.5 hrs.\nRemove supernatant and place in sterile flask.\nAdjust the collagen I concentration to ˜2 mg/ml using 0.5 mM acetic acid at 4°C.\n3. Stage II - Setting up the 3D matrix with embedded fibroblasts (allow to contract for 8 days).\nAssemble the mix using cold reagents at 4°C in a pre-chilled bottle. Keep collagen I on ice.\nFor one T75 flask of confluent primary fibroblasts (˜ cell number 1 x 106) use:\n\t\n25 ml rat tail collagen (approx conc 2mg/ml)\n3 ml 10xMEM\n0.22 M NaOH: first, add 2ml, then drop-wise whilst stirring, until the collagen turns orange,\nbut not pink (usually up to 3 ml). Approximate pH = 7.2.\nNote: It is important to ensure that the medium/gel remains neutral or slightly acidic as fibroblasts will not contract the gel if exposed to even slightly alkaline conditions.\nTrypsinise the fibroblasts, spin at 400 x g for 5 mins and remove supernatant.\nDuring 5 mins spin above: Prepare 12 x 35 mm plastic dishes - normally achieve 12 dishes from one flask of fibroblasts/collagen mix.\nRe-suspend fibroblasts in 3 ml FCS and immediately add to the collagen mix and stir.\nPlate approximately 2.5 ml of collagen/fibroblast per dish as quickly as possible. Try to avoid bubbles and collagen setting.",
    "Let the collagen set at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 10 mins.\nAdd 1ml of fibroblast growth media (DMEM+ 10% FCS).\nDetach the collagen/fibroblast matrix from the sides of the dish using a pipette.\nNext day: Add 1ml of fibroblast growth media (DMEM + 10% FCS).\nChange media every other day. Allow collagen/fibroblast matrix to contract for approximately 8 days, until they fit in a 24-well dish (Contraction from ˜3.5 cm to 1.5 cm in diameter, see Figure 1).\nNote: The collagen concentration should be adjusted to suit the application. The more dilute the collagen solution, the faster it will be contracted by the fibroblasts. Slight differences in contraction rate will be experienced with different batches of collagen at the same concentration. Similarly, different fibroblast cultures will contract the collagen gels at different rates, and the more fibroblasts present, the faster the rate of contraction. Collagen concentration and fibroblast density can therefore by adjusted to modify the rate of contraction, and the final density of the collagen gel.\n4. Stage II - Plating cells of interest on top of the matrix\nNote: Sterilize all forceps and equipment with ethanol before use.\nUsing blunt forceps, gently move contracted matrix to 24-well dish. Make sure it does not fold.\nPrepare suspension of cells of interest at approximately 4 x 104 /ml and plate 1ml (after trypsinising, spin cells to get rid of trypsin) on top of the matrix. Actual number of cells needed will vary depending on cell type used. Cell medium should be normal growth medium for the cells of interest.\nAllow cells to grow to confluence on top of the matrix, approximately 3-5 days.\n5. Stage III - Transferring the matrix to a grid for invasion (approximately 0-21 days)",
    "Cut stainless steel grids to create a tripod and autoclave prior to use (See Figure 2).\nPlace sterile grid in 6 cm dish, add growth media to a level above the grid (approx 10.5ml). Place matrix on the grid and gently aspirate media so the bottom of the matrix is in contact with media but not submerged. This is referred to as the air/liquid interface, which creates a gradient that promotes invasion. Replace medium every two days (See Figure 2).\nLive cell, contextual imaging using fluorescent cells can be imaged at this stage or earlier. The contracted or fibrillar collagen I can be imaged using second harmonic generation (SHG, See figure 3). Using multi-photon excitation combined with wide-field detection we find that SHG can be imaged at least 100 μm into the matrix, whereas cells expressing cytoplasmic GFP can be imaged at least 200 μm deep.\nNote: With respect to quantification of invasion, the day on which matricies are placed on the grids defines Day 0. Placement on grids generates a gradient of cell culture media that promotes invasion into the matrix. Samples can be imaged over the next 1 - 21 days (or longer) to assess biological processes such as invasion, proliferation, survival or differentiation (See reference list).\n6. Stage IV - Fixation\nAdd 5 ml of 4% PFA in a Falcon tube.\nTransfer the matrix onto a flat surface. Cut the matrix in half with a fresh clean scalpel (as you will be staining the cross section), lift the matrix with scalpel and transfer to 4% PFA, fix over night.\nOrganotypic matrices are now ready to stain with antibody/stain of choice (See Figure 3).\n7.
