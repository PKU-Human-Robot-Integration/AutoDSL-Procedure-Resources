    "All surgical procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Sungkyunkwan University and Seoul National University.\n1. Preparation of solutions: artificial saliva and tastants\nPrepare artificial saliva by dissolving 2 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM NaHCO3, 3 mM KHCO3, 0.25 mM CaCl2, 0.25 mM MgCl2, 0.12 mM K2HPO4, 0.12 mM KH2PO4, and 1.8 mM HCl in distilled water (>1 L), and adjust the pH of the solution to 7 (see Table of Materials)12.\nPrepare tastants, such as sour: 10 mM citric acid; salty: 400 mM NaCl, optionally with 50 µM amiloride; sweet: 40 mM acesulfame K; bitter: a mixture of 5 mM quinine, 5 mM denatonium and 20 µM cycloheximide, by dissolving the tasting chemical in the artificial saliva prepared in step 1.1.\n2. Preparation of the microfluidic system\nNOTE: Tastants were delivered to the mouse tongue using a pressurized multichannel fluidic delivery system (refer Figure 1 and Table of Materials).\nFill the reservoirs of the pressurized flow perfusion system with the artificial saliva and tastants.\nConnect the compressed air line to the regulator input and set the air pressure between 30 and 50 psi in the fluidic delivery system.\nSet the output pressure of the regulator to 0.4 psi and check if liquid comes out of the tube under this pressure.\nConnect the manifold from the reservoirs to the input port of µTongue.\nConnect the output port of µTongue to a syringe pump and withdraw liquid with ~300 µL∙min-1 to establish the steady-state condition. Observe the constant volume of a hanging droplet under the µTongue. Adjust the value of the setting parameter depending on the sample height.\nDisconnect the compressed air line and stop the syringe pump until protocol step 3 is completed.\n3. Mouse preparation for in vivo imaging (Figure 2).",
    "NOTE: All animal preparations were carried out during the daytime under aseptic conditions on a laboratory workbench.\nMouse anesthesia\n\t\nPrepare a 7-week-old or older mouse of either sex. Use a genetically modified mouse line that expresses calcium-sensing fluorescence proteins in the taste cells.\nThe mouse is restrained for anesthesia. A mixture of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine is injected intraperitoneally into the mouse13.\nTRITC-dextran (500 kDa) in 2.5% W/V phosphate buffer saline is administrated intravenously into the mouse through a retro-orbital route to observe blood circulation during an imaging session.\nAttach a head fixer on the mouse skull to minimize movement artifacts.\n\t\nThe mouse head is sprayed with 70% ETOH while the mouse is placed in a supine position. Lift the head skin lightly with forceps and snip off approximately 7 mm2 with scissors.\nClean the hair around the scalp, remove the periosteum under the skin, apply an instant adhesive to the skull, and attach a customized head fixer.\nAfter the instant adhesive is hardened, apply dental glue around the head fixer and illuminate with a blue light to solidify dental glue.\nPlace the mouse tongue on the bottom unit of µTongue.\n\t\nAttach the lower lip of the mouse to the bottom unit of µTongue with an instant adhesive.\nPlace the mouse on the board (mouse preparation board in Figure 1B) and put the bottom unit of the µTongue to the posts (µTongue hold post in Figure 1B). Make sure that the holes at the edge of the bottom unit are aligned to the post.",
    "Tighten the mouse head fixer to the head fixer holder at the board. Then, adjust the distance between the mouse head and the device. Rotate the mouse head smoothly approximately 45° using the head fixer holder. This process prevents physical contact of the mouse nose with microscope objective.\nDraw the mouse tongue gently using plastic tweezers and attach the ventral side of the tongue to the upper side of the bottom unit of the µTongue. Then, wipe the surface of the mouse tongue with a wet cotton swab.\nSoak a piece of paper in the artificial saliva and place it on the exposed surface of the mouse tongue to maintain a wet condition.\nPlace the curved washers on the posts that hold both ends of the bottom part of µTongue.\nPlace the mouse preparation on the microscope stage. Position the exposed mouse tongue under the approximate center of the microscope objective area. Be sure not to deviate from the dynamic range of the stage. Then, tighten the mouse board on the stage with screws.\nPlace the heating pad under the mouse body and maintain the temperature at 36.5 °C-37.5 °C. Monitor the mouse body temperature with a temperature sensor and control the temperature of the heating pad using a feedback signal from the temperature sensor.\nTwist a thin piece of paper and place it at the mouth of the mouse to prevent liquid from entering the mouse trachea.\nRemove the wet tissue from the mouse tongue and place the prepared µTongue on the mouse tongue. Put a microfluidic channel on the tongue and adjust its position to observe the surface of the tongue through the imaging window.\nSecure the µTongue by gently screwing on both ends with minimal compressive pressure.\n4. Imaging acquisition",
    "Turn on the 920 nm two-photon laser and the microscope in advance of use.\nMount the water-immersion objective (16x, NA 0.80 or 25x, NA 1.1) on the microscope. Drop the distilled water on the imaging window of the µTongue and immerse the objective.\nIn camera mode, turn on the light using mercury lamp and illuminate the surface of the tongue.\nBy adjusting the Z-axis, search the autofluorescent signal from the filiform papillae to find the approximate focal plane. Then, using the X and Y adjustment knob, locate a taste bud.\nSwitch to the multiphoton mode. Set the image acquisition conditions as follows: excitation wavelength: 920 nm; emission filter set: 447/60 nm, 525/50 nm, and 607/70 nm; bidirectional raster scan mode, frame size: 512 x 512.\nAdjust the X and Y positions to place the taste bud on the center of the image window.\nSearch the blood vessels surrounding the taste bud at about two-third height of the taste bud. Visualize the blood circulation by TRITC-dextran (500 kDa) injection from protocol step 3.2. If the blood flow clogs, loosen the fixing screws slightly to allow blood flow.\nAdjust Z-axis and find the Z-plane of taste bud that contains an adequate number of taste cells.\nProceed calcium imaging with 2-6 Hz for 80 s. Provide a taste solution of 20 s by switching on the reservoir of the fluidic system after imaging starts. After 20 s of taste stimulation, switch the reservoir back to artificial saliva.\nAfter sequential imaging is finished, wait for about 3-4 min in advance to the next imaging session. Keep the artificial saliva flowing to the mouse tongue to wash away the tastant remanent from the previous imaging session. Depending on the design of the experiment, repeat the session as required.",
    "When in vivo calcium imaging is complete, euthanize the mouse according to the IACUC procedure. The mouse under anesthesia is sacrificed in the CO2 chamber.\n\t​NOTE: Check the depth of the anesthesia using a toe-pinch reflex. During an imaging session, artificial saliva from the reservoirs should be provided consistently. If bubbles appear at the imaging window of the µTongue, remove the bubbles by pushing them through the input or the output of the µTongue using strong liquid pressure.\n5. Image analysis (Figure 3)\nImage conversion\n\t\nOpen the raw image files using Fiji14 or a similar image analysis software.\nConvert the image file to a RGB stack file to use the NPL Bud Analyzer code.\n\t\t\nImage > Color > Split Channels\nImage > Color > Merge Channels and select the image from step 5.2.1.\nImage > Color > Stack to RGB\nImage registration\n\tNOTE: Use the custom-written code for data analysis. Please refer to https://github.com/neurophotonic/Tastebud-analyzer.\n\t\nRun the code named Taste_GUI.m; a GUI window named NPL Bud Analyzer will pop up. Click on the New Analysis button on the upper-right corner, then load the converted image from step 5.1. Set the frame rate above the loaded image.\nDraw the region of interest (ROI) over the loaded image for registration. Double click on the selected ROI and an auto-calculated registration will start.\nObtain the relative fluorescence intensity changes (ΔF/F)\n\t\nGo back to the NPL Bud Analyzer window to show the registered image from step 5.2 automatically. If the user already has a reg file, click on the Load Data button and select the _reg.tif file.\nClick on the CIRCLE or POLYGON button and position the ROI of taste cell over the taste bud image.",
    "This presents the raw fluorescence intensity and the calcium trace (ΔF/F) of the selected taste cell automatically under the taste bud image.\nClick on Save Trace to present the calcium trace (ΔF/F) on the right side of the GUI, while ROI is shown over the taste bud image. Repeat steps 5.3.2-5.3.4 until the ROI selection is finished.\n\t\tNOTE: Click on the Delete Trace button if the ROI is mis-selected to eliminate the last selected ROI and calcium trace.\nAfter the ROI selection is finished, write the file name on the bottom-right corner, and click on the Finish button to export the ΔF/F calcium trace as an .xls format, and the tase bud image with ROIs in a .bmp format.\nAnalysis of the calcium trace\n\t\nAnalyze the calcium trace obtained from step 5.3. Consider that taste cells have reacted to tastant when fluorescence intensity rises more than two standard deviations of the baseline after the tastant is delivered4, and p-values are less than 0.01, using paired or unpaired t-tests10.\nConsider the taste cell as a responder cell, if it responds to a certain tastant more than two times out of three trials(~60%)15.\nObtain the representative calcium traces by averaging individual calcium traces acquired from step 5.4.1.\nSubscription Required.
