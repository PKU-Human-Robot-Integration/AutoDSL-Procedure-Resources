    "The Portuguese law and European Union guidelines (2010/63/EU) were respected in all procedures regarding the protection of animals for scientific purposes. All methods described here were approved by the iMM’s Institutional Animal Welfare Body (ORBEA-iMM) and the National competent authority (DGAV – Direção Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária).\n1. Preparation of rhinal cortex-hippocampus slices\nNOTE: The preparation of rhinal cortex-hippocampus slices uses P6-7 Sprague-Dawley rats.\nCulture setup and medium preparation\n\t\nOn the day before the culture, prepare the required media and place them at 4 °C.\nPrepare dissection medium: 25 mM glucose in Gey's Balanced Salt Solution (GBSS).\nPrepare culture medium: 50% Opti-MEM, 25% HBSS, 25% Horse Serum (HS), 25 mM glucose, 30 µg/mL Gentamycin.\nPrepare maintenance medium: Neurobasal-A (NBA), 2% B27, 1 mM L-glutamine, 30 µg/mL Gentamycin, HS (15%, 10%, 5% and 0%).\nBrain harvesting\n\t\nJust before starting the culture, add 1.1 mL of culture medium to each well of the 6-well plate with a P1000 pipette and place it at 37 °C.\nPlace all the equipment (dissection microscope, tissue chopper, dissecting lamp, dissecting tools, electrodes, plates, inserts and filter papers) inside the biological safety cabinet and sterilize under UV light for 15 minutes.\nAdjust slice thickness to 350 µm.\nWithdraw the GBSS from the fridge. Add 5 mL of GBSS to six Petri dishes. Six Petri dishes will be required per animal.\nEuthanize the rat pup. Perform decapitation by using a sharp scissor at the base of the brain stem of the animal.\nWash the animal head three times in cold GBSS and take it inside the safety cabinet.\nTissue isolation and preparation of slices\n\t\nFirmly insert sharp forceps into the eye sockets to hold the head.",
    "Using a thin scissor cut the skin/scalp along the midline starting from the vertebral foramen towards the frontal lobes and put it aside.\nCut in the same way the skull and along the cerebral transverse fissure (space between brain and cerebellum). With curved long forceps, move it apart.\nDiscard the olfactory bulbs with a spatula. Remove the brain from the head and place it in ice-cold GBSS with the dorsal surface faced up (Figure 1A).\nInsert the fine forceps into the cerebellum and go along the midline with the spatula opening each hemisphere very carefully (Figure 1B).\nWith short curve forceps, carefully remove the excess tissue that covers the hippocampi, without touching the hippocampal structure. Then with a spatula, cut below each hippocampus (Figure 1C).\nPick up one hemisphere and place it, with hippocampus facing up, onto a filter paper. Repeat the procedure with the other hemisphere and place it parallel to the first one, in the filter paper. Put the filter paper on the tissue chopper, with the hemispheres perpendicular to the blade, and cut the hemispheres in 350 μm slices (Figure 1D).\nPlace the sliced tissue into a Petri dish with cold GBSS (Figure 1E).\nCarefully separate the slices using the round tip electrodes (Figure 1F). Keep only the slices with a structurally intact rhinal cortex and hippocampus. DG and CA areas should be perfectly defined, as well as the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex (Figure 1G).\nPlace each slice onto the insert (Figure 1H-I), with a spatula and a round tip electrode. Remove excess dissection medium around each slice with a P20 pipette (Figure 1J). Four rhinal cortex-hippocampus slices can be cultured in a single insert (Figure 1K).\nCulture maintenance\n\t\nChange the medium every other day.\nWarm up the medium at 37 °C.",
    "Take the plates from the incubator. Pick up each insert by holding the plastic edge with forceps (Figure 1L).\nUse a free hand to aspirate the medium from the well. Place the insert back into the well and add 1 mL, with a P1000 pipette, of fresh warmed medium (Figure 1M). Repeat for all the inserts. Make sure no air bubbles are trapped between the membrane and the medium.\nNOTE: Epileptic-like slices undergo a gradual and controlled deprivation of serum in the medium. From 9 Days In Vitro (DIV) on, slices are maintained in NBA without HS14.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61330/61330fig01.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Detailed procedure for the preparation of rhinal cortex-hippocampus organotypic slices. (A) Remove the brain from the head and place it in ice-cold GBSS with the dorsal surface faced up. (B) Insert the forceps into the cerebellum. Open the brain through the midline and remove the excess tissue over the hippocampus. (C) With a spatula cut below the hippocampus, as indicated by the arrows. (D) Place both hippocampi facing up and parallel to each other onto the filter paper and cut 350 µm slices on the tissue chopper. (E) Place the sliced hippocampus in ice-cold GBSS. (F) Separate the slices with the help of round tipped glass electrodes. (G) Choose only the slices that depict an intact rhinal cortex and hippocampus. (H, I) With the help of a round tipped glass electrode push each slice to the spatula and place it on the insert. (J) Remove the GBSS surrounding the slice. (K) Place four slices per insert. (L) To change the medium, lift the insert and aspirate the medium with a glass pipette. (M) Add fresh medium by placing the pipette between the insert and the walls of the 6-wells plate. Make sure there are no air bubbles beneath the slices. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61330/61330fig01large.jpg]\n2. Electrophysiological recordings\nNOTE: Electrophysiological recordings were performed in rhinal cortex-hippocampus organotypic slices at 7, 14 and 21 DIV in an interface-type chamber. Recordings were obtained with an amplifier, digitized and analyzed with software. All recordings were band-pass filtered (eight-pole Bessel filter at 60 Hz and Gaussian filter at 600 Hz).\nSetup preparation\n\t\nPrepare 50 mL of NBA medium with 1 mL of B27 and 250 μL of L-Glutamine. Warm up at 37 °C.",
    "Set the electrophysiology setup in close circuit. Verify if the flow rate is 2 mL/min.\nOpen the carbox (5% CO2/95% O2) valve and check the water level in the system.\nPut the filter paper in the interface recording chamber to drain excess medium and the lens cleaning paper beneath the frame to supply medium to the slice.\nTurn on the temperature controller, the amplifiers, and the micromanipulator.\nLet the temperature in the interface chamber stabilize at 37 °C before starting the recordings.\nPrepare artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF: 124 mM NaCl, 3mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4 with pH 7.4) and use it to fill the glass electrode with a syringe. Place it in the receiving electrode.\nRecordings of spontaneous activity\n\t\nOnce the temperature is stable, remove the plate from the incubator and cut one slice from the insert with a highly sharp blade. Place it in a 60 mm plate with a drop of medium. Take it to the interface recording chamber.\nPlace the slice in the interface chamber with the hippocampus to the bottom right. Place the receiving electrode in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer.\nProceed to the continuous acquisition protocol and record for 30 min.\n3. PI uptake assay\nNOTE: Cell death was assessed by monitoring the cellular uptake of the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI). PI is a polar compound, which enters cells with damaged cell membranes and interacts with DNA emitting red fluorescence (absorbance 493 nm, emission 630 nm). Since PI is not permeant to live cells, it is used to detect dead cells in a population.\nPI incubation\n\t\nPrepare, in culture medium, a fresh 1:10 dilution of PI stock.",
    "For PI uptake assay remove the plate from the incubator and carefully raise the insert. Add 13 µL of PI to the medium, with a P20 pipette, obtaining a final concentration of 2 µM.  Agitate slowly the plate before putting the insert back in place. Make sure there are no bubbles beneath the slices.\nPut the slices back in the 37 °C incubator for 2 h.\nProceed with the immunohistochemistry protocol, as described in the next section. Cover the plates with aluminium, since PI is light sensitive.\n4. Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: In immunohistochemistry a neuron specific antibody, as well as antibodies able to discriminate resting and reactive phenotypes of microglia and astrocytes, were used to evaluate the extend of neuronal death and gliosis in rhinal cortex-hippocampus epileptic-like organotypic slices.\nTissue fixation\n\t\nRemove the plate from the incubator and aspirate the medium. Fix the slices with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h at RT, by adding 1 mL of PFA beneath and above the slices, with a P1000 pipette.\nRemove the PFA and add 1 mL of PBS. Also add PBS beneath and above the slices.\nKeep the slices at 4 °C, in PBS, until further use. Always put parafilm around the plates to avoid drying.\nImmunostaining steps\n\t\nWash twice, 10 min each time, with 1 mL of PBS.\nPrepare permeabilization/blocking solution containing 1% Triton-X100, 10% HS and 10% BSA in PBS. Prepare 5% BSA solution.\nDraw two rectangles with the hydrophobic pen (Figure 2A). Cut the slices from the insert (Figure 2B) with a highly sharp blade. Put two slices per slide (Figure 2C) and add 140 µL of permeabilization/blocking solution on the top of each slice, using a P200 pipette. Incubate for 3 h at RT.",
    "Dilute the primary antibodies to the working dilution in 5% BSA in PBS. Incubate with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C.\nIncubate with the secondary antibodies for 4 h at RT. From this step on, protect the plate from light since fluorophores are being worked with.\nPlace a 50 μL drop of Hoechst solution on the top of each slice and incubate for 20 min at RT.\nWash between incubations. Always wash three times, for 10 min each time, with PBS-T.\nRemove Hoechst and wash as recommended.\nAdd 50 μL of mounting medium on the top of each slice. Cover with a glass coverslip and surround with nail polish (Figure 2D).\nLet it dry at RT for 24 h.\nVisualize the immunostaining under a confocal microscope. Keep the stained slices at -20 °C.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61330/61330fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Specific procedure for the immunohistochemistry assay. (A) With the hydrophobic pen draw two squares in the slide. (B) Cut the piece of insert that contains the slice. (C) Place each slice in the squares drawn with the hydrophobic pen and start the permeabilization/blocking step. (D) After concluding the protocol, finish by mounting the slices in mounting medium, covering with a glass coverslip and surrounding it with nail polish.
