However, as mice wake up faster with isoflurane anesthesia, mice need to be handled individually, as opposed to ketamine/xylazine anesthesia where several mice can be anesthetized simultaneously.\nHolding the anaesthetized mice in an upright position, pipette 40 μL of the IAV dilution.\nPipette the solution in a slow continuous steady movement and only in one nostril (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: As mice are obligate nasal breathers, it is important to administer the inoculum only in one nostril, in order not to block breathing. The pipette tip should not touch the mouse nostril, but rather the inoculum should be delivered at the opening of the nostril, making sure that it is properly inhaled.\nImmediately after administration, pinch the footpad so that the mouse takes a deep breath. This allows the viral solution to reach the lower respiratory system.\nPlace the mouse on the heating pad until it wakes up.\nPeriodically check breathing and reflexes of the mouse.\nPlace the mouse back in the cage only after it is able to flip from supine position and move its hind legs.\nNote: If the anesthesia lasts longer than 5 min, you should apply an ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1411-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Intranasal administration of IAV in anesthetized mice\n(A) Mice are placed on a heating pad with small inclination while under anesthesia.",
    "(B) The viral solution is pipetted in a steady movement and only in one nostril, while holding the mouse in an upright position.\nSample collection\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step describes how to terminally anaesthetize mice, and collect the samples at a desirable time-point post infection (p.i.).\nNote: Peak of viral load is detected on days 3–4 p.i. for LD50, and on days 4–5 p.i for 0.1LD50.\nTerminally anesthetize mice by i.p. injection of 0.1 mL/10 g of anesthesia mix 2.\nCritical: It is important to avoid using an inhaled anesthesia, such as isofluorane or CO2, as it may influence the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid content.\nCollect blood by retro-orbital bleeding to a 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: It is important to use non-heparinized capillary tubes for the bleeding, in order to allow the blood to clot in allotted time. Alternatively, sterile Pasteur pipettes may be used instead.\nAllow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room temperature (RT) for 15 min.\nCentrifuge at ∼ 8,500×g for 10 min in a table centrifuge at 20°C.\nCollect the serum into clean 0.5 mL tubes in aliquots.\nPause point: The sera can be stored at −80°C for at least several months before performing viral HA ELISA.\nCritical: It is important to avoid freeze-thaw cycles of aliquoted sera samples to avoid degradation of analytes.\nDissect the mouse.\nPlace the animal on its back on a surgical plate and fix it by pinning down the limbs.\nSpray the skin with 70% ethanol to disinfect, and dissect the skin.\nExpose the trachea by removing the salivary glands and the sternohyoid muscle.\nMake a small incision in the trachea with scissors.\nCritical: It is important to be careful not to cut off the trachea completely, otherwise BAL will not be feasible.\nPerform BAL.",
    "Load 500 μL of PBS in a 1 mL syringe with detachable needle.\nAssemble a catheter with the syringe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1411-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Collection of samples in euthanized mice\n(A) BAL collection with catheter.\n(B) Inflation of left lung for histology. The scale bars represent 1 cm.\nInsert the catheter into the trachea and gently inject the PBS.\nGently aspirate the solution back to the syringe.\nTransfer the recovered BAL fluid into a 1.5 mL tube placed on ice.\nRepeat the procedure once again. Averagely, 800 μL of BAL fluid is recovered from 1 mL of injected PBS.\nCritical: Be careful that the catheter is not inserted too far down into the trachea, as it may lead to damage of the lung structure.\nCritical: If no fluid is aspirated back in the syringe, try to carefully move the catheter a little bit up and down into the trachea.\nSeparate the cellular and noncellular components of the BAL fluid.\nCentrifuge at ∼ 230×g for 10 min in a table centrifuge at 4°C.\nCollect the BAL supernatant (S/N) into clean 0.5 mL tubes in aliquots.\nCritical: The BAL S/N should be used immediately fresh for viral determination by plaque assay.\nPause point: The BAL S/N can be stored at −80°C for at least several months before performing viral HA ELISA.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 mL of PBS + 1% FBS, and use it for downstream applications (determination of inflammatory cell influx in the lung, FACS analysis and determination of infectious viral load in sorted cells by plaque assay).\nDissect the right lobe for RNA or viral load assessment by plaque assay.\nAfter performing the BAL, make an incision in the thorax to make the lung visible.",
    "Make a tight surgical knot around the right main airway, and remove the right lobe of the lung, leaving the right airway tightly sealed.\nTransfer immediately the right lobe in a 2 mL tube and snap-freeze in liquid N2.\nPause point: The frozen lung tissues can be stored at −80°C for at least several months before performing RNA isolation as stated in the next section.\nDissect the left lobe for histology (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nWith a piece of suture, make a loose surgical node around the trachea.\nLoad 350 μL of 4% PFA/Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) embedding medium mix in a 2:1 ratio in a 1 mL syringe with detachable needle.\nAssemble a catheter with the syringe.\nInsert the catheter into the trachea and the left main airway, and gently inject the mix to inflate.\nRemove the catheter, while tightening the surgical node around the trachea, until removing completely the catheter.\nDissect the left lung together with the trachea and place in 7 mL polystyrene bijou bottle filled with 5 mL of 4% PFA. Leave O/N at 4°C.\nNote: As residual air may cause the lung to float, hook the suture as you close the lid of the bijou, and place the bijou upside-down. In this way, the lung will be completely submerged in PFA.\nThe next day rinse the tissues briefly in PBS and place in a fresh 7 mL polystyrene bijou bottle filled with 5 mL of 30% sucrose in PBS. Leave O/N at 4°C.\nNote: Sucrose is necessary for cryopreservation.\nThe next day tissues can be embedded in OCT medium to perform cryosectioning.\nPause point: The OCT-embedded frozen lung tissues can be stored at −80°C for at least several months before performing cryosectioning.",
    "Note: Tissues may be stored in 30% sucrose solution for several days, before being embedded in OCT.\nAlternative to steps 11 and 12, the lung may be used for FACS analysis.\nPerfuse the lung with 10 mL PBS administered via the right heart ventricle.\nRemove the lung and cut in small pieces with a scalpel.\nTransfer in 3 mL digest solution, and place in a rotator set at 37°C for 1 h. Perform occasional trituration with a 1 mL pipette.\nAt the end of the incubation, pass through a 100 μm cell strainer, and wash with FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 200×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend in FACS buffer, and use single cell suspension for FACS analysis. Keep cells on ice until staining.\nNote: Although perfusion of the lung has been performed, residual red blood cells may remain. In this case red blood cell lysis may be performed in the cell pellet with the addition of 1 mL red blood cell lysing buffer and incubation for 15 min on ice. At the end of the incubation, cells are washed with 20 mL of FACS buffer, followed by a centrifugation at 200×g for 10 min at 4°C. Cells are subsequently resuspended in FACS buffer.\nViral RNA determination\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes how to isolate RNA from the lung, and determine RNA viral load.\nHomogenize frozen lungs collected in step 11.\nAdd 1 mL of TriReagent in the frozen lung.\nImmediately homogenize with a mechanical homogenizer for ∼10 s in maximum speed (30,000 rpm).\nCentrifuge homogenized lung samples at ∼ 10,000×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the S/N to new 1.5 mL tube.\nCritical: Make sure that the homogenizer is autoclaved before use. If more than one sample is analyzed, wash the homogenizer with DEPC-treated dH2O between samples.",
    "Perform phase separation.\nAdd 200 μL of chloroform and shake vigorously by hand for 15 s.\nIncubate for 2–3 min at RT.\nCentrifuge at ∼ 10,000×g for 15 min at 4°C.\nCollect the upper transparent phase and transfer into a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 500 μL of isopropanol to precipitate the RNA, and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at ∼ 10,000×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove the S/N and dissolve the pellet in 1 mL 75% EtOH.\nMix by hand and centrifuge at ∼ 3,300×g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove completely the S/N.\nAir-dry RNA pellets.\nDissolve RNA in 50 μL of RNase DNase-free ddH2O.\nIncubate at 57°C in a heat block for 10 min.\nStore RNA samples at −80°C until use.\nPerform quantitative and qualitative control of RNA.\nMeasure O.D. (1:50) on a spectrophotometer at 260 nm to calculate concentration.\nRun 1 μg of RNA in 1.5% agarose gel to monitor RNA integrity.\nNote: Intact RNA appears as two sharp bands corresponding to the 28S and 18S rRNA subunits in 2:1 ratio. Degraded RNA will appear as a smear in lower molecular weights.\nPerform cDNA synthesis.\nTreat 2 μg of RNA with RQ1 DNase.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nStop the reaction with 1 μL RQ1 Stop Solution at 65°C for 10 min.\nAdd 1 μL of random primers at 70°C for 5 min.\nPerform reverse transcription with M-MLV reverse transcriptase in the presence of RNaseOUT at 37°C for 60 min.\nDetermine viral load by real-time qPCR analysis.\nPrepare qPCR master mix, use primers for IAV PR8 NS1 gene.\nRun reaction at 59°C for 40 cycles.\nCalculate relative amounts of NS1 RNA expression normalized to Gapdh or Ppia according to the ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nViral HA protein determination",
    "Timing: 1 day\nThis step describes how to detect hemagglutinin (HA), one of the major glycoproteins found on the surface of IAV, in the BAL, with the use of a commercially available sandwich ELISA pair set.\nCritical: Bring all buffers to RT before use.\nCoat a plate with capture antibody.\nDilute capture antibody (stock concentration: 1 mg/mL) to working concentration (2 μg/mL) in PBS.\nCoat a 96-well microplate with 100 μL per well of the diluted capture antibody.\nSeal the plate and incubate overnight (16–18 h) at 4°C.\nWash the plate.\nWash the plate with 300 μL wash buffer per well. Three washes of the plate are recommended.\nAfter the last wash, remove any remaining wash buffer by inverting the plate and blotting it against clean and dry paper towels.\nBlock unspecific binding.\nAdd 300 μL of blocking buffer to each well.\nIncubate at RT (on a plate shaker) for 1 h.\nWhile blocking takes place, prepare the sample dilutions and the standard.\nPrepare the sample dilutions.\nUse U-bottom 96 well plates to perform the dilutions. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for estimated sample dilutions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1411_13.csv\nCritical: Serial dilutions should be performed to achieve consistency. For example, in order to have a final dilution of 1:100, perform two dilutions of 1:10 each.\nPrepare the HA standard by serial 2-fold dilutions.\nPrepare 7 tubes, one for each dilution of the standard curve.\nAdd 500 μL of sample dilution buffer to six of the tubes.\nCalculate the volume of the stock standard needed to have a starting concentration of 3000 pg/mL in 1000 μL of sample dilution buffer and mix well.",
    "Transfer 500 μL of the prepared working standard to the second tube to have a concentration of 1500 pg/mL, mix well by pipetting and continue the same procedure until the lowest recommended concentration (46,875 pg/mL) is achieved.\nRepeat wash step #20 after blocking.\nPipette 100 μL per well of samples or standards. Seal the plate and incubate for 2 h at RT on a plate shaker.\n10 min before the end of the incubation, prepare the detection antibody.\nDilute detection antibody (stock concentration: 0.2 mg/mL) to working concentration (0.5 μg/mL) in HA ELISA detection antibody dilution buffer.\nRepeat wash step #20 after incubation.\nPipette 100 μL of the detection antibody to each well. Seal the plate and incubate for 1 h at RT on a plate shaker.\nRepeat wash step #20.\nPipette 200 μL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate for ∼20 min at RT, by monitoring the development of blue color.\nCritical: Avoid placing the plate in direct light.\nAt the end of the incubation, pipette 50 μL of stop solution to each well. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.\nNote: If the blue color has not been sufficiently developed at the end of the 20 min incubation with the substrate solution, the incubation time may be prolonged. You should however balance that to the development of blue color in the zero standard (blank control) wells.\nMeasure the OD immediately in a microplate reader set to 450 nm.\nCalculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate standards and samples. Subtract the mean zero standard absorbance from each.\nTo create the standard curve, use the mean absorbance for each one of the seven standards at the y-axis and their concentration at the x-axis and construct a curve through the seven points of the graph.",
    "Use the absorbance of the unknown samples to calculate the corresponding concentration through the standard curve. If samples are diluted, the concentration must be multiplied by the dilution factor.\nNote: The procedure described here is in accordance to the latest protocol provided by the manufacturer. During our experiments we used more than one kit that had different specifications regarding, for example, the storage of the various kit components or the concentrations of the antibodies. So, make sure to always read carefully the manufacturer instructions (www.sinobiological.com/pair-set/hemagglutinin-ha-sek11684[href=http://www.sinobiological.com/pair-set/hemagglutinin-ha-sek11684]).\nInfectious viral load assessment by plaque assay\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes how to determine infectious virus in the BAL, based on the susceptibility of the established canine kidney cell line MDCK to IAV infection.\nAspirate the medium of the 12-well plates with MDCK cells from step #5 in the ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section, wash the monolayers twice with PBS and leave the cells in PBS until required.\nPrepare serial dilutions of the infectious samples (BAL) in 1.5 mL tubes using MDCK infection medium as follows:\nAdd 405 μL of medium in each tube.\nAdd 45 μL of sample to the first tube and vortex well.\nPerform 10-fold serial dilutions throughout all tubes. The tubes will have the following effective dilutions of virus: 10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, etc.\nThe final volume of inoculum used for the infection is 200 μL per well.\nAfter completing the serial dilutions, remove the PBS from the cells and add 200 μL of inoculum in each well.",
    "Note: When performing the assay for the first time, it is essential to test the undiluted sample as well. Following infection with 0.1LD50, plaques can hardly be detected at days 1–3 p.i. in the undiluted samples, whereas at day 5 p.i viral titers are usually determined at the 10−2 dilution. On the other hand, after LD50 viral titers can be determined at dilutions 10−2 and 10−4 at days 3 and 5 p.i., respectively.\nCritical: It is essential to plate samples at least in duplicates and in every assay to use an uninfected control sample (MDCK infection medium) to independently ensure cellular viability as well as a positive control (Influenza A virus).\nInfect the cells for 1 h at 37°C. Gently rock the plates every 20 min to ensure even coverage and prevent cells from drying out.\nDuring this incubation time, prepare the overlay medium. Estimate that for each 12-well plate, 9.1 mL of overlay medium is needed. Aliquot overlay medium in 15 mL tubes and leave them in a 37°C incubator. Prepare the solution of 2 % agar in dH2O by melting it in a microwave oven for about 2 min and cooling it to 65°C in a water bath until used.\nAfter the 1 h of infection, remove the inoculums from the 12-well plates. Mix 3.9 mL of agar solution with the pre-warmed overlay medium and add 2 μg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin. Gently add 1 mL of the agar overlay medium to each well.\nCritical: It is crucial to test and optimize the amount of trypsin used because the activity of each batch may vary.\nNote: TPCK-treated trypsin is added in the overlay medium to allow the cleavage of the IAV hemagglutinin, facilitating thus the viral binding to sialic acid residues, and the subsequent viral entry.",
    "Alternatives: Low-viscosity overlay media, such as Avicel, may be used instead of agar (Matrosovich et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nAllow agar overlay to dry for 10 min in the laminar flow hood and place the plates upside-down in the incubator at 37°C, 5 % CO2 for 3 days to enable plaques to form.\nNote: Plaque formation will not be affected if the plate is placed in an upright position in the incubator. However, in our experience, this leads to humidity formation on the agar that affects the following steps of plaque visualization.\nVisualize plaques.\nNote: Plaques will be visible from day 2 post plating, mainly in the undiluted samples, but it is recommended to allow their development until 3 days post plating.\nCount the plaques with naked eye by viewing the plate under a light source.\nCarefully remove agar from the plates, trying not to disturb the cells, using a small spatula.\nFix and stain cells by adding 1 mL of crystal violet stain/well for at least 10 min.\nGently wash off the stain with running water. The monolayer will appear purple, while plaques will appear as clear areas.\nLeave the plates to air-dry at RT and recount the number of plaques.\nNote: Once fixed, stained and dried, plates can be stored indefinitely for future analysis.\nDetermine viral titers.\nCount the plaques in each well and calculate the average of every dilution. The negative control should have a uniform monolayer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: Ideally count the wells with 10–100 plaques.\nDetermine the viral titer of the initial viral suspension according to the following formula: Pfu/mL = (average number of plaques/10−dilution) ∗ (1mL/volume of sample (in mL) used for the infection)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1411-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative plaques visualized by crystal violet staining",
    "In this example, 40 and 45 plaques were counted for replicates of the 10−2 dilution of Sample 1. Based on the above equation, 42.5 (average)/10−2 (dilution) ∗ 0.2 mL (inoculum) would yield a titer of 21.25∗103 pfu/mL. Influenza A dilutions (10−3, 10−4) are used as positive control for plaque formation and serum-free (SF) medium as negative control. The scale bar represents 1 cm.\nInfectious viral load assessment by plaque assay in cells\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes how to determine infectious virus in sorted cells from the lung, based on the susceptibility of the established canine kidney cell line MDCK to IAV infection.\nCount viable cells of the BAL from step #10 or the lung single cell suspension prepared in step #13 using trypan blue for dead cell exclusion.\nNote: Trypan blue cannot penetrate an intact cell membrane, so it will stain blue only the dead cells.\nAdjust cell concentration to 1 × 107 cells/mL in FACS buffer.\nMinimize unspecific antibody binding by incubation with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody (Fc blocking 1:100 diluted) for 15 min at 4°C.\nStain cells with cell-specific antibodies.\nAdd appropriate cell-specific antibodies, e.g., against the epithelial marker EpCAM and the leucocyte marker CD45 in 1:100 dilution directly in the cell suspension.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAfter the end of the incubation, wash with 10× volume of FACS buffer.\nResuspend in 1 mL of FACS buffer, and filter in a polystyrene test tube with cell strainer cap.\nAdd DAPI at 0.25 μg/mL concentration to discriminate live/dead cells.\nSort for the desirable cell population(s), e.g., the CD45+ leucocytes and the EpCAM+ epithelial cells, in a BD ARIA III flow cytometer or equivalent.\nLyse the cells to release the virus.\nCentrifuge sorted cells at ∼ 230×g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Resuspend pellets in serum-free DMEM medium by adjusting the concentration to 106 cells/mL.\nFreeze and thaw cells twice by alternate immersing the samples in liquid N2 and a water bath set at 37°C.\nNote: Alternate freezing and thawing leads to disruption of cells through the formation of ice crystals, and allows for the liberation of the cytoplasmic content that contains the virus.\nCentrifuge lysates at ∼ 10,000×g to remove debris.\nUse the S/N, undiluted or 10-fold serially diluted, as the inoculum for performing the plaque assay according to steps #33–41.\nInfectious viral load assessment by plaque assay in lung tissue\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes how to determine infectious virus in whole lung tissue, based on the susceptibility of the established canine kidney cell line MDCK to IAV infection.\nHomogenize frozen lungs collected in step 11.\nAdd 1 mL of serum-free DMEM medium in the frozen lung.\nImmediately homogenize with a mechanical homogenizer for ∼10 s in maximum speed (30,000 rpm).\nCentrifuge homogenized lung samples at ∼ 10,000×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the S/N to new 1.5 mL tube.\nUse the S/N, undiluted or 10-fold serially diluted, as the inoculum for performing the plaque assay according to steps #33–41.\nNote: In our experience, performing plaque assay in whole lung tissue leads to a smaller number of plaques, when compared to BAL S/N and BAL cells.\nAnalysis of viral presence in cells\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes how to monitor IAV presence in cells through the immunofluorescent detection of IAV nucleoprotein (NP).\nPrepare samples as described in steps 42–45c.\nFix the cells by resuspending the pellet in 100 μL of 4% PFA, vortex the tubes, and incubate for 10 min at RT.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of FACS buffer.",
    "Permeabilize the cells by resuspending the pellet in 100 μL of 0.5% saponin.\nMinimize intracellular unspecific antibody binding by incubation with an anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody (Fc blocking diluted 1:100) for 15 min at 4°C.\nStain the cells intracellularly by the addition of FITC-conjugated influenza A anti-NP antibody (10 μg/mL) directly in the cell suspension for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAt the end of the incubation, wash the cells once with permeabilization buffer and then with FACS buffer.\nAnalyze on a BD ARIA III flow cytometer or equivalent. Unstained samples and single-stained samples are used to set appropriate PMT voltages for the positive and negative populations.\nAnalysis of virus localization in tissues\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes how to monitor IAV localization in the lung tissue through the immunofluorescent detection of IAV NP.\nUse OCT-embedded tissues collected in step #12 to perform 10 μm-thick cryosections in a cryotome. Ideally, collect sections in the sagittal plane of the left lung lobe at the level of the respiratory tree. You can place up to 3 sections on the same slide.\nNote: You can store cryosections until further use in a slide box at −20°C in the presence of some silica gel to absorb moisture.\nLet slides air-dry at RT.\nDefine areas around sections with a hydrophobic pen.\nFix sections with 4 % PFA for 10 min at RT.\nWash the slides 3× with PBS.\nCritical: Do not allow sections to dry from this point on.\nMinimize unspecific antibody binding by blocking with 5 % goat serum for 30 min at RT.\nNote: Blocking of unspecific binding is usually performed with serum from the host animal that the secondary antibody originates from. If no secondary antibodies are used, any available serum may be used for blocking.",
    "Stain sections with FITC-conjugated IAV anti-NP antibody (5 μg/mL) for 1 h at RT in the dark.\nNote: In parallel to NP staining, you may stain for cell-specific markers. In case unconjugated antibodies are used, add the anti-NP antibody together with the secondary antibodies.\nWash the slides 3× with PBS.\nStain nuclei with 2.5 μg/mL of DAPI diluted in PBS for 3 min at RT in the dark.\nRinse the slides briefly in PBS.\nMount sections with Prolong Diamond mounting medium and coverslip.\nVisualize with a Leica TCS-SP5II Confocal Microscope."
