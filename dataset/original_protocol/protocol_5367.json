    "Isolation of crude GAGsTo remove lipids from the sample, suspend the dried powder (5 g) in a centrifuge tube with 20 ml of acetone and then centrifuge sample at 2,300 x g for 15 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant. Repeat this defatting step three times. After centrifugation, dry samples overnight in fume hood at room temperature. In general, 30 g of dried powder was defatted.To digest the core proteins, dissolve the defatted sample in 120 ml of Tris acetate buffer (pH 8.0) (see Recipes) containing actinase E in an Erlenmeyer flask and maintain for 18 h at 45 °C with shaking at 100 rpm.Add 600 ml of NaOH buffer (see Recipes) to the sample and leave to stand at 4 °C for 18 h.Neutralize the sample with 100 ml of 2.0 N acetic acid at room temperature and precipitate the degraded proteins by adding perchloric acid (to a final concentration of 5%). Separate the degraded proteins by centrifugation at 2,300 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant into a dialysis membrane (MWCO: 3,500) and dialyze it against distilled water at room temperature for 16 h.Transfer the dialyzed sample solution into a new Erlenmeyer flask. Add CPC solution (see Recipes) (final concentration 0.1%) and suspend well. Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), a cationic surfactant, interacts with the sulfates and carboxylates of GAGs. After storage at 4 °C for 16 h, GAG-CPC complex in the Erlenmeyer flask can be observed.Collect the GAG-CPC complex by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Transfer the precipitate (GAG-CPC complex) into a new conical tube using a stainless steel spoon (180 mm). To remove CPC from GAG-CPC complex, resuspend the precipitate in 4 ml of 2.5 M NaCl using a 1,000 μl pipette.",
    "Centrifuge the solution at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and transfer the GAG-containing supernatant into a new conical tube. Suspend with 11 volumes of 85% ethanol and store at 4 °C for 16 h. After incubation, collect crude GAGs by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Dissolve the precipitate with 10 ml of distilled water.Transfer the supernatant fluid (dissolved precipitate) into a dialysis membrane (MWCO: 3,500) and dialyze it against 2 L of distilled water in a polypropylene beaker (3 L) with a stir bar at room temperature for 16 h to remove excess NaCl from crude GAGs. Distilled water is changed 5 times during dialysis. Transfer the dialyzed sample into a new conical tube and freeze.Lyophilize overnight using freeze drier to obtain the crude GAG powder.Fractionation of KS-branched CS-EDissolve the crude GAGs (30 mg) into 2 ml of distilled water.The dissolved crude GAGs are fractionated using low-pressure liquid chromatography. Fractionation condition: ECONO GRADIENT PUMP (Bio-Rad Laboratories) is applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min on a HiPrep DEAE FF at room temperature. The eluent buffers are as follows: (A) 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6) (see Recipes), (B) 2.0 M NaCl in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6) (see Recipes). The gradient program is 0-30 min (5% B), 30-150min (5-100% B), and 150-180 min (100% B). Collect fractionated samples at 30 min intervals. Dry the fractionated samples using a freeze drier and keep samples at 4 °C."
