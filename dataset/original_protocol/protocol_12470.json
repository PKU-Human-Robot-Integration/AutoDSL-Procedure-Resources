    "1. Subjects\nWe recruited five hundred and forty-one psychologically and somatically healthy male and female subjects (age 44.47± 9.41; range 18-89 years; IQ 113.90±12.73). All subjects spoke German on a native speaker level. The study was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the German Psychological Society. All subjects gave written informed consent before screening and were reimbursed for participation.\n2. Study Design\nThe EmoCogMeter, an iPad-based application, includes 7 neuropsychological tests and was developed to investigate cognitive functions in several domains. Prior to each test, a short instruction and demonstration was displayed on the screen. There was no verbal instruction or feedback from the experimenter. Subjects needed approximately 25-30 min to complete the testing session.\nNeuropsychological Tests\nLearning and memory\nMemory Span\n\t\t\tPresent the participants with a series of digits and ask them to input the numbers immediately afterwards. Start with 2 digits and if participants are successful, give a longer list of numbers.\n\t\t\t\nEnd the task either after 5 min, or earlier, if subjects successfully recall 9 digits. Record the digit span and the number of total trials required to reach that level.\nWorking Memory \n\t\t\tHave participants view sequences of positive, negative and neutral words and respond if a word is the same as the one presented two trials before.\n\t\t\t\nEnd the task after 5 min and record the number of correct responses (hits), false responses, and the mean latency of responses.\nAttention and concentration\nSelective Attention\n\t\t\tApply a variant of the Stroop task and ask subjects to respond if the written color name corresponds to the color ink it was displayed in.",
    "End the task after 3 min and record the number of correct responses (hits), false responses, missed responses, and the mean latency of responses.\nSustained Attention\n\t\t\tUse a task that includes a small working memory component. Present a circle consisting of small blue and yellow circles, illuminated in a pseudo-random order in the center of the screen.\n\t\t\t\nInstruct subjects to detect and respond to sequences of blue-yellow-yellow. End the task after 4 min and record the number of correct responses (hits), false responses, and missed responses.\nExecutive Functions\nTrail Making Test B \n\t\t\tProbe task switching and require subjects to sequentially and alternatively connect 13 numbers and 12 letters on the screen. Do not display the connection if the subject made an error and do not continue the task before the correct connection is selected.\n\t\t\t\nEnd the task after 90 sec if it is not successfully completed until then. Record the total time required to complete the task.\nTower of Hanoi\n\t\t\tAssess planning and the ability to achieve a goal through a series of intermediate steps. Use a version with three rods and four discs of subsequently smaller size.\n\t\t\t\nInform subjects that they have to move the entire stack of discs to another rod by obeying the following rules: (1) Only one disk may be moved at a time. (2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod. (3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nEnd the test if subjects fail to reach the goal after 4 min. Record the time needed to solve the task and the number of moves required for solution.\nProcessing Speed\n\t\tSymbol Letter Modalities Test",
    "Present subjects with 9 letters and corresponding geometric symbols in the upper part of the screen. Display rows of letters in the lower part and instruct subjects to move the corresponding symbol under each letter as fast as possible.\n\t\t\nRecord the number of correct responses (hits), false responses, missed responses and the mean latency of responses within the allowed time (90 sec).\nStatistical analysis \n\tFor the tests probing working memory, selective attention and sustained attention we defined an accuracy ratio ((hits- false)/ targets) x 100. All data were analyzed using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) with the between-subjects factors age group and gender. GreenhouseGeisser corrections were applied where appropriate. If MANOVAs revealed significant main or interaction effects, further statistical analyses were conducted using t-test comparisons.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
