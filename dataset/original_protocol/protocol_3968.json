    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart A-Design gene editing reagents\nTiming: 4 h\nStart by conceptually designing the fluorescent tag. The first decision regards where the fluorescent tag will be placed in the genome. Depending on the gene of interest, there may be many variants expressed, and a unique 5′ and 3′ terminus on each variant. Create a fluorescent tag that will minimally disrupt folding and function of the protein of interest as well as other variants encoded by the gene of interest. Then identify a suitable 1) crRNA to target the site of fluorescent tag knock-in, 2) fluorescent tag to label the protein of interest, 3) linker peptide to fuse the protein of interest to the selected fluorescent tag, and 4) design a targeting vector encoding a fluorescent tag which will tag the protein of interest.\nsgRNA design",
    "An sgRNA is made up of a crRNA, which is a 20 nucleotide sequence which corresponds to the region of the genome you wish to target, and a tracrRNA which scaffolds the sgRNA to SpCas9. The tracrRNA is constant, while the crRNA is changed based on the region of the genome being targeted. Importantly, immediately adjacent to the 3′ end of the crRNA should be an “NGG” (protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)) sequence which allows for cleavage by SpCas9 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Online tools examine the region of the genome you wish to target and look for 20 nucleotide sequences adjacent to NGG sites and then probe for relative off-target homology across the rest of the genome. Ideal crRNAs for tagging purposes will have minimal homology with the rest of the genome to decrease the chances of off-target genome cleavage by SpCas9 and will cut within 20–30 nucleotides of either the 5′ or 3′ end (depending on which end of the protein is being targeted for fluorescent tagging) of the gene encoding your protein of interest (Paquet et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). Here we will discuss how to identify optimal crRNA sequences using the online tool Benchling (benchling.com[href=http://benchling.com]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/934-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. sgRNA and targeting vector design",
    "The region of the genome encoding vimentin’s carboxyl terminus was probed for PAM sites (brown) to identify optimal crRNAs around our site in which we aimed to place the fluorescent tag (green). Here we show an example crRNA (blue) which we used to place a coding sequence for mNeon on vimentin’s 3′ terminus in the mouse genome. The stop codon is listed in pink. The site of double stranded cleavage by SpCas9 is denoted by a purple dashed line. The site of the fluorescent tag knock-in is denoted by a gray dashed line. Yellow colored boxes denote vimentin exons, white boxes denote vimentin introns and dashed lines denote untranslated regions (UTRs). The targeting vector cartoon on the bottom depicts how to construct a targeting vector for knock-in of a linker peptide (orange) coding sequence and mNeon fluorescent tag (green) coding sequence on to vimentin’s 3′ terminus. Genomic DNA is abbreviated as gDNA.\nUsing a web browser, go to benchling.com[href=http://benchling.com], create an account and then start a new project by clicking on the plus sign on the left-side bar.\nAfter creating a project, click on the plus sign on the left-side bar, move over “CRISPR” in the menu and then select “CRISPR Guides.”\nInput the sequence you wish to target by either providing coordinates, gene name, raw sequence, or a sequence file. Then hit “Next.”\nSelect “Single guide,” guide length: 20, the correct genome species for your cell type and PAM: NGG and then click “Finish.”",
    "Below the middle of the screen where your sequence of interest is displayed, select the specific region of DNA you wish to target by either typing in the start and end position in the panel on the right or clicking and dragging your mouse over the DNA in the middle panel of Benchling. Then click the green “+” sign in the panel on the right. Now you should see a list of potential crRNA sequences.\nSelect crRNA(s) that are the closest to either the 5′ or 3′ end of your gene of interest (depending on which end of the protein you are tagging with a fluorescent tag) with the highest “On-Target Score” (on-target scores above 60 are considered good cut sites). Choosing a crRNA that is closest to your site of fluorescent tag insertion will increase chances of success. In general, avoid using a sgRNA that cuts further than 30 nucleotides from your site of fluorescent tag knock-in (Paquet et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). For example, to target the 3′ terminus of vimentin we use the following crRNA: GAATAAAAATTGCACACACT.\nNote: Using a sgRNA cut site which will be disrupted once a fluorescent tag has been successfully achieved (knock-in of the fluorescent tag occurs within the crRNA target site) simplifies creation of the targeting vector by eliminating a need to mutate the PAM site. Mutating the PAM site prevents cutting of your targeting vector and/or recutting by SpCas9 following successful incorporation of your fluorescent tag sequence in to the genome.\nFluorescent tag selection\nThere are many suitable fluorescent tags encoded by nucleotides with a combination of strengths and weaknesses (Shaner et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). When selecting a fluorescent tag to label your protein of interest, consider the following:",
    "Excitation/emission of your fluorescent tag – Choose a fluorescent tag that you can easily image with equipment accessible to your lab and that is compatible with other assays you plan to perform once you have generated cells with your desired fluorescent tag.\nStability and intensity of the fluorescent tag – Choose a fluorescent tag that will not quickly photobleach and that is relatively bright.\nToxicity of the fluorescent tag – Some fluorescent tags, such as mCherry and DsRed are known to aggregate, and thus using these fluorescent tags as your tag may be undesirable (Bell et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Choose a fluorescent tag with minimal toxicity.\nNote: For a general overview of candidate fluorescent tags encoded by nucleotides, visit https://www.addgene.org/fluorescent-proteins/[href=https://www.addgene.org/fluorescent-proteins/].\nNote: We recommend using either mNeon as a “green” fluorescent tag or mScarlet as a “red” fluorescent tag to label your protein of interest as these are relatively brighter fluorescent tags with increased photostability and decreased aggregation propensity compared with other potential fluorescent tags.\nLinker design\nIt is often desirable to have a linker peptide that will connect your fluorescent tag to your protein of interest, as opposed to directly attaching the fluorescent tag to your protein of interest. This increases the chances that the fluorescent tag and endogenous protein of interest will properly fold and minimally interfere with the function and localization of your endogenous protein of interest. Linker peptide sequences are normally between 2–20 amino acids long and typically consist of amino acids such as glycine and serine to provide flexibility (Snapp, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). For example, in our tagging of the 3′ terminus of mouse vimentin with mNeon, we used a linker peptide with the following composition: Amino Acids – GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS; Nucleotides – GGTGGTGGCGGTTCAGGCGGAGGTGGCTCTGGCGGTGGCGGATCG",
    "Alternatives: The following are alternative options for flexible linker peptides (Sabourin et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Huston et al., 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10], Chen et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]):\nAmino Acids – GGGGGGGG; Nucleotides – GGTGGGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGT\nAmino Acids – GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS; Nucleotides – GGTGGTGGTGGTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTAGT\nTargeting vector design\nThe targeting vector is a DNA sequence containing the sequence you wish to place into the genome flanked by DNA sequences homologous to the loci in the genome your fluorescent tag will be placed within (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). To design the targeting vector, arrange the linker peptide and fluorescent tag DNA sequences according to whether they will be placed on the amino or carboxyl terminus of your protein of interest and then add homologous sequences of DNA on either side of the DNA sequence you wish to place in the genome (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). We recommend using homology arms that are at least ~500 nucleotides long.\nAlternatives: Although larger homology arms generally yield higher efficiency reactions, homology arms as short as 50–100 nucleotides have been shown to be sufficient to successfully tag epitopes in the genome with fluorescent tags (Li et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], Dewari et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nCritical: If your fluorescent tag is placed on the amino terminus of your protein of interest, be sure to remove the stop codon from the fluorescent tag so that translation does not stop after your fluorescent tag is produced. Conversely, if your fluorescent tag is placed on the carboxyl terminus of your protein of interest, place your fluorescent tag upstream of the stop codon of the endogenous gene interest so that translation does not stop prior to translation of your fluorescent tag. In this situation, be sure to place the stop codon in the repair template to make sure translation ends correctly/in frame.",
    "Critical: Prioritizing sgRNA cut sites that are outside the coding sequence (untranslated regions) can reduce the chances of creating mutations through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in the non-tagged allele of your protein of interest (Bressan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Merkle et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nPart B-Synthesize the SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid and the targeting vector plasmid\nTiming: 1 week\nHere we describe how to generate the reagents required to create successful fluorescent tags in genomic DNA of primary adult mouse NSCs using CRISPR/Cas9. First we will discuss how to clone a crRNA sequence into a SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid, which already includes the constant tracrRNA. Second, we will discuss how to assemble the targeting vector in a separate plasmid.\nClone the crRNA into the SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid\nThis section of the protocol describes how to generate a SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid which includes the crRNA chosen in Part A through restriction digestion/ligation cloning (adapted from (Ran et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18])). SpCas9 and the tracrRNA are already present in the SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid backbone, and thus, only the crRNA needs to be inserted. As an example, in this protocol we will describe how to make a plasmid encoding a sgRNA targeting the DNA sequence encoding the 3′ terminus of vimentin in the mouse genome (Addgene #62988); however, this protocol should work for any sgRNA. In brief, a template plasmid harboring an empty crRNA cloning site and the SpCas9 sequence will be cut and a crRNA insert will be prepared and ligated into the empty crRNA cloning site.\nOrder DNA oligonucleotides according to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] by adding the indicated nucleotides in red to the forward or reverse complement of the crRNA DNA sequence respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/934-Mmc1.xlsx]). These oligonucleotides will be referred to as “crRNA F oligonucleotide” or “crRNA R oligonucleotide” in this protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/934-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. crRNA oligonucleotide (oligo) design for cloning the crRNA (blue) into the SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid\nOrder oligonucleotides with your crRNA sequence and the attached nucleotides (red) to create sticky ends which will ligate into the linearized SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid (Ran et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).

Primer design for cloning the targeting vector using a Gibson Assembly\n(A) Primers are used to amplify each fragment with additional DNA sequences homologous to neighboring fragments of the targeting vector.\n(B) Amplified fragments with homology to neighboring fragments are ligated by Gibson Assembly to create the targeting vector plasmid.\nThe nucleotide residues in red will serve as sticky ends which will allow for ligation of the crRNA insert into the SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid at the cut BbsI site.\nNote: Addition of a “G” at the 5′ of the crRNA is only necessary if the crRNA does not already start with a “G” residue.\nCreate crRNA insert\nPrepare a reaction with the following components to anneal and phosphorylate the oligos for insertion into the SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_1.csv\nRun the reaction in a thermal cycler with the following conditions: 37°C for 30 min, 95°C for 5 min, decrease temperature from 95°C to 25°C at a declining rate of 5°C per minute.\nRestriction digest of the SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid (pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0)\nPrepare a restriction digest reaction with the following components to linearize the plasmid and dephosphorylate the sticky ends to prevent self-ligation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_2.csv\nDigest for 4 h at 37°C.\nAfter 4 h, add 1 μL shrimp alkaline phosphatase and incubate at 37°C for 1 additional hour.\nGel purify the linearized plasmid (Qiagen 28704; https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sample-technologies/dna-cleanup/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit/?cmpid=QVenSPP1404quartzySC[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sample-technologies/dna-cleanup/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit/?cmpid=QVenSPP1404quartzySC]). For pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 the linearized plasmid should be ~9.1 kB.",
    "Note: Running a “no restriction enzyme” control, where enzymes are not present in the reaction, can be helpful to ensure the enzyme is cutting properly. When linearized, DNA will run true to size, whereas non-linearized plasmid DNA can run faster or slower based on its supercoiled state.\nLigation of crRNA insert and linearized SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid\nPrepare a ligation reaction with the following components.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_3.csv\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature (25°C).\nNote: Running a “no insert” control where all components are added to the ligation reaction aside from the crRNA insert will inform on the efficiency of your cloning after the transformation is complete by allowing you to visualize the fraction of colonies in your reaction that are religated or empty backbones.\nTransformation of ligated SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid\nThaw 50 μL DH5α on ice for 20 min.\nAdd 3 μL of the ligation reaction to the DH5α on ice and then let the samples sit on ice for 20 min.\nHeat shock samples for 30 s at 42°C.\nImmediately following heat shock, place samples back on ice for 2 min and add 250 μL SOC recovery media.\nShake at 200 rotations per minute (rpm) at 37°C for 1 h in a bacterial shaker.\nPlate 250 μL transformed bacteria in SOC on to a LB agar plate with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and grow at 37°C for 18 h.\nScreen clones by performing minipreps on clones (Invitrogen R1213) and then performing restriction digests with BbsI. The BbsI restriction digest site should be lost upon insertion of the DNA sequence of the crRNA.\nAnalyze clones that are not cut with BbsI using Sanger Sequencing to validate insertion of the DNA sequence of the crRNA using the following sequencing primer: GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATT.",
    "Prepare plasmid DNA for delivery to NSCs by performing an endotoxin free maxi plasmid purification.\nCritical: Performing a DNA preparation with an endotoxin removal step (e.g., Qiagen 12362) is essential for viability of electroporated cells.\nAlternatives: Many plasmids have been generated for delivery of SpCas9 and an sgRNA to cells, all with subtly different utilities. For example, some plasmids are viral backbones allowing for delivery of SpCas9 and the sgRNA through generation of viral particles (Addgene 98290). Other plasmids harbor different reporters such as fluorescent reporters (GFP; Addgene 48138) or antibiotic resistance reporters (Puromycin; Addgene 62988).\nClone the targeting vector plasmid\nThis section of the protocol describes how to generate a plasmid encoding the desired fluorescent tag and a linker peptide flanked by homologous regions of the genome upstream or downstream of the fluorescent tag knock-in site through a Gibson Assembly reaction (Gibson, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Gibson et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). For example, to create a targeting vector plasmid for labeling vimentin with mNeon on its 3′ terminus, a Gibson Assembly reaction will be performed to create a plasmid which includes the following sequence: 5′ homology region + linker + mNeon + 3′ homology region (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nGibson Assembly allows for the simultaneous ligation of multiple fragments of DNA that are over 200 nucleotides long which have at least 15–30 nucleotides of homology with each other on the ends of each adjacent fragment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). First, PCRs are performed to create fragments with overlapping homology to adjacent fragments (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Second, fragments with overlapping homology to adjacent fragments are ligated into a linearized plasmid to assembly the targeting vector plasmid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "As the linker peptide coding sequence is often a short fragment less than 200 nucleotides, it is optimal to attach the linker peptide coding sequence to an adjacent fragment, such as the fluorescent tag, (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A PCR 1-2) prior to Gibson Assembly to increase the efficiency of the Gibson Assembly.\nObtain coding sequences for all components of the designed targeting vector plasmid.\nCoding sequences for fluorescent tags and many linker peptides can be obtained commercially from vendors such as Addgene or generated through commercial DNA synthesis services.\nHomology arms can be generated through PCR using genomic DNA as a template or through commercial DNA synthesis services.\nGibson Assembly Overlapping Primer Design\nDesign primers with a melting temperature greater than 55°C and less than 70°C that will amplify each DNA fragment and add a 15–30 nucleotide overhang sequence that is homologous to each adjacent DNA fragments in the theoretically designed targeting vector (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nFor example, the forward primer used to amplify the 3′ homology arm should contain a 15–30 nucleotide overhang homologous to mNeon and the reverse primer should contain a 15–30 nucleotide overhang homologous to pENTR (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: For general recommendations on primer design visit the NEBuilder Gibson Assembly Tool (www.NEBGibson.com[href=http://www.NEBGibson.com]). In general, higher overlap between fragments will yield a higher efficiency during the Gibson Assembly reaction.\nCreate fragment with linker peptide attached to the fluorescent tag through assembly PCR.\nPerform a PCR to create an amplicon of the fluorescent tag coding sequence with 15–30 nucleotides of homology to the linker peptide coding sequence (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A PCR 1).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_5.csv",
    "Perform an assembly PCR using reaction recipe and conditions listed in step 19 to ligate the fluorescent tag coding sequence with the linker peptide coding sequence and attach a 15–30 nucleotide overhang homologous to adjacent fragments in the targeting vector plasmid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A PCR 2).\nPCR amplification of DNA fragments\nPerform a PCR using the reaction recipe and conditions listed in step 19 to generate remaining fragments (e.g., 3′ and 5′ homology arms) for Gibson Assembly with a 15–30 nucleotide overhang homologous to adjacent fragments in the targeting vector plasmid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A PCR 3-4).\nAlternatives: Fragments can also be purchased using DNA synthesis services commercially available.\nNote: If amplifying fragments from genomic DNA is challenging for your region of interest, adding 0.5 mM MgCl2 and/or 3% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can increase the chances of successfully amplifying each fragment. Separately, you can also perform sequential PCRs by first amplifying your fragment without the 15–30 nucleotide DNA sequences homologous to adjacent fragments. Then, upon isolating your fragment from genomic DNA, a second PCR can be performed to attach adapter sequences for the Gibson Assembly reaction.\nAlternatives: Other high-fidelity polymerases can be used instead of Phusion, such as Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB E0555S).\nFollowing completion of the reaction, gel purify (Qiagen 28704) each DNA fragment.\nRestriction digest of targeting vector\nPrepare a restriction digest with the following recipe to linearize the targeting vector backbone plasmid.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_6.csv\nIncubate the reaction at 37°C for 1 h.\nGel purify the linearized plasmid. For pENTR4-HaloTag w876-1 the linearized plasmid should be ~2.3 kB long with a ~1 kB fragment cut out of the original plasmid.\nNote: Here we use two restriction enzymes with non-complementary cut sites. This decreases the chances of the linearized targeting vector plasmid backbone self-ligating, which reduce efficiency of the Gibson Assembly.",
    "Note: The targeting vector backbone plasmid as we describe is used only to amplify the targeting vector, and thus many plasmids could be suitable targeting vector plasmids. In general, smaller vectors will yield higher HDR efficiencies and targeting vector plasmids should not encode other transcripts. Other suitable targeting vector backbones include but are not limited to: (Addgene 12257 and 10791).\nOnce your DNA inserts (e.g., vimentin 5′ homology region + peptide linker + mNeon + 3′ homology region) and digested targeting vector plasmid are prepared using the previous steps, set up the following Gibson Assembly reaction on ice:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_7.csv\nIncubate the samples at 50°C for 60 min.

    "NSCs will be electroporated with both the SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid and the assembled targeting vector plasmid and then cultured for 3–10 days to achieve genetic knock-in of the fluorescent tag coding sequence into the genome and expression of the desired endogenously tagged gene. To electroporate NSCs, we recommend using the Amaxa Nucleofector system.\nTrypsinize proliferating NSCs in culture (Morrow et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15], Ahmed et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], Peltier et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) to generate a single-cell suspension:\nUse a pipette to detach any adherent cells off of the dish and then create a pellet by centrifugation at 120 × g for 4 min.\nResuspend pellet in 100 μL 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen 25300-054) in Versene (Thermo Fisher 15040066) and incubate at 37°C for 5 min.\nQuench the trypsinization with 200 μL volume of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma T6522) and then mechanically dissociate the sample with a pipette by pipetting 15–20 times vigorously.\nFurther quench the trypsinization by adding 3 mL of NSC media DMEM/F12 GlutaMax (Invitrogen 10565018) with penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone (1:100, Invitrogen 15140122), B27 (1:50, Invitrogen 17504044), and 20 ng/mL FGF-2 and EGF (PeproTech 100-18B and AF-100-15).\nRemove the trypsin by pelleting the sample through centrifugation at 120 × g for 4 min and aspirating the supernatant.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer or cell counter and create a pellet of 4 million NSCs through centrifugation at 120 × g for 4 min.\nResuspend pellet by adding 100 μL Mouse Neural Stem Cell Nucleofector Solution and 3.5 μg SpCas9:sgRNA dual plasmid and 3.5 μg targeting vector plasmid, by pipetting gently up and down 3–5 times.\nImmediately transfer resuspension to an electroporation cuvette, close the cuvette with the cap and then electroporate using program A-033 on a Nucleofector device.\nImmediately following electroporation, quench the sample by adding 1 mL prewarmed NSC media to the cuvette.",
    "Use a plastic disposable pipette to transfer the electroporated cell solutions, avoiding the “foam-like” cellular debris, to a 150 mm diameter uncoated culture dish (150 cm2 area) with 10 mL of NSC media and as quickly as possible return cells to the incubator.\nCritical: Moving as fast as possible post-electroporation will ensure the highest NSC viability.\nNote: It is expected to see significant cell death (~50%+ of cells) immediately after electroporation due to the electroporation itself. Using less NSCs will increase the amount of cell death during electroporation. Finally, avoidance of collection of the foam-like cellular debris following electroporation will improve longer-term survival.\nOptional: 24 hours following electroporation, trypsinize NSCs and replate them into a 10 cm dish to remove dead cells and debris. This step additionally can increase survival of the culture.\nOptional: If you are unable to achieve viability after electroporation sufficient to isolate successfully edited cells, you can further increase survival by plating NSCs onto Poly-L-Ornithine (PLO)- and laminin-coated culture dishes, such as Fisher Scientific 12-565-163 (coating as previously described: incubate with PLO for 1 hour at 37°C (PLO; 10 μg/mL in ddH2O) and with laminin for 3 hours at 37°C (5 μg/mL in PBS)) (Morrow et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Once electroporated NSCs are plated onto coated wells, they can be washed with warm media to remove cellular debris and dead cells ~4 hours following plating, limiting the requirement for trypsinization.\nPart D- isolation of fluorescently tagged NSCs\nTiming: 1 month\nElectroporated NSCs from the previous section of the protocol will be single cell-sorted and expanded clonally over the course of roughly 2–4 weeks and then screened for zygosity of the fluorescent tag knock-in by PCR on genomic DNA isolated from clones.",
    "24–72 h following electroporation, use a fluorescent microscope to visualize electroporated samples for knock-in of the desired fluorescent tag (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/934-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative data for tagging the carboxyl terminus of vimentin with mNeon\n(A and B) NSCs were electroporated either with or without plasmids for a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated tagging (green) of vimentin’s carboxyl terminus with mNeon and A) imaged with a fluorescent microscope and B) analyzed with a flow cytometer. Panel A shows a fixed NSC with the nucleus labeled with Hoechst (blue). Panel B shows mNeon fluorescence and forward scatter-area (FSC-A) of single cells.\n(C) Following expansion of clones expressing mNeon, genomic DNA was extracted from two positive clones and analyzed for either a homozygous (homo) or heterozygous (het) fluorescent tag by PCR. Genomic DNA is abbreviated as gDNA. Scale bar, 10 μm.\nAlternatives: If attempting to place a peptide that is not a fluorescent tag into the genome, you can alternatively screen clones by performing a PCR and/or Sanger Sequencing.\nNote: Depending on the synthesis and degradation rate of your protein of interest, the time it takes for the fluorescent tag to be placed into the genome and the fluorescent reporter to become detectable in live cells with a fluorescent microscope can be variable. As a general rule of thumb, you should be able to detect fluorescence within 72 hours following electroporation for most proteins that are expressed in your cell type.",
    "Note: If your fluorescently tagged protein is highly expressed, you may be able to detect fluorescence in live cells on plastic culture dishes. However, if your protein of interest is not as highly expressed, you may not be able to detect successful fluorescent tags using a fluorescent microscope on plastic culture dishes in live cells due to a suboptimal refractive index of plastic. To increase the likelihood of detecting correctly tagged cells, you can alternatively plate NSCs onto coated glassware or plastic with a refractive index optimized for your fluorescent microscope’s objective lenses. Further, fixing cells and removing autofluorescent compounds in the media can additionally increase clarity of signal. Lastly, you can also run trypsinized samples through a flow cytometer to probe for dimmer cells harboring fluorescent tags.\nAfter visualizing expression of your fluorescent tag, use flow cytometry to sort single cells with the fluorescent tag.\nOn the day of cell sorting, precoat a 96-well plate with PLO for 1 h at 37°C (PLO; 10 μg/mL in ddH2O) followed by laminin for 3 h at 37°C (5 μg/mL in PBS).\nTrypsinize cells and then sort single cells using a fluorescence activated cell sorter directly into a 96 well plate preloaded with media (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). We recommend resuspending samples in prechilled dPBS with 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1 μg/mL DNAse (Sigma-Aldrich D5025-15KU) and keeping samples on ice until completion of cell sorting. We recommend using a larger nozzle for cell sorting (~130 μm).\nCritical: Immediately following cell sorting, spin down the plate in a centrifuge at 120 × g for 4 minutes to increase the chances cells will stick to the bottom of the dish and survive.",
    "Alternatives: If you do not need to isolate a pure population of heterozygous or homozygous knock-ins, you can bulk sort all positive fluorescent cells into one well. This substantially expedites the timeline.\nNote: Following single cell sorting, it takes ~25–35 days for a single young adult mouse hippocampal NSC clone to expand to fill one well of a 96 well plate. Typically only ~30% of single-cell sorted clones are able to successfully expand. During expansion, change media at least once every 72 hours (Morrow et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nAfter expanding clones with fluorescent tags, clones should be screened to identify heterozygous and homozygous fluorescent tag knock-in. We recommend generating pellets of at least 10,000 cells to extract genomic DNA for a PCR. To do this, during the first split, take half of the cells to create a pellet for sequencing and use the other half of the cells to continue expanding the clone.\nAfter creating cell pellets from each clone, extract genomic DNA using a commercially available kit (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific K182001) and set up a PCR with the following parameters using primers that flank the site in which your fluorescent tag is placed, but which begin amplification outside of the homology arms (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/934-Mmc1.xlsx]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_8.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_934_9.csv\nRun the PCR reaction on an agarose gel to visualize PCR products and determine which clones are heterozygotes or homozygotes by probing for the presence of bands indicating alleles that are either harboring (larger PCR product) or lacking (smaller PCR product) your desired fluorescent tag (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nPerform Sanger Sequencing to validate that the fluorescent tag has been successfully placed in the genome without any mutations to the fluorescent tag, linker peptide or endogenous protein of interest.\nCritical: PCR reaction conditions may need to be optimized depending on the targeted gene."
