    "1. Synthesis of Pyropheophorbide-lipid\nCombine 200 mmol pyropheophorbide (prepared from Spirulina Pacifica algae as described previously; Zheng et al., Bioconj. Chem., 2002, 13-392)4, 98.7 mg 16:0 lysophophatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Avanti Polar Lipids #855675), 76.3 mg of EDC , 48.7 mg DMAP (4-(dimethylamino)pyridine) in 5 ml amylene stabilized chloroform for a ratio of 1:1:2:2 Pyro:Lipid:EDC:DMPA.\nStir the reaction mixture at room temperature under argon for 24 hr. Evaporate the chloroform under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator with heating to 40 °C. The mixture of pyro-lipid isomers (pyro attached at the sn-1 or sn-2 position) is produced.\nResuspend pyro-lipid isomer mixture in 1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 0.5% Triton X-100 and 10% methanol at the concentration of 5 mg/ml. Add phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from honey bee venom at 0.1 mg/ml concentration and incubate the solution at 37 °C for 24 hr to digest sn-1 pyro-lipid and to produce the pure sn-2 pyro-lipid isomer.\nAdd additional 2 volumes of chloroform and 1.25 volumes of methanol, extract, and then remove the solvent using rotary evaporation at reduced pressure at 40 °C. Resuspend the cleavage product in 1% MeOH in DCM and purify over a small diol silica column for the isomerically pure pyro-lipid.\n2. Preparation of Porphysomes\nDissolve pyropheophorbide-lipid, distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-methoxy (polyethylene glycol) (PEG-2000-PE) and cholesterol in chloroform separately, and record the concentrations respectively.\nPrepare porphysome lipid film in a 12x75 mm borosilicate test tube with a total lipid weight of 5 mg/tube by combining 65 molar % porphyrin-lipid, 5 molar % PEG-2000-PE and 30 molar % cholesterol.\nDry the lipid films under a stream of nitrogen gas and let them further dried under vacuum for 1 hr. Store the lipid films at -20 °C under argon until future hydration and extrusion.",
    "Add 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4) to each lipid film tube. Freeze the test tube in liquid nitrogen until completely frozen, and then thaw the tube in 65 °C water bath until the sample has all melted. Vortex the tube for a total of 30 sec (3x at 10 sec each, with 5 sec re-heating in 65 °C water bath between each vortexing).\nRepeat the freeze-thaw for 5 cycles or more upon needed until no large aggregates can be observed in the hydrated solution. Leave the porphysome suspension on ice when done.\nAssemble the high pressure extruder (10 ml) with two stacked 100 nm polycarbonate filters installed in. Connect the thermobarrel extruder to a thermostatted circulator for 65 °C circulating water bath, and connect the extruder system to a nitrogen tank for high pressure supply.\nTransfer the porphysome suspension to the extruder chamber using a 9 inch glass transfer pipette. Set the pressure by turning the dial on the nitrogen tank regulator until a reading between 200 and 300 psig is observed as initial extrusion pressure. Open the valve of the pressure regulator gradually until sufficient porphysome flow rate is achieved or a maximum of 800 psig (5,440 kPa) of pressure is reached.\nAfter the first extrusion pass is complete, close the pressure control valve and release the pressure of the extruder by opening the pressure relief valve on the extruder top. Refill the extruder with the freshly extruded porphysome solution, and repeat the extrusion for at least 10 times to ensure the final extruded solution is homogeneous.",
    "Determine the concentration of final porphysome solution by measuring the absorption of a diluted sample in methanol by UV-Vis spectrometer. Calculate the concentration using the following equation with the extinction coefficient of 97,000 M-1cm-1 at 410 nm for pyropheophorbide-lipid.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50536/50536eq1.jpg\nMeasure the final size distribution of porphysomes using a Malvern Zetasizer ZS90 by dynamic light scattering. Dilute porphysome solution in PBS and perform three measurements with 15 runs each for the averaged results.\nDetermine the fluorescence quenching of porphysome by comparing the fluorescence emission of quenched porphysome (1 mM in PBS) and unquenched porphysome (1 mM in 1% Triton X-100) using Spectrofluorometer. Take the spectra before and after the detergent (Tirton X-100) is added, and normalize the signal reading to maximum fluorescence. Set the excitation to be 410 nm, and emission wavelength range to be 600-800 nm.\nKeep porphysomes solution under argon at 4 °C until future use, and protect it from light by aluminum foil.\n3. Preparation of Animal Xenograft Model\nCulture the KB cells in RPMI-1640 (with 10% FBS), and sustain the cells in 5% CO2 and moisturized atmosphere at 37 °C.\nHarvest KB cells using standard cell culture technique. Keep the cell suspension (20,000 cells/ml) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) on ice for short-term storage until time of injection.\nPrepare a KB xenografts on nude mice. Nude mice are purchased from Charles River Laboratories when they are 20 g (Category# Crl:NU(NCr)-Foxn1nu, 6-7 weeks-old), given standard diet and bedding (Harlan Laboratories; Diet: Irradiated LM-485, #7912; Bedding: Corncob bedding, ¼”, #7097). Sterilize all the animal handling tools (syringe, forceps, and animal pad) prior to experiments. Anesthetize mice with 2% isoflurane v/v in 100% oxygen carrier gas. All animal protocols are approved by the institution (University Health Network in this case) animal care and use committee.",
    "Inject tumor cells suspended in PBS subcutaneously to the right flank of mice. Mice are ready to be used after 10 days when tumor reaches diameter of 4-5 mm and thickness of 2-3 mm.\n4. In vivo Photothermal Therapy\nInject porphysomes (containing 750 nmol pyro at 200 µl volume) intravenously via tail vein. Conduct laser irradiation 24 hr post-injection of porphysomes.\nIn this section, conduct all procedures in an enclosed laser safety room. Wear laser safety goggles during laser irradiation.\nSet up the laser irradiation equipment. Hold the laser fiber and a diffuser by a clamp on a stand. Set the laser power at low level and turn on the laser. Adjust the height of laser fiber to achieve an irradiation area of 9 mm in diameter (DPSS Laser, LaserGlow Technologies, Toronto, Canada), calibrate the laser power to 750 mW (1.18 W/cm2) using a power meter and then turn off the laser to prepare the animals.\nAnesthetize the animals with 2% isoflurane v/v in 100% oxygen carrier gas through nose cone no scavenging evident of isoflurane a human health risk hazard). Confirm that the animal is anesthetized deep enough by performing a toe pinch with forceps or fingers to animal's hind paws. The animals are ready for laser irradiation when they are unresponsive to this procedure.\nMonitor the tumor temperature by an infrared thermal camera (Mikroshot, LUMASENSE Technologies). Place the camera close to the tumor, focus it well and take a pre PTT image as well as a regular white-light image before PTT irradiation starts.",
    "Turn on the laser again, and increase the light power to 750 mW. Position the tumor in the center of laser beam to get the tumor fully covered, and start timing the irradiation. Take the tumor temperature image every 5 sec for a one minute laser treatment. Turn off the laser at 1 min. Stop the gas supply of 2% isoflurane, wait until the animal recovers from the anesthesia and put it back to the cage.\nKeep mice at normothermia animal room under 12:12 hr dark and light cycle according to animal protocols approved by University Health Network. Inject Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneously twice a day for a week following the laser irradiation to reduce the pain caused by the scar. Every two days, measure the tumor diameter using a caliper and take a photo. Calculate the tumor volume using the following equation: V=π/6 · a · b2, where a is the long diameter, and b is the short one.\nSacrifice the animals by putting them in CO2 chamber when the long diameter of the tumor reaches 10 mm, as it is the defined end point in our laboratory. Perform cervical dislocation following the CO2 treatment. Plot the survival curve.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
