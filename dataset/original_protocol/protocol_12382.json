    "Ethics statement: The project has been approved by IUCPQ’s Research Ethics Committee prior to patient recruitment. For the purpose of this article/video, we obtained tissues from 2 patients: 1) a 62 year-old male patient with a BMI of 50.7 kg/m2 and 2) a 35 year-old female patient with a BMI of 57 kg/m2. Experiments can be done with both fat compartments, but have been limited to one fat compartment for the purpose of this video. Technical aspects of the video were performed with patient 1 and FABP4 immunofluorescence was performed with dedifferentiated cells from patient 2.\n1. Sample Processing\nAsk surgeons to collect adipose tissue from the omental and subcutaneous fat compartments at the time of laparoscopic bariatric surgery.\nQuickly bring adipose samples to the laboratory at RT and process immediately.\nPerform digestion in the laboratory, in a non-sterile atmosphere. The cells will eventually be transferred to the culture room and cultivated under sterile conditions. To avoid contamination, prepare KRH buffer with distilled and filtrated water and follow by a filtration (0.22µM filter) prior to digestion. Thoroughly clean tubes with ethanol prior transfer in the cell culture hood for flask and plate preparation.\nPlace adipose tissue on a pre-weighted dish and record weight. Fix a small piece of each tissue sample (less than 1 cm2) in 10% formalin buffer at RT for at least 24 hr before paraffin embedding. Use this embedded sample for immunohistochemistry experiments (technique not shown).\nPlace another piece in a 50-ml tube and flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80 °C for further studies on whole adipose tissues (e.g., gene expression - technique not shown).\n2. Collagenase Digestion\nPlace the remaining adipose tissue piece in a 50 ml tube for digestion.",
    "Add 4 ml of KRH-WB supplemented with collagenase (350 U/ml) per gram of sample in the digestion tube.\nMince adipose tissue with scissors.\nPlace minced adipose tissue suspension in a shaker, 37 °C, 90 rpm maximum, for a 45-minute incubation (maximum 1 hr).\n3. Purification of Adipocytes and Preadipocytes\nPour the translucent solution with few chunks of fat through a 400 µM nylon mesh into a plastic beaker.\nWith tweezers, rub the cell preparation on the nylon mesh and wash with 5 ml of KRH-WB.\nDelicately transfer the filtrated cell suspension into a 50 ml tube with the plastic tubing in it and a 60cc syringe attached at the tubing extremity.\nLet the suspension with mature adipocytes stand for approximately 10 min, allowing the cells to reach the top of the buffer by floatation.\nSlowly aspirate the buffer at the bottom of the tube using 60cc syringe suction.\nAdd 20 ml of KRH-WB to wash. Repeat from step 3.4 for 2 additional washes.\nCollect the buffer to bring the adipocyte suspension to a final volume of 5 or 10 ml, depending on cell quantity. Pursue with steps in section 5.\nRecover the stromal-vascular fraction from the buffer collected with the 60cc syringe by centrifugation (3,000 rpm, RT, 5 min) for further primary cell culture if desired (technique not shown).\n4. Mature Adipocyte Cell Count\nLoad 10 µl of gently shaken adipocyte suspension in a counting chamber (haemocytometer). Perform cell count in quadruplicate.\nCalculate number of isolated mature cells.\n5. Mature Adipocyte Dedifferentiation into T-25 Flask\nFill a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask to ¾ of the volume with DMEM/F12-20% calf serum.\nAccording to cell count, pour 500,000 mature cells into the flask.\nFill the flask completely using a 50ml tube with medium and remove as many bubbles as possible.",
    "Screw the unvented cap on the flask.\nClean the flask with ethanol prior to incubation to avoid contamination.\nIncubate the flask upside down for a week without touching it to avoid movement in the culture that may disrupt cellular adherence.\nPrior to reversing the flask at 7 days of inverted culture, gently manipulate the flask and remove all medium in the flask by aspiration, avoiding abrupt movements.\nAdd 12 ml of DMEM-F12-20% calf serum and cultivate cells with standard techniques. A filtered, vented cap may be added to the flask.\n6. Mature Adipocyte Dedifferentiation into a 6-well Plate\nPlace a coverslip on the bottom of each well of a 6-well plate\nAdd a ½” plastic bushing on top of each coverslip.\nFill wells with 8 ml of 20% calf serum-DMEM medium.\nPut a coverslip on each plastic bushing.\nInsert pipet tip between the slide and the tube to inject cells under the slide (50,000 cells per well).\nIncubate plates in a standard cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for a week.\nReverse coverslip with attached cells into each well containing 2 ml of media supplemented with 20% calf serum and pursue culture.\nUse coverslip with cells undergoing dedifferentiation for several purposes including immunofluorescence (technique not shown).\nSubscription Required.
