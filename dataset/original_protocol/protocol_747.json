    "1. Set Incubator to 60°C and warm PS Solution A, PS Solution B, and PS Solution C for 20 minutes to ensure no precipitates are present.\n  2. Add 50 mL of 96-100% ethanol to Wash Solution and check off box on bottle noting addition of ethanol. \n  3. Add 10 µL 2-Mercaptoethanol per 1 mL PS Solution B.<sup>1</sup> \n  4. Transfer 500 µL biofluid into a microfuge tube.\n  5. Add 100 µL PS Solution A<sup>2</sup> and 900 µL PS Solution B \\(containing 2-Mercaptoethanol). \n  6. Vortex for 15 seconds. \n  7. Incubate for 10 min at 60°C.\n  8. Add 1.5 mL 100% Ethanol. \n  9. Vortex for 15 seconds.\n  10. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 100 x g at room temperature. Carefully decant supernatant, discarding it. DO NOT disrupt pellet. \n  11. To the pellet add 750 µL PS Solution C. \n  12. Vortex for 15 seconds. \n  13. Incubate for 10 min at 60°C.\n  14. Add 750 µL 100% Ethanol. \n  15. Vortex for 15 seconds. \n  16. Assemble a mini filter Spin Column with a collection tube. \n  17. Transfer 650 µL of the mixture to the Filter Column. \n  18. Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature. \n  19. Discard flow-through. \n  20. Repeat steps 17-19 until all of the mixture has been added to the Filter Column.\n  21. Add 400 µL Wash Solution to the column. \n  22. Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.\n  23. Discard flow-through. \n  24. Repeat steps 21-23 two more times for a total of 3 washes. \n  25. Open the cap of the column and centrifuge for 3 minutes at 16,000 x g at room temperature to dry the column. Discard collection tube.\n  26. Transfer the spin column to a fresh 1.7 mL elution tube.\n  27. Apply 30 µL water to the column.<sup>3</sup>",
    "28. Centrifuge for 2 mins at 300 x g at room temperature to load the solution onto the column.\n  29. Centrifuge for 3 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature to elute the RNA.<sup>4</sup>"
