    "Before starting the RNA purification be sure that you have cleaned pipets, centrifuges, bench, the chemical hood, equipment for gels and the marker pen with RNaseZap to ensure that everything is RNase free. At every step of the protocol you should wear nitrile/latex gloves to avoid RNase contamination.Total RNA purification using the hot phenol method and RNA quality control by electrophoresisPrepare a pre-culture by inoculating 5 ml of TSB medium with a single colony of S. flexneri 5a M90T from a Congo red tryptone soy agar plate and grow overnight (~16 h) at 37 °C with agitation (150 RPM).Note: Ensure that the colonies used are secretion-competent (forming red colonies on the plate due to Congo red absorption) (Sharma and Puhar, 2019). Subculture by diluting 100 μl of the pre-culture in 10 ml of TSB (1:100 dilution).Grow to OD600 = 0.3 with shaking. This will take approximately 2 h if the medium is pre-warmed.Mix the culture with 2 ml of cold stop solution.Incubate the mixed culture with the stop solution on ice for 30 min. Note: To stabilize the RNA and prevent degradation, incubate it for at least 30 min, but not longer than 2 h on ice. Transfer the culture into a 15 ml tube.Centrifuge for 5 min at 16,200 x g at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant by decanting. Keep ~2 ml of supernatant to resuspend the pellet in it.Transfer the resuspended cells into two 1.5 ml tubes.Centrifuge for 5 min at 16,200 x g at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant by decanting.Note: At this point the samples could be frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Samples are stable for months.  Purify the total RNA using the hot phenol method as follows.Resuspend cell pellets in 500 μl of lysis solution at room temperature.",
    "Under the chemical hood add 500 μl of phenol pH 4 pre-warmed to 65 °C. Mix by inversion at least 20 times.Note: Pre-warm in a heat block the phenol before starting the RNA purification. Vortex vigorously for 20 s.Incubate 5 min at 65 °C in the heat block.Centrifuge 3 min at 13,800 x g at room temperature.Note: If the centrifugation step is done at 4 °C the SDS is going to precipitate and the solution turns white, which does not affect the efficacy of the process but makes it difficult to differentiate the two phases. After this centrifugation time you should see two phases, the upper one should be whitish (when the SDS is cooling down it becomes insoluble). RNA is in the aqueous phase (upper phase), while in the clearly white disk interphase there are protein layers and DNA, whereas lipids and some other cellular components are dissolved in the lower transparent phase that is the organic phase. Transfer the upper phase (~500 μl) to a new RNase-free tube under the chemical hood.Add 1 ml of cold (4 °C) absolute ethanol.Mix thoroughly by vortexing for 5 s until you see a homogeneous mixture.Centrifuge at 16,200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Discard supernatant that contains the ethanol solution by decanting.Note: At this step you can see a white/transparent pellet on the bottom. Add 1 ml of 80% ethanol at room temperature. Shake the tube vigorously for 10 s.Note: Do not use the vortex, it can detach the pellet from the bottom. Centrifuge at 16,200 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant by decanting.Centrifuge (short spin) the tubes and discard the remaining liquid by pipetting.Dry samples at room temperature by leaving the tubes uncapped on the bench.",
    "Note: Once that the sample is completely dry it turns transparent. It can take 10 min to obtain a completely dry sample. Resuspend the RNA sample in 100 μl of nuclease free water. Check the quality of the purified RNA in a 1% agarose gel in TAE 1x as follows.Prepare the sample to be analyzed in a 1.5 ml tube. Add 1 μl of sample plus 5 μl of RNA loading buffer 2x and 4 μl of nuclease free water. Heat the sample for 5 min at 65 °C for secondary and tertiary structures denaturation.Cool down the tube in ice for 5 min.Spin down for 2 s and load the gel.Run the gel in TAE 1x buffer for 40 min at 100 V.Stain the gel with 3x-concentrated Gel Red for 10 min.Wash the gel with 20 ml of nuclease free water for 10 min shaking at room temperature.Visualize the gel under UV light (Figure 3A). If the total RNA purification was successful, the 23S and 16S are visible as clear, heavy bands, while in the lower part of the gel weaker tRNA bands are observed. It is not possible to see mRNAs. In case of RNA degradation, bands appear as smear.Quantify the RNA in a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Figure 3B).Note: At least 20 μg (10 μg for each of two conditions) of total RNA are necessary to continue with the protocol. Typical concentrations should be around 500-900 ng/ml. Very successful purifications yield up to 1,500 ng/ml RNA.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916003924_9309.pngFigure 3. Total RNA quality control. A.

    "Freeze the RNA samples at -20 °C. The RNA samples are stable for months.DNase treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA from total RNAProtocol volumes are for one reaction, but every step is scalable to two or more reactions.Dilute 10 μg of total RNA to a final volume of 30 μl using nuclease free water.Denature RNA in nuclease free water for 5 min at 65 °C in the heat block.Cool down in ice for 5 min.Prepare a reaction mix containing the components listed in Table 1. The indicated quantities are sufficient for one sample containing 10 μg of RNA.Table 1. DNase reaction mix for one reactionNote: 1 Unit of DNase I for 1 μg of total RNA.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916004026_0698.pngAdd the reaction mix to the RNA sample tube on ice.Incubate the reaction mix for 60 min at 37 °C in the heat block.Note: Be sure that the heat block is at the correct temperature, DNase works efficiently at 37 °C. Add to the reaction tube 60 μl of nuclease free water to obtain 100 μl final volume.RNA clean-up by chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitationAdd 100 μl of CHISAM to the reaction tube under the chemical hood.Mix with the vortex vigorously for 15 s.Centrifuge the tube for 2 min at 13,800 x g, 4 °C.Under the chemical hood transfer ~100 μl from the aqueous phase (upper) that contains the RNA to a new 1.5 ml tube. Discard the organic phase (lower), proteins and salts from the buffer are dissolved in this phase.Repeat Steps C1-C4.Add 300 μl of cold absolute ethanol (3 sample volumes), 10 μl of sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.5 (1/10 of sample volume) and 1 μl of glycogen (20 mg/ml).Vortex the mix vigorously for 5 s.Incubate the tube at -20 °C for 30 min.",
    "Note: This step is optional, but it is good to do it to decrease the loss of RNA in the next steps. Centrifuge at 16,200 x g (or maximum speed) for 30 min at 4 °C.Note: Centrifugation step can be for longer time. The minimum is 30 min, but it could be for 2 to 4 h. Discard the supernatant carefully by decanting.Note: On the bottom of the tube there should be a white pellet. Discard the supernatant without detaching the pellet.  Add 1 ml of 80% ethanol at room temperature to wash the RNA.Mix the tube by inverting 20 times.Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 13,800 x g, 4 °C.Discard the supernatant by decanting.Centrifuge (short spin) and discard the remaining liquid with a 100 μl pipette.Keep the tubes open on ice to dry the samples.Note: The time required to dry the samples depends on how well the liquid phase was removed (usually it takes 10-15 min). The pellet is completely transparent once it is completely dry. Resuspend the total RNA in 23 μl of nuclease free water.Check the integrity of the DNase-free RNA by visual inspection of the 23S and 16S band on 1% agarose gel as performed after the total RNA extraction.Prepare the running sample as in Steps A30-A37.Visualize the gel under UV light (Figure 4A).Quantify the RNA in the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (the final RNA concentration should be ~600-1,000 ng/ml) (Figure 4B). It is normal to detect lower concentrations after the process, as the presence of DNA increase the absorbance of the sample.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916004134_6035.pngFigure 4.

    "The absence of a PCR product seen as a 909 bp band in lanes 2-4 indicates that the purified RNA is devoid of DNA contaminations.rRNA depletionRibosomal RNA is the most abundant RNA species. If rRNA is not removed, most reads from sequencing will originate from rRNA. As a consequence, samples which are compared need to all either have or be devoid of rRNA, or else the sequencing depth will be very different and statistical analysis cannot be performed. The TEX treatment described in the next section to enrich for primary RNA removes all RNA that is not tri-phosphorylated including rRNA, making this library rRNA-depleted. Therefore, to allow the comparison of TEX-treated with mock-treated samples, rRNA needs to be specifically depleted first from total RNA before splitting the RNA into two for further treatment.    rRNA depletion is carried out using a commercial kit, which specifically depletes bacterial rRNA, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Specific depletion of bacterial rRNA generally relies on hybridization with tagged pan-bacterial probes that recognize conserved sequences in rRNA, followed by removal of captured rRNAs, for example by precipitation with magnetic beads that bind the tag of the probes.We have used the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit for Bacteria from Illumina, but unfortunately it is not available anymore on the market. However, it can be replaced with any hybridization-based kit of your choice. We provided some suggestions in the Material section.Terminator exonuclease (TEX) treatment to enrich for primary transcripts Prepare two (TEX- and TEX+) 1.5 ml reaction tubes with 10 μg (10 μl) each of DNase I treated RNA (from the same sample) in nuclease free water.Denature RNAs for 2 min at 90 °C.Cool down on ice for 5 min.Add to each tube the reaction mix described in Table 4.",
    "The indicated quantities are sufficient for one sample containing 10 μg of RNA:Table 4. Reaction mix for TEX treatmentimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916004542_8839.pngNote: The final reaction volume is going to be 20 μl after adding the enzyme for the TEX+ sample or water for the TEX- sample.Add 1 μl of nuclease free water to the TEX- sample.Add 1 μl of TEX (1 U/ml) to the TEX+ sample.Incubate for 60 min at 30 °C in the thermo cycler.Note: This step could be carried in a heat block, but the temperature variation and liquid evaporation are important factors that hamper good results, and these effects are stronger in a heat block. Add 80 μl of nuclease free water to obtain 100 μl final volume.Add 100 μl of Phe-CHISAM to the reaction tube under the chemical hood.Mix with the vortex vigorously for 15 s.Centrifuge the tube for 2 min at 13,800 x g, 4 °C.Transfer ~100 μl of the upper phase that contains the RNA to a new tube under the chemical hood.Repeat Steps F9 to F12.Add 300 μl of cold absolute ethanol (3 sample volumes), 10 μl of sodium acetate 3M pH 5.5 (1/10 of sample volume) and 2 μl of glycogen (20 mg/ml).Vortex the sample vigorously.Incubate the tube at -20 °C overnight (around 16 h), but could be longer, for example over the weekend.Note: This step is very important. It helps complete recovery of the RNA. Centrifuge at 16,200 x g for 1 h at 4 °C.Note: The centrifugation step could be for longer time. Minimum 1 h, but could be for 2-4 h. Discard the aqueous phase carefully by decanting.Note: On the bottom of the tube there should be a white pellet. Discard the aqueous phase without detaching the pellet.",
    "In the case that you do not see any pellet before discarding the supernatant, just add 10 μl of sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.5 (1/10 of sample volume) and 2 μl of glycogen (20 mg/ml) and repeat Steps F16 to F18). Add 1 ml of cold 80% ethanol at room temperature to wash the RNA.Centrifuge for 5 min at 13,800 x g, 4 °C.Discard the aqueous phase by decanting.Centrifuge (short spin) and discard the remaining liquid with a 100 μl pipette.Keep the tubes open on ice to dry the samples.Note: The time required to dry the samples depends on how well the liquid phase was removed. It can take around 10-15 min. The pellet will be completely transparent once it is completely dry. Resuspend the RNA in 13 μl of nuclease free water.Check the integrity of the TEX- and TEX+ treated RNA by visual inspection on 1% agarose gel.Prepare the running sample as in Steps A29-A36. Visualize the gel under UV light (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916004640_9482.pngFigure 6. Shigella flexneri 5a M90T RNA treated (TEX+) and untreated (TEX-) with TEXNote: It is normal not to see clear bands in this gel for the mRNA, which is a mix of different transcripts of variable length. To see a smear in the gel means that the treatment was successful. If you do not have a high quantity of RNA maybe you will see only tRNAs.Quantify the RNA in the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (final RNA concentration should be ~20 ng/ml).Freeze the RNA samples at -20 °C. The RNA samples are stables for months.RNA 5’ Pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH) treatment of RNA to remove terminal phosphatesIn the following steps, the 5′-ends of the RNA prepared in Procedure F is modified with a linker-RNA-adaptor of known sequence, which allows the identification of TSS with single nucleotide precision.",
    "This is necessary because the sequence of adaptors added during library preparation for sequencing can be a trade secret (the full sequence of Illumina adaptors was only revealed recently and other platforms using adaptors of unknown sequence exist). During bioinformatic analysis of sequencing results, the sequence of adaptors is occasionally incompletely removed from reads and the remaining nucleotides could be confused for transcribed bases if they happened to align with the DNA sequence. However, this problem can be avoided by introducing the RNA adaptor of known sequence between the adaptors and the TSS. Moreover, the linker-RNA-adaptor allows to univocally identify 5′ ends present before RNA shearing during library preparation. To allow the ligation of adaptors to the 5’ end of the linker-RNA-adaptor during library preparation, the linker-RNA-adaptor must have a triphosphate in the 5′ end.Denature remaining 10 μl of TEX+ and TEX- treated RNA for 1 min at 90 °C.Cool down on ice for 5 min.Prepare RppH mix as described in the Table 5. The indicated quantities are sufficient for one sample:Table 5.

The gel should look similar as the one shown in Figure 6. Quantify the RNA in the NanoDrop spectrophotometer.Linker-RNA-adaptor phosphorylation prior to ligation to TEX+ and TEX- librariesDenature 100 pmol (10 μl) of the linker-RNA-adaptor per sample dissolved in nuclease free water for 5 min at 90 °C.Cool down on ice for 5 min.",
    "Note: You can keep the oligo on ice for longer time while you prepare the reaction. Prepare the T4 PNK mix according the Table 6.Table 6. Reaction mix for T4 PNK phosphorylation of the linker-RNA-adaptorimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916004843_0566.pngIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min in the thermo cycler.Add 80 μl of nuclease free water, follow the Steps F8-F23.Resuspend the RNA sample in 10 μl of nuclease free water.Note: After this step the RNA adaptor can be frozen at -20 °C and used later.Linker-RNA-adaptor ligation to TEX+ and TEX- samplesThe efficiency of linker-RNA-adaptor ligation is around 80-90%.Denature the phosphorylated RNA adaptor (10 μl) and RNAs treated with RppH (10 μl) at 65 °C for 5 min.Cool down on ice for 5 min.Prepare the T4 RNA ligase mix as described in Table 7 (quantities described on the table are for only one sample, if you are processing more samples just scale them up).Table 7. Reaction mix for linker-RNA-adaptor ligationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200916/20200916004945_8827.pngIncubate at 25 °C for 16 h in the thermo cycler.Add 60 μl of nuclease free water.Stop the reaction and precipitate the reaction following Steps F9-F23.Resuspend the RNA sample in 23 μl of nuclease free water.Note: Resuspension volume is defined by the sequencing facilities that you have decided to use. The RNA concentration in our case was 150 ng in 23 μl. Quantify the RNA adaptor by NanoDrop spectrophotometer.Library preparation for Illumina sequencingLibrary preparation for sequencing and RNA-sequencing is performed at the service platform or company of your choice. Stranded libraries must be prepared to identify the coding DNA strand. Paired-end sequencing with 150 nt read length should be performed. We used a TrueSeq library on a HiSeq 2000 platform. For microbial genomes, 10-20 M reads per sample will provide appropriate sequencing depth, but 5 M it is enough for an acceptable coverage."
