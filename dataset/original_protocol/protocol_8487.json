  "procedures": [
    "Procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) of the Capital Medical University. All surgical instruments and solutions were sterilized prior to surgery to limit microbial infection.\nNOTE: The surgical protocol included five parts, namely anesthesia, surgical approach, optic nerve evaluation, closing, and recovery. To assist with partial quantitative transection of the optic nerve, a new, low cost surgical instrument was designed. All procedures were carried out following ethical rules and the surgical technique.\n1. Surgical Technique\nCarry out experiments using the aseptic technique; protocols for animal use should be institution specific.\nSterilize instruments and materials (solutions, test substances, tracers, needles, etc.) coming into contact with living tissues in order to prevent infection and adverse impacts on animal welfare as well as potential negative impacts on the study.\n2. Anesthesia\nAnesthetize SD rats using a veterinary isoflurane vaporizer system. Use medical grade oxygen at a rate of 1 L/min to vaporize the isoflurane gas. Place the animal in the attached anesthesia box and run isoflurane at a concentration of 4.5% until slow breathing and animal sedation.\nSwitch the gas flow to the gas mask attachment and place the animal on the operation table. Lower the isoflurane concentration to 2% and monitor anesthesia. Larger animals (>300 g) may require a higher concentration of isoflurane. Monitor anesthesia during surgery, with isoflurane dosage adjusted accordingly. Constantly evaluate the depth and rate of breathing, and perform toe pinch evaluation every 5 min, to ensure the absence of deep pain.\nOnce the surgery is completed, turn off the isoflurane and allow the animal to breath oxygen for several minutes prior to removal from the operation table. Maintain body temperature by covering the animal with a surgical blanket and/or using a regulated heating blanket during surgery.",
    "3. Self-designed Surgical Assistant Instrument (SSAI)\nUse a SSAI made of stainless steel, and mainly comprises a hand-held pole (length, 100 mm; diameter, 9 mm) and a grooved head (Figure 1). The grooved surface of the grooved head is semi-circular, with vertical depth, width, and length of 200 µm, 500 µm, and 1,000 µm, respectively. Between the two parts, there is a joint section with a length of 50 mm. The grooved head's edge is 300 µm wide.\n\tNOTE: The grooved surface enables the stabilization of the ventral optic nerve for transection. The dorsal optic nerve is exposed to the exterior of the groove when the ventral side of the optic nerve lays within it; meanwhile, the dorsal optic nerve exposed to the grooved edge can be transected when vertical cutting is performed. The ventral optic nerve laid within the grooved surface is protected by the grooved head's edge.\nAchieve primary injury in RGCs corresponding to quantitatively transected optic nerve axons (dorsal side), while the secondary injury would be performed in RGCs corresponding to untransected optic nerve axons (ventral side) without direct damage.\n4. Surgical Approach\nPlace the right side of the rat upwards on the surgical table with head facing the surgeon. Adjust the right orbit in the center of the surgical field of view. Then, clean the incision area several times along the lateral canthus to the external acoustic foramen of the right orbital skin, applying 0.5% chlorhexidine in 75% ethanol. Remove the fur between the lateral canthus to the external acoustic foramen using iris scissors.",
    "Make a skin incision using iris scissors along the lateral canthus to the external acoustic foramen with a length of 0.5 to 1 cm. Then, pinch the fascia and pull upward to create a triangular wedge with 0.12mm toothed forceps. Insert the lower blade of Vannas spring scissors into the incision area and cut open the fascia in the same shear direction.\nCut the fascia with Vannas spring scissors and expose the orbital vein. Use sharp-serrated forceps to clamp the sides of the orbital vein and blunt open both sides of the incision. Place the orbital vein in the surgical direction of the orbital muscle surface, which is positioned to facilitate follow-up operation and to avoid surgery related bleeding of the orbital vein.\nUse iris scissors to cut the right lateral canthus apart along the incision line to fully expose the field of vision for blunt dissection of orbital muscles during follow up.\nContinue to clamp the folder of the subfascial orbital muscle, and blunt separate vertically in the direction of skin and fascia incision. Separate along sides gradually to reach the orbital depth, until appearance of the orbital adipose tissue.\nAfter exposure of the orbital adipose tissue, change the rat head direction from facing the surgeon vertically to the right side of the surgeon. Meanwhile, keep the area constantly moist using surgical or cotton swabs containing sterile PBS. This procedure ensures a clear vision of the surgical field, while keeping the tissues moist and soft.\n5. Accessing the Optic Nerve\nCut off orbital adipose tissues covering the orbital muscle cone around the optic nerve in the orbital cavity. This ensures a better exposure of the appropriate surgical approach. Keep resection of the fat tissue limited to avoid sustained bleeding.",
    "Cut the fat tissue, exposing the lateral rectus. Clamp the lateral rectus outward, and then cut it with Vannas spring scissors. If the fat tissue remains under the lateral rectus, pull up the fat overlying the optic nerve using 0.12 mm toothed forceps and cut it with Vannas spring scissors.\n\tNOTE: At this time, the tissue sheath around the optical nerve should be visible.\nContinue to separate the tissue sheath along the direction of the optic nerve in the orbital depth, until total exposure of the optic nerve. Keep the area clean by using surgical swabs to clean small amounts of blood that arise from tissue removal.\n\tNOTE: Now, the optic nerve should be visible.\nIn order to access it, remove the meningeal sheath that surrounds the nerve without damaging the ophthalmic artery. Gently rotate the sheath to examine the vascular pattern of the dura at high magnification under an operating microscope.\nIdentify an area devoid of blood vessels, and perform a longitudinal cut on the dura.13 Rip the sheath parallel to the direction of the optic nerve with a 26G needle tip or knifepoint of sapphire surgical probe carefully, avoiding damage to the vasculature with lateral cuts.\n\t\tNOTE: The only leftover covering the nerve should be the arachnoid membrane, which is very thin and transparent.\nSimilar to step 5.2, rip the arachnoid membrane gently with a 26G needle tip or knifepoint of sapphire surgical probe, parallel to the direction of the optic nerve.13",
    "Lay the optic nerve within the instrument groove softly and carefully, resulting in the dorsal optic nerve being slightly higher than the grooved head edge. At this time, transect the dorsal optic nerve above the edge of the grooved head platform with a 26G needle tip or knifepoint of sapphire surgical probe to complete partial optic nerve transection.\n6. Closing and Recovery\nMove the instrument a little deeper towards the vertical direction of the optic nerve to free the latter. Then, remove the grooved head of the instrument gently. Try not to scratch the ocular muscles or other tissues to avoid extra damage. The stump of partial optic nerve transection can be observed.\nReplace the lateral rectus, fascia and other surrounding tissues of the eye to their original positions. Then, suture the muscle and the skin layers of the orbit in sequence. If bleeding persists, gently fill with a medical cotton ball before closing the wound, and maintain this for a period of time. Apply antibiotic ointment to the wound to prevent infection.\nTurn off the isoflurane source and allow the animal to breath oxygen for several minutes. In the process of rat resuscitation, prepare thermal insulation with a heated mat, or cover the cage surface with dry padding. Cover the animals with blankets, to ensure rat airway patency during the recovery process.\nHouse animals individually after surgery. Administer post-surgical analgesics according to the guidelines provided by institutional animal care authorities. Carefully monitor animals after surgery."
