    "1. Prepare Fixative\n(See table Fixative and Buffers.)\n2. Prepare Perfusion Buffers\n(See table Fixative and Buffers.)\n3. Prepare Apparatus and Anesthesia\nUsing the water bath, warm perfusion buffer to 37 °C. Place outlet valve in a beaker filled with buffer. Fill a 50 ml syringe with buffer and attach to fixative tubing. Flush tubing repeatedly by expelling and withdrawing buffer.\nClear the line with buffer until all air bubbles in the tubing are eliminated. It is crucial for the success of a perfusion not to have air bubbles in any of the lines.\nRemove the syringe and connect the 4% paraformaldehyde fixative (room temperature) container. To avoid air bubbles at the tubing end, squeeze the tube while positioning the tube into the container so that a drop of buffer protrudes from the end to contact the fluid surface within the container.\nClose the outlet port (needle end). Turn buffer valve (blue) to the same position as the fixative valve (white). This will allow flow from the buffer line only.\nOpen the outlet port and repeat step A1 through A3 for filling the buffer line. After all the air bubbles are eliminated close the outlet port, remove the syringe and connect the buffer container, taking care not to introduce air bubbles into the tubing.\nTest system for ability to hold pressure by pumping the rubber manometer blub. There is normally some resistance due to the compression of air in the system.\nSetup surgery tools in order for easy of access. Fill perfusion needle with buffer to eliminate the possibility of air bubbles.",
    "Prior to surgery, a ketamine/xylazine mixture (up to 80 mg/kg body weight ketamine and 10 mg/kg body weight xylazine) is administered via intraperitoneal injection (27 gauge needle and 1 cc syringe). Additional administration of anesthetic will be performed as necessary during the course of each operation to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia.\n4. Perfusion Surgery\nOnce the animal has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia, place it on the shallow tray filled with crushed ice. (Use toe pinch-response method to determine depth of anesthesia. Animal must be unresponsive before continuing).\nMake a 5-6 cm lateral incision through the integument and abdominal wall just beneath the rib cage. Carefully separate the liver from the diaphragm.\nMake a small incision in the diaphragm using the curved, blunt scissors. The position and pressure of your finger can aid in the ability to cut the diaphragm.\nContinue the diaphragm incision along the entire length of the rib cage to expose the pleural cavity.\nPlace curved, blunt scissors along one side of the ribs, carefully displacing the lungs, and make a cut through the rib cage up to the collarbone. Make a similar cut on the contralateral side.\nLifting the sternum away, carefully trim any tissue connecting it to the heart. Clamp the tip of the sternum with the hemostat and place the hemostat over the head. When done properly, the thymus lifts away from the heart along with the sternum, providing a clear view of the major vessels.\nMake a small incision to the posterior end of the left ventricle using iris scissors.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3564/3564step7.jpg\n Click here to view larger figure[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3564/3564step7large.jpg].",
    "Pass a 15-gauge blunt- or olive-tipped perfusion needle through the cut ventricle into the ascending aorta. The tip should be visible through the wall of the aorta, and should not reach the aortic arch where the brachial and carotid arteries diverge.\nUse a hemostat to clamp the heart, this secures the needle and prevents leakage. If desired, the modified hemostat can be used to clamp the aorta around the needle tip (these hemostats remain in place until dissection begins, but are omitted from future illustrations for clarity).\nFinally, make an incision to the animal's right atrium using iris scissors to create as large an outlet as possible without damaging the descending aorta. At this point the animal is ready to be perfused.\n5. Perfusion\nOpen and attach outlet port to needle base taking care not to introduce any air bubbles.\nPump up the manometer bulb to a pressure of 80 mm Hg quickly & evenly. Maintain this pressure throughout the buffer infusion period. Start the timer.\nAdjust the needle angle. The angle of the needle is critical to the achievement of a maximum flow rate (note the flow change with angle adjustment).\nSwitch the buffer valve (blue) once buffer is almost finished (200 ml). The fluid should be running clear. The clearing of the liver is an indicator of a good perfusion. The liver should be clear at this point. Indicate time for your records.\nFixation tremors should be observed within seconds; this should be considered the true time of fixation. Indicate time for your records.\nThe pressure can gradually be increase up to a maximum of 130 mm Hg 2 to maintain a steady flow rate.\nClose the outlet valve once the fixative is nearly finished. Indicate ending time for your records.",
    "The rat should be stiff at this stage.\nThe used paraformaldehyde must be collected and stored for disposal according to the regulations of your institution.\n6. Dissection 4,11\nRemove the head using a pair of scissors.\nMake a midline incision along the integument from the neck to the nose and expose the skull.\nTrim off the remaining neck muscle so that the base of the skull is exposed; remove any residual muscle using scissor or rongeurs.\nPlace the sharp end of a pair of iris scissors into the foramen magnum on one side, carefully sliding the scissors along the inner surface of the skull.\nNext, make a cut extending to the distal edge of the posterior skull surface. Make an identical cut on the contralateral side. Use the rongeurs to clear away the skull around the cerebellum.\nCarefully slide the scissors along the inner surface of the skull as the tip travels from the dorsal distal posterior corner to the distal frontal edge of the skull, lifting up on the blade as you are cutting to prevent damage to the brain. Repeat for opposite side.\nUsing rongeurs peel the dorsal surface of the skull away from the brain. Trim away the sides of the skull using rongeurs as well.\nUsing a spatula, sever the olfactory bulbs and nervous connections along the ventral surface of the brain.\nGently tease the brain away from the head, trimming any dura that still connects the brain to the skull using iris scissors.\nRemove the brain and place it in a vial of fixative containing fluid at least 10x the volume of the brain itself. Swirl the vial occasionally.\n7. Post-fixation & Storage\nKeep the brain in fixative for 24 hours at 4 °C, swirling occasionally.",
    "After 24 hours, wash the brain with phosphate buffered saline by exchanging the media 3 times and swirling each time.\nBrains can then be stored in phosphate buffered saline or HBHS with sodium azide and kept at 4 °C.\n8. Representative Results\nAn initial indicator of the success of the perfusion is the clearing of extremities such as the nose, ears, and paws and internal organs such as the thymus gland and liver (IHC World). Gross inspection of the brain reveals the blood vessel void of blood (white to pale yellow appearance). This will be also true within tissue sections destine for staining and immunohistochemistry. The final indicator of outcome of the perfusion is the condition of the ultrastructure in the tissue.1,6,7,8\ntable:\n﻿0\nPrepare Fixative:\nPrepare 8% Paraformaldehyde stock\n\"Add 40 g Paraformaldehyde to 500 ml dH2O. Heat the solution to 60- 65 °C while stirring (Do not exceed 65 °C, doing so can adversely affect the success of the immunohistochemical procedure). To clear the solution, reduce heat and add 2-3 ml of 1.0 M NaOH with a dropper. Filter and store at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\"\n\"Prepare 0.2 M Sodium Phosphate Buffer, pH 7.4\"\n\"For the sodium phosphate monobasic stock, add 27.8 g NaH2PO4* H2O to 1 L dH2O.
