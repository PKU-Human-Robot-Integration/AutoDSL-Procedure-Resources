    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPellet formation\nTiming: 1 day\nFormation of 3D MSC pellet at the bottom of tube by centrifugation and 16 h (overnight) culture.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nHarvest MSCs from culture flasks by trypsinization and centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in complete culture medium at a concentration of 2×105 cells/mL.\nAdd 1 mL of cell suspension to 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 450 × g for 10 min.\nSlightly loosen the cap of centrifuge tube and incubate the tubes at 37°C in humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 16 h (overnight).\nWnt antagonism-based chondrogenic induction\nTiming: 1 day\nInduce MSC chondrogenic differentiation by replacing the culture medium with Wnt antagonism-based chondrogenic medium.\nReplace the complete culture medium with Wnt antagonism-based chondrogenic medium.\nCarefully remove the liquid from the centrifuge tube and avoid aspirating the MSC pellet.\nSlowly add the 2 mL of Wnt antagonism-based chondrogenic medium along the tube wall to prevent disturbing the pellet.\nMaintenance/medium refreshment\nTiming: 10–20 days\nRefresh the differentiation medium.\nRefresh the Wnt antagonism-based chondrogenic medium.\nCarefully remove the liquid from the centrifuge tube and avoid aspirating the MSC pellet.\nSlowly add 2 mL of Wnt antagonism-based chondrogenic medium along the tube wall to prevent disturbing the pellet.\nMaintained in culture for 10–20 days. Refresh the medium every 2–3 days.\nNote: 20-day induction can induce more glycosaminoglycans production, but a 10-day induction is sufficient to induce a significant rapid chondrogenesis compared to traditional TGF-β-based method.\nCharacterization\nTiming: 2 days\nCharacterization of MSC chondrogenic differentiation by chondrogenic gene expression and Alcian blue staining (stain glycosaminoglycans in extracellular matrix of chondrocytes).\nExamination of chondrogenic genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]",
    "Extract total RNA from pellets and reverse transcript to cDNA following the operation manual provided by manufacturer.\nPerform qPCR with primers of chondrogenic marker genes below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3135_3.csv\nNote: Chondrogenic gene expression can be analyzed at any time point of interest during differentiation process.\nAlcian blue staining.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nStaining of the whole pellet.\nWash sample pellet with PBS.\nFix samples with 0.5 mL 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 25°C.\nWash with PBS, rinse in 0.1 N HCl for 5 min.\nStain the samples with 0.5 mL Alcian blue solution (pH 1.0) for 1 h.\nWash with 0.5 mL 0.1 N HCl for 5 min. Repeat this step until the solution is colorless.\nRinse with ddH2O.\nTransfer the pellets to a 24-well plate and conduct microscopic imaging with bright field at 40x magnification.\nQuantification of Alcian blue staining (elusion).9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nWash the pellets with PBS for 5 min, transfer to PCR tube then remove supernatant.\nDigest the pellets with 5 μL collagenase I (3 mg/mL in PBS) at 37°C for 3 h.\nCarefully aspire the supernatant.\nDissolve the pellets with 20 μL of 6 M Guanidine HCl by rigorous pipetting.\nSupernatant was transferred to transparent 96-well plate (for absorbance analysis).\nAdd 30 μL of ddH2O (total 50 μL) each well and measure the absorbance at 650 nm (Dilution could be applied if necessary).\nStaining of sliced pellet.\nWash sample pellet with PBS.\nFix samples with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 25°C.\nEmbed the MSC pellet in OCT compound and freeze at ‒80°C.\nPause point: The sample can be stored at ‒80°C for at least several months.\nCut the pellet into 10 μm sections using a cryostat and place the sections onto microscope slides.\nRehydrate the sections by washing them with distilled water three times for 2 min each.",
    "Rinse in 0.1 N HCl for 5 min.\nStain the sections with Alcian blue solution (pH 1.0) for 30 min.\nWash with 0.1 N HCl for 5 min.\nRinse with ddH2O.\nDehydrate the sections by dipping them into graded alcohol solutions (70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol) for 2 min each.\nClear the sections with xylene for 2 min.\nMount the slides with cover slips using mounting medium.\nMicroscopic imaging."
