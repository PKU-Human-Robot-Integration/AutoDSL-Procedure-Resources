    "Retrovirus production Note: Universal precautions must be taken while handling RV supernatants and RV-transduced samples, and all experiments must be carried out in at least class II biological safety cabinets and using appropriate protection equipment. RV must be handled and disposed of in accordance with your institutional biohazard control regulations. Maintain Phoenix-ECO cells in 10 mL of IMDM + 10% Hyclone (see Recipe 1) in a T75 flask in a 37 °C incubator supplied with 5% CO2.Seed 2 × 106 Phoenix-ECO cells into a 100 mm × 20 mm tissue culture dish with 9 mL of IMDM + 10% Hyclone.Transfect Phoenix-ECO cells at ~70%–80% confluency, normally ~20–24 h after seeding.Ten minutes before transfection, add 25 μL of 10 mM chloroquine to the cell and incubate at 37 °C.Prepare the plasmid mix:125 μL of 1 M CaCl2 20 μg of vector plasmid DNA (20 μL if DNA concentration is 1 μg/μL)and the proper volume of TE 0.1-H2O (see Recipe 2) to reach a final volume of 500 μLWhile vortexing the plasmid mix, add 500 μL of 2× HBS (see Recipe 3) (use the pipette gun and a 2 mL pipette).Immediately add (with the same pipette) the precipitate to the Phoenix-ECO cells drop by drop.Return cells to the incubator.After 14–16 h, completely replace the medium and add 7 mL of fresh prewarmed IMDM + 10% Hyclone.Twenty-four hours after step A9, collect culture media and replace with 7 mL of fresh prewarmed IMDM + 10% Hyclone.Centrifuge the collected media at 300× g for 5 min at 4 °C and then pass through a 0.45 μm filter into a clean 50 mL tube. Store filtered media at 4 °C.Twenty-four hours after step A11, repeats steps A10 and A11 and combine filtered media into 50 mL tubes.",
    "Make 32 mL aliquots of retroviral supernatant in ultracentrifuge tubes (Polyallomer centrifuge tubes) carefully balancing the volumes (add medium or PBS if necessary).Ultracentrifuge at 69,000× g for 2 h at 4 °C (rotor SW32Ti).Discard supernatant and pay attention to dry all drops that may remain on the tube walls.Add 70 μL of PBS per tube and wait 15 min at room temperature (RT).Resuspend the samples at least 10 times setting the pipette volume at 60 μL, without creating bubbles, and pool all the samples in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.Parafilm the Eppendorf tube and rotate on a wheel for 30 min at 4 °C.Make 20 μL aliquots and store at -80 °C. Under these conditions, RV may be stored up to two years after production.Primary iNKT cell purification Note: All the procedures must be performed under sterile conditions. Spleen processingEuthanize iVα14-Jα18 mice according to institutional policy, by inhalation of CO2.Note: iVα14-Jα18 mice must be eight weeks old or older. To dissect the spleen, place the animal on a clean dissection board and rinse with 70% reagent alcohol. Incise the abdominal cavity and collect the spleen using scissors and tweezers. The spleen is located to the left side of the abdomen, inferior to the stomach (Dowling et al., 2020).Place a 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 mL tube and prepare the strainer by rinsing with 3 mL of PBS + 2% FBS (hereafter PBS-FBS).Place the spleen on the strainer and homogenize the tissue via grinding in 10–20 mL final volume of PBS-FBS.Centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Remove the supernatant by inversion and resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of sterile ACK lysing buffer (see Recipe 4); for red blood cell lysis, incubate for 3 min at room temperature and block with 5 mL of PBS-FBS.Centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant by inversion and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL of PBS-FBS. Remove fat residues by pipetting and determine cell number. Note: Expected recovery from the spleen of one iVα14-Jα18 mouse is 2 × 106 iNKT cells; if more iNKT cells are needed, increase the number of mice accordingly. Cells coming from different mice can be pooled at this point prior to the determination of cell number.  T-cell enrichmentNote: For the enrichment steps, work fast, keep the cells cold, and use solutions pre-cooled at 4 °C overnight and then kept on ice. Resuspend the total spleen cells in the appropriate volume of PBS-FBS (500 μL for 107 cells) + Fc blocker (5 μL × 107 cells) and incubate for 15 min at RT.Wash with 1–2 mL of MACS separation buffer (MB) (see Recipe 5) per 107 total cells and centrifuge at 450× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant by inversion and stain the cell with CD19-FITC and H2(IAb)-FITC (use 5 μL × 107 cells in 100 μL of MB); mix well and incubate for 15 min in the dark at 4–8 °C.Wash cells by adding 1–2 mL of MB per 107 cells and centrifuge at 450× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Pipette off the supernatant completely and resuspend the cell pellet in 90 μL of MB per 107 total cells.Add 10 μL of anti-FITC microbeads per 107 total cells. Mix well and incubate for 15 min in the dark at 4–8 °C.",
    "Wash the cells by adding 1–2 mL of MB per 107 cells and centrifuge at 450× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Pipette off the supernatant completely and resuspend up to 1.25 × 108 cells in 500 μL of MB.Place a LD column in the magnetic field of MACS Separator to proceed with the depletion. To avoid clogging, apply a pre-separation filter on the LD column and rinse with 2 mL of MB. When the column reservoir is empty, apply the cell suspension onto the filter. This step depletes B and myeloid antigen-presenting cells from the spleen cell suspension.Collect the unlabeled cells that pass through the column.Wash three times with 1 mL of MB, only when the column reservoir is empty.Collect the total effluent, which will be enriched in T cells, and count the cells.iNKT cell enrichmentCentrifuge the T cell–enriched suspension at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant by inversion.Stain the cells with CD1d-tetramer-PE (mouse PBS57-CD1d-tetramer), according to the antibody titration, in 50 μL of MB per 106 cells. Mix well and incubate for 30 min in the dark on ice.Wash the cells by adding 1–2 mL of MB per 107 cells and centrifuge at 450× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Pipette off the supernatant completely and resuspend the cell pellet in 80 μL of MB per 107 total cells.Add 20 μL of anti-PE microbeads per 107 total cells. Mix well and incubate for 15 min in the dark at 4–8 °C.Wash cells by adding 1–2 mL of MB per 107 cells and centrifuge at 450× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Pipette off the supernatant completely and resuspend up to 108 cells in 500 μL of MB; otherwise, if cells exceed 108, adjust the volume accordingly.",
    "According to cell count, place a LS (up to 108) or MS (up to 107) column in the magnetic field of MACS Separator. Rinse the column with MB (3 mL for LS, 500 μL for MS).Apply the cell suspension onto the column. Collect unlabeled cells that pass through.Wash column three times by adding the appropriate volume of MB (3 × 3 mL for LS column, 3 × 500 μL for MS column), only when the column reservoir is empty. The total effluent is the negative fraction.Remove column from the magnetic field and place it on a new collection tube.Add MB onto the column (5 mL for LS column or 1 mL for MS column), push the provided plunger into the column, and flush out the positive fraction (enriched in iNKT cells).To further increase the iNKT cell recovery, centrifuge the negative fraction at 450× g for 10 min at 4 °C and repeat steps h–l with a new LS or MS column.Pool the positive fractions and determine cell count.Check the purification steps by FACS analysis. Samples are spleen ex vivo, T cell–enriched fraction, iNKT-positive fraction, and iNKT-negative fraction. Stain the cells with CD19-FITC, IAb-FITC, CD1d-tetramer-PE, TCRβ-APC, and DAPI (Figure 2 and Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4707/bioprotoc-13-13-4707-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Representative dot plots of gating strategy for analysis of ex vivo splenic iNKT cells used to evaluate each purification step.iNKT cell activation and transduction Activate purified iNKT cells with mouse T activator anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads in 1:1 ratio.Centrifuge the iNKT cell positive fraction at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Meanwhile, transfer the appropriate volume of mouse T activator anti-CD3/CD28 magnetics beads to a 15 mL tube, add an equal volume of PBS, vortex for 5 s, place the tube on the magnet (DynaMagTM-15 Magnet) for 1 min, and discard the supernatant.Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the washed magnetic beads in the proper volume of complete RPMI (see Recipe 6) to have 5 × 105 iNKT cells in 1 mL. Use this suspension to resuspend the iNKT cell pellet.Plate 1 mL of the cell suspension (5 × 105 iNKT cells) + anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads in a 48-well plate with 20 U/mL human recombinant (hr)IL-2 and incubate at 37 °C.Transduce iNKT cells after 48 h in culture.Note: All handling of retroviral production and transduction is carried out in at least class II biosafety cabinets. Centrifuge the 48-well plate at 450× g for 7 min at RT.Carefully remove the cell media by pipetting, starting from the top of the well to avoid disturbing the cells.Add 200 μL of complete RPMI, plus the appropriate volume of concentrated RV (Section A), and 8 μg/mL of polybrene to the wells.Note: Always leave one well for the non-transduced (NT) control by adding complete RPMI and 8 μg/mL polybrene only. Centrifuge the plate at 800× g for 2 h at 30 °C.Add 800 μL of prewarmed media to each well with original culture conditions [complete RPMI and 20 U/mL of (hr)IL-2] and incubate at 37 °C.",
    "Analyze iNKT cell transduction five days post-infection as described below (Section E).iNKT cell expansion Split the cells 1:2 when they reach 80%–90% confluency (usually starting from day 3–4 after activation)Maintain the cell in complete RPMI and 20 U/mL of (hr)IL-2 until day 5 in culture.After five days in culture, add 10 ng/mL of mouse IL-7.In these culture conditions [complete RPMI, 20 U/mL of (hr)IL-2, 10 ng/mL of mouse IL-7], iNKT cells can be expanded for up to 15 days, when in vivo or in vitro assays can be performed.Note: For iNKT adoptive cell transfer, beads have to be removed from the cell culture by loading the cell suspension on the magnet (incubate for 3 min). Cells are washed three times with PBS before injection. Analysis of iNKT cell transduction At five days post-infection, iNKT cell transduction can be assessed by flow cytometry.Note: Work under a class II biosafety cabinet, since at this time point some RV particles can still be present in cell supernatant. Collect 200 μL of cell suspension and transfer to a U-bottom 96-well plate for staining.Centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at RT.Remove the supernatant by pipetting (change the tips and bleach them).Add 50 μL of PBS + 0.5 μL of Fc blocker per sample and incubate for 15 min at RT.Centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant, add 50 μL of PBS + 0.1 μL of Live/Dead Fixable Violet per sample, and incubate for 20 min at RT.Centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and stain the cells with CD1d-tetramer-PE, according to the antibody titration, in 50 μL of PBS-FBS per sample. Mix well and incubate for 30 min in the dark on ice.Centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the flow cytometry mix for surface staining:100 μL of PBS-FBS.1 μL of TCRβ-APC and 1 μL of Vβ5.2-PE/Cy7 (for OT-I TCR staining) per sample.Note: If the RV contains a GFP reporter, avoid the use of FITC-conjugated antibodies for the cell staining. Remove the supernatant and add 100 μL of flow cytometry mix. Mix well and incubate for 15 min in the dark on ice.Centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and add 200 μL of 2% (w/v) PFA in PBS. Incubate for 10 min in the dark on ice.Centrifuge at 600× g for 7 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and wash twice with PBS: add 200 μL of PBS, centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C, and repeat.Resuspend the cells in 200 μL of PBS and transfer to flow cytometry tubes for FACS analysis.Use gating strategy in Figure 4 to identify transduced iNKT cells.iNKT cell transduction can also be assessed later on over cell culture. Starting from day 7 after infection, fixation with PFA is no longer required."
