    "This protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Michigan State University.\n1. Building the system\nRationale\nPrepare the mirror setup, a variant of the classic Wheatstone stereoscope28 illustrated in Figure 1, consisting of two mirrors positioned at a 45° angle relative to the participant's midline. The mirrors reflect stimuli from two screens that are positioned at opposite ends of a table, facing each other.\nSeat a participant in front of the mirrors and have them view a different screen, reflected via a different mirror, with each eye. For best results, use a head rest for stabilizing the participant's head.\nPosition an infrared-sensitive video-based eye tracker, including a camera and an illuminator, in front of the participant but behind the mirrors. The eye tracker is represented by a box in Figure 1.\n\t\tNOTE: One challenge when trying to track the eyes in normal setups of this type, is that the eyes are blocked by the mirrors.\nUse two front-surface mirrors, often advertised as \"cold mirrors\" (incident angle: 45°), that feature near-complete reflectance of visible wavelengths and near-complete transmission of near-infrared wavelengths (see Table 1 for detailed information about the mirrors).\n\t\tNOTE: Such mirrors can be obtained via companies supplying optical equipment for scientific and industrial purposes, which usually list components like these as 'cold mirrors' or as a type of 'dichroic mirrors' (see more detail in Materials/Equipment Table).\n\t\ttable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\n,,Setup 1,Setup 2\nMirrors,Dimensions,10.10 × 12.70 cm,10.10 × 12.70 cm\nMirrors,Reflectance,400 ~ 690 nm,425 ~ 650 nm\nMirrors,Transmission,750 ~ 1200 nm,800 ~ 1200 nm\nEye Tracker,Brand,Research-end Eye Tracker,Customer-grade Eye Tracker\nEye Tracker,Transmission,890 ~ 940 nm,Around 850 nm\nTable 1.

    "The eye tracker's transmission wave length range is covered by the mirrors' transmission range at a 45° incidence angle, but outside their reflectance range.\nStructure of the Setup\nBuild the setup on top of a desk. Besides the mirrors and eye tracker, it consists only of three custom-built elements made of fiberboard (see Figure 2 for an assembly guide) and two flat-screen monitors on monitor-arms available from normal office supply stores.\nFiberboard elements\nBuild the framework of the setup from three components of fiberboards: one central component and two reference boards on each side (see Figure 1 for general positioning, Table 2 for detailed dimensions, and Figure 2 for an assembly guide of each component). Paint all these pieces in matte black to reduce light scatter.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The central component (see Figure 2B and 2D) holds the mirrors and eye tracker. Both are on the same plateau, thus keeping the eye tracker at participants' eye level.\nPlace the top element of this component such that it leaves 8 cm in depth in the front of the desk. Such an arrangement allows enough room for the participant's face when stabilized on the head rest and avoids condensation on the mirrors during expiration, while minimizing the distance between the participant's eyes and the mirrors to maximize the possible use of the participant's visual field.\nPosition the two reference boards straight below the monitors (see Figure 1 for positioning and Figure 2 panels A and C for an assembly guide) for easy manual calibration of the screens. Note that the apparent offset in Figure 1 between screen and board is due to limited depth cues in the image; the boards are straight below the monitors on both sides.",
    "Exactly align the long horizontals with the edges of the desk, while the long verticals leave 4 cm beyond the front of the desk for ease of stabilizing a calibration board (see below) to these boards. The two small verticals will ensure the long vertical staying vertical as the reference for the monitors.\nOptionally, use a separate piece of fiberboard as a calibration board (see Figure 3). In this case, after obtaining an optimal position of a monitor, position the calibration board against the reference board and indicate the positions of both the reference board and the monitor on the calibration board while it is in place (in the example of Figure 3, wooden slats provide these indications).\nWhenever this desired monitor position is lost (accidentally or because other experiments require a different position), retrieve this position by using the markings on the calibration board to put the calibration board back in the same place relative to the reference board that has a fixed position on the desk. Move the monitor again to line up with the appropriate markings (see step 2.1.1. for details).\n\t\t\ttable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nComponent,Dimensions (cm),Number,Remark\nCentral Component,80 × 25 × 2,1,Horizontal top\nCentral Component,23 × 25 × 2,1,Horizontal bottom\nCentral Component,21 × 32 × 2,1,Central vertical\nCentral Component,32 × 25 × 2,1,Front-facing vertical\nReference Boards,61 × 11 × 2,2,Long horizontal\nReference Boards,66 × 29 × 2,2,Long vertical\nReference Boards,11 × 15 × 2,4,Small vertical\nTable 2. Details of the fiberboard components.\nMonitors and Mirrors\nPosition the setup on top of a standard office desk.",
    "Mount two flat-screen monitors on standard monitor arms clamped to the side of the desk (clamping both the reference board and the desk). These arms allow translation in three dimensions as well as rotation in the plane of the screen. Conventional CRT-monitors are clearly also compatible with the setup, but would not afford the same flexibility in terms of positioning and repositioning.\nMount the mirrors on mirror mounts that are sold for the purpose by the same suppliers that stock cold mirrors. Connect these mounts to the fiber board holding the mirror at participants' eye level. Position the mirrors to touch at a 90° angle in the center, right before the participant's nose.\nRemaining elements\n\t\tNOTE: Some experiments require participants not seeing the screens from the corner of their eyes, so that a direct line of sight to the screens (dashed lines in Figure 4A) should be avoided.\n\t\t\nIn that case, create \"blinders\" made of black cardboard and foam-padded hole straps painted in black, and attach them to the posts of the head rest (see Figure 4B). Adjust the blinders in height and angle to accommodate individual participants. If the wall in front of the participant has high reflectance, hanging a piece of black fabric will help remedy this.\n2. Using the system\nHardware calibration\n\tNOTE: The purpose of calibration is to achieve satisfactory alignment of the two monitors for ease of fusion of the two monitors' images for each participant. This can be achieved in two steps: hardware calibration (described here) and software calibration (described below).",
    "When using a calibration board, as described above, align it with one of the reference boards, holding it in place with a C-clamp if needed, and then move the corresponding monitor to line up with the desired reference lines on the calibration board. The monitors should be parallel to each other, and each should be straight above its reference board.\nWhen using blinders, move them to the participant's eye level and rotate them slightly toward the midline, i.e. more inward, compared to the orientation of the monitors. Make sure that each eye can see the whole visual stimulus in the mirror without seeing any of it directly. Turning the blinders toward rather than away from the midline will minimize participants' exposure to other visual input.\nSoftware calibration\nSince participants may vary in their eye position relative to the mirrors despite the use of a head rest, calibrate further before doing experiments. This part is most easily done in the software, i.e. without moving the setup's parts any further. There are two possible methods.\n\t\t\nFor the first, present a dot on each of the two screens in alternation, and instruct the participant to eliminate the perceived position change by moving the dot on one of the screens (or both in opposite directions).\nFor the second method, instruct the participant to align the frames of experimental stimuli instead of two dots so that both eyes' visual fields critical to the particular experiment are aligned.\nAfter applying either method, center the stimuli in the experiment on the resulting on-screen positions. Other aspects of setting up displays and stimuli for dichoptic presentation in general can be found elsewhere5.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
