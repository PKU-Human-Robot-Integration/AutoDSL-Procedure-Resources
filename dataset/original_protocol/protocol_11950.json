    "1. Establishment and Maintenance of Primary Mouse Tail Tip Fibroblast Cultures\nPrepare gelatin-coated dishes (recommend a 10 cm dish for one tail) by covering the surface with 0.1% gelatin and incubating the dishes for approximately 20 min at 37 °C. Aspirate the gelatin solution from the dish and allow it to dry for at least 2 h.\nEuthanize the mice by cervical dislocation. Remove the tail with scissors, cutting at the base of the tail. Put the tail in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) until ready to use.\n\tNOTE: For the best results, tails should be taken from mice around 6 to 8 weeks of age. Tails can be taken from mice older than 8 weeks of age, however, as the mice age, the proliferation capability of the fibroblasts and the efficiency of reprogramming decrease11.\nPerform all subsequent steps of this protocol in a tissue culture hood under sterile conditions. Prepare a diluted trypsin solution of 0.02% trypsin-EDTA in DPBS and add 5 mL into an uncoated 10 cm dish.\nWash the tail, first in 70% ethanol, then in DPBS. In a dish, place the tail flat and use forceps to hold it in place. Make an incision on the tail along its longitudinal axis from the base to the tip.\nGrasp the tail with one pair of forceps and hold it vertically. Using a second pair of forceps, grip the skin beside the incision at the base of the tail and peel it back. Do this at both sides of the incision until the skin can be peeled off by pulling downwards toward the tip of the tail.",
    "Hold the peeled tail with forceps over the dish containing the trypsin solution and cut the tail into approximately 1 cm long pieces. With the tail pieces in the trypsin solution, use scissors to fragment the pieces into smaller pieces. Incubate the tail pieces in the trypsin solution at 37 °C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: The smaller the pieces are preferred so as to provide each piece a high surface area to volume ratio.\nQuench the trypsin using 2 volumes of fibroblast expansion (FEX) medium (high-glucose Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, Non-essential amino acids (NEAA) and 100 U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin).\nCollect entire contents of the dish into a 50 mL tube and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the tail fragments in 10 mL of fresh FEX medium.\nTransfer tail fragments in medium to a gelatin-coated dish and incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 4% O2, adding fresh FEX medium every 2 days.\n\tNOTE: After five to seven days, tail fragments have attached at the bottom of the dish and fibroblasts can be seen moving away from them.\nOnce clusters of fibroblasts are spotted, gently shake the dish to dislodge tail pieces and aspirate the medium and all the bone fragments leaving the fibroblasts attached to the plate. Add new FEX medium and culture the fibroblasts until confluent.\nTo ensure no contamination of fibroblasts by hematopoietic progenitors, dissociate the cells from the plate using 1x trypsin-EDTA for 5 mins and collect cells. Deplete for cells expressing hematopoietic markers (CD117, CD5, CD45R (B220), CD11b, Anti-Gr-1 (Ly-6G/C), 7-4, and Ter-119) using a magnetic separation system10.\n2. Retrovirus Production",
    "Seed retroviral packaging cells at approximately 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 (2.0 × 106 cells for a 10 cm dish) on a tissue culture-treated (by vacuum-gas plasma) dish and culture overnight in high-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS, 10 mM Sodium Pyruvate, and 100 U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOn the following morning, change the medium to DMEM with no additives using half the volume used to culture overnight (5 mL for a 10 cm dish). In the afternoon, check that the cells are 70-80% confluent and begin the transfection.\nFor each reprogramming factor, Gata1, Tal1, Lmo2, and c-Myc, prepare a 2:1 mixture of the expression vector (pMX) and helper vector (containing gag and pol genes). For a 10 cm dish of fibroblasts, use 6 µg of expression vector and 3 µg of helper vector in a final volume of 100 µL in DMEM medium.\nFor each reprogramming factor, prepare 300 µL of room temperature (RT) DMEM in a sterile polystyrene tube and carefully add 27 µL of commercial transfection reagent.\n\tNOTE: The transfection reagent should be brought to RT before use and must be added directly into the medium as the electrostatic properties of the compound can make it stick to the plastic wall of the tube.\nAdd the plasmid mix into the transfection reagent-containing tube, vortex briefly and incubate the transfection reagent-DNA mixture for 15 min at RT. Briefly vortex the mixture and add it dropwise to the retroviral packaging cells so that the transfection reagent-DNA mix is evenly spread over the culture and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\n24 h after transfection, change the medium to DMEM with 20% FBS and 100 U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin. 48 h after transfection, collect the supernatant and filter it through a 0.22 µm pore-size syringe filter.",
    "NOTE: Viral supernatants can be frozen to -80 °C and kept until required, although transduction is more efficient if fresh viral supernatant is used.\n3. GTLM transduction and iEP harvest\nSeed the tail tip fibroblasts at 1 × 104 cells/cm2 on 0.1% gelatin pre-coated dishes in FEX medium and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h.\nThe following day, prepare a transduction mixture as follows.\n\t\nAdd 1 volume of viral supernatant for each reprogramming factor supplemented with 4 µg/mL of retroviral infection reagent (40%) to 6 volumes of FEX medium (60%).\nFor a 10 cm dish of fibroblasts, add 1 mL of each viral supernatant (4 × viruses = 4 mL) supplemented with 4 µg/mL of retroviral infection reagent to 6 mL of FEX medium, giving a total of 10 mL transduction mixture.\nAspirate FEX medium from the fibroblast culture and replace it with the transduction mixture. Incubate the transduction for 4 h at 37 °C in hypoxic conditions (5% CO2 and 4% O2).\nAspirate the transduction mixture and replace it with fresh reprogramming medium (Serum-free Expansion medium (SFEM), 100 U/mLPenicillin/Streptomycin, 100 ng/mL murine Stem Cell Factor (mSCF), 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (IL3), 2 U/mL human recombinant Erythropoietin (hrEPO), and 100 nM Dexamethasone).\nIncubate for 8 daysat 37 °C in hypoxic conditions, adding fresh reprogramming medium every 2 days. After five to eight days, successful reprogramming will yield clusters of cells that have detached from the plate.\nTo collect reprogrammed cells for analysis, gently pipette up and down to harvest them directly from the dish. To harvest untransduced fibroblasts for comparison, dissociate the cells from the plate using 1x trypsin-EDTA and collect.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
