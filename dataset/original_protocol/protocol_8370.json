    "All procedures were performed in accordance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU for animal research and were approved by the Animal Experiments Council under the Danish Ministry of Environment and Food (2015-15-0201-00535).\n1. Procedure for Cannulation\nCannula preparation\n\tNOTE: Avoid touching the cannula with non-sterile gloves.\n\t\nBreak off the beveled metal tip of a 30G dental needle using a needle holder.\nUsing a needle holder, prepare the cannula by inserting the beveled metal tip (approximately 0.3 cm) into a 30-cm length of PE10 tubing (Polyethylene Tubing 0.024\" OD x 0.011\" ID) filled with aCSF (126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO3; pH 7.4 when gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2).\nFlush the cannula with aCSF using a 1 mL syringe fitted with a 30G needle (30 G x ½\" 0.3 x 12).\nSurgical procedure\n\tNOTE: The chronic CM cannulation allows the animals to recover from the surgical procedure. CM injections are made the day following cannula implantation and, importantly, can be performed in either anesthetized or awake animals. Since this is a recovery surgery, procedures should be carried out under sterile conditions.\n\t\nWeigh the mouse (C57BL/6JRj, both sexes, 8 weeks) and anesthetize it with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg; 10 mg/kg, respectively) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. If necessary, redose the mouse with a half dose of ketamine (50 mg/kg) during the surgical procedure. Alternatively, for chronic cannulation, anesthetize mouse by placing it into an isoflurane induction chamber at 2.5 - 3% isoflurane, in circa 1 L/min O2. In this case, use a nose cone to sustain isoflurane anesthesia at 1.5 - 2% throughout the surgery.",
    "When toe pinch reflexes cease, and the respiration becomes slow and steady, place the animal in a stereotaxic frame over a heating pad.\nApply ophthalmic ointment. Repeat during surgery whenever necessary.\nShave the head and neck of the mouse, remove fur, and sterilize exposed skin first with an alcohol swab and then two times with chlorhexidine (0.5%) or iodine solution (2%). Repeat the sterilization two more times.\n\t\tNOTE: Change the surgical drape to remove debris and hair after shaving. Then drape the animal to protect the sterile field.\nFor the chronic cannulation, administer 0.5 - 1 ml lidocaine/bupivacaine (1 mg/ml and 0.25 mg/ml, respectively) subcutaneously (s.c.) at the incision site. Administer buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg; s.c.) for post-surgical analgesia.\nFix the mouse in the stereotaxic frame. After ensuring fixation, either intraural or by the zygomatic arch, tilt the head slightly so that it forms an angle of 120° to the body (Figure 1E).\nFind the part of the skull protruding immediately above the neck muscles - the occipital crest. Lift the overlying skin using a pair of tweezers, and cut an almond shaped piece of skin of approximately 1 cm along the midline. Use cotton swabs or eye spears to control any resultant bleeding.\nUsing the occipital crest as a reference point, pull apart the superficial connective tissue to expose the neck muscles below.\nSeparate the muscles at the midline by carefully running the forceps down the middle of the incision site in the anterior-to-posterior axis. With a pair of curved forceps in each hand, join the tips in the middle near the bottom of the skull and pull the muscles aside.",
    "NOTE: This should expose the CM, which appears as a tiny inverted triangle, outlined by the cerebellum above and medulla below, behind the translucent dural membrane (Figure 1B and 1C).\nUsing a surgical eye spear or cotton swab, wipe the dural membrane covering the CM.\nInsertion of the cannula into the CM\nRemove the cannula from the aCSF-filled syringe, keeping the 30G needle attached to the rear end of the tubing.\nAttach the 30G needle to a distilled water-filled 100 µL syringe connected to a syringe pump.\nInsert an air bubble of approximately 1 cm into the cannula by withdrawing air with the aid of a syringe pump.\nUsing a syringe pump, withdraw 12 μL of desired CSF tracer into the cannula.\nGrasp the cannula, filled with the CSF tracer, near the tube-covered needle with a pair of curved tweezers held in the dominant hand. Rest the middle finger of the non-dominant hand on the ear bar of the opposite side and hold it steady for the later use as a rest for the cannula.\nInsert the cannula at an angle of 45° relative to the mouse head, passing into the center of the CM, identified by its triangular aspect seen through the dura. Avoid any penetration of the cerebellum or medulla. Ensure that the needle is only inserted to a depth of 1 - 2 mm, i.e. to the point where bevel is entirely under the dura. Release the tweezers holding the cannula, and let the cannula rest on the non-dominant hand.\n\t\tNOTE: The beveled end of the dental needles will require the application of some force to pierce the dural membrane covering the CM.\nIf necessary, dry off any CSF leak upon penetration using a surgical eye spear or cotton swabs.",
    "Drop 2 - 3 drops of cyanoacrylate glue onto the dural membrane surrounding the cannula. Add a drop of glue accelerator to cure the glue immediately. Cover the skull and needle with a mixture of dental cement (approximately 0.5 mg) and cyanoacrylate glue (3 - 5 drops). Immediately after, apply a drop of glue accelerator to cure.\nFor chronic cannulation, cut the tubing (leaving approximately 2 - 3 cm attached to the cannula) and seal it with a surgical weld to retain the intracranial pressure (ICP) levels, by preventing CSF leakage through the tubing.\nFor chronic cannulation, administer carprofen (5 mg/kg; s.c.)\nFor chronic cannulation, place the mouse in a cage, keeping it over a heating pad to maintain body temperature until the animal is fully recovered from anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: The animals should be singly housed in their cages to assure that the cannula remains intact. Ensure that the nose is clear of bedding by placing the mouse on a paper towel or other solid substrate.\n\t\t​NOTE: The following day, when animals are recovered from the surgical procedure performed for cannula insertion, they can be injected with CSF tracers. For injection under anesthesia, administer a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg; 10 mg/kg, respectively; i.p.) and proceed to steps described in section 2. For injection in awake animals, proceed to section 3.\n2. Injection of CSF Tracers via Acute Implanted CM Cannula in Anesthetized Animals\nNOTE: For injection of CSF tracers via acute implanted CM cannula in anesthetized animals, immediately after step 8 from previous section, proceed to CSF tracer injection as described below.",
    "Using a syringe pump, start the injection into the CM of CSF tracers at a rate of 1 μL/min for 5 or 10 min, resulting in a total volume of 5 µL or 10 µL, respectively. At the end of the injection, allow the CSF tracer to circulate throughout the brain for 30 min with the cannula undisturbed.\nAfter 30 min, cut the tubing connected to the cannula (approximately 4 cm distance from the needle tip) and seal its end using a surgical weld.\nUnder deep anesthesia, euthanize the animal by decapitation. Quickly dissect the brain and fix the tissue by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 0.01M; pH 7.4) overnight (o/n) at 4 °C.\n3. Injection of CSF Tracers via Chronically Implanted CM cannula in Awake Animals\nUsing a syringe pump, withdraw 7 µL or 12 µl of desired CSF tracer into a cannula composed of approximately 30 cm of PE10 tubing with a beveled dental needle tip of 0.5 cm.\nGently restrain the animal and cut of approximately 1 cm of the tubing attached to the cannula.\nStill under gentle restraining, quickly connect the cannula filled with CSF tracer to the CM implanted cannula.\nUsing a syringe pump, start the injection into the CM of CSF tracers at a rate of 1 µL/min. Inject 7 µL or 12 µL, to achieve a final volume of CSF injected tracer of 5 µL or 10 µL, thus compensating the aCSF remaining in the implanted cannula. At the end of the injection, allow the CSF tracer to circulate throughout the brain for 30 min with the cannula undisturbed. Ensure that the tubing remains attached during injection and circulation periods.",
    "At the end of CSF tracer circulation time, proceed to euthanasia by decapitation, assuring that the animal is deeply anesthetized. Quickly dissect the brain and fix the tissue by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 0.01M; pH 7.4) overnight (o/n) at 4 °C.\nSubscription Required.
