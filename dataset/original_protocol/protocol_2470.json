    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTumor sectioning\nTiming: 1–2 h\nAfter tumor growth and harvest, tumors were processed with a compresstome in order to obtain live tumor slices whose infiltrates can be photoconverted using a point scanner confocal microscope. The use of slices directly exposes deep tumoral areas, avoiding the need of a multiphoton microscope for photoconversion across the whole tumor. Besides, the use of slices also allows for the enrichment of the population/s of interest, increasing recovery yield in the subsequent flow-sorting step.\nCollect tumor.\nHarvest the tumor with the help of scissors and a blade to maintain tissue integrity.\nTrim the surrounding fat tissue.\nPlace the tumor in one well of the 12-well cell culture plate with medium prepared before starting.\nNote: When possible, protect tumor from light to avoid photobleaching or undesired photoconversion.\nEmbed tissue in low melting agarose.\nMounting tumor into the specimen tube.\nCut with a blade the edge of the tumor to generate a flat surface.\nPlace one drop of Gorilla Glue® into the tissue holder of the specimen tube.\nGlue the flat surface of the tumor to the tissue holder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2105-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mounting tumor into specimen tube\n(A) Glue tissue to tissue holder (white plunger).\n(B) Assemble tissue holder with the metallic tube to create embedding cavity.\n(C) Place sample holder into the chilling block to solidify the agarose faster.\nCritical: Make sure the tissue is located in the center to obtain a block with homogenous agarose thickness around the tissue when embedding.\nPrepare the agarose solution.\nDissolve 0.5 g of agarose in 25 mL of PBS to get a 2% agarose solution.",
    "Critical: Agarose concentration in this protocol is optimized for our model of mammary tumors. It is crucial that the agarose density is similar to that of your tissue to obtain clean slices.\nHeat the solution in a microwave until the solution gets clear (20–30″ aprox).\nCool down the solution by washing the flask under cold running water to reach 37C.\nUse right away to prevent undesired polymerization prior to tissue embedding.\nNote: The flask can be kept in a water bath at 37C to avoid solidification.\nEmbed tissue with agarose.\nAssemble the specimen tube by introducing the sample holder (white plunger) into the metal tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCut the tip of a 1,000 μL pipette tip to facilitate the pipetting of a dense substance such as agarose.\nPour agarose around the tissue into the sample holder.\nCritical: Avoid bubble formation during this process. Additionally, when embedding the tissue in agarose, be sure to leave approximately 0.2–0.5 cm between the sample and the edge of the tube to set up compresstome settings with the free agarose before reaching the sample.\nIntroduce the specimen tube into the chilling block until agarose solidifies (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nSlice samples with the compresstome.\nAssemble the sample holder into the compresstome following manufacturer instructions (compresstome VF-310-0Z user manual[href=https://bidc.ucsf.edu/sites/g/files/tkssra806/f/wysiwyg/VF-310-0Z_User%20Manual_Email_06-18-19.pdf]).\nCritical: Make sure the blade is placed in the correct position and the buffer tray is secured in place with the screw tightly attached. (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2105-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Tissue sectioning with compresstome\n(A and B) Compresstome assembly.\n(C) Successful floating tissue section.\n(D) Sections stored in non-supplemented medium to keep track of sequential slices after sectioning until microscope processing.\nFill buffer tray with PBS until it covers half of the sample (specimen tube).\nSectioning of the tissue.",
    "Push the tissue advancement plunger until the agarose is seen out of the tube.\nSet machine in single cutting mode, speed 1–3 and oscillation 5–6. Set slice thickness to 300 μm.\nNote: Settings are optimized for the breast tumors we normally process, but they need to be adjusted for each specific tissue and also throughout the slicing process, as the tumor surface increases and becomes less cohesive. See problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for more details.\nSlice through the agarose using the manual fast forward to trim the tissue-free agarose gel using thicker slicing until the tissue appears.\nNote: The speed of cutting can also be increased during the trimming.\nNote: Do not cut slices thicker than ∼2 mm to obtain slices with even surfaces.\nNote: During trimming, you can set continuous mode and a higher slice thickness. However, make sure you start reducing the slice thickness gradually before reaching the tissue, since the equipment does not readjust the thickness immediately (it might take a couple of slices to get the desired slice thickness).\nOnce the tissue is visible, change to single mode and keep adjusting the settings to the tissue needs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Generally a speed 1–3 and oscillation 5–6 is suitable for most tissues.\nPlace sequential slices in pairs in one well of the 12-well plate with medium to store them until image acquisition. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Keep the 12-well plate on ice and covered from light. Slices should be protected from light to avoid photobleaching or undesired photoconversion.\nAfter finished slicing the tumor, make sure to clean the buffer tray, the blade and the sample holder. Remove the gorilla glue with acetone if needed.\nPhotoconversion in the microscope\nTiming: 1–1.5 h/slice",
    "Live tissue slices are mounted on a slide and photoconverted using a point-scanning confocal microscope that can perform selective illumination of irregular polygonal ROIs to maximize the spatial resolution of the areas of interest.\nMount tumor slice on a microscope slide:\nPlace a few drops of medium on the slide before mounting the slice to facilitate straightening the tissue.\nSet the slice on the slide and carefully extend it using tweezers, without inflicting damage to the tissue.\nAdd a moisturizing agent such as lubricant eye gel to decrease evaporation and maintain/keep slices hydrated during the whole imaging process.\nNote: The use of lubricant instead of alternative physiological aqueous buffers helps avoiding desiccation. Lubricant eye gel might possess slightly different refractive index as compared to water-based buffers impacting in the quality of imaging. However, the aim of this imaging step is the specific photoconversion of cellular niches and not the generation of high-resolution images. As the tissue needs further processing to obtain a viable single-cell suspension, we prioritize the wellbeing of the tissue over the quality of imaging at this step.\nPlace a coverslip and seal the edges using paraffin or nail polish to fix the sample.\nNote: Use nail polish with caution since it could be toxic for the sample in case of undesired contact.\nScan the whole slice by tiling fields of view (FOV) to generate a full-size image of the tissue that helps to identify regions of interest:\nAcquire a tile scan using fast scan rate (short pixel dwell time) and low resolution to generate a full-size image of the whole slice:\nCollect green (non-photoconverted Kaede) and red (from tdTomato-p27k reporter in quiescent cancer cells in our experimental model) fluorescence by using a Zeiss Plan Apochromat 20×/0.8 NA DIC air objective.",
    "Note: The acquisition settings used in this experimental setting were as follows: the sample was illuminated with an argon multi-line 488 nm 25 mW Argon AOTF modulated line set to 0.2% transmittance and a 561 nm 20 mW DPSS AOTF modulated line set to 0.2% transmittance, using a multi-bandpass dichroic mirror with 488/561 cut off wavelengths (MBS 488/561). The emission wavelength ranges for the green and red fluorescence signals were set to 499–560 nm and 571–735, respectively, and collected using multi-alkali PMTs. No offset was applied. The microscope was controlled by ZEN Black SP2 acquisition software, scanned unidirectionally with a pixel dwell time of 1.58 μs/pixel, no averaging, a 12-bit digitizer, zoom 1.0×, a pixel size of 0.83 μm and pinhole set to 1 A.U. for 488 nm wavelength. Images were saved with the .czi file format.\nNote: This acquisition settings were optimized for Kaede and tdTomato-p27k reporter, they will need modifications for the use of alternative photoconvertible/photoactivatable proteins as well as different reporters.\nOnce a mesoscopic image of the tissue is obtained, mark positions of interest per slice.\nNote: In our experimental model, positions were placed in tdTomato-p27kHigh areas in the first slice and in tdTomato-p27kNegative areas in the consecutive paired slice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2105-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Photoconversion of Kaede protein in tumor slices\n(A) Full-size image of a tumor slice showing the distribution of the expression of the non-photoconverted Kaede protein in host cells (green channel) and the expression of the quiescence reporter in specific tumor cells (red channel). The data from the red channel was used to select positions of interest (white crosses) based on the tdTomato-p27k reporter (red).\n(B) Full-size image of the same tumor slice acquired after photoconversion to corroborate successful photoconversion in all selected positions. Enhanced red fluorescence corresponds to photoconverted areas.",
    "(C) Representative region of interest drawn based on tdTomato-p27k reporter expression (white dash-dotted line) before and after photoconversion (left and right, respectively). Overlay of green and red channels is shown. Green: non-photoconverted Kaede-expressing cells, red: tdTomato-p27k+ tumor cells, yellow: photoconverted Kaede-expressing cells. Scale bar (white) is 100μm. This panel was originally published in Cell (Baldominos et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPhotoconversion of the identified regions of interest:\nAcquire a single confocal image (snapshot) for each position marked in the slice using same microscope settings as in 5.a.i., except for the pinhole aperture that should be set to max.\nNote: In confocal microscopy, fluorophore excitation is not restricted to the focal plane.\nCritical: Opening the pinhole allows to recover also the out of focus signal above and below the focal plane. This is critical to assess that the volume to be photoconverted only contains cells of interest (either tdTomato-p27kHigh or tdTomato-p27kNegative clusters).\nDraw a defined region of interest (ROI) in the snapshot using the freehand shape tool of the microscope (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nNote: If the aim is to compare the approximate number of infiltrating cells or the relative abundance of a cell type among different conditions, equivalent areas should be photoconverted. For this purpose, a ROI can be initially defined and saved, then applied to every position of interest throughout the set of slices from the same experiment.\nPhotoconvert the Kaede protein specifically within the ROI.",
    "Note: Photoconversion of Kaede in this experimental setting was performed using a Zeiss Plan Apochromat 20×/0.8 NA DIC air objective, a 405 nm 30 mW diode AOTF modulated line set to 0.2% transmittance laser, and a 405 long-pass dichroic mirror. A time series of 325 cycles at a 1.58 μs/pixel (pixel dwell time) was used during photoconversion. This settings might need to be modified for other photoconvertible/photoactivatable proteins.\nAssess photoconversion by a single confocal micrograph with dual green-red fluorescence.\nNote: Acquisition settings in this case were acquired using the settings from 5.a.i. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). They might need to get modified accordingly to the experimental setting used.\nNote: If not successful, check problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nScan the whole slice to check the overall photoconversion using same setting as 5.a.i. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSlice processing and flow sorting populations\nTiming: 30–45 min processing + 1 h sorting per slice\nPhotoconverted slices are digested to obtain single-cell suspensions that are flow-sorted to isolate individual photoconverted cells from the specific tumor region of interest.\nTissue digestion to obtain a single-cell suspension:\nPrepare digestion buffer as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2105_1.csv\nDigest slices:\nPlace 500 μL of the digestion buffer in a 12-well cell culture plate to digest each slice separately.\nPut tissue slice in the solution and disrupt tissue with two needles.\nIncubate for 15–20 min at 37C.\nPipette up and down with a 1,000 μL pipette to further disrupt tissue.\nFilter digestion with a 100 μm (pore size) filter, washing the well and the filter with flow buffer (2 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA in PBS).\nSpin down at 800 g for 5 min.\nPrepare a single-cell suspension for sorting:\nResuspend in 500 μL of red blood cell lysis buffer (BioLegend) and incubate for 5 min at RT.\nWash with flow buffer.",
    "Spin down at 800 g for 5 min.\nOptional: Stain with antibodies to analyze specific cell populations, such as exhaustion markers in our particular case (Baldominos et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: As quality control, it is recommended to stain a single-cell suspension from one slice that has gone through the whole procedure, combining an apoptosis marker such as AnnexinV and a viability dye (DAPI, BioLegend). Viable cells will be negative for both markers. The percentage of cell viability in photoconverted samples should be comparable to non-photoconverted ones.\nNote: We did not experience major phototoxicity issues with the conditions used for photoconversion.\nResuspend in flow buffer + DAPI (dilution 1:10,000 from stock, BioLegend).\nSort photoconverted population:\nSet gates using a single-cell suspension from a non-photoconverted slice (negative control) and another from a photoconverted slice with a big photoconverted area as a positive control (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2105-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative FACS plots of photoconverted infiltrates\n(A) Set up gate strategy using the DAPI negative cell population gated from a non-photoconverted sample (left) and from a photoconverted one (right).\n(B) Assessment of sample viability after photoconversion using viability dye (DAPI) and annexinV staining (to control for apoptosis).\nCheck cell viability using the single-cell suspension stained with AnnexinV and DAPI, as a quality control before proceeding further with the protocol (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: If cell viability is low, check problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nSort enough cells to comply with the requirements of your subsequent technique.\nNote: In our experimental model, the target amount for scRNA-sequencing using 10× genomics platform was 10,000 cells per condition (See problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nNote: Sorting in serum-supplemented cell culture medium increases cell viability but requires extra washing steps that might reduce the cell recovery yield.",
    "Critical: If sorting in serum-supplemented culture medium, use 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and a swing centrifuge to minimize cell loss during repeated washes.\nSamples are ready for standard single-cell RNA-sequencing (such as 10× genomics, the procedure used for our experimental model) or any other analysis dependent on the scientific question to be addressed.\nNote: If comparing two different regions inside of a tumor, it is recommended to use hashtags to eliminate technical variability when sequencing paired samples."
