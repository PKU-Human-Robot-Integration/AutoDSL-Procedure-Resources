    "1. Dormancy Determination and Plant Material Collection\nSample the flower buds in the field. Dormancy studies are long-term experiments and require adult trees big enough to collect buds and shoots all winter without compromising the trees’ development during the next spring. Special orchard management could be required depending on the training system; thus, pruning may be less severe than for fruit production purposes.\n\t\nEach week, from the start of autumn until the onset of bud break, collect and weigh 10 flower buds.\nFix the flower buds by placing them into a 10-mL glass tube with a cap and soak the samples in a fixative solution of ethanol/acetic acid (3:1) for at least 24 h at 4 °C. Then, discard the fixative and add 75% ethanol, generously ensuring that it covers the samples. The samples can be conserved in this solution at 4 °C until use.\n\t\tNote: Vacuum infiltration can be used to remove the air bubbles inside the bud and prevent them from floating. This facilitates the penetration of the fixative into the tissues but could damage the structure of the tissues. Try to avoid it if not necessary.\nSample the shoots in the field.\n\t\nEach week, from the start of autumn until the onset of bud break, take three shoots of 15 - 30 cm in length and 5 mm in diameter, containing at least 10 flower buds each. Place them on water-soaked florist foam in a growth chamber at 22 ± 1 °C with a 12 h light photoperiod.\nAfter 10 days in the growth chamber, pick and weigh 10 flower buds from the shoots.",
    "Evaluate the bud growth and determine the dormancy status. The sampling period has to be adjusted to the conditions of the location. In the orchard conditions (Zaragoza, Spain, 41°44’30” N, 0°47’00” W, and 220 m above sea level), the sampling of the shoots was carried out from November 30 until the end of February or the beginning of March.\n\t\nWeekly evaluate the response of the flower buds to the suitable growth conditions of the chamber, from the beginning of autumn until budburst in the spring, by comparing the weight of the 10 buds picked from the field.\nIf there are no differences or those differences are less than 30%, consider that the buds have not fulfilled their chilling requirements and are endodormant22. If the differences are more than 30%, consider that the buds have fulfilled their chilling requirements and are ecodormant22.\n2. Plant Material Preparation for Starch Quantification\nSelect about six fixed buds from each sampling date (see step 1.1). Depending on cultivars, each sweet cherry flower bud contains up to five flower primordia.\n\t\nRemove the external bud scales and place the bud on a watchmaker’s glass with 75% ethanol to prevent it from drying out.\nDissect the bud and extract at least one flower primordium per bud with the help of precision forceps and an ophthalmologic scalpel under a stereoscopic microscope. The flower primordium can be conserved in a 10-mL glass tube with 75% ethanol at 4 °C, or proceed immediately to the next step.\nDehydrate the samples in a tertiary butyl alcohol series.\n\t\nReplace the 75% ethanol solution with 10 mL of 75% tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) to generously cover the samples and incubate them for 1.5 h. A Pasteur pipette can be useful to discard the solution.",
    "Repeat step 2.2.1, adding TBA with rising concentrations (85%, 95%, and 100%, v/v; and 3x with pure TBA) in a drying stove at 30 °C with air extraction, since pure TBA crystalizes at room temperature (< 20 °C) and is very volatile and toxic. If TBA crystalizes with the sample, it would damage the tissues.\nEmbed the samples in paraffin18.\n\t\nMelt the paraffin by introducing the paraffin pearls in the drying stove at 60 °C with air extraction the previous day. The paraffin pearls can be also melted on a hotplate, but ensure that the liquid paraffin is at 60 °C and not at a higher temperature, to avoid tissue damage.\nReplace the TBA with a mix of TBA and paraffin oil (1:1) and incubate for 24 h inside a drying stove at 60 °C. Then, replace the mix of TBA and paraffin oil with pure melt paraffin and incubate for at least 6 h inside a drying stove at 60 °C. Repeat it 2x and incubate the last change for at least 4 - 6 d.\nPlace each sample on a small metal base mold over a heat surface, embedded in paraffin wax, and pace the embedding cassette. Place it over a cold surface and remove the block once the wax is solidified.\nSection and rehydrate the preparations.\n\t\nPrepare Haupt’s adhesive: dissolve 1 g of plain Knox gelatin in 100 mL of distilled water at 30 °C; then, add 2 g of phenol loose crystals (C6H5OH) and 15 mL of glycerol. Spread the Haupt’s adhesive over a glass slide with a brush and add a drop of a 1% formaldehyde solution.\nSection each paraffin block at 10 µm in a rotatory microtome and place the sections onto the glass slide covered with Haupt’s adhesive.",
    "Place the glass slides with the sections over a heat surface at 35 - 40 °C until dry; then, move the glass slides to a slide rack.\nPrepare the dewax and rehydration solutions. Place 200 mL of Histoclear II in three glass-staining dishes, another one with Histoclear II:ethanol (1:1, v/v), an ethanol series (100%, 70%, 40%, v/v), and a final distilled-water wash.\nDewax the sections with three washes, each 5 min, in Histoclear II and in Histoclear II:ethanol (1:1, v/v). Place the slide rack inside the glass-staining dishes, ensuring that the solution completely covers the slides, and, then, move the slide rack from one solution to the next.\nRehydrate the sections by the following series of 2-min washes: an ethanol series (100%, 70%, 40%, v/v) and a final distilled-water wash. Finally, dry the glass slides at room temperature.\nStain the sections18.\n\t\nPrepare I2KI stain: dissolve 2 g of potassium iodide (KI) and 0.2 g of iodine (I2) in 100 mL of distilled water. Apply a drop of fresh I2KI over the section(s) for 5 min and, then, discard the excess of stain by absorbing it with a blotting paper. Quickly proceed to the next step.\nApply a small drop of a synthetic mounting media, place a small cover glass on top, and press hard. Once the mounting media dries, observe under a bright-field microscope for a preliminary evaluation of the ovary starch.",
    "Note: This step is not mandatory, although a better contrast between the starch and the background is obtained. If the section has to be reused with other stains after starch quantification, place the cover glass over the drop of stain and discard the excess by absorbing it with a blotting paper (see 2.5.1). Then, after starch quantification, wash out the I2KI stain with distilled water and place the preparations over a heat surface at 35 - 40 °C until dry.\n3. Quantification of the Starch Content\nCalibrate the optical conditions.\n\tNote: The detection levels used by the image analyzer to detect the stained starch are directly dependent on light conditions and magnification of the microscope; thus, fix these conditions for all the preparations evaluated. Adapt the adjustment proposed here to the available microscope and light conditions.\n\t\nAdjust the aperture diaphragm at the 20X magnification and the brightness control or light intensity.\nMake sure that there are no filters on the filter holder, and select a bright-field condition in the microscope. Select a suitable magnification (e.g., 40X for sweet cherry ovary primordium).\nControl the image acquisition conditions. Adjust the camera settings with a stained preparation without tissue via Image | Acquisition | Pre-view.\n\t\nFix the brightness at 50%, the gain at 1.0x, and the histogram indicators the gamma value at 1.00 and the contrast at 0 - 100, lining up with the limits of the brightness distribution histogram.\nActivate the overexposure/underexposure function and adjust the exposure time at the limit of overexposure.\nApply the white balance function to the complete image to display all neutral-colored components of the image without any color tone and the shading correction to the complete image to create a corrected and homogeneous image.",
    "Calibrate the Image Analysis System to obtain the control values of the grey level (0, black; 255, white) of different optical densities (OD) that are obtained by the transmittance (T) values.\n\t\nAcquire an image of a stained preparation without tissue, considered control white, and measure the grey level of the black and white image via Measure | Grey measure | Calibrate grey | Reference value = 0 | Measure | Calibrate | OK. This corresponds with a 100% transmittance; thus, an optical density of 0, according to OD = 2 - log T.\nAcquire an image of the same preparation with a 4N filter, which reduces the amount of light 4x, and measure the grey level of the black and white image via Measure | Grey measure | Calibrate grey | Reference value = 0.6 | Measure | Calibrate | OK. This corresponds with a 25% transmittance; thus, an optical density of 0.6, according to OD = 2 - log T.\nAcquire an image of the same preparation without light, considered black, and measure the grey level of the black and white image via Measure | Grey measure | Calibrate grey | Reference value = 1 | Measure | Calibrate | OK. This corresponds with a 0% transmittance; thus, an optical density of 1, according to OD = 2 - log T.\nDetect starch.\n\t\nAcquire a color image of the field to measure in TIFF format with a resolution of at least 300 dots per inch (dpi).",
    "Create a binary image corresponding to the area stained. Set the three color thresholds (values between 0 - 255 for each) until the binary image exactly reflects the stained starch granules observed, via Image | Detect | Select the thresholds of red, blue and green | OK. Make repeatedly visual comparisons in various preparations and tissues to tune up the final detection levels. Store and use these levels for all preparations.\nQuantify the starch. Convert the original color image into a black and white image with the image analysis system. Use the binary image as a superimposed mask on the black and white image via Image | Binary Edit. Measure the sum of the optical density of every pixel under the mask via Measure | Grey level | OK and consider this value as the starch content in the measured field.\nRepeat steps 3.4.1 - 3.4.3 in four places of the ovary primordia to obtain a representative value of the starch content in the ovary of flower primordia.\nRepeat steps 3.4.1 - 3.4.3 and step 3.4.5 in different flowers of each collecting date.\nSubscription Required.
