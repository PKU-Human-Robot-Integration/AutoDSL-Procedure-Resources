    "NOTE: The protocol follows guidelines from Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust’s Human Research Ethics Committee. Perform all described techniques in a temperature controlled laboratory (21 – 22 oC), with stable lighting and absence of noise. Ask individuals undergoing assessments to refrain from food, drink, smoking and exercise 12 hr prior to the test. Withhold vasoactive medications for at least 12 hr when appropriate.\n1. Laser Doppler Imaging with Iontophoresis\nSwitch on Laser Doppler Imager (LDI) and allow the scanner to automatically stabilise for approximately 30 min. Start the LDI software and click ‘Measurement’ (the software’s home screen will then be shown). On the home screen, select ‘Ionto Protocol’ on the taskbar located at the top of the window.\nManually enter the protocol (the protocol used in our laboratory involves a total of 13 scans, with electrical current for iontophoretic drug delivery set from scan 2 to scan 11 at a voltage of 30 µa). Set scan 1 as a baseline scan with no electric current, and scan 12 & 13 as recovery scans also with no electrical current. Click OK to confirm settings and return to home screen.\nAsk participant to relax in a semi-recumbent chair with their forearm resting 90 degrees on a comfortable, firm pillow, and place a black mat under the forearm.\n\tNOTE: The mat helps to limit artefact measurements generated by background surfaces surrounding the tissue. It is important that the participants arm is strapped firmly to the pillow so that there is no movement and associated artefacts.",
    "Connect the wired plugs at the opposite end of each perspex chamber to the iontophoresis controller. Connect the chamber containing a 2.5 ml dose of 1% acetylcholine (ACh) to the anodal connection of the iontophoresis controller, and connect the second chamber containing a 2.5 ml dose of 1% sodium-nitroprusside (SNP) to the cathodal connection. Mix both agents in the chamber using 0.5% saline solution. Connect the two chambers to the volar aspect of the participant’s right forearm using double sided adhesive pads.\nCover the chambers by 32 mm coverslips to prevent leakage of fluid.\nBefore starting the scan, open the ‘Scanner Setup’ window located on the top left of the home screen. Select the ‘Video and Distance’ tab and select the ‘auto distance’ function to measure the distance of the scanner head from the participants forearm.\n\t\nFollowing completion of the auto distance measurement, select the ‘Image Scan’ tab and determine the area that is to be scanned by clicking the ‘Mark’ button in the bottom right corner of the window. If needed, change the size of the region of interest by manually entering in the size of the scanning area into the ‘Scan Area’ section near the top of the window. Ensure that the region of interest includes the diameter of each of the iontophoresis chambers and is large enough to limit variability in skin blood flow.\nFollowing completion of the assessment, save the data file. Open the data file using LDI image analysis software to perform measurements of perfusion.\n\t\nClick ‘Image Review’ on the main software window, and open the image file that is to be analysed.",
    "Use the software to mark out a region of interest around the outer diameters of each chamber. Adjust the region of interest so that it fits correctly on the area where the chambers were present. Then click the ‘statistics’ icon and a column containing the median perfusion units for each chamber will be displayed. Note the baseline perfusion unit, as well as the highest perfusion unit from each of the preceding 12 scans for each chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: This method of analysis is specific to our laboratory; however, other methods can be used to express data obtained from the LDI scan. For a comprehensive review please refer to guidelines from Roustit and Cracowski 12.\nTo calculate percentage change in perfusion in response to ACh and SNP, subtract baseline perfusion from the peak perfusion, divide by baseline perfusion and then multiply by 100.\n\tNOTE: In our lab, changes in perfusion relative to baseline have shown good intra-observer coefficient of variation for ACh (7%) and SNP (6%).\n2. Flow-mediated Dilatation and Glyceryl trinitrate-mediated Dilatation\nSwitch on the Doppler ultrasound machine and networked PC containing vascular image analysis (VIA) software.\n\tNOTE: The VIA software captures a live image (at 25 frames per sec) and provides information on the vessel diameter as well as the quality of the vascular borders being detected by the ultrasound machine. Other software packages are available which may contain additional features and settings. It is advisable to consult operating manuals for specific software.\nAsk participant to relax in a semi-recumbent armchair and place their arm on a comfortable pillow out to their side but level with the heart. Place a blood pressure cuff around the participant’s wrist.\n\tNOTE: The patient should be asked to keep their arm as still as possible to prevent movement artefacts during the measurement.",
    "Secure the linear array transducer from the ultrasound machine into a stereotactic clamp, and tighten the clamp using the wingnuts so that the ultrasound transducer remains in a fixed position.\n\tNOTE: The clamp will ensure that the ultrasound transducer will remain stable once the blood vessel is located.\nOn the ultrasound machine, scroll into the ‘Menu’ and set the scanning frequency at 5 MHz and optimize the depth (the recommended depth setting is 3.5 cm) and gain settings on the ultrasound machine. Adjust the gain settings to ensure that there is symmetrical brightness for the near and far wall of the vessel.\nUsing the linear array transducer, locate the brachial artery which is usually found 2-10 cm above the antecubital fossa in the longitudinal scanning plane. Make any adjustments to clarify the image quality at this stage. To help identify the artery, turn on the colour Doppler to help show pulsatile arterial blood flow and distinguish it from continuous venous blood flow. View the brachial artery horizontally across the screen; it should appear as two solid parallel lines, separated by a clear area in between the lines which represents the lumen of the vessel.\nTo allow the VIA software to automatically record vessel diameter, use the cursor to mark a predetermined region of interest to detect and track the anterior and posterior walls of the artery.\n\tNOTE: The size of the region of interest can be increased or decreased using the ‘x’ and ‘y’ buttons located on the main software screen.\nClick ‘Start’ on the VIA software and image the artery for 2 min. Following this, press ‘Inflate’ on the VIA software and simultaneously inflate the blood pressure cuff placed around the wrist to suprasystolic pressures (usually above 220 mmHg) for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: The purpose of the wrist cuff is to occlude blood flow to the hand.\nAfter 5 min deflate the blood pressure cuff to induce reactive hyperaemia which, in a healthy vessel, will stimulate NO-mediated vasodilatation.\n\tNOTE: Peak dilatation can occur up to 180 sec following cuff deflation, so it is advisable to continue recording vascular diameters for 3 min after cuff release.\nFollowing a 10 min rest period, re-locate the brachial artery using the linear array transducer and record a 2 min baseline diameter reading in the same manner as step 2.7.\nThen ask the participant to place a 500 µg sublingual glyceryl-trinitrate (GTN) tablet under their tongue and continue to measure the brachial artery diameter for a further 5 min. After this period, ask the participant to remove the GTN tablet and monitor the participant to make sure they do not experience any adverse effects to the drug.\nCarry out all analysis of data offline. Twenty-five data points are available for each second of the assessment; collapse this data into one-second epochs in Microsoft Excel. Export the data to a digital signal analysis package and filter with a 3 sec moving average filter.\nEstablish the baseline diameter from the 120 sec of data prior to the cuff-inflation. Visually inspect the baseline region and exclude artefacts. Average the remaining baseline regions to produce the baseline diameter.\nFor the flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) analysis, use the software to automatically scan the post cuff-deflation region for peak dilation and use the cursor to mark this peak for visual inspection. If the peak has been misidentified, use the cursor to select a more confined region within which the peak could then be identified. Record the peak value as peak diameter.",
    "For the GTN data, adopt an identical procedure to that used with FMD, except search for peak dilation in the region following the 5 min of drug administration.\nTo calculate FMD % and GTN %, subtract baseline diameter from the peak diameter, divide by baseline diameter and then multiply by 100.\n\tNOTE: In our laboratory, the intra-observer coefficient of variation is 11% for FMD, and 12% for GTN.\n3. Carotid Intima-media Thickness\nAsk participant to lie comfortably on a bed, and place a pillow under the head to offer support to the neck.\nConnect the electrocardiogram (ECG) leads to the Doppler ultrasound and then attach them onto the patient limbs. Only a basic ECG trace is required, so place the appropriate leads on the left and right arms, and on the left ankle.\nPrepare the ultrasound machine by scrolling through the ‘menu’ and setting the scanning frequency at 10 MHz and optimizing depth (the recommended depth setting is 3 – 4 cm) and gain settings. Adjust the gain settings to ensure that there is symmetrical brightness for the near and far wall of the vessel.\nAsk participant to tilt their head slightly to the left, and using the linear array transducer, scan the right carotid artery along all its sections (common, internal and external carotid artery) using the longitudinal scanning plane to identify the presence of any plaques. Save images that display any evidence of plaque. To help identify the artery, look for a bifurcation point in the vessel, as this shows the common carotid artery bifurcating into the internal and external carotid arteries.",
    "For measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), attain at least 3 images of a section of the common carotid artery that is free of plaque, and is 1 cm proximal to the carotid bulb. Attain all images at the peak of the R wave on the ECG as this corresponds to ventricular diastole and the point at which the vessel is under the least amount of shear stress.\nRepeat steps 3.4 and 3.5 in the left carotid artery. Ask the participant to tilt their head slightly to the right for this measurement.\nTo assist in attaining clear images of the near and far walls, carefully manipulate the ultrasound probe during the assessment to ensure the vessel is perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. Achieve this by subtly changing the tilt and rotation of the transducer along with minor adjustments to the pressure applied to the proximal-to-distal angle (heel-toe movement) of the probe.\nCarry out analysis of images offline using Artery Measurement Software (AMS) to detect the vascular boundary according to the lines of Pignoli. Load up the image to be analyzed, and then using the cursor, create a region of interest in a section of the vessel that is free from plaque. Click ‘detect’ on the software and record the values displayed on the screen for cIMT and lumen diameter.\n\tNOTE: accurate readings can only be obtained from the far wall, so ignore readings from the near wall.\nTake three measurements for each side, and then average these to give the mean cIMT for the right and left carotid arteries separately. Further average the cIMT from both sides to give the overall cIMT.\n\tNOTE: The intra-observer coefficient of variation for this technique in our laboratory is 9%.",
    "Perform measurement of any plaque using the same software by manually marking out the plaque using the cursor. Click ‘classify’ on AMS to automatically calculate the echogenicity of the plaque and grade according to its susceptibility for rupture. Click on the “Plaque Characteristics” window to see this information."
