    "This protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, and it was in accordance with all guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of China. There was no accidental death situation during the experimental procedure, and no animals needed to be euthanized in this study.\n1. Preparation\nPurchase 30 male SAMP8 mice and 10 male SAMR1 mice (age: 8 months).\nHouse the mice individually in individual ventilation cages at a temperature of 24 ±2 °C and a 12 h dark/light cycle.\nFeed the mice with a standard pellet diet available ad libitum and provide sterile drinking water.\nAcclimate all the mice to the environment for 5 days before experimentation.\n2. Grouping of animals\nRandomly divide 30 SAMP8 mice into three groups (n = 10/group): the AD group, manual acupuncture (MA) group, and medicine (M) group.\nUse 10 SAMR1 mice as the normal control (N) group6.\n3. Administration of donepezil hydrochloride tablets\nCrush a donepezil hydrochloride tablet (5 mg/tablet) and dissolve it in 50 mL of distilled water.\nDeliver the medicine prepared in step 3.1 at doses of 1 mg/kg to the mice using an oral gavage once a day8 during the entire experiment, including the days when the MA treatment and MWM tests are performed.\n4. Administration of manual acupuncture\nImmobilize the mice of the MA group in mouse bags.\nUse disposable sterile acupuncture needles (0.25 mm x 13 mm) and apply the flat thorn method of MA on Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29)5 toward the nose for 20 min. Ensure that the needle depth is 0.2–0.3 cm.",
    "Bidirectionally twirl the manipulation within 90° at a speed of about 180 r/min every 5 min for ~15 s each time during the entire experiment, including days when MA treatment and MWM tests are performed.\n5. MWM test\nNOTE: At 24 h after the 15 consecutive days of treatment, subject the mice in the four groups to the MWM test. Conduct the visible platform trial, hidden platform trial, probe trial, and reversal trial in order.\nPrepare for the MWM test.\n\t\nPosition MWM device and the signal acquisition and processing system in an experiment room designed to maintain sound insulation.\nPut a circular white tank (diameter = 90 cm, height = 50 cm) surrounded by an opaque cloth in the middle of the MWM device.\nFix a video camera to the ceiling of the MWM device and connect it to a video recorder with an automated tracking system to collect the data.\nDivide the water maze tank equally into four equal regions using two mutually perpendicular lines, labeled north (N), south (S), east (E), and west (W). Divide the pool area conceptually into four quadrants of the same size (NE, NW, SW, and SE).\nWithin the sight of the mouse, place visual cues of different shapes on the wall of each quadrant as visual references (e.g., squares, triangles, and circles).\n\t\tNOTE: Distal cues are the animal’s navigational reference points for locating the platform. Therefore, do not move them during the test. The position of the researcher is a potential distal cue and can influence the MWM. Therefore, the researcher should stay out of the sight of the mice while waiting for the animal to perform the test.\nFill the circular tank with water to a depth of 30 cm and maintain at 22 ± 2 °C with an electric heater.",
    "Render the water opaque with about 150 g of milk powder.\nPerform the visible platform trial.\n\t\nPlace a plastic circular platform (diameter = 9.5 cm; height = 28 cm) 1 cm above the water surface in any quadrant at random.\nPut a black flag on the platform.\nRelease each mouse gently into the water at water-level from one of the four start locations facing the tank wall. Do not drop the mouse into the water.\nActivate the computer tracking program as soon as the mouse is released into the water.\nGive each mouse 60 s to search for the platform. At the end of each trial, place each mouse on the platform and allow it to stay on it for 10–30 s.\nObserve the swimming trajectories of the mice on the computer, record the time the mouse took to find the platform as escape latency, and analyze the swimming speed.\nDry each mouse with towels and warm it with an electric heater. Be sure to use an appropriate heat source to prevent the animal from overheating. \n\t\tNOTE: Place each mouse into the pool at each of the four different starting quadrants for four trials, moving the platform to a different location with each subsequent trial. The interval between two trials using each mouse is 15–20 min.\nPerform the hidden platform trial/place navigation test.\n\t\nPlace the same platform without a flag in the SE quadrant.\nRandomly place the mouse into the pool from each of the four quadrants (NE, NW, SW, N) facing the pool wall for four trials. Use a time interval of 15–20 min between two trials.\nGive each mouse 60 s to search for the hidden platform.\nRecord the escape latency of each trial after the mouse climbs up to the platform for subsequent analysis.",
    "Dry each mouse with towels and warm it with an electric heater.\n\t\tNOTE: Conduct the hidden platform trial from days 2−6. If the mouse cannot find the platform in 60 s, lead the mouse to climb up to the platform and allow it to stay there for 10–30 s at the end of each trial. Perform four trials/day for each mouse for 5 consecutive days, with the platform and the visual cues at constant positions.\nPerform the probe trial.\n\tNOTE: Locate each mouse in the pool at a novel start position to observe the spatial exploration ability of the mouse.\n\t\nRemove the platform.\nLocate each mouse facing the tank wall in the pool once for 60 s. Ensure that the starting location is the NW quadrant, which is the quadrant furthest away from the SE quadrant.\nRecord the swimming distance, swimming speed, and the platform crossover number in the maze.\nDry each mouse with towels and provide warmth after the trial.\nPerform the reversal trial.\n\tNOTE: Perform the reversal trial from days 8−11.\n\t\nPosition the platform in the middle of the NW quadrant (instead of the SE quadrant).\nFollow steps 5.3.2 −5.3.5 as detailed in the hidden platform trial section.\n6. Statistical Analysis\nUse statistics software (e.g., SPSS 20.0) to perform the statistical analysis."
