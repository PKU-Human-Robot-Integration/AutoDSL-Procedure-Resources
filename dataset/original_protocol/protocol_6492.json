    "Notes: Mice should be cared for and used in accordance with national and institutional policies. All protocols must be approved by the institutional animal committee. Tissue dissection can be performed outside a biosafety cabinet without need of sterility. Mouse perfusionDeeply anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (12.5 mg/ml) at 20 μl/g of body weight.Pin mouse down in a supine position (ventral side up) to the dissecting pad. Spray the mouse with 70% ethanol.Open a sterile wrap with scissors and forceps and place a prefilled 10% neutral buffered formalin container in the work area.Cut open the fur, then cut open the peritoneum along the midline. Cut through the rib cage along the midline.Cut away part of the rib cage with sternum to expose the heart and lungs.Snip the inferior vena cava (IVC) to exsanguinate the mouse (Figure 2).Take a DPBS filled 10 ml syringe attached to a 25 G x 5/8 inch needle and insert it into the left ventricle in the direction of the aorta (Figure 2). Gently push the plunger of the syringe to perfuse the mouse.Notes:The cardiac perfusion is initiated before cessation of the heartbeat.The perfusion with DPBS is done to clear the tissues from the blood that might interfere with subsequent staining. As an indication of correct perefusion, blood should drain out of the IVC. Organs like the lungs, kidneys and liver should gradually become pale as a sign of good perfusion.Cardiac perfusion can also be performed using a peristaltic pump.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200514/20200514181002_4073.jpgFigure 2. Thoracic cavity. Image of the mouse thoracic cavity showing the anatomical structures in reference to the position of the perfusion needle. The aorta and inferior vena cava are marked with dashed lines.Kidney dissectionRetract the intestine and surrounding tissues to expose the kidneys.Cut the renal arteries to isolate the kidneys.",
    "Carefully remove the kidneys from the abdominal cavity and place them on the dissecting pad, trim the fat attached to the tissues.Place the kidneys in the pre-filled 10% neutral buffered formalin container. Fix the kidneys for 48 h and proceed directly to Step F1.Notes:To better fix the kidneys, they can be cut in ½ (longitudinal or sagittal cut).Routinely, for formalin fixed tissues all specimens are placed together in a container large enough to allow a ratio between tissue specimens and neutral buffered formalin (10%) volume of 1 to 15/20x.Tissue specimens can be stored in containers filled with 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin indefinitely at room temperature without the risk of over-hardening or shrinking of the tissue. Liver dissectionCut any membranes attaching the liver to the diaphragm, the stomach and small intestine.Cut the blood vessels which are visible between the liver and diaphragm.Remove the entire liver from the abdominal cavity.Place the liver in the pre-filled 10% neutral buffered formalin container. Fix for 48 h and proceed directly to Step F1.Lungs and heart dissectionCut the esophagus and trachea close to the head.Using forceps lift the lungs and the heart by the remaining trachea and/or esophagus.Cut any membranes attached to the diaphragm.Once removed from the thoracic cavity, place the organs on the dissecting pad and separate the heart from the lungs. Discard the thymus if still attached.Place the lungs and heart in the pre-filled 10% neutral buffered formalin container. Fix for 48 h and proceed directly to Step F1.Gastrocnemius (GA) muscle dissectionPin the mouse down in a prone position (dorsal side up) to the dissecting pad. Spray the mouse with 70% ethanol.Remove the skin from both hind limbs to expose the muscles and gently cut away the fascia of both hind limb muscles.",
    "Note: For the isolation of other muscle types, position the mouse in a supine position (ventral side up) onto the dissecting board. Cut the Achilles tendon of the muscle.Carefully pull the GA muscle upwards towards the knee joint, using scissors to remove the surrounding muscles.Note: Do not pull too hard as this might affect the tissue integrity and create artifacts in the stained tissue sections.  When the superior tendon close to the knee joint becomes visible, cut it and remove the GA muscle.Place the muscles in the pre-filled 10% neutral buffered formalin container. Fix for 48 h and proceed directly to Step F1.Tissue processingPlace the tissues in labelled Tissue-Tek Uni-cassettes.Process the tissues overnight using an Excelsior AS tissue processor (Table 1).Notes:Alternatively, the tissue can be processed manually. Steps 1-6 (dehydration) are done to replace the water in the tissues/cells by alcohol. The gradual increase in alcohol concentration is done to avoid distortion of the tissue. Steps 7-9 (clearing) are done to remove the alcohol. Alcohol cannot form a homogeneous mixture with paraffin; therefore, xylene is used as an intermediate solvent. Steps 10-12 are done to displace xylene with paraffin to make the tissues ready for embedding.The incubation time of each step is based on the thickness of the tissues (10-15 mm).Table 1. Stepwise procedure of tissue processing in the Excelsior ASimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200514/20200514181714_9388.jpgTurn on the cold plate and make sure the paraffin embedding station is on and the paraffin is liquid.Choose an appropriate size base mold and add some liquid paraffin into it.Embedding of the GA muscles for tissue sectioning (Figure 3):Position the entire muscle from tendon to tendon onto the paraffin base mold for subsequent longitudinal sectioning of the tissue.",
    "Cut the muscle in half transversely and position both halves with with the cut site down onto the paraffin base mold for subsequent coronal (frontal) sectioning of the tissue.The other tissues can be positioned onto the paraffin base mold according to the type of analyses required.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200514/20200514181850_4248.jpgFigure 3. Embedding positions of the GA musclesPlace the base mold with the tissue on the cold plate at -10 °C to start solidifying the paraffin, making sure that the tissues are pressed down and fully immersed.Place the pre-labelled cassette on top of the base mold containing the tissue and fill the mold with additional liquid paraffin.Let the paraffin to completely solidify before removing the paraffin block from the mold.Trim excess paraffin from the sides of the cassette with the Para Trimmer.The blocks are now ready for sectioning and can be stored at room temperature.SectioningPrewarm a water bath to 37 °C.Mount the paraffin block on the microtome.Note: The block can be mounted in a vertical or horizontal position depending on the user’s preference. Cut 6 mm thin sections throughout the block to collect different layers of the tissues.Note: Skeletal muscles may be difficult to section, maintaining the integrity of the tissue. To improve the quality of the sections, place the blocks on the cold plate before sectioning. Pick up the sections using a small brush and transfer them gently into the water bath.Note: Leave the sections floating only for a very short time, as prolonged floating may cause separation of the muscle fibers. Collect the tissue sections by dipping a glass slide into the water bath and allowing the section to adhere to the surface of the slide.Drain the slide in a slide box.Dry the slides by placing them in a 45 °C incubator for 1 h or overnight.",
    "Masson’s Trichrome staining for formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissueNote: Perform all steps in a fume hood wearing protective gloves throughout the staining procedure. Prepare all reagents in advance, prior to starting the staining procedure.Place the bead bath in the fume hood and set it to 60 °C.Prewarm Bouin’s solution in a slide holder to 60 °C in the bead bath.Note:The Bouin's solution (inorganic oxide) rapidly penetrates the tissues preserving glycogen and enhancing the binding of the dyes.Bouin’s solution can be prepared by combining 75 ml Picric acid (saturated), 25 ml formaldehyde (37-40%) and 5 ml glacial acetic acid. Deparaffinize the slides using Gemini AS automated slide stainer (Table 2).Note: This step can also be conducted manually.Table 2. Deparaffinization and rehydration stepsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200514/20200514182128_0639.jpgPlace the slides into the slide holder containing the Bouin’s solution and close it tightly.Incubate the slides in Bouin’s solution for 1 h at 60 °C.Discard the solution in a properly labeled waste bottle.Notes:Since Bouin’s solution contains formaldehyde, picric acid and acetic acid it is a hazardous solution and correct safety and disposable measures should be taken. The picric acid, in less than 10% water, is explosive.The solution should be discarded after use in a proper waste container following institutional guidelines for the disposal of hazardous solutions. Wash the slides in running tap water for 5 min to ensure complete removal of the Bouin’s solution.Transfer the slides into a coplin jar.Stain tissue sections with Weigert’s iron hematoxylin for 10 min (Recipe 1).Notes: Weigert’s iron hematoxylin solution will stain nuclei dark purple/black. See Note b of Step H7 for disposal guidelines. Weigert’s iron hematoxylin binds to chromatin and nuclear structures. The oxidation product of hematoxylin, hematin, is anionic and therefore does not have good affinity for DNA.",
    "However, the combination of an iron salt with hematin results in a positively charged dye complex that efficiently binds to anionic chromatin. Wash in running tap water for 5 min and rinse twice in distilled water.Incubate the slides in Biebrich scarlet-acid fuchsin solution for 5 min (Recipe 2).Notes: Biebrich scarlet-acid fuchsin solution will stain the cytoplasm and muscle tissues red. Decreased red staining indicates that the staining solution is old or overused. See Note b of Step H7 for disposal guidelines.The chemical basis and exact mechanism of Biebrich Scarlet, like other experimental stains, is still unclear. However, its specificity to low pH cytoplasm and muscle fibers is obtained by additional treatment with the combination of phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acids, that enables the less permeable structures to retain the red, while the dye is removed from the collagen fibers. Rinse the slides three times in distilled water.Place the slides in phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acid solution for 10 min (Recipe 3).Note: The phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acid solution is used as a decolorizer causing Biebrich scarlet-acid fuchsin to diffuse out of the collagen fibers, while leaving the muscle fibers stained in red. See Note b of Step H7 for disposal guidelines. Drain the slides and transfer them directly to aniline blue for 5 min (Recipe 4).Notes: Aniline blue will stain collagens blue. See Note b of Step H7 for disposal guidelines.As a consequence of the previous reaction (H14) with the combined mixture of phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acids, the amphionic aniline blue dye can now stain collagen fibers. Rinse the slides three times in distilled water.Differentiate the colors of the dyed tissue structures by incubating the slides in 1% acetic acid for 1 min (Recipe 5).Notes:If the blue staining of connective tissue appears faded, the incubation time in the acetic acid solution should be shortened.",
    "The acetic acid solution can be discarded in the sink with running water. Rinse the slides in distilled water.Dehydrate in 95% ethanol, and then 100% ethanol for 2 min each.Note: Depending on the tissue, the time of dehydration may be reduced to avoid fading of the red color. Clear the slides in xylene for 2 min.Mount with Cytoseal XYL mounting medium by placing 2 drops on the sections and covering them with a cover slip.Drain excess Cytoseal and dry the slides.Image sections by using a light microscope.Notes: A 4x or 10x objective can be used for an overview of the sections, for more detailed pictures 20x-100x objectives can be used.Analyses of the extent of tissue fibrosis can be done manually by a pathologist or performed quantitatively using imaging/processing software, such as ImageJ, Photoshop and Aperio."
