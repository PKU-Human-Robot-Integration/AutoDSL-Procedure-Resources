    "1. Preparation of Media for Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC)\nNOTE: Here, the SILAC Protein Quantitation Kit - DMEM supplemented with 50 mg of 13C6 L-Arginine-HCl was used for SILAC labeling. The dialyzed Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) is provided with the SILAC Protein Quantitation Kit.\nRemove 50 mL from each bottle of DMEM medium and add 50 mL of dialyzed FCS.\nDissolve 50 mg of 13C6 L-Lysine-2HCl and 50 mg of 13C6 L-Arginine-HCl in 1 mL of medium. Mix thoroughly and add the amino acids to the DMEM + FCS medium.\nAdd 1x Pen/Strep and 1x L-glutamine substitute. Sterile-filter the medium using a 0.45 µm filter. Label the bottle as \"heavy\" SILAC medium.\nTo prepare the \"light\" medium, repeat steps 1.1 - 1.3 using 50 mg of L-Arginine-HCl and 50 mg of L-Lysine-2HCl. Label the bottle as \"light\" SILAC medium.\n2. SILAC-labeling and Amino Acid Incorporation Control\nTrypsinize cells (1x Trypsin-EDTA) and split 1 x 105 Huh7.5 cells into 2 wells of a 6-well culture plate containing 2 mL of medium, one well with the \"heavy\" SILAC medium and one with the \"light\" SILAC medium.\nCulture the cells for at least 6 passages (split ratio: 1:6); after 6 passages, the incorporation of the \"heavy\" amino acids should be more than 95%.\nHarvest 1 x 106 cells of the \"heavy\"- and \"light\"-labeled cell population to analyze the incorporation efficacy. Wash the cells in 1x PBS and pellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 160 x g and 4 °C.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 150 µL of MS-buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubate the cells on ice for 30 min. Lyse the cells by sonication at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: The following are the sonication settings used here: timer, hold; output control, 8; duty cycle, 80%; and 2 x 30 pulses.\nRemove the cell debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 11,000 x g and 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and determine the protein concentration with a detergent-compatible protein assay.\nMix 75 µg of protein with 6x sample buffer (375 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25.8% glycerol, 123 mg/mL SDS, 600 µg/mL bromophenol blue, and 60 µL/mL β-mercaptoethanol), boil at 95 °C for 5 min, and separate the proteins by SDS-PAGE in SDS running buffer (3.02 g/L Tris base, 18.8 g/L glycine, and 1 g/L SDS) at 180 V for approximately 1 h or according to the manufacturers' instructions.\nTransfer the gel into colloidal Coomassie staining solution. Excise the same protein band from each lane. Digest the proteins with trypsin and analyze the incorporation efficacy by MS analysis, as described22.\n3. Lipid Droplet Isolation of SILAC-labeled Huh7.5 Cells\nInfect one population of cells (i.e. those labeled with \"light\" amino acids) with an HCV reporter virus by incubating with virus stocks (e.g., Jc1NS5AB-mKO2-BSD, MOI 1) for 4 h at 37 °C, as described21.\n\tNOTE: Jc1NS5AB-mKO2-BSD is an HCV virus carrying a fluorescence reporter (monomeric Kusabira Orange 2, mKO2) to monitor infection rates followed by a Blasticidin Resistance Gene (BSD) between a duplicated NS5A-NS5B cleavage site, described previously21,23. Work with HCV requires BSL2+ (USA) or S3** (Germany) biosafety-level containment and practices. Instead of infection with HCV, cells can be infected with different pathogens.",
    "Expand HCV-infected \"light\" cells and noninfected \"heavy\" cells. During the passaging of the cultures, fix an aliquot with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and determine the HCV infection rates by flow cytometry of the fluorescent marker protein (e.g., mKO2), as described21; the infection rates should be higher than 90% for lipid droplet isolation. NOTE: If using the Jc1NS5AB-mKO2-BSD HCV strain, add 10 µg/mL blasticidin S to the \"light\" medium to select for HCV-positive cells.\n1 d prior to lipid droplet isolation, wash the cells with PBS, trypsinize, resuspend in \"light\" and \"heavy\" medium, and count the cells using a Neubauer counting chamber. Seed 7 x 106 cells of each population in a 150 cm2 cell culture dish. Prepare at least 5 dishes per \"light\" and \"heavy\" cell population. Culture the cells in 30 mL of medium/dish O/N.\nRemove the medium and wash the cells in 1x PBS. Detach the cells in 1x PBS using a cell scraper.\nCount both cell populations using a Neubauer counting chamber and pool equal cell numbers in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Pellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 160 x g and 4 °C.\nRemove the PBS and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of sucrose buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail). Transfer the cell suspension to a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer and lyse the cells with 200 strokes on ice.\n\tNOTE: Confirm complete cell lysis using trypan blue staining.\nTransfer the lysate into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube and spin down the nuclei and cell debris for 10 min at 1,000 x g and 4 °C.\nAfter centrifugation, store an aliquot of 25 µL of the post-nuclear fraction (PNS) at -20 °C as an input control.",
    "Place the rest of the PNS fraction at the bottom of centrifuge tube (11 x 60 mm) and overlay with lipid droplet wash buffer (~3 mL; 4 mL total) (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride).\nCentrifuge for 2 h at 100,000 x g and 4 °C. Harvest the floating lipid droplet fraction using a bent, blunt cannula from the top of the tube (approximately 250 - 500 µL, depending on the amount of lipid droplets). Place the lipid droplet fraction in a centrifuge tube (11 x 60 mm), overlay with lipid droplet wash buffer (~3.5 mL; 4 mL total), and repeat the centrifugation step.\nHarvest the floating lipid droplet fraction using a bent, blunt cannula from the top of the tube and transfer the lipid droplets to a new 1.5 mL microfuge tube. Add 500 µL of lipid droplet wash buffer and spin for 20 min at 21,000 x g and 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Lipid droplets appear as a white band floating on top of the buffer.\nRemove the subjacent wash buffer using a gel loading pipette tip and repeat this washing step three times.\nAfter the final removal of the washing buffer using a gel loading pipette tip, mix 5 µL of lipid droplet fractions with 10 µL of NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% NP-40, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail). Incubate the sample on ice for 1 h to inactivate the virus if working with infectious material. Determine the protein level with a detergent-compatible protein assay; at least 35 µg of protein is needed for MS-analysis.\nStore the lipid droplet fractions at -20 °C.",
    "Mix the corresponding volume of the lipid droplet fraction with 4x loading dye. Incubate on ice for 1 h to inactivate the virus if working with infectious material. Boil at 95 °C for 5 min.\nSeparate the proteins using SDS-PAGE according to the manufacturers' protocol. Transfer the gel into colloidal Coomassie staining solution. Excise all the protein bands from the gel. After tryptic in-gel digestion24, evaporate the samples and dissolve them in 0.1% formic acid. Analyze by LC-MS/MS.\n\tNOTE: Here, LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF) or on a Linear Trap Quadrupole (LTQ) orbitrap mass spectrometer. Both instruments were coupled with an ESI-source to a nano-UPLC system. Data analyses and LC-MS/MS analyses on the Q-TOF and on the orbitrap mass spectrometer were performed as described21,22. Take great care not to contaminate the sample with human keratin. Always use keratin-free pipette tips and tubes. Prepare buffers under the laminar flow hood with keratin-free chemicals. Before usage, clean all surfaces and devices with distilled water and ethanol. Always wear gloves and a lab coat.\n4. Analysis of Lipid Droplet Purity\nDilute aliquots of lipid droplet fractions 1:2 and input fractions (see step 3.9) 1:10 with NP-40 lysis buffer. Incubate the samples on ice for 1 h to inactivate the virus if working with infectious material. Determine the protein level with a detergent-compatible protein assay.\nMix equal amounts of protein with 6x sample buffer and incubate the samples on ice for 1 h to inactivate the virus if working with infectious material. Proceed with SDS-PAGE and transfer the proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane by tank blotting at 80 V for 90 min.",
    "NOTE: After blocking the membrane in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dried milk powder in TBS-T (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween20)), incubate with antibodies directed against lipid droplet markers (e.g., PLIN1, PLIN2, or PLIN3) and markers of other subcellular compartments (e.g., CALR, MnSOD, or tubulin), followed by secondary HRP-coupled antibodies. Use chemiluminescence for the detection of proteins.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
