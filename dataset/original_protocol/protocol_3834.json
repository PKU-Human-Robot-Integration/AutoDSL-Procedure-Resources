Preparation of surgical instruments and equipment\n(A) Zoom stereo microscope and warming light.\n(B) Corneal scissors, copper wire, and forceps.\nHypothermic anesthesia for neonatal mice: take P3 neonatal mice (postnatal day 3) from the mouse cage and place them in crushed ice for 2–3 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/750-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Establishment of cryoinjury in P3 neonatal mice\n(A) Hypothermic anesthesia.\n(B and C) Disinfection and fixation of neonatal mouse.\n(D–F) Make an incision on the skin and chest muscles (The intervals between lines: 0.08 cm).\n(G) Exposing the LV of the heart.\n(H) Placement of a frozen copper wire on the coronary vasculature of the LV.\n(I) White area of the injured heart.\n(J) Removal of excess blood and bubbles.\n(K and L) Suture the 3rd and 4th ribs together.\n(M and N) Close the pectoral muscle groups and skin with sutures.\n(O) Keep all the pups warm after surgery under a warming light.\nCritical: Do not perform hypothermic anesthesia for more than 5 min.\nPrepare for cryoinjury: disinfect neonatal mice with 75% medical alcohol and iodine tincture for two times and place them on a pre-cooled table; meanwhile, focus on the chest of neonatal mice by using a Zoom stereo microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nFix mouse limbs with forceps and disinfect the surgical area of neonatal mouse with iodine tincture for two times (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Make an incision (<1 cm) on the skin to expose the musculature underneath and then cut the chest muscles (incision <0.5 cm) once to expose the sternum under a Zoom stereo microscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E).\nNote: Do not cut the blood vessel of muscles during surgery.\nMake an intercostal incision (<0.5 cm) between the 3rd and 4th intercostal spaces with corneal scissors and expose the left ventricle (LV) of the heart (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and 2G).\nNote: The intercostal incision should be less than 0.5 cm.\nGently place a pre-cooled 1 mm2 blunt copper wire on the LV for 3–5 s and the area of white frostbite appears in the coronary vasculature of the LV (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H and 2I).\nNote: The 1 mm2 blunt copper wire should be placed in liquid nitrogen for at least 5 min.\nNote: The pre-cooled copper wire should be gently placed on the coronary vasculature of the LV.\nCritical: Make sure that the pre-cooled copper wire is perpendicularly attached to the surface of the neonatal heart.\nAfter cryoinjury, remove excess blood and bubbles in the chest with a medical cotton swab (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nSuture the 3rd and 4th ribs together and the pectoral muscle with 7-0 sutures (9.3 mm, 3/8c taper ends) and close the skin with 10-0 sutures (6.5 mm, 3/8c taper ends) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K–2N).\nNote: Suture the chest and muscle with 7-0 sutures in P3 and P8 neonatal mice and close the skin with 10-0 (7-0) sutures in P3 neonatal mice (5-0 sutures [13 mm, 3/8c, cutting needles] in P8 neonatal mice).\nNote: Excessive blood loss should be avoided during surgery.\nCritical: The optimal time for the entire surgical procedure is about 10–15 min.",
    "After surgery, place the injured neonatal mice on warming light for 10–20 min and then transfer them to the mouse cage containing feeding mice after finishing all the pups' surgery. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]O)\nNote: Keep the mouse cage clean and do not change the mouse cage before or after operation.\nNote: Take all the pups (the total amount of neonates is less than 10) from feeding mice and then transfer them to another mouse cage without feeding mice before surgery.\nPause Point: A pause can be taken for 5 min before performing the surgery of another neonatal mouse\nTissue processing and sectioning for Masson's trichrome staining\nTiming: 2–3 days\nHeart tissue is complicated and needs to be embedded in a correct section orientation. This step describes the processing and serial sectioning of heart tissue for Masson's trichrome staining.\nCritical: Make sure that the surface of the sectioned tissue is in cross-section orientation.\nTake heart tissue at 4 weeks after injury and place it into 4% PFA solution for 24 h at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/750-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Tissue processing and sectioning for Masson's trichrome staining\n(A) Fixation with 4% PFA.\n(B) Dehydration of tissue with 30% sucrose.\n(C) Embedding tissue with OCT.\n(D) Serial frozen sectioning.\nNote: Inject pre-cooled 1× PBS into the right ventricle of the heart (next to the right ventricular apex) to wash the heart before taking heart tissue.\nAfter fixing the heart tissue, wash the tissue with pre-cooled 30% sucrose once and place it into pre-cooled 30% sucrose solution for 24–48 h at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The heart tissue should be located at the bottom of the tube, if the dehydration is sufficient.\nPerfuse heart tissue with OCT compound and then fix the heart tissue with OCT on a freezing microtome (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C)",
    "After finishing step 13, place the fixed heart tissue into pre-cooled 12-well plate containing 4 mL OCT. Embed the tissue with OCT at −80°C until adequate fixation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: The 12-well plate containing OCT should be pre-cooled at −20°C.\nFix the perfused heart tissue with OCT on the sample plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: Sample component temperature: −20°C, working platform: −15°C\nPerform serial sectioning to perfused heart tissue with OCT (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: Make 6 or 10 μm frozen sections prior to staining.\nPause Point: The slides of frozen sections can be stored at −20°C for 1–3 months\nMasson's trichrome staining for injured heart\nTiming: 1 day\nCritical: Make sure that all solutions are freshly prepared.\nPerform Masson's trichrome staining to P3 and P8 heart tissue (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_750_2.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/750-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Masson's trichrome staining for injured heart\n(A) Masson's trichrome staining for P3 and P8 injured heart tissue (Scale bar: 2000 μm).\n(B) Quantification of fibrosis coverage (%) of P3 and P8 injured heart. Experimental data are presented as the mean ± SEM of biological replicates (n = 3 per group) and independent experiments (n = 2). The statistical significance between groups was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test. The statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. ∗∗∗p < 0.001.\nNote: All reagents are obtained from Masson's trichrome staining kit unless otherwise noted.\nNote: Weigert's Iron Hematoxylin working solution is mixed Weigert's Iron Hematoxylin A and Weigert's Iron Hematoxylin B at a 1:1 ratio before performing Masson's trichrome staining.\nMount with neutral resin and glass coverslips.\nCalculate the fibrosis coverage (%) of the injured heart (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nNote: Quantification of fibrosis coverage (%):100 × scar area/total area"
