    "Yeast transformation Transformation was performed using the lithium acetate method (Gietz et al., 1992).   Inoculate 5 ml YPD medium in a 16.5 x 105 mm test tube with a single colony of S. cerevisiae strain IMFD-72ZsD.   Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 150 opm. Note: Shaking incubator (TAITEC, model: BR-43FL).   Transfer 2 ml of the cell culture to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.   Remove the supernatant and wash the cells with 1 ml sterilized dH2O.   Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.   Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1.5 ml of TE/LiAc solution.   Aliquot 100 μl of yeast suspension to a fresh 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.   Add 500 ng of plasmid DNA (pGK421-SSTR5, -SSTR2 or -NTSR1) and 20 μg of carrier DNA to each tube. Note: Before using the carrier DNA, denature it at 95 °C for 5 min, and then chill it quickly on ice.   Add 600 μl of LiAc/PEG solution to each tube and vortex at high speed for 10 sec to mix.   Incubate the cell suspension at 30 °C for 30 min.   Add 70 μl of DMSO. Mix well by gentle inversion. Do not vortex.   Heat shock at 42 °C for 15 min.   Centrifuge the cell suspension at 14,000 rpm for 5 sec at room temperature. Remove the supernatant completely.   Resuspend the cells in 0.5 ml of 1x TE buffer.   Spread 100 μl of cell suspension on each SD selective agar plate. Note: Since the yeast strain has his3Δ leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ alleles and the plasmid has MET15 as a selection marker, the selective medium requires supplementation with histidine, leucine and uracil.",
    "Incubate the plates at 30 °C until colonies appear (generally, 2-4 days).      GPCR signaling assay   Inoculate 5 ml SD selective medium in a 16.5 x 105 mm test tube with a single colony of a positive transformant.   Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 150 opm. Note: Shaking incubator (TAITEC, model: BR-43FL).    Measure the OD600 of the yeast cultures. Note: Spectrophotometer.   Transfer the cultured cells into 5 ml of fresh SD selective medium in a 10-ml conical flask to give an initial OD600 of 0.03.   Further incubate the culture at 30 °C for 18 h with rotary shaking at 150 rpm. Note: Shaking incubator (TAITEC, model: BR-43FL).   Transfer 2 ml of the cell culture to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.   Remove the supernatant and wash the cells with 1 ml sterilized dH2O.   Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.   Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in ~400 μl sterilized dH2O.   Measure the OD600 of the cell suspension, and then dilute it to an OD600 of 10. Note: Spectrophotometer.   Add 10 μl of the resulting cell suspension (to give an OD600 of 1) to 80 μl fresh SDM71 selective medium per well of a 96-well cluster dish.   Add 10 μl of 10-times concentrated ligands (SST or NTS) or sterilized dH2O (no ligand control) to each well. Note: A final concentration of ~10 μM ligand is recommended (dissolved in and diluted with sterilized dH2O).   Seal the 96-well cluster dish with sealing tape.   Incubate the dish at 30 °C for 4 h with shaking at 150 rpm. After incubation, measure green fluorescence using a flow cytometer or fluorescence microscope (see below). Note: Shaking incubator (TAITEC, model: M∙BR-022UP).",
    "Flow cytometry analysis   Dilute the cell culture in 1 ml sheath fluid in test tubes with 2-position caps.   Measure the green fluorescence signal emitted from 10,000 cells using a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer equipped with a 530/30 nm band-pass filter.   Analyze the data and assess the mean ZsGreen fluorescence of 10,000 cells using BD FACSDiva software.    Fluorescence microscopy imaging   Transfer the cell culture to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.   Remove the supernatant and wash the cells with 100 μl sterilized dH2O.   Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.   Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 μl sterilized dH2O.   Spot 7 μl of the cell suspension on a glass slide and mount a coverslip over the spot.   Observe the cells using a BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope equipped with a 100x objective lens or equivalent and acquire green fluorescence images with a 470/40 band-pass filter for excitation and a 535/50 band-pass filter for emission.  Note: The 100x objective lens should be immersed in oil."
