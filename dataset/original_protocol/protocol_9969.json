Permeabilize with 2 mL of 0.5% nonionic surfactant (i.e., Triton X-100) for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the nonionic surfactant and wash the microspheres with DPBS. Stain them with 2 mL of tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) phalloidin for 30 min in darkness at RT.\nDiscard the TRITC and wash the microspheres with DPBS.
