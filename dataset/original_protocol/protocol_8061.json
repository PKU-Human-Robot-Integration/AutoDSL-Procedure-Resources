    "The study was approved by the Ethics Committee Review Board of Peking University Third Hospital and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Settings\nNOTE: The icVEP hardware necessitates a reexamination of stimulus conditions for favoring the M-ON pathway using a standard video card with an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter per electron gun.\nClick the Test CFG button and select icvep-bc-8.cfg.\nClick the System button, select Configuration → Test Configuration and then click the Edit Stimulus button. Please ensure that the frame rate is 60 Hz, luminance of the display's static background is 51 cd/m2, and total cycles are 20.\nTo differentiate OAG patients and control subjects, ensure the following conditions: sinusoidal temporal signals of 10 Hz (6 frames per cycle) and 15% positive-contrast (bright, Contrast 7.50%, Luminance Offset 7.50%, Contrast Offset 0.00%).\n2. Examination\nSelect the Eye to Test and ensure that the spatial pattern is a 24 x 24 array of isolated-checks to subtend a 11° visual field, with a 2 x 2 array fixation cross without sinusoidal temporal signals, in order to cue facilitated and careful fixation on the center of the screen (Figure 2)9.\nPlace the gold cup electrodes filled with electrolytic water-soluble paste at the following midline sites on the scalp based on the international 10-20 system (Figure 3)24. Ensure that the testing distance is 114 cm.\nClick the Start Test button. One run last for 2 s: the first second of this period presents half of the test contrast level (7.50%) as an adaptation condition, and the following second presents the full test contrast (15.0%).\nNote the prompt Error:Outlier from the program and repeat the run when noise is detected and when the electroencephalography (EEG) epoch is rejected.",
    "Note the EEG data that is displayed on the operator's monitor when the run is determined to be valid and when the operator is prompted to click Stop Test button in order to reject the data based on reliability.\n3. Automatic data processing using software\nNOTE: The data is calculated by a discrete Fourier transform after EEG signals are recorded.\nNote that once the data is accepted, the program will instruct the operator by a Ding sound and automatically initiate the next run until a set of 8 valid runs are accumulated.\nNote that each run produces a fundamental frequency component (FFC), and if one of the FFCs is an outlier relative to the remaining 7, the program will discard that FFC and will prompt the operator to repeat the run until 8 qualified runs are collected.\nWait for the program to calculate the mean FFC and radius of a 95% confidence circle using the T2circ statistic25 that is automatically produced from the 8 FFCs within a few seconds.\nEnsure that the individual and mean FFC values, confidence circle, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are automatically displayed on the monitor within less than 1 min after the end of the test (Figure 4A).\n4. Flowchart for assessing reliability of results\nEnsure that the refractive error is corrected to adapt for a distance of 114 cm.\nEnsure that intraocular pressure (IOP) is ≤ 30 mmHg on the day of examination.\nEnsure that pupil diameters are ≥ 2 mm and without mydriasis.\nEnsure that each subject rest and is quiet ≥ 30 min before examination.\nTo avoid the influence of a study curve, first check the right eye, then left eye; then, check the right and left eyes again, and record this second result.",
    "Initiate a retest after at least a 30 min rest when the R-value (nosing ring radius) between both eyes shows a difference of > 0.2, which means the result is unreliable as mood swings."
