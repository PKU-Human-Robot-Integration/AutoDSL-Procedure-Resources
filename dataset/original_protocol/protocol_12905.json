    "1. Starvation plate preparation\nWeigh out 1.5 g of agarose into a 250 mL glass beaker.\nAdd 100 mL of distilled H2O to the beaker.\nMicrowave intermittently until agarose is fully molten.\n\tNOTE: Observe the beaker since the agarose is prone to boiling over.\nPour the molten agarose into a reagent trough and dispense 80 µL of molten agarose into each well of a 96-well microplate using a multichannel pipette. Allow plates to cure while covered at room temperature. Refrigerate the leftover agarose for up to a week in a sealed bag and re-melt it for making additional plates.\n2. Fly sorting and starvation\nPrepare couplers by inserting barrier strips into the barrier strip channels. If barrier strips are too loose, coil them around the finger to give them curvature to hold them in the channels.\nAffix the coupler to a starvation plate. Do not use the coupler to manipulate the plate since the coupler may slip off. Ensure that the couplers are correctly oriented (i.e., ensure the angled corner of the coupler matches the angled corner of the microplate).\nUnder CO2 anesthesia (Table of Materials), sort 3-5-day old flies. Load individual flies by column into the starvation plate.\n\tNOTE: Although flies are loaded by column, it is recommended to distribute groups of samples down rows of the plate rather than down columns (see Figure 4 for plate layout example).\nClose each column as it fills by adjusting its barrier strip to the closed position.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62771/62771fig04.jpg",
    "Figure 4: Representative Starvation Plate Layout. The diagram shows the organization of evaporation controls and male and female flies in a 96-well plate used in this study. Alternative configurations, including alternating rows of males and females with evaporation controls in rows A and H, can also be used.

Once the starvation plate is filled, allow the flies to recover spontaneously after removing the CO2 and starve them for 6 h starting from their initial anesthetization time.\n3. Liquid food preparation\nNOTE: Make liquid food fresh every day.\nPrepare a 10 mg/mL of dye stock solution of FD&C Blue #1 in distilled H2O.\n\tNOTE: This may be stored at room temperature for up to 6 months.\nPrepare 10 mL of liquid food (4% sucrose, 1% yeast extract, 40 µg/mL of FD&C Blue #1) in a 15 mL conical tube by dissolving 0.4 g of sucrose and 0.1 g of yeast extract in 10 mL of distilled H2O. Vortex the tube until the solids fully dissolve. Add 40 µL of dye stock solution and invert the tube repeatedly to homogenize the solution.\nTransfer the liquid food into a 10 mL syringe tipped with a 0.45 µm filter. Filter ~1.5 mL of the solution at a time into a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. Set aside the syringe containing the solution and filter the additional solution as needed during feeder plate preparation.\n4. Feeder plate preparation\nNOTE: Handle the feeder plates gently after filling to prevent the formation of bubbles or droplets in the well that could influence the absorbance readings.",
    "Prepare a feeder plate by sealing the bottom of a 1536-well microplate with a sealing film. Use a sealing paddle to adhere to the film thoroughly. Trim excess film off the left and right edges with a razor blade.\nDispense 10 µL of the filtered liquid food column-wise (see Figure 5 for illustration) into the appropriate wells of the 1536-well microplate. Dispense into the upper-left-hand well for each cluster of four wells (see Figure 5 for illustration).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62771/62771fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Fill order and well location for the 1536-well feeder plate. The diagram illustrates step 4.2 of the protocol. Arrows show the order in which the feeding solution is introduced in the feeder plate one column at a time from column 1 through 12. Sample B1 is magnified to show an example of the location of feeding solutions for 1-choice and 2-choice assays. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62771/62771fig05large.jpg]\nOnce all the wells are filled, apply a sealing film to the top of the plate. Use a sealing paddle to adhere to the film thoroughly. Trim excess film off the left and right edges with a razor blade. Repeat for the desired number of plates.\nCentrifuge the plates at 200 x g for 10 s to settle the fluid. Do not allow the plate to be chilled since this can cause condensation to build up in the wells, obscuring absorbance readings.\n5. Exposure",
    "Once the flies are ready for the consumption assay, perforate the wells on the top surface of the plate with the needle probe tool equipped with a 0.25 mm diameter needle. Use the same order to perforate as was used when dispensing the solutions. Flip the plate and perforate the wells on the bottom. Wipe off the needle between solutions to prevent cross-contamination. Be careful not to touch the perforations as this wicks the solution from the wells.\nRead the plate's absorbance at 630 nm without a lid.\nPlace an internal lid on the top sealing film to ensure that the condensation rings encircle the perforated wells. Place the external lid on the plate.\nPlace the feeder plate face-up on the coupler such that the guides align the appropriate holes of the feeder plate and starvation plate. Ensure that the coupler and plates are correctly oriented (i.e., ensure the angled corner of the coupler and the plates match). Wrap elastic bands around the top and bottom plates to hold the coupler together. Check for alignment and gaps between the feeder plate and coupler.\nOnce all the feeder plates are loaded onto the couplers, open the wells for the plates by adjusting the barrier strips on the coupler. Place the coupler/plate assemblies in the secondary container. Each secondary container can accommodate up to six assemblies.\nPlace the lower half of a pipette box containing soaked paper towels into each secondary container to provide humidity. Close the lid of the secondary containers and transfer them to a controlled environment (25 °C, humidity controlled, 12 h light:dark cycles). Allow the flies to consume for 22 h.",
    "After the 22 h exposure, check each plate for dead flies and update the plate layout accordingly. After all the plates are checked, anesthetize the flies en masse by pumping CO2 inside the secondary container. After ~60 s, ensure that all the flies are immobilized. Gently tamp the flies into the starvation plate and replace the plastic barrier strips. Remove the feeder plates for reading.\nRe-read the plate's absorbance at 630 nm. Repeat until all plates have been read.\n6. Data analysis\nNOTE: Analysis can be performed with the investigator's preferred software package.\nOmit any flies that died during the 22 h exposure.\nFor each well, calculate the volume consumed as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62771/62771eq02.jpg\nC - Volume Consumed (µL)\nV - Initial Well Volume (i.e., 10 µL)\nABS0 - Pre-Exposure Absorbance\nABS1 - Post-Exposure Absorbance\n\tNOTE: Consumption is denoted as a positive volume in the calculation.\nTo account for evaporation, subtract the mean evaporation volume from fly consumption values within respective plates. For 2-choice/preference testing, adjust every well by its respective solution, e.g., adjust \"choice 1\" wells by \"choice 1\" in the evaporation controls.\nAfter adjusting for evaporation, drop any samples with a consumption value less than zero.\nFor 2-choice testing, calculate the preference for each well as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62771/62771eq03.jpg\nP - Preference Index (positive direction indicates preference)\nFA - Volume of Liquid Food Consumed Containing Additive (Choice 2)\nFN - Volume of Normal Liquid Food Consumed (Choice 1)\n7. Microplate and coupler washing protocol.\nNOTE: Take care to prevent damage to the bottoms of the microplates, as damage can affect sealing.",
    "Remove the films and labels from the 1536-well microplates. Separate the couplers and barrier strips. Place the barrier strips in a sealable container, such as a bottle. Wash the barrier strips by vigorously shaking in a series of warm tap water, mild detergent solution, warm tap water, and then distilled H2O.\nRinse 1536-well microplates and couplers under warm tap water. For microplates, run tap water through each microplate's wells to clear as much solution and debris as possible. If needed, use a pipette tip to dislodge debris; do not use metal or glass utensils on the plates.\nCover each plate and coupler with a mild detergent solution (e.g., 1% v/v Aquet). For the plates, scrub the surfaces with a gloved hand. For the couplers, use a brush.\nRinse each plate thoroughly with tap water, and then with distilled H2O. Ensure that the wells are specifically rinsed out under the water flow.\nAllow the plates and couplers to air dry covered at room temperature. Store in a clean storage bin until use.\n\tNOTE: Never handle the 1536-well microplates without gloves. Residual oils from the skin can hinder sealing, leading to well leakage and evaporation."
