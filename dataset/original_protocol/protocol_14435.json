    "The Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm, Sweden, approved the design of the investigation.\n1. Material\nRecruit relatively healthy women and men 65-80 years old who have BMI values between 20 and 30 kg·m-2. Randomize them into two groups. Ensure that the individuals in both groups have relatively low physical activity levels (i.e., moderate daily physical activity and no regular exercise training).\nExclude beta-blocker users and those with coronary artery disease and severe neurological or joint problems.\nAsk the subjects for their written consent after informing them of possible discomfort and risks in the test and training sessions.\nBalance the resistance training (RET) and control without training (CON) groups in terms of age, sex, and BMI. Ask one group to perform RET under a trainer for 1 h three times a week for eight weeks; the other group will serve as controls (CON).\n2. Testing and Training\nNote: The eight exercises are standard strength training exercises: seated leg press, seated abdominal crunch, supine chest press, seated back extension, seated shoulder press, seated rowing, seated leg extension (knee extension), and prone leg curl (knee flexion); see Figure 8 in the Representative Results section.\nDuring the first training session, assess the maximal strength at one maximal repetition (1 RM) for each training exercise.\n\tNOTE: The 1 RM model is commonly used and is defined as the load at which the subject can lift or push the resistance only once but not twice.\n\t\nBefore the start, ask the participant to perform a short warm-up (with a few initial trials at very low weight loads) of the tested exercise. Subsequently increase the load until just below the probable 1 RM value (most often the maximum of 3-4 increased loads). Register the maximal load that the subject can perform only once (= 1 RM).",
    "Measure 1 RM in the eight standard strength training exercises (see Figure 8 in the Representative Results section). Ask the subjects to rest for at least 2-3 min between each tested exercise.\n\t\tNOTE: Strength training equipment was used for all training exercises, including the tests of each training exercise.\nAsk the whole RET group to perform 1 h of supervised strength training three times a week for eight weeks. Ask the participants to perform, after warm-up, the eight abovementioned standard training exercises. They should repeat an exercise 12 times in each set and perform three sets of each exercise. Allow rest for 1 min between each set and 2-3 min between each exercise.\n\t\nAsk subjects to perform each exercise as fast as possible during the concentric phase (i.e., muscle shortening phase) and slowly during the eccentric phase (i.e., muscle elongation phase).\n\t\tNOTE: Subjects can do the exercises in any order. However, ask them to start and end with a leg exercise and also to try to perform the eight exercises in the presented order. Use strength training equipment for all eight exercises.\nDuring each training session, ask the participants to perform three sets at 75-80% of 1 RM for each exercise. Increase the load by approximately 5% the session after when a participant can do 12 repetitions in all three sets of an exercise.\n3. Submaximal Cycling Test\nNote: Perform the submaximal cycling test on test day 1 (see the Introduction and Figure 1).\nPerform a cycle ergometer test, including two submaximal levels, each for 4 min14,15. Set the first work rate to be low (30 W) and the second at 60-120 W, with no pause between the loads on the cycle ergometer.",
    "NOTE: The first load is the same for all subjects, but the second and last submaximal level should be approximately 65-85% of maximal heart rate for each subject. Both loads should be the same before and after the intervention period of 8 weeks of training.\n\t\nBase the second-highest load level on familiarization tests done before the trials by asking how physically active the person is and by having the subject initially cycle for a short while; the test leader will form an opinion based on the subject's heart rate as to what final submaximal load is appropriate.\nRecord the mean steady heart rate (HR) using a heart rate monitor via a chest belt during the last minute on the low and high work rates, by taking the mean of the observed HR at 3:15, 3:30, 3:45, and 4:00 min at each work rate.\nUse an ergo-spirometric device to ascertain the composition of gas (O2 and CO2) in the expired and inspired air. Register the respiration exchange ratio (RER; i.e., CO2/O2), and quantify the RER mean values during the last minute (from four measures every 15 s) at both work rate loads.\n4. Knee Extensor Strength: Static, Eccentric, and Concentric Peak Torque and the Rate of Force Development\nNote: Perform knee strength measurements on test day 1 (see the Introduction and Figure 1).\nBefore the recordings, ask the subject to perform a warm-up by cycling for 8-10 min on a cycle ergometer at submaximal level (i.e., approximately 65-85% of maximal heart rate).",
    "Ask the subject to sit on the bench of an isokinetic dynamometer. Fix the subject's trunk with straps over the shoulders and hips. Securely strap the subject's shank to the dynamometer shaft with two straps: one below the knee and one just above the ankle. Align the knee joint axis with the rotational center of the dynamometer shaft.\nWhen the subject is secured, assess the maximal voluntary knee strength as the peak torque, with the subject sitting in the isokinetic dynamometer. Initially allow the subject to perform several trials for familiarization with the knee strength equipment (isokinetic dynamometer).\nAsk the individual to perform four maximal voluntary eccentric and concentric knee extensions (alternately), with the right leg at a constant angular velocity of 30 deg/s. Set the range of motion between 90° and 15° (straight leg = 0°).\n\t\nIn the eccentric task, ask the subject to resist the dynamometer shaft with maximal effort through the whole movement from the 15° to 90° knee angle. In the concentric task, ask the subject to press the lower leg in the dynamometer shaft in a knee extension, as hard as possible throughout the whole motion range.\nAllow a 4-min rest after the dynamic recordings. Thereafter, assess the static maximal voluntary contraction torque (MVC) four times at a 65° knee angle. In every static trial, ask the subjects, sitting in the same dynamometer, to kick as fast and hard as they can against the dynamometer shaft, which now is fixed (at 65°) and cannot be moved.\nFor torque (strength) signals, convert the analog torque signals to digital using an analog-to-digital converter box connected to the isokinetic dynamometer.\n\tNOTE: The converter automatically changes the analog signals from the dynamometer to digital signals, which thereafter are automatically exported to the computer where the data are collected.",
    "Set the sampling frequency at 5 kHz in the software analysis program of the computer. Store the digital signals on the computer for a subsequent strength value analysis with the software analysis program.\nIn the subsequent analysis, use the highest value obtained from four trials for each subject in the eccentric, concentric and static measurements. In the software program, click on the highest value of the four trials and write down the strength value shown on the computer screen.\n\t\nRegister the highest peak torque in the eccentric and in the concentric recordings for each subject and the highest strength value among the four static trials.\n\t\tNOTE: Isokinetic dynamometer testing of knee extensor strength in a seated position has proper reliability and validity16,17.\nMeasure the rate of force (torque) development (RFD) during 0-30 ms and 0-200 ms in the highest value found among the static trials. Set the value of zero at the 7.5-Nm level for the onset of contraction for knee extensor strength (time: 0 ms)18,19. Move the cursor (in the software program for muscle strength analysis) to the \"7.5 Nm\" value on the y-scale to obtain the position for 0 ms.\n\t\nFor the pre-test assessment, set the cursor on the 30-ms value (after the time 0 ms). Write down the value showing the raise in Nm at 30 ms (i.e., the increase in Nm from 7.5 Nm = 0 ms). Do the same procedure for the post-test value.\nCalculate the increase in percentage for the post-test Nm value (numerator) compared to the pre-test Nm value (denominator) over the period of 0-30 ms. Thus, present the RFD raise in percent from the pre-test to the post-test. Do the same analyses for the time interval of 0-200 ms.\n5. Muscle Biopsy",
    "Note: Perform a muscle biopsy on test day 2 (see the Introduction and Figure 1).\nTake a muscle biopsy from the middle portion of the thigh muscle vastus lateralis using a conchotome20.\n\t\nPrior to the biopsy, inject 1-2 mL of local anesthesia subcutaneously and into the fascia. After a couple of minutes, make an incision with a small scalpel through the skin and fascia, approximately 1/3 of the distance from the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine. Extract about 100-150 mg of muscle tissue using the conchotome.\nFreeze samples for histochemistry in isopentane cooled to its freezing point in liquid nitrogen and store it at -80 °C. Store a sample of 30-50 mg of muscle tissue.\nRapidly freeze the samples for protein analysis in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C. Store a sample of 30-50 mg of muscle tissue.\n6. OGTT\nNote: Perform OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) on test day 3 (see the Introduction and Figure 1). The time between the exercise and OGTT must exceed 48 h and should be similar between the pre- and post-tests. A 2-h oral OGTT is used to investigate whether frequent blood samples during this time show normal or increased levels, indicating diabetes or prediabetes conditions.\nPerform the OGTT test in the morning on subjects who have fasted overnight and have not done any strenuous exercise on the testing day or the day before.\nTake blood samples (4 mL) from supine participants via a venous cannula in the antecubital vein 15 min before and just prior to the intake of glucose, followed by 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the ingestion of the glucose (75 g of glucose in a 250 g/L solution).",
    "Centrifuge the blood samples at 1,500 x g and 4 °C for 10 min and store the plasma at -20 °C for future analysis. Use the samples to perform standard glucose level tests (step 7).\nFor glucose, insulin, and c-peptide, calculate the area under the curve (AUC) by determining the time integral of glucose above basal glucose levels. Use the OGTT results to calculate insulin sensitivity for the whole body using the Matsuda method21, as per the equation: 10 000*√[(Glucosebasal*Insulinbasal)*(Glucosemean*Insulinmean].\n7. Blood Sample Analysis\nQuantify the glucose concentration in the venous plasma with an automated analyzer. Set the impaired glucose tolerance level at blood glucose values >7.8 mmol/L after a 2-h OGTT22.\nUse ELISA kits22 to perform a plasma analyses of insulin and c-peptide. Use a plate reader. Put the ELISA plates for both insulin and c-peptide in a plate reader (each on a separate occasion).\n\tNOTE: The plate reader measures the amount of insulin and the amount of c-peptide by measuring the samples on the plate at certain absorbances. Blood lipids TG, HDL, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B were analyzed with standard methods at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.\n8. Analysis of Muscle Samples\nImmunoblotting\n\t\nFirst, freeze-dry the muscle sample in a lyophilizer at a pressure below 10-1 mbar for 12 h. Dissect it so that it is free of blood and connective tissue using a needle and forceps under a light microscope. Store it at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: A suitable amount of muscle is between 1 and 5 mg of dry weight, but the protocol can be adjusted to less than 1 mg, all the way to single fibers. Due to the low amount of muscle tissue present in one biopsy, values from that RET participant were not used for immunoblotting.",
    "Homogenize the muscle samples with a mini bead beater in ice-cold buffer (80 µL/mg) composed of 2 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM ß-glycerophosphate, 1% TritonX-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 µg/mL leupeptin, 50 µg/mL aprotinin, 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, and 40 µg/µL PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).\n\t\t\nPlace a scoop of 0.5-mm zirconium oxide beads in each tube with the muscle. Add buffer and homogenize for 2 x 1 min at speed step 7-8 (here, the maximum is 10) and 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the homogenate for 10 min at 10,000 x g. Transfer the remaining supernatant to new tubes and discard the pellet containing the structural proteins.\nSpectrophotometrically determine the protein concentration in the supernatant with a commercially available kit using a plate reader at 660 nm23.\n\t\t\nSubsequently dilute the samples with 2x Laemmli sample buffer and homogenizing buffer (1:1) to a final protein concentration of 1.5 µg/µL. Heat them to 95 °C for 5 min to denature the proteins. Store the diluted samples at -20 °C prior to analysis.\nFor Native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), load 30 µg of protein from each sample into 18-well precast gradient gels (4-20% acrylamide) and perform electrophoresis at 300 V for 30 min on ice.\nEquilibrate the gel in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, and 10% methanol) for 30 min at 4 °C. Transfer proteins to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes with 0.2-µm pore sizes at a constant current of 300 mA for 3 h at 4 °C.\nTo confirm equal loading and transfer, stain the membranes with a total protein stain24. For each target protein, load all samples from each subject onto the same gel and run all gels at the same time.",
    "Block the membrane for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris-base, 192 mM NaCl; TBS; pH 7.6) containing 5% non-fat milk.\nIncubate the membranes over night with primary antibodies (see the Materials List) diluted in TBS containing 2.5% non-fat milk and supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-TM).\nFollowing primary antibody incubation, wash the membranes (2 x 1 min plus 3 x 5 min) with TBS-TM and incubate with secondary antibodies (see the Materials List) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Wash again with TBS-TM (2 x 1 min and 3 x 10 min) and again subject them to four additional 5-min washes with TBS.\nApply 6-12 mL of chemiluminescent substrate to the membrane for 5 min. Place the membrane between two transparent plastic sheets. Place the membranes in front of a CCD camera blocking external light. Take serial exposures using a chemiluminescent camera filter.\n\t\t\nUse the software program to acquire 10 exposures for 2 min, or until the signals are saturated. Use a standard setup, both for the optical filter settings to acquire chemiluminescence, as well as for the lens settings.\nUse the highest exposure that does not lead to saturation and mark the contours of the band. Quantify the bands as the intensity x mm2 using the same software. Subtract the background noise from the band intensity. Present the results relative to the total protein stain and express it as the percent change as compared to baseline.\nHistochemistry\n\tNOTE: The histochemistry technique below is based on methods described in an earlier publication25.\n\t\nFor histochemistry, cut serial cross sections (10 µm) at -20 °C using a cryostat. Mount the cross-sections on glass slides stored in a glass cuvette and air dry the biopsy slices at room temperature.",
    "Prepare buffer solutions for each pH level for pre-incubation at pH 4.3, 4.6, and 10.3 for ATPase staining26. To visualize capillaries, stain the cross-sections using the amylase-PAS method27.\nCalibrate a pH-meter by pouring calibration solutions into labeled calibration beakers. Push the appropriate button to select the pH from the main menu.\n\t\t\nRinse the probe with deionized water and place the probe in the first calibration beaker. Make sure that there are no air bubbles in the membrane. Measure the first calibration solution and then present the next calibration solution (the display will ask for the next solution).\nRinse the probe with deionized water and then place it in the second calibration beaker. Make sure that there are no air bubbles in the membrane. Measure a second calibration solution and proceed to the next calibration solution.\nRinse the probe with deionized water and place it in a third calibration beaker. Make sure there are no air bubbles in the membrane. Measure the third calibration solution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: When the calibration is good, the display will briefly show, \"3rd Buffer OK\" and will then return to the main menu.\nUse the buffers as follows for ATPase staining.\n\t\t\nTo prepare a solution at pH 10.3, use two different solutions: (A) 4.506 g of glycine, 4.8 g of CaCl2, 3.51 g of NaCl, and 600 mL of dH2O and (B) 2.176 g of NaOH and 540 mL of dH2O. Store the solutions in a cold room or a refrigerator. Use them within one month.",
    "To prepare solutions at pH 4.3 and 4.6, perform \"acid preincubation.\" Prepare the acid for preincubation using: 6.47 g of Na acetate, 3.7 g of KCl, and 500 mL of dH2O. Thereafter, prepare 1% CaCl2 solution by dissolving 2.5 g of it into 250 mL of dH2O. Prepare 2% CoCl2 solution by dissolving 5 g of it into 250 mL of dH2O.\nStore and use these solutions as mentioned above. Finally, prepare 0.2% ammonium sulphide by mixing 800 µL of 20% (NH4)2S into 40 mL of dH2O. Prepare the latter freshly.\nPrepare solutions at certain pH values as follows. After the calibration of the pH-meter, remove the cuvettes and calcium and cobalt chlorides from refrigerator and allow them to warm to room temperature before staining.\n\t\t\nFor pH 10.3, add around 25 mL of solution A to a small (approximately 70 mL) glass beaker. Measure the pH. Keep adding solution B until the required pH of 10.37 is reached. If the staining is too dark, increase the pH. If it is too bright, reduce the pH.\nFor pH 4.6, add around 25 mL of \"acid preincubation\" to a small glass beaker. Measure the pH. Reduce the pH using 5 M acetic acid. If the image of the stain is too dark, try to lighten with increased pH. If it is too bright, darken with a decreased pH. If staining does not help, try another pH: 4.8 instead of 4.6.\nFor pH 4.3, do the same as for 4.6, but add more acetic acid. Decrease the pH if the stain is too bright, and increase the pH if it is too dark for the fibers to be specified.",
    "Prepare ATP solution as follows. Weigh 0.017 g of ATP per cuvette (10 mL), so 0.051 g per 3 cuvettes or 0.068 g for 4 cuvettes. Take 30 mL (for 3 cuvettes, 10 mL/cuvette) of solution at pH 10.3 (use a cylinder scale glass) and put it into a glass beaker with weighed ATP.\n\t\t\t\nMix thoroughly and measure the pH. Reduce the pH using concentrated HCl until the pH reaches exactly 9.40.\nFor incubation at various pH values, do the following. Place 10.3 solution into one cuvette and incubate it in a water bath at 37 °C for 9 min. Place 4.3 solution into another cuvette and incubate it at room temperature for 5 min. Place 4.6 solution into the last cuvette and incubate at RT for 1 min.\nFollowing the preferred pH incubation procedure, apply the contents of each cuvette as follows. Wash 15 times with dH2O. Add ATP solution (0.170 g of ATP/100 mL of H2O) to the biopsy sample. Incubate in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. Wash 15 times with dH2O.\nAdd CaCl2 solution (1 g of CaCl2/100 mL of H2O) to the biopsy sample in the cuvettes. Incubate at RT for 3 min. Wash 15 times with dH2O. Add CoCl2 solution (2 g of CoCl2/100 mL of H2O) to the biopsy sample in the cuvettes. Incubate at RT for 3 min. Wash 15 times with dH2O.\nPut it in (NH4)2S solution for 30 s and wash quickly 15 times under the fume hood. Glue the biopsy slices onto slide glass. To avoid bubbles, squeeze the biopsies, but not too hard.\nSelect one region of the cross-section without artifacts or longitudinal cuts of the fiber. Analyze under a light microscope using software.",
    "Assess the cross-sectional area (CSA), capillaries, and classification of fiber type (i.e., type-I, IIA, or IIX) via computer image analysis from a mean of at least 150-200 fibers per biopsy. From a microscope picture of muscle fibers in the cross-sections ensure that the three types of muscle fibers (i.e., type-I, IIA, and IIX) have various shades of white to gray to black, depending on the pH staining (i.e., 4.34, 4.65 and 10.37).\nStart by marking some type-I fibers. Thereafter, the program will automatically register the other type-I fibers. Check that all type-I fibers are marked correctly. To mark a certain fiber, click the \"Vector\" button. Use the cursor to measure the area for each individually selected muscle fiber.\nAfter the analysis of type-I fibers, continue the same procedure for type-IIA and type-IIX. The average ± SEM for each type of muscle fiber (i.e., type I, IIA, and IIX) should be calculated regarding amount of fiber and the CSA for the RET and CON groups.\n\t\tNote: The cross-sectional area (CSA), capillaries, and classification of fiber type (i.e., type I, IIA and IIx) were assessed from a mean of 163 ± 9 fibers per biopsy.\nSubscription Required.
