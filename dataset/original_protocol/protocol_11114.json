    "For this protocol, the accreditation number related to the use of human materials is DC-2020-4203.\n1. Microfluidic device fabrication, preparation and treatment\nFabricate SU-8 molds using conventional photolithography techniques18.\n\tNOTE: For this purpose, two photolithography masks have been designed to construct two layers of photoresist structures on silicon wafer substrate and a thin SU-8 2005 photoresist layer (3.2 µm high and 6 ± 1 µm wide) that defines asymmetric microgrooves under the patterning of main channels made in SU-8 2100 (200 µm high, 1 mm wide, and 13 mm long) (see Supplemental Figure S1).\nActivate the wafer by using a plasma cleaner (5.00e-1 torr, high radio frequency (RF) level) for 1 min and silanize it using 1 mL of (trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane in an aluminum folder into a desiccator for 30 min.\nPrepare a 10:1 ratio of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), mix the prepolymer with catalyst, pass it in a vacuum desiccator to remove trapped bubbles, and cast it slowly onto the mold before being cured in an oven at 80 °C for 40 min.\nCut it after that using a razor at the desired size before peeling off the mold. Punch out the inlet and the outlet zones to obtain 3 mm wide holes, clean the PDMS, and protect it using adhesive tape.\n\tNOTE: The thickness of the final PDMS device is approximately 5 mm.\nTreat the device using a plasma cleaner (5.00e-1 torr, High RF level during 1 min), assemble it with a polystyrene Petri dish, and expose the vacuum under UV light for 30 min.\nFill with a pipette the inlet of the microfluidic device before usage with 70% ethanol and empty it by pipetting aspiration.\nWash the microfluidic device by adding inlet reservoirs Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (D-PBS) and empty it by pipetting aspiration three consecutive times.",
    "Coat the device using 0.05 mg/mL Poly-D-Lysine and place it into an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). After 24 h, rinse the device by adding into the inlet reservoir the neurobasal medium and empty it by pipetting aspiration three consecutive times.\nFill the microfluidic chip with the cell culture medium and let it remain at room temperature until use for a maximum of 2 h.\n2. Cell preparation and seeding in the microfluidic device\nCulture, seeding, and immunofluorescent characterization of human hiPS-derived cortical glutamatergic neurons\n\tNOTE: Carry out experiments with commercialized hiPS-derived cortical glutamatergic neurons (Figure 1A). Preserve human-derived materials and handle them with the approval and under the guidelines of legislation.\n\t\nEmpty the inlet and outlet reservoirs of the microfluidic device by pipette aspiration before seeding, letting only the device's channels to be filled with medium.\nSeed the hiPS cells at Day 0 (D0) by putting 10 µL of a 6.5 x 106 hiPS cells/mL suspension (e.g., 900 cell/mm2 concentration) with the medium, whose composition is given in Table 1, and let the device be under the hood (at room temperature) for 15 min to allow cells to attach.\nAfter 15 min, fill both inlet and outlet reservoirs with 50 µL of D4 culture medium, whose entire composition is given in Table 1, and transfer the device into the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nMaintain glutamatergic neuron differentiation for 23 days (Figure 1A(1), microscopy) under a controlled environment (37 °C, 5% CO2) and with a specific cell culture medium, whose composition is described in Table 1. Replace the medium regularly as detailed in the next step 5. just below and follow the steps as in Figure 1B.",
    "Replace the medium every 3 to 4 days following Table 1 composition. Use seeding medium until D4, D4 medium until D7, D7 medium until D11, and D11 medium for the remaining time of the culture.\nTake microscopic pictures at D4, D21, and D23 using a standard phase-contrast microscope to assess cell viability and allow cell counting.\nFor characterization, fix the differentiated glutamatergic neurons in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at room temperature after medium aspiration and follow the protocol for immunofluorescence staining.\nWash cells three times with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) and permeabilize them for 10 min with 0.1% Triton-X followed by 30 min with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). Add primary antibodies and incubate the device overnight at 4 °C.\nRinse the cells three times with PBS and incubate further with the corresponding secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Immunofluorescent antibodies used in the study are listed in Table 2.\nRinse the cells three times with PBS and counterstain with DAPI (4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole) for 10 min at room temperature.\nAcquire images with an inverted epifluorescence microscope fitted with a CMOS (Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) camera and analyze using appropriate image analysis software.\nOpen the DAPI stained images and binarize with the thresholding routine in the software. To do this, click on Image > Adjust > Threshold, and set the appropriate parameters to distinguish the nucleus from the background. Then, click on Apply > Process > Watershed to split the aggregate nucleus.\nAfter that, use the Analyze Particles innate software's function to interpret the binary images. To do this, click on Analyze and then on Analyze Particles and set the appropriate parameters after this: size and circularity filter (exclude from analysis objects smaller than 7 µm, bigger than 20 µm, or with a circularity smaller than 0.1 µm).",
    "Merge the contour images obtained from DAPI analysis to correspondent immunofluorescent pictures to validate the correct staining.\nFinally, save the associated data (number of objects, mean area, % of coverage, etc.) for the different biomarkers and quantify the expression at D4 and/or D21 using appropriate quantification software.\nCell culture of commercialized pHGG line, UW479, and patient-derived cell line, BT353\nCulture both cell lines in DMEM/F-12 GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in a cell culture flask. Wait for 80% confluence of each cell line as presented in Figure 1C.\nMaintain these pHGG cells under a controlled environment at 37 °C in normoxic conditions throughout the experiments.\n3. Co-culture protocol\nAdjust the seeding day and concentration for UW479 and BT35 cell lines to reach 80% of confluent cells when co-culture should start, corresponding to 21 days of culture for glutamatergic neurons.\nTrypsinize UW479 and BT35 cells and seed them on the top of glutamatergic neurons in each dedicated microfluidic device (with a target density of 900 cell/mm2 for each cell type) before seeding the pHGG cells into the microfluidic device containing matured glutamatergic neurons.\nMaintain the co-cultures for 2 days under a controlled environment (37 °C, 5% CO2) with glutamatergic neuron D11 and onward medium detailed in Table 1.\nCount pHGG cells using the microscopic pictures analyzed with an image analysis software to assess their viability. Calculate the percentage of cells.\n\t​NOTE: Use the following formula: 100 - ((number of cells at D23 / number of cells at D21) x 100).\n4. Electrophysiological recording\nPerform the electrophysiological recording with a commercial system and commercially available software.\n\tNOTE: The experiments were carried out with a MEA that consisted of 30 µm diameter electrodes spaced by 100 µm.",
    "Perform a first electrophysiological recording on glutamatergic neurons at D21 before seeding of pHGG cells. Use the differentiated glutamatergic neurons as control and culture them alone in parallel to the co-culture. Do a second recording for both conditions as described in the next step numbered 3.\nPerform a second electrophysiological recording at D23 (after 2 days of co-culture).\n5. Electrophysiological data processing\nFilter the raw data with a 2nd order Band-pass Butterworth filter (with passband frequencies of 100 Hz and 2500 Hz).\nFor spike detection, compute the root mean square of the signal over the 10 min recording for each electrode and set an amplitude threshold corresponding to eight times this root mean's square value.\nApply a PTSD (Precision Timing Spike Detection25) algorithm, considering a maximum duration of 2 ms for one action potential.\nConsider as an active electrode, each electrode detecting at least 5 spikes/min. Continue the assay if at least 10% of the recording electrodes are active.\nDivide the number of detected spikes by the time-period of recording to calculate the mean firing rate of each active electrode. Calculate an average mean firing rate for each independent experiment. Ultimately, calculate an average by condition (±SEM) and express it as a function on the day of recording.\nCompute a raster plot for each experiment representing the events detected for each active electrode as a function of time. Then, calculate the temporal array-wide firing rates (or instantaneous firing rates) of all the active electrodes, allowing to monitor synchronicity of the neural network activity.\nFinally, generate bar graphs using the quantification software and perform comparisons using Kruskal Wallis tests.\nSubscription Required.
