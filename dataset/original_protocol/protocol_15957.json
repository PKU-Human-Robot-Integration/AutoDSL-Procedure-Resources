    "The human DC family currently comprises five principal populations: pDC, cDC1, AS-DC, DC2, and DC3. Many commercial tools developed to isolate DC were designed before the discovery of certain DC subsets and the proprietary cocktail of negative selection antibodies overlaps with the newly identified DC subsets: DC3 expresses CD14 and AS-DC express CD5 or CD2. This protocol provides instructions for the enrichment of all known circulating human DC subsets and other mononuclear phagocytes from peripheral blood using the commercially available RosetteSep HLA Myeloid Cell Enrichment Kit from Stemcell Technologies. Following density centrifugation with Ficoll, erythrocytes, and granulocytes pass through the Ficoll layer due to their higher density and form a large pellet at the bottom of the tube. RosetteSep removes the lymphoid fractions of leucocytes by crosslinking these unwanted cells to erythrocytes, resulting in the formation of a compact rosette leucocyte-erythrocyte complex that also passes through the Ficoll layer. The purified HLA+ myeloid cells are highly enriched at the interface between the plasma and the Ficoll media for downstream analysis.\nMaterials\nFresh blood obtained from healthy volunteers\nRosetteSep HLA Myeloid Cell Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 15272HLA)\nDulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), Ca2+- and Mg2+-free (Sartorius, cat. no. 02-023-1A)\nFicoll Paque Plus density gradient media (Cytiva)\nFACS buffer (see recipe)\n0.5% Trypan Blue (Sartorius, cat. no. 03-102-1B)\nAntibodies for flow cytometry analysis (see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.873#cpz1873-tbl-0002])\nHuman TruStain FcX (BioLegend)\nBrilliant stain buffer (BD Biosciences, cat. no.

In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and following institutional research board approval, blood is drawn from the median cubital vein of a human donor using a 21G butterfly needle and aseptic technique. Collect the blood in lithium heparin- or EDTA-treated vacutainers. Invert the tubes five times immediately after obtaining the blood.\nPerform blood draws at the same time each day to avoid circadian differences.\nIt is possible to collect between 5 and 90 ml per donor routinely. This may be adjusted depending on your experimental requirements and IRB approval.\n2. Transfer the blood to a 15- or 50-ml centrifuge tube, depending on the volume collected.\nHLA Myeloid cells enrichment\n3. Add 12.5 μl of RosetteSep HLA Myeloid Cell Enrichment solution for every 1 ml of blood collected.\n4. Incubate the blood at room temperature (∼20°C) for 20 min on a rotator.\n5. Remove the tube from the rotator and dilute the blood 1:1 with sterile PBS.\n6. For density centrifugation, prepare a 50-ml tube with 15 ml Ficoll.\n7. Carefully add 20 ml of the diluted blood dropwise over the Ficoll layer, avoiding mixing. If using an electronic pipette, ensure the flow is set to gravity. Centrifuge for 20 min at 950 × g and 20°C, with no brake and the lowest acceleration setting.",
    "For smaller volumes, use a 15-ml centrifuge tube and add 6 ml Ficoll with 6 ml diluted blood or a layer ratio of 1:1 at a chosen volume.\nFollowing centrifugation, ensure that the interphase layer between the Ficoll and diluted blood layers remains distinct and undisturbed as you cautiously remove the tubes from the centrifuge.\n8. Carefully remove the interphase layer via pipette. This layer contains the enriched HLA+ PBMCs. Transfer the cells to a sterile 50-ml centrifuge tube using a sterile Pasteur pipette. Dilute the cells in a large volume of FACS buffer, three times the original volume, to dilute any residual Ficoll, and invert the tube once before washing the cells.\n9. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 400 × g and 4°C (now with the brake and acceleration on maximum). Discard the supernatant.\nCells counting\n10. Resuspend the enriched HLA+ cell pellet in 10 ml FACS buffer. Ensure the cells are fully resuspended and kept on ice for the remainder of the protocol.\n11. In a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube or U-bottom 96-well plate, add 10 μl of the resuspended cells and 10 μl Trypan Blue (0.5% Solution). Ensure the cells are properly mixed by pipetting up and down several times without introducing bubbles.\n12. Remove 10 µl of the stained cell solution and place it in the cell counting chamber slide. Insert the slide into the Countess II automated cell counter to enumerate cells per ml sample.\nAlternatively, perform a conventional cell count using a hemocytometer and light microscope.\nAnticipate retrieving between 5 and 7 × 105 cells per ml of blood.\nAntibodies staining\n13. Wash the leucocyte fraction by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 × g and 4°C, then discard the supernatant.",
    "14. Resuspend the cell pellet in 50 µl FACS buffer plus 5 µl Fc Receptor Blocking Human TruStain FcX per 1 × 107 cells for 10 min.\n15. Add the appropriate antibodies. A cocktail of CD3, CD19, CD20 CD66b, and CD314 lineage markers plus HLA-DR helps discriminate mononuclear phagocytes from lineage-positive cells. A cocktail of CD88, CD89, CD14, CD16, CD45RA, CD123, CD5, AXL, CD11c, CD141, CD1c, FceR1a, and CD163 helps define mononuclear phagocytes (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.873#cpz1873-tbl-0002] and Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.873#cpz1873-fig-0001]). Add 50 µl Brilliant stain buffer to prevent cross-reactivity of Brilliant fluorescent polymer dyes. Mix well and incubate for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nBrilliant stain buffer should be added whenever two or more BD Horizon Brilliant stains are used. This will eliminate dye interactions that would result in artifacts.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6df2d9bd-fcf2-4fc6-8b3d-c7a3c4a3d337/cpz1873-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFIGURE 1\nFlow cytometry-based identification of human DC subsets. Peripheral blood DC cells were identified as Lin- HLA-DR+ CD88- and CD89-. The DC subsets consist of pDC (CD123+ AXL-) and AS-DC (CD123+ CD5+ Axl+). Mature cDC could be identified as CD123- CD11c+, with cDC1 also being CD141+, while cDC2 expressed CD1c+ and was subdivided into DC2 CD5+ and DC3 CD5- for three populations differentiated by expression of CD163 and CD14. (A) PBMCs stained following Ficoll density centrifugation. (B) Cells were processed using the Whole blood RosetteSep HLA Myeloid Cell Enrichment kit, yielding significant enrichment of the Lin- HLA-DR+ population. (C) Pan-DC Enrichment kit enriches the CD88- CD89+ population, but note the absence of CD14+ DC3 compared to the other two processes in red.\n16. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml and wash twice with FACS buffer by centrifuging for 5 min at 400 × g and 4°C. Remove the supernatant.",
    "17. Resuspend the cell pellet in 300 µl FACS buffer and filter the stained cells through the 70-µm mesh into a 5-ml flow cytometry tube to remove clumps before analysis.\n18. Determine the purity of the enriched HLA+ fractions and DC subsets by flow cytometry or perform cell sorting if required according to the strategy described in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.873#cpz1873-fig-0001]. After sorting, verify the purity of each sorted DC subset by running a small sample from each collection tube. Acquire 300-500 events on the FACS machine to assess the quality of the sort.\nPlease follow routine flow cytometry procedures—all antibodies should be titrated and fluorescence minus one performed.",
    "As discussed above, cDC can be divided into cDC1, DC2, DC3, and an additional population of AS-DC. This protocol achieves a significantly more purified population of blood DC that includes pDC, cDC1, DC2, and AS-DC but not CD14+ DC3 by negative magnetic cell sorting (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.873#cpz1873-fig-0001]). Non-target cells are magnetically labeled against specific antigens absent on DC. Magnetically labeled non-target cells are retained in a MACS column (Miltenyi Biotec), while unlabeled DC pass through.

    "2. Harvest and transfer the interphase layer of the PBMC from the density centrifugation to a sterile centrifuge tube using a sterile Pasteur pipette. Add an equal volume of FACS buffer and slightly invert the tube.\n3. Wash the cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 400 × g and 4°C (with brake and acceleration on). Discard the supernatant.\n4. Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml PBS and determine the total number of viable cells (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.873#cpz1873-prot-0001], steps 10-12)\nA typical quantity of PBMC obtained from one unit of blood at this stage is between 4 and 9 × 108 cells. It is preferable to work with fresh blood as quickly as possible.\n5. Wash the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 × g and 4°C, and remove the supernatant.\n6. Resuspend the leucocyte pellet to a concentration of 1 to 1.5 × 108 in 350 µl FACS buffer. Transfer each 350 µl aliquot of resuspended cells to a fresh sterile 15-ml tube.\nMagnetic labeling and DC isolation\n7.

    "13. Attach the MidiMACS Separator to the MACS MultiStand and place the LS column in the separator. Place a 15-ml collection tube on a stable tube stand below the LS column.\nWhen inserting the LS column into the MACS Separator magnet, ensure that the “wings” face the front.\n14. Prepare each column by washing it with 5 ml FACS buffer.\n15. Wait until the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next stage.\n16. Replace the 15-ml collection tube below the LS column with a new sterile 15-ml collection tube labeled “DC fraction”.\n17. Apply the 500 µl cell suspension to the column reservoir. Collect flow-through in the 15-ml tube, which now contains the unlabeled, enriched DC population.\n18. Wait until the column reservoir has run dry before proceeding to the next step.\n19. Add 9 ml FACS buffer to the column in stages. Collect any residual DC retained in the column in the 15-ml centrifuge tube from step 16.\n20. Once all FACS buffer has passed through the column and the reservoir is empty, wash the cells by centrifuging the unlabeled DC fraction for 5 min at 400 × g and 4°C. Remove the supernatant and count the cells as described in basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.873#cpz1873-prot-0001], steps 10-12.\n21.

    "This protocol describes how to perform a functional readout of DC. The MLR assay uses allogeneic human T lymphocytes as responder cells to cDC. Stable incorporation of the intracellular fluorescent dye 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) into the T cells can be used as a tool to monitor the proliferation of T cells—each time a cell divides, the fluorescence will be halved, and this change can be measured. This protocol can also examine the response of T cells to DCs stimulated by cytokines or a drug of your choice. The extent of T cell proliferation is then measured by conventional flow cytometry.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2)\nFetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sartorius, cat. no. 04-127-1A)\nIscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) (Sartorius, cat. no. 01-058-1A)\nFresh blood obtained from healthy volunteers\nNaive Pan T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-097-095)\nCellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit (Thermo Fisher, cat. no.

Adjust the final volume to a concentration of 50,000 cells/ml in IMDM 10% (see recipe).\n5. Resuspend the DC thoroughly by pipetting up and down and dispense 100 µl of the adjusted cell suspension into each well of a U-bottom 96-well plate (5000 cells/well). Prepare two sets of triplicate wells for each subset and condition (every stimulus requires equal control and, in certain cases, an FMO).\nIn this protocol, both stimulus and genetic mutations may be examined. Thus, at least 24 wells are required for four DC subsets: 12 unstimulated wells and 12 stimulated controls with an agonist for each of the four DC subsets examined. Always set aside wells for DC plus agonist and T cells plus agonist, too, and FMO. Always remember to test T cells alone with and without the test drug.\n6. Add 100 µl of 10% IMDM to two additional sets of triplicate wells as the control group.\nThree wells with stimulus and three without.\n7. Add 1 µl agonist or vehicle to the appropriate wells, such as LPS, at a final 100 ng/ml concentration.\nAdjust the volume of each well to the equivalent volume. Ensure any agonist, drug, or vehicle is tested with and without T cells alone.\n8. Incubate DC for 1 hr (or for an appropriate period up to 12 hr) in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Allow the DC to acclimatize while preparing the T cells to be added at the end of the next step.",
