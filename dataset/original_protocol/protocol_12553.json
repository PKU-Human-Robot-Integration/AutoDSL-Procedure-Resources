    "1. Getting started\nNOTE: The protocol presented here is focused on tool utility and key features. Detailed descriptions of methods, features, and components can be found on the website in a comprehensive User Guide (Table 1).\nTable 1: Evolution of the SeqAPASS tool. A list of features and updates added to the SeqAPASS tool from its initial deployment. Abbreviations: SeqAPASS = Sequence Alignment to Predict Across Species Susceptibility; ECOTOX = ECOTOXicology knowledgebase. Please click here to download this Table.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63970/Vliet et al. Table 1.xlsx]\nGo to https://seqapass.epa.gov/seqapass using Chrome. Select either Login to use an existing account or follow instructions to create a SeqAPASS account, which will allow users to run, store, access, and customize their completed jobs.\nPrior to conducting an analysis, first identify a protein of interest and a targeted or sensitive species by reviewing the existing literature or pre-existing data (Figure 1). As SeqAPASS contains links to external resources to help identify the query protein, click the drop down buttons under Identify a Protein Target to access relevant resources.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63970/63970fig1v2.jpg\nFigure 1: SeqAPASS problem formulation: schematic diagram of the preliminary information necessary for a successful analysis.

    "Table 2: Links, resources, and tools integrated into the SeqAPASS tool. A list of the various data sources, links, and resources leveraged into the SeqAPASS tool. Abbreviation: SeqAPASS = Sequence Alignment to Predict Across Species Susceptibility. Please click here to download this Table.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63970/Vliet et al. Table 2.xlsx]\n2. Developing and running a SeqAPASS query: Level 1\nNOTE: In a Level 1 analysis, the entire primary amino acid sequence of a query protein is compared to the primary amino acid sequences of all species with available sequence information. This tool uses algorithms to mine, collect, and compile publicly available data to rapidly align and compare amino acid sequences across species. The backend stores information from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases and strategically makes use of the standalone versions of the Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTp)54 and the Constraint-based Multiple Alignment Tool (COBALT)55.\nUnder Compare Primary Amino Acid Sequences, click either By Species or By Accession. Use the By Species selection to type or select from a list of species to choose the protein target of interest.\nSubmit protein accessions (i.e., NCBI protein ID) directly by entering the accession(s) in the By Accession text box.\nSelect Request Run to submit the query. Once submitted, wait for a notification to appear in the top-right corner of the browser window indicating a successful submission.\nSelect the SeqAPASS Run Status tab at the top of the page to display a list of all SeqAPASS runs conducted under that user account and check the percent completion.\n\t\nClick Refresh Data while the appropriate radio button is selected to check the status of Level 2 and Level 3 runs.\nSelect the View SeqAPASS Reports tab at the top of the page to access a list of all reports completed under that account.",
    "In the View SeqAPASS Reports tab, select the query protein of interest. Click Request Selected Report to open the Level 1 Query Protein Information page and view results, data customization options, visualizations, and summary reports.\nBy default, select View Report to view data in the web browser. Alternatively, select Save Report to download raw data as a .zip file.\n\t​NOTE: The time required for a Level 1 analysis will vary (average of 23 min for version 5.1) depending on the global user demand at that point in time, the number of jobs submitted to the queue, and the amount of protein information that exists for a submitted job. If a protein target has been previously completed, data will be available in seconds upon submission.\n3. Developing and running a SeqAPASS query: Level 2\nNOTE: As the entire protein sequence is not directly involved in a chemical interaction, a Level 2 analysis compares only the amino acid sequence of the functional domain to make susceptibility predictions at lower taxonomic ranks (e.g., class, order, family).\nFrom the Level 1 Query Protein Information page, click the plus sign + next to the Level 2 header to populate the Level 2 Query menu.\nIdentify the appropriate domain(s) in the protein of interest (query protein).\n\t\nIf a domain has not been identified, click the integrated link to the NCBI Conserved Domains Database (CDD) (Table 1), which can aid in the identification of the appropriate domain selection.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, only specific hit domains are selected as queries in Level 2.\nClick the Select Domain box to auto populate a list of functional domains for the query protein.",
    "Select the domain accession(s) from the dropdown list and initiate the Level 2 query by clicking the Request Domain Run button. Once submitted, wait for a notification to appear indicating a successful submission.\nClick Refresh Level 2 and 3 runs to populate Level 2 data, which will be available within seconds of submission.\nUnder View Level 2 Data, select the completed domain accession(s) from the dropdown list and click the View Level 2 Data button to open the results in a new page.\n4. Accessing and understanding the data: SeqAPASS Level 1 and Level 2\nScroll to the bottom of the Query Protein Information page to view a report of the results - a Primary Report is provided with Level 1 and 2 analyses by default. Select the Full report radio button to view a more detailed report that provides all sequence hits and alignment metrics. Click on the appropriate accession/ID/name in both reports to access the transparent protein alignment and taxonomy information in the NCBI database.\nScroll to the right side of the results table to view the ECOTOX column. Click links to the ECOTOXicology knowledgebase (ECOTOX) to rapidly gather corresponding toxicity data for species with susceptibility predictions.\n\tNOTE: ECOTOX is a comprehensive, publicly available knowledgebase providing single chemical toxicity data for aquatic and terrestrial plants and wildlife. SeqAPASS v6.0 includes an ECOTOX widget to connect with relevant ECOTOX data more rapidly by chemical and species of interest.\nClick Download Table to save the table as a spreadsheet file. Click the View Summary Report button to view and download a summary report table presenting data sorted by taxonomic group.\n\t​NOTE: Data summary tables are available for both Primary and Full Reports and provide an overview of predictions for a given target.",
    "5. Manipulating data settings: SeqAPASS Level 1 and Level 2\nNOTE: In both Level 1 and Level 2 analyses, it is assumed that the greater the protein similarity, the greater the likelihood that a chemical will interact with the protein in a similar manner to the query species/protein, making them susceptible to potential impacts of chemicals with this molecular target. Due to the similarity of these data, steps for understanding Level 1 and 2 data are outlined together in a single protocol.\nRefer to the submenus at the top of Query Protein Information to access and manipulate the report settings and use default settings for all report options for most analyses. If there is scientific justification for changing the default setting, follow these optional steps:\n\t\n(OPTIONAL) Click the plus sign + next to Susceptibility Cut-off to view and adjust the susceptibility cutoff settings in a new tab. Either select a new cutoff value from a dropdown list or enter a user-defined cutoff value.\n(OPTIONAL) Change the number in E-Value (the number of different alignments expected to occur by chance) field if something other than default is desired.\n\t\tNOTE: Any protein with an E-value greater than the number in the box will be eliminated from the primary report.\n(OPTIONAL) Use the Sort by Taxonomic Group option to choose the Level of taxonomic hierarchy to display in the Filtered Taxonomic Group column in the results table.\n\t\tNOTE: Changing the taxonomic hierarchy will also alter the prediction of susceptibility based on the species from each filtered group that are found above the cutoff.\n(OPTIONAL) Change the Common Domain (how many common domains a protein must share with the query protein to be included in results) field if something other than default is desired.",
    "NOTE: As the default setting is 1, any sequence that does not share at least one common domain with the query protein will be excluded.\n(OPTIONAL) Select No under Species Read Across to get back the susceptibility predictions of Y only if Percent Similarity is greater than or equal to the cutoff or if the hit is identified as an ortholog candidate.\n\t\tNOTE: This setting defaults to Yes, meaning that a susceptibility prediction of Y will be reported for all ortholog candidates, all species listed above the susceptibility cutoff, and all species below the cutoff from the same taxonomic group with one or more species above the cutoff.\nClick the Download Current Report Settings button to download a file capturing the current settings applied.\n\t​NOTE: The specific evaluation Level (1, 2, or 3) selected will dictate the settings that are presented in the report.\n6. Visualizing the data: SeqAPASS Level 1 and Level 2\nClick the plus sign + next to Visualization and click the Visualize Data button to open a separate tab displaying the user-defined information and the option to select an interactive graph of results.\nClick Boxplot to open the interactive boxplot and plot controls and allow the boxplot visualization to actively update to reflect changes to the data table and provide publication- and presentation-quality graphics.\n\tNOTE: The default boxplot displays species groups on the x-axis and percent similarity on the y-axis. Boxplots display the susceptibility cutoff (dashed line), percent similarity across species compared to the query species, and mean and median values for each taxonomic group along with the 25th and 75th percentiles and interquartile range. Depending on the objective of the analysis and the user's needs, many boxplot features can be modified through the following optional steps.",
    "(OPTIONAL) To customize the displayed taxonomic groups, refer to the Taxonomic Groups box under the Controls section. Remove groups by scrolling over the names and selecting x or by using the Taxonomic Groups dropdown menu.\n(OPTIONAL) To add a legend that will pinpoint a species of interest or specific predefined groups (e.g., endangered or threatened species), hover over a taxonomic group name on the x-axis to activate a pop-up box listing the top three species ordered by highest percent similarity. Hover over species in the legend to generate a pop-up box with the corresponding species information. Click on the box for a specific taxonomic group to generate a downloadable summary table listing species and predictions.\nClick Download Boxplot to choose a file type, customize the width/height resolution, and save the visualization.\n7. Developing and running a SeqAPASS analysis: Level 3\nNOTE: A Level 3 analysis assesses user-identified amino acid residues within the query protein and rapidly compares the conservation of these residues across species. Species in which these residues are conserved are assumed to be more likely to interact with a chemical in a similar manner to the template species/protein. As Level 3 focuses on individual amino acids, an analysis can only be performed when detailed knowledge of the amino acid residues critical to the chemical-protein or protein-protein interaction is available.\nClick the plus sign + next to the Level 3 header on the Level 1 Query Protein Information page to populate the Level 3 Query menu.",
    "Click the plus sign + next to the Reference Explorer to open the reference explorer tool, which generates a predefined Boolean string to query the available literature and aids users in identifying appropriate literature to support the identification of critical amino acids to be used in the Level 3 evaluation (Table 2 and Figure 2).\n\t\n(OPTIONAL) Once the query protein auto populates, use the Add Protein Name function to add additional proteins.\nClick the Generate Google Scholar Link to open a pop-up containing an autogenerated search string that includes relevant search terms.\nClick Search Google Scholar to query the literature database using the search string.\n\t\nAlternatively, click Copy to Clipboard and customize the search string by adding or removing terms using the functions in Reference Explorer.\n8. Identify critical amino acid residues using identified literature\nSelect the template sequence to which user-selected species will be aligned in the Level 3 Query menu.\n\tNOTE: This template sequence is commonly chosen based on the literature for which the critical amino acids were identified and can be the same or a different species than those queried in Level 1 and Level 2.\n\t\n(OPTIONAL) Use the Additional Comparisons box to compare any accessions/sequences that do not appear in the Primary/Full Report tables.\nEnter a user-defined name for the Level 3 run in the Enter Level 3 Run Name text box to identify the completed Level 3 run. Choose a unique name for each evaluation.\nSelect the taxonomic group of interest in the Choose Taxonomic Group(s) field. Select a taxonomic group to auto filter the table by that taxonomic group.\nIn the results table, manually click the checkbox beside any species to be aligned to the template sequence.",
    "NOTE: To ensure appropriate alignment, one taxonomic group at a time should be compared to the template. Only select similarly annotated proteins for the species of interest. When selecting sequences for comparison, it is important to pay attention to certain sequences (e.g., hypothetical, LOW QUALITY, or partial). Unless there is transparent justification for inclusion, it is best to exclude these sequences as they may distort predictions due to incomplete or inappropriate sequence information.\nRepeat steps to align all taxonomic groups of interest.\nClick Refresh Level 2 and 3 runs once all species have been aligned to populate the Select Level 3 Run Name menu with the completed Level 3 jobs and get the data from a Level 3 alignment immediately.\nClick Combine Level 3 Data to combine alignments from multiple taxonomic groups.\n\t\nAlternatively, to view a single report, select the user-defined name under Choose Query to View and click View Level 3 Data.\nSelect the Level 3 template to be used as the basis for amino acid residue comparison within the Combine Level 3 Reports menu and click Next.\nIn Level 3 jobs, select completed jobs for comparison and click Next. Use the Order Level 3 Jobs function to reorder the taxonomic groups if desired. Click View Level 3 Data to produce a Level 3 report page with the combined taxonomic groups aligned.\nSelect previously identified amino acid positions for the template species by typing in the amino acid position(s), separated by commas, in the Enter Amino Acid Residue Positions box and then selecting Copy to Residue List. Directly select residues in the template sequence from the shuttle box.\nClick Update Report to refresh the page and display the Level 3 susceptibility predictions.",
    "​NOTE: Level 3 uses a simple set of rules derived from basic descriptors of side-chain functional properties (e.g., aliphatic, aromatic) and molecular dimensions (molecular weight differences >30 g/mol) to determine whether differences at key positions are likely to affect protein interactions13.\n9. Visualizing Level 3 SeqAPASS data\nNOTE: As in previous Levels, Primary and Full reports are available. In addition to data identical to the data in Level 1 and 2, the Primary Report displays amino acid positions, abbreviations, and a yes/no (Y/N) similar susceptibility as the template prediction. Similarly, the Full Report contains information on amino acid side chain classification and molecular weight.\nOn the Level 3 report page, scroll to the bottom to view a report of the results. Click Download Table at the bottom of the report to save the table.\nClick View Level 3 Summary Report to view and download a summary report table presenting data sorted by taxonomic group. Click the plus sign + next to Visualization on the Level 3 Report page to open a separate browser tab displaying the user-defined information and the option to view results in the form of an interactive heat map.\nClick Heat Map on the Visualization Information page to open the interactive graphic and controls and allow the heat map visualization to actively update to reflect changes to the data table. Perform the following optional steps to customize the heat map.\n\t\n(OPTIONAL) Select Report Options to change between a Simple Report, which displays the amino acid position, one-letter abbreviation, and amino acid similarity, or a Full Report, which displays detailed information on each amino acid selected.\n(OPTIONAL) Select Report Options to change how species are displayed, either by Common Name or Scientific Name.",
    "​NOTE: Within the Simple Report, amino acids are categorized as a Total Match (dark blue), Partial Match (light blue, substitutions meeting only one criterion), or Not a Match (yellow, substitutions meeting neither criteria) to the template amino acid. The Full Report displays comparisons as either a Total Match (dark blue) or Not a Match (yellow).\n(OPTIONAL) Select Optional Selections to highlight useful information such as Ortholog Candidates, Threatened Species, Endangered Species, or Common Model Organisms.\n(OPTIONAL) Select Heat Map Settings to select additional customization options, including adding or removing columns, legends, and text.\nClick Download Boxplot to choose a file type and save the visualization.\n10. Interpretation of SeqAPASS Results: Lines of evidence for protein conservation\nNOTE: For ease of interpretation, this tool includes a Decision Summary Report (DS Report) designed to integrate data across Levels. The DS Report contains the results (i.e., data tables and/or visualizations) that the user has selected and allows for the quick evaluation of susceptibility predictions across multiple Levels for multiple species simultaneously.\nClick Push Level # to DS Report from the results or data visualization pages and wait for the data to be \"pushed\" and the DS Report tab to become active.\n\tNOTE: If results or any changes have not been pushed to the DS Report, Push Level # to DS Report will remain active until selected. If a setting has been changed, the text Click to push new changes will appear until the changes are pushed to the report. Visualizations can be pushed to the DS Report any time during the evaluation.\nSelect the DS Report tab at any time to access the DS page.",
    "NOTE: For all species aligned in Level 1, the Final Decision Summary Report table contains the important data and susceptibility predictions for each analysis. If a species in the DS table was not included in the Level 3 report but was found in Level 1 and/or Level 2 jobs, the cell in the table will receive a not applicable (NA) designation for the Level 3 susceptibility prediction.\nSubscription Required.
