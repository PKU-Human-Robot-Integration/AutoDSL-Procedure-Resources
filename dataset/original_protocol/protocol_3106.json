    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nTiming: 1 month in total\nA timeline of all main steps is summarized in the Graphical abstract. Briefly, it takes several hours for lentiviral and AAV injections. Three-week intervals between the first lentiviral and second AAV injections, and a one-week interval between the second AAV injection and brain sampling are needed. It takes 1 week for immunostaining and ExM.\nFirst Stereotaxic Injection of BATTLE-1 Lentivirus into Mouse Brain\nTiming: 2–4 h\nPerform stereotaxic injection of viruses according to Kohara et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and Kohara et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10].\nCritical: Perform stereotaxic injection of BATTLE-1 lentivirus in the Biohazard room P2.\nPrepare surgery set up in the safety cabinet in P2 biosafety room.\nPlace the stereotaxic injection systems on the safety cabinet.\nPrepare the surgery tools, suture needle with thread, and microdrill on the safety cabinet.\nPrepare skin marker, cotton swabs, and ointment pot (a box for used pipette tip attached with viral liquid) added with commercial chlorine disinfecting cleaner (Hypochlorous acid >0.1%).\nPrepare pipette man (P2, P20, P200) and filtered tips on the safety cabinet.\nPut 50 mL autoclaved PBS and isodine.\nPlace the anesthetic machine for isoflurane beside the safety cabinet and fill with isoflurane.\nConnect the tube between anesthetic machine and gasmask attached in stereotaxic injection system.\nConnect the tube between the extra isoflurane retrieve bottle and the gas mask attached in stereotaxic injection system.\nPlace a small desk stand with a magnifying glass on the safety cabinet.\nPrepare small square parafilms (about 1 cm × 1 cm) for back-filling sharp glass pipette with virus solution.\nPlace a small shaver on the side desk for cutting the skull hair of the mouse.\nPrepare Hamilton syringe and sharp glass pipettes on the desk in P2 biosafety room.",
    "Place a 50-mL centrifuge tube filled with mineral oil in the tube stand on the desk.\nPrepare Hamilton syringe, sharp glass pipette box, and backfill syringe with sharp tube.\nRemove metal joint fitting of Hamilton syringe and place it on the desk.\nFill metal joint fitting with mineral oil on the desk.\nFill mineral oil on the upper lid of 50-mL centrifuge tube on the desk.\nInsert the tip of Hamilton syringe without metal joint fitting (but with plastic compression fitting) into the upper lid of 50-mL centrifuge tube filled with mineral oil.\nFill mineral oil in the Hamilton syringe and remove air in the Hamilton syringe by repeating plunger pushing and withdrawing.\nAfter removing the bubble air in the Hamilton syringe, connect the Hamilton syringe with metal joint fitting (avoid trapping any air).\nBackfill sharp glass pipette with mineral oil by using backfill syringe with sharp tube (avoid trapping any air bubbles in the sharp glass pipette).\nConnect carefully sharp glass pipette (filled with mineral oil) with Hamilton syringe (filled with mineral oil).\nAttach Hamilton syringe connected with sharp glass pipette to stereotaxic injector in the safety cabinet.\nMove attached Hamilton syringe to the highest position just above mouse head. (This position is probably the safest position during surgery to avoid your hand from unexpectedly touching a sharp glass pipette with virus.)\nAnesthetize mouse (older than 8 weeks) in the box filled with 3% isoflurane.\nShave skull hair of anesthetized mouse using slim hair cutter.\nFixation of mouse head with ear bars in stereotaxic injection system (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/288-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Stereotaxic Injection System and Anesthetized Head-Fixed Mouse\n(A) A representative picture of the stereotaxic injection system and a head-fixed mouse. The mouse is anesthetized by 3% isoflurane and an incision made on the skull skin.",
    "(B) The magnified image of (A). Bregma point and Lambda point are shown.\nFix left ear bar in the appropriate position and unfixed right ear bar in stereotaxic injection system.\nInsert fixed left ear bar into left ear canal of mouse.\nAdjust mouse head direction in parallel to ground in that state.\nInsert right ear bar (in flexible state) around the right ear canal of mouse.\nWhen right ear bar is adequately inserted into right ear canal of mouse, mouse skull moves with movement of right ear bar.\nFix the right ear bar when it is adequately inserted into the ear canal.\nConfirm that the mouse head can rotate vertically to the fixed ear bar.\nFit gas anesthesia mask to mouse nose.\nAdjust gas anesthesia mask z-position at roughly good position.\nApply eye ointment by cotton swabs on mouse eyes to prevent dry eyes.\nSanitize mouse head hair with povidone iodine and cotton swabs.\nCover mouse body with a trimmed surgical paper.\nMake an incision on the mouse head skin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nUse small surgical clamps to expose skull bone and wipe jelly on the skull by cotton swab.\nMark points at Bregma and Lambda using skin marker.\nMove and lower sharp glass pipette to just above the Lambda point by using magnifying stand glass (×5).\nContact the tip of sharp glass pipette with the surface of skull at Lambda point. Monitor the tip through magnifying stand glass (×5).\nRecord dorso-ventral (DV) position of Lambda point by reading scale of stereotaxic injection system.\nUpper and move sharp glass pipette to Bregma.\nContact the tip of sharp glass pipette with the surface of skull at Bregma point. Monitor the tip through magnifying stand glass (×5).\nRecord DV position of Bregma point by reading scale of stereotaxic injection system.",
    "When DV position of Bregma does not equal to that of Lambda, adjust the position of gas anesthesia mask.\nConfirm that DV position of Bregma equals that of Lambda and record the anterior-posterior (AP) position and medio-lateral (ML) position of Bregma.\nMove the sharp glass pipette to the injection site determined in the preparation step.\nMark the injection site using skin marker.\nDrill slowly at marked injection site using microdrill. When the skull bone becomes thin, make a hole carefully using the bent tip of the needle.\nDig up the small bones at the injection site by the bent tip of the needle.\nRemove blood by cotton swabs and apply sterilized PBS.\nPlace a small piece of parafilm on the ear bar.\nApply 2 μL of mixed lentiviruses on a small piece of parafilm.\nLower sharp glass pipette into the water drop of mixed lentiviruses.\nSuck up 1.2–1.5 μL of mixed lentiviruses into a sharp glass pipette (speed: 90 nL/s) by pressing the button of microsyringe controller micro4 (as lentivirus is relatively unstable at room temperature (22°C–26°C), load only necessary volume of lentivirus solution for single injection).\nMove the sharp glass pipette to the injection site and lower it to a position 0.3 mm deeper than the injection site and then return to injection site (make some space around the injection site for injection).\nInject 1 μL of mixed lentiviruses solution (speed: 30 nL/s).\nWait for 5 min.\nNote: Quick retrieving of a sharp glass pipette from the injection site just after injection probably causes spread of lentiviruses to the needle track.\nUpper the sharp glass pipette.\nStitch skin of mouse head.\nPlace the mouse in a new cage and heat the cage by the heater sheet until the mouse becomes awake.",
    "Wait for 3 weeks until the second AAV injection.\nSecond Stereotaxic Injection of BATTLE-1 AAV into Mouse Brain\nTiming: 2–4 h\nPrepare surgery set up in the safety cabinet in P2 biosafety room in the same manner as the first injection three weeks after the first surgery.\nAll processes are the same as the first injection except the following steps.\nThe skull bone at the injection site is usually thin because of the first injection. Make the injection hole by a vent needle.\nInject 1 μL of mixed AAV solution into the same injection site as the first one (speed: 30 nL/s)\nWait for 5 min.\nInject 1 μL of mixed AAV solution into the same injection again (speed: 30 nL/s)\nThe subsequent surgery processes are same as the first injection.\nWait for 1 week until the brain section.\nCritical: Lentivirus can be inactivated by 70% ethanol, but AAV is not inactivated by 70% ethanol. Use hypochlorous acid (>0.1%) to sterilize the used tip for AAV.\nPreparation of Brain Sections\nTiming: 3 days\nSampling: Anesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal administration (5 mL/kg body weight) of a mixed anesthetic (medetomidine, midazolam, and butorphanol), then perfuse transcardially with ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS using a peristaltic pump. Postfix removed brain in the same solution for 24 h, transfer to 30% sucrose in PBS, and embed in optimal cutting temperature compound. Freeze brain with isopentane and liquid nitrogen.\nPause Point: Sample can be stored at −80°C until use.\nCryosection: Section brain sagittally 60-μm thick using cryostat (Leica). Transfer sections in PBS to the 12-well plate.",
    "Note: The protocols for brain sections can be modified by target proteins and samples. We cut the brain 60 μm thick in this protocol, but thinner slices may be better for antibody penetration. Using a vibratome to cut the brain without freezing is also an alternative.\nNote: Roughly check the fluorescence of the sections through the 12-well plate using inverted microscope to select sections for Expansion microscopy (ExM).\nPause Point: Sample can be stored in PBS with 0.02% sodium azide at 4°C in the dark until use.\nImmunostaining\nTiming: 1 week\nThe protocols for immunostaining can be modified by your target proteins and samples. For immunostaining of the free-floating sections, we use parafilm well plate that was made by pressing a magnetic stirrer bar on parafilm-covered empty chip tray (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). We drop 100 μL buffer for one brain section in the well and use a paintbrush to transfer sections between the wells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). To avoid drying samples during incubation, add water to the bottom of the chip tray.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/288-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Parafilm Well Plate for Immunostaining\n(A) Cover parafilm on the empty chip tray.\n(B) Press a magnetic stirrer on parafilm to make wells.\n(C) Use a paintbrush for sample transfer between wells.\nAntigen retrieval: incubate freely floating sections in citrate buffer at 80°C for 30 min in a 1.5-mL tube, and then allowed to cool at room temperature (22°C–26°C) slowly. The sections were washed five times with PBS for 5 min.\nNote: Rough trimming of the sections by Iris scissors before immunostaining is recommended to save reagent.\nNote: The antigen retrieval step is optional but showed strong effect on Bassoon immunostaining in our experiment.\nBlocking: Incubate sections in blocking buffer in the parafilm well plate for 1 h at room temperature (22°C–26°C) with shaking.",
    "Primary antibody staining: Incubate sections with primary chicken polyclonal antibody to GFP (1:500), rat monoclonal antibody to RFP (1:100), mouse monoclonal antibody to Bassoon (1:100), and rabbit polyclonal antibody to Homer1 (1:100) in blocking buffer for 2 days (44 h–52 h) at 4°C, followed by washing four times with blocking buffer, each time for 5 min with shaking.\nSecondary antibody staining: Incubate sections with secondary anti-chicken donkey antibody conjugated with Alexa488 dye (1:200), anti-rat donkey antibody conjugated with Alexa568 dye (1:100), anti-mouse goat antibody conjugated with Atto647N dye (1:100), and anti-rabbit goat antibody conjugated with CF405M dye (1:100) in blocking buffer for 24 h at 4˚C with shaking. Wash sections three times with blocking buffer, three times with high salt PBS, and three times with PBS, each time for 5 min with shaking.\nNote: For the ExM, we changed the antibody concentration higher and the incubation time longer than usual immunostaining because fluorescent signals become weak in the expansion step.\nExM and Imaging\nTiming: 4 days\nExM was performed according to a protocol published by Ed Boyden lab (Asano et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). For details on the ExM, please refer to http://expansionmicroscopy.org/[href=http://expansionmicroscopy.org/].\nAnchoring to gel: Incubate sections with Acryloyl-X (0.1 mg/mL) in PBS in 1.5-mL tube for more than 6 h at room temperature (22°C–26°C) with no shaking. Wash three times with PBS, each time for 5 min.\nInfiltrate gelling solution: Incubate sections with the gelling solution in 1.5-mL tube for 30 min at 4˚C in the dark.\nNote: Remove PBS before anchoring and gelling by washing once with reagent. Gelling solution should be made just before use by mixing monomer solution, 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (inhibitor), APS, and TEMED (initiator, add last) and be kept at 4°C to prevent premature polymerization.",
    "Gelation: Cut coverslip with a glasscutter and place two of them on the glass slide as spacers (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B). Drop 50 μL of gelling solution and transfer sections using paintbrush (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D). Slices are sandwiched between glass slide and top coverslip and incubate for 2 h at 37°C (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4F).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/288-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The Construction of the Gelling Chamber\n(A) Cut coverslips with glasscutter.\n(B) Place coverslips on the glass slide.\n(C) Drop gelling buffer on the glass slide.\n(D) Transfer sections into the buffer.\n(E and F) Place a coverslip on the sample.\nDigestion: Trim hippocampus regions minimally from gelled sections with a razor blade under a stereo microscope (Leica S9i) before detaching from the gel chambers (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). Drop digestion buffer on the sample and peel off gently from the edge (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C–5E). Immerse sections in the 500 μL of digestion buffer at room temperature (22°C–26°C) for 12 h. Wash three times with PBS for 5 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/288-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Detaching Gel of the Hippocampal Region from the Gelling Chamber\n(A–C) Trim the hippocampal region with a razorblade.\n(D) Drop digestion buffer on gel.\n(E) Detach gel from the edge with a paintbrush.\nNote: Trimming the gel into an asymmetric shape is recommended to deduce the orientation easily. Be careful of losing a sample that becomes clear and invisible in the buffer after digestion. We recommend changing buffer by absorbing it with Kimwipes.\nPause Point: Sample can be stored in PBS at 4°C in the dark until expansion.\nExpansion: Transfer gels into new container that is enough size for expanded gels. Wash samples three times with water for 15 min to reach the final expansion size (×4 linearly, Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/288-Fig6.jpg",
    "Figure 6. The Construction of the Imaging Chamber\n(A and B) Comparison of the gels before and after expansion.\n(C) Put expanded gel on the coverslip.\n(D) Put silicon sheet surrounding the gel.\n(E and F) Put silicon sheet on the sample.\nImaging: Transfer samples on coverslip with paintbrush and remove extra buffer by Kimwipes. Silicon sheets (0.5-mm thick) are used as spacers surrounding the sample to prevent sample compression (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and 6D). To avoid sample drifting during imaging, samples are sandwiched between a coverslip and silicon sheets (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E and 6F). Acquire fluorescence images using an inverted confocal fluorescent microscope (Olympus FV3000, using 10×/0.40 NA, 20×/0.70 NA, and 60×/1.20 NA water objective from Olympus). Use Imaris 9.1 (Bitplane) for generating three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering projection images or 3D maximum intensity projection images (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A and 7B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/288-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.
