    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the local ethics committee of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU).\n1. DISE-TCI-Bispectral Analysis Procedure\nPerform venipuncture and place an IV catheter in the patients left back of the hand or median cubital vein to obtain intravenous access to administer the sedative.\nCarry out the investigation at room temperature (22 °C).\nBring the awake patient into the operating theater. Place the patient in the supine position on the operating table.\nFollowing this, have the anesthesiologist connect the monitoring system of vital signs. Monitor the patient during the whole procedure by peripheral pulse oximetry, 3-channel ECG and non-invasive blood pressure measurement at 3-min intervals.\nEnsure that both the anesthesiologist and the anesthetic equipment are on the left side of the patient.\nHave the anesthesiologist place and fix the single-use sensor for bispectral analysis.\n\t\nTo do this, wipe skin with disinfectant and let it dry.\nPosition sensor (4 interconnected and adhesive electrodes) diagonally on the patient's forehead: one electrode (number 1) at center of forehead, electrodes 2 and 3 directly above eyebrow and electrode 4 on temple between corner of eye and hairline.\nConnect sensor via interface cable to the bispectral analysis-monitor. Press electrodes firmly and ensure that the automatic sensor test is passed.\nHave the anesthesiologist enter patients' individual sex, age, height, weight and plasma target concentration of propofol into the data manager with the pre-programmed pharmacokinetic model of Marsh17.\n\tNOTE: According to this model, the TCI-data manager calculates the infusion rates of propofol and operates the connected TCI-infusion pump to establish and automatically maintain the set target plasma concentration.\nDim the light in the operating room.\nInduce sleep solely by the intravenous infusion of propofol with the TCI-infusion pump with an initial target plasma level of 2.0 µg/ml.",
    "Under continuous monitoring of the patient's respiration, state of consciousness and value of the bispectral analysis, raise the target plasma propofol level in steps of 0.2 µg/ml/2 min until the desired depth of sedation is reached.\n\tNOTE: The target depth of sedation is a sleeping patient (eyes closed), with maintained spontaneous breathing and / or starting to snore and / or obstructive apnea observed by the examiner with the endoscope or the anesthesiologist.\nRecord manually the mean value of the bispectral analysis at the target depth of sedation.\nHave the examiner with the endoscope stand at head level on the right side next to the patient.\nAt the target depth of sedation insert a flexible fiber endoscope transnasally via the inferior nasal meatus.\nFilm the endoscopic examination and store digitally. Use the image acquisition system according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: In case of nasal septal deviation or hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates, the inferior meatus with the larger diameter should be chosen.\nExamine the upper airways by videoendoscopy in a proximal to distal direction from the nasopharynx as far as the hypopharyngeal entrance.\nClassify the obstruction site(s) (velum, oropharynx, tongue base, epiglottis) and configuration/obstruction pattern (anterior-posterior, lateral, concentric) and the degree/severity (no obstruction/no vibration, partial obstruction/vibration, complete obstruction/collapse) according to the VOTE system at the target depth of sedation15.\nIn the case of isolated sleep endoscopy, terminate sedation of the patient by stopping the propofol infusion after completing the endoscopic examination.\nIn the case of sleep endoscopy as part of a planned surgical procedure, let the anesthesiologist perform total intravenous anesthesia by starting infusion of opioids (e.g., using remifentanil in TCI mode) and increasing infusion of propofol (e.g., set TCI level to 4 µg/ml) until loss of consciousness. Inject muscle relaxant (e.g., rocuronium) and intubate the patient.",
