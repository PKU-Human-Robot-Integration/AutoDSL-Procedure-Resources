Preparation of XF running medium and XF cell culture microplate for human T cells\nThis figure is to show detailed steps for “step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]”. pH and temperature of XF running medium is important factor in the experiment. Also, coating cell culture microplate for human T cells is essential to allow cells to be positioned at the right spot for the measurement by sensor cartridge.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1348-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Loading ports in the microplate cartridge for drug and soluble αCD3 and αCD28 injections\nThis figure is to show detailed steps for “step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]”. The schematic diagram of XFe24 cell culture microplate shows that the wells are double-layered in the top view. The side view of XFe24 cell culture microplate also shows that cells and medium should be added separately to avoid cells seeding on the top-level. The XFe24 Sensor Cartridge diagram has to be hydrated in utility plate before use. Also, the compounds and soluble αCD3 and αCD28 are loaded in this component as shown in steps 8 and 9.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1348-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Diagram showing the Wave program set up for real-time T cell activation assessment\nThis figure is to show detailed steps for “step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]”. Designing the program for the experiment is shown here. The program set-up can be done before the experiment and the template can be saved for future analyses.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1348-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Successful (left) and failed (right) outcome after performing metabolic flux analysis in human T cells",
    "(A) The successful outcome shows that the ECAR level of human T cells after the treatment of soluble αCD3 and αCD28 is increased from 2 to 4 mpH/min. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM)\n(B) However, the failed outcome shows that the treatment of soluble αCD3 and αCD28 did not increase the ECAR level of human T cells. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM)\nNote: Glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration of T cells (i.e., murine splenocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or Jurkat cells) can be measured by using commercially available kits (OXPHOS: https://www.agilent.com/ko-kr/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-assay-kits-reagents-cell-assay-media/seahorse-xf-cell-mito-stress-test-kit-740885; Glycolysis: https://www.agilent.com/ko-kr/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-assay-kits-reagents-cell-assay-media/seahorse-xf-glycolysis-stress-test-kit-740886[href=https://www.agilent.com/ko-kr/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-assay-kits-reagents-cell-assay-media/seahorse-xf-glycolysis-stress-test-kit-740886]) and by following previous protocols (Gotoh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Gu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). However, this protocol does not require the purchase of these commercial kits.\nStart sensor hydration and instrument warm up.\nNote: Sensor hydration has to be prepared a day before the experiment. Instrument warm up has to start minimum 4 h before the experiment.\nThis preparation starts a day before the experiment.\nIn the clean bench, take out the ‘Sensor Cartridge (green) & Utility plate (pink)’ from Seahorse XFe24 Fluxpaks.\nAdd autoclaved ddH2O 1 mL/well in Utility plate.\nPlace the Sensor Cartridge over the Utility plate and incubate this in non-CO2 incubator (37°C), 24 h.\nPour 25 mL of ‘XF Calibrant (pH 7.4)’ in conical tube and incubate 24 h in non-CO2 incubator (37°C).\nTurn on XFe24 analyzer minimum 4 h before the experiment.\n1 h before the experiment, take out both ‘XF Calibrant’ and ‘Sensor Cartridge & Utility plate.’\nRemove all ddH2O in Utility plate.\nAdd XF Calibrant 1 mL/well in Utility plate.\nIncubate the ‘Sensor Cartridge & Utility plate’ with ‘XF Calibrant’ in non-CO2 incubator.",
    "Note: If the experiment starts in the morning, turn of XFe24 analyzer a day prior to the experiment.\nPrepare XF running medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAdjust pH level of pre-warmed XF RPMI media with L-glutamine to pH level of 7.4 using NaOH 0.1 N.\nNote: For adjustment of pH level to 7.4, approximately 80–100 μL of NaOH 0.1N needs to be added for 40 mL XF RPMI medium. From this step, all XF RPMI media used in the experiment should contain L-glutamine.\nKeep the medium warm at 37°C in a water bath.\nCritical: It is critical to keep the medium at 37°C, because pH level fluctuates depending on the temperature of the XF RPMI medium. For non-phenol XF RPMI medium with pH 7.4, this step is not required. Since ECAR equation involves the conversion of pH changes Fluctuation of pH level affects the ECAR level.\nSeed cells in XF cell culture microplate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nCoat the XF cell culture microplate, which is included in Seahorse XFe24 Fluxpaks: Use either coating solution to coat wells before cell seeding.\nNote: Suspension cells (i.e., T cells) require this step. Strongly adherent immune cells (i.e., macrophages) do not require this step if cells were cultured and incubated 1 hour before the experiment. Less adherent cell types may take 5–6 h for adhesion prior to the experiment.\nNote: Poly-d-lysine and Cell TakTM can be used as an alternative. 50 μL of either poly-d-lysine (50 μg/mL in DPBS, 1 h, RT) or Cell TakTM (5.74 μL dissolved in 0.5 mL of 0.1 M sodium carbonate, pH 8.0 for 15–20 min, RT) is needed for a well. Tilt and stir the plate slightly so that the coating solution can be dispersed evenly in the well.",
    "Note: The wells of XF cell culture microplate are smaller in size compared to the conventional 24-well plate, as illustrated (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The seeding surface of microplate is similar to that of a typical 96-well (0.275 cm2). Coated XF cell culture microplate can be stored for 1 week in 4°C.\nCritical: All wells are needed to be coated with either poly-d-lysine or Cell TakTM. Do not seed cells on A1, B4, C3, D6 wells (for blank/background correction wells in XFe24; blank/background correction wells are preset settings in Wave program, but they can be assigned manually in Wave program, which is used for all types of Seahorse analyzers (i.e., XFe24)). Blank/Background correction wells are used to filter out artifacts, such as temperature and buffering capacity, that can affect oxygen and pH that are not due to changes in metabolism (https://www.agilent.com/en/support/cell-analysis/purpose-of-background-wells[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/support/cell-analysis/purpose-of-background-wells]). Thus, 4 wells needed to be used for blank/background correction, and only 20 wells can be used for samples.\nAspirate off the coating media and wash the wells with autoclaved ddH2O twice and let wells to air dry.\nAdjust the concentrations to 1.0 × 106 cells/mL of T cells with XF running media containing L-glutamine.\nNote: All samples needed to be seeded in duplicates or triplicates. Also, optimal cell seeding numbers vary widely, though are typically between 10,000–80,000 cells per well (http://www.agilent.com/cell-reference-database/[href=http://www.agilent.com/cell-reference-database/]).\nAdd 100 μL of cells into the bottom of the wells (=1 × 105 cells/well for XFe24).\nNote: This is due to the structure of the XF cell culture microplate as illustrated in (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The plate’s well is 2-layered that adding cells in one step will seed cells in an upper level of the well, which the sensor cannot detect and measure.",
    "Centrifuge 5 min at 400 g to allow the cells to settle down as a monolayer at the bottom of the plate.\nSlowly add 450 μL of XF media to each well making sure not to disrupt the monolayer. The total volume of each well will be 550 μL for XF24.\nObserve the cells under a microscope to determine that all groups have a monolayer of cells without any that have dislodged.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in a non-CO2 incubator for 30–60 min.\nNote: The incubation is necessary for de-gassing the plate, allowing for CO2 diffusion from the cells, medium, and plate (https://www.agilent.com/en/support/cell-analysis/why-non-co2-incubation[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/support/cell-analysis/why-non-co2-incubation]). The contributions of CO2 to total extracellular acidification have been considered negligible in the measurement platform, XFe24 analyzer (Mookerjee and Brand, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Wu et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nPrepare compounds to assess real-time T cell activation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nPrepare 8× compound, which will be tested as a drug of interest (i.e., MOTS-c), diluted with XF running medium to be loaded into Drug Port A of sensor cartridge as below:\nThe final concentration is calculated based on the combined final volume [(drug of interest (8×) mixed with XF medium). Thus, 8× compound is added into Drug Port A.\nNote: To assess the effects of a drug (i.e., MOTS-c), you will need to prepare 8× concentration of a drug (i.e., 80 μM of MOTS-c). 75 μL of 8× drug is loaded into the drug port of sensor cartridge. The drug loaded in the drug port of sensor cartridge will be automatically injected from the drug port of sensor cartridge into the 550 μL of cell culture microplate during the assessment. The final concentration will be 1× concentration of drug after the injection (i.e., 10 μM of MOTS-c).\nPrepare αCD3 and αCD28 in 4 μg/mL and 20 μg/mL.",
    "The final concentration is calculated based on the combined final volume [(drug in the port (75 μL) mixed with XF medium). Thus, 4 μg/mL (αCD3) and 20 μg/mL (αCD28) is mixed and added into Drug Port B.\nNote: Until this stage, the experiment will take approximately 50–60 min.\nTake out Sensor Cartridge + Utility plate, which was incubated for 1 h, from non-Co2 incubator from Step 1.\nAdd prepared drug of interest to Port A and mixtures of αCD3 and αCD28 to Port B of Sensor Cartridge + Utility plate.\nIncubate Sensor Cartridge + Utility plate with drugs loaded in the ports in non-Co2 incubator for 15–25 min.\nSet up Seahorse program (XFe24) for real-time human T cell activation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])\nInitialization:12 min equilibrate\nBasal Measurement: 2–3 min mixture; 5 min measurement (3 times)\nInjection 1 (Drug of interest): 2–3 min wait; 5 min measurement (7 times)\nInjection 2 (αCD3&αCD28): 2–3 min wait; 5 min measurement (14 times)\nNote: The αCD3/αCD28 will be injected from the port to the cell after step c. and will be measured for 49–56 min. Then, after the injection of drug at step d, 98–112 min will be measured. With the interval time in between the injection, the total measurement period is around 3–4 h."
