    "Preparation of recombinant proteins   MBP-RSG, His-14-3-3 and GST-NtCDPK1 were expressed in Escherichia coli containing pMALc2-RSG, pET16b-14-3-3 or pGEX 4T-1-NtCDPK1, respectively, as described in the references (Ishida et al., 2008; Ito et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2014).   MBP-RSG, His-14-3-3 and GST-NtCDPK1 were purified by using Amylose resin, COSMOGEL His-Accept or Glutathione Sepharose 4B according to the manual (pMALTM Protein Fusion & Purification System, Ni-NTA His Bind Resins, or GST gene fusion system handbook, respectively).   The purified proteins were dialyzed separately overnight against a 500-1,000-fold volume of ice-cold dialysis buffer.   Glycerol, corresponding to 40% by volume of the dialyzed protein solutions, was added to the dialyzed protein solutions to make approximately 50% (v/v) glycerol (final concentration), and the protein solutions were stored at -20 °C.  Note: Dialyzed protein solution contains approximately 30% (v/v) glycerol.      Phosphorylation of RSG by NtCDPK1   Prepare reaction mixtures in each of 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube using the following: 5 µl 10x phosphorylation buffer 5 µl 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (dilute immediately before use) 2.5 µl 20 mM ATP with or without 1 µl [γ-32P] ATP (5,000 µCi/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) 2 µg MBP-RSG 100 ng GST-NtCDPK1 H2O up to 50 µl   Mix and incubate the reaction mixture for 1 h at 30 °C.      14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated RSG   Gently invert the container of amylose resin to resuspend the slurry.   Transfer 30 µl of resuspended slurry to each of 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.    Add 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer to each microcentrifuge tube to equilibrate the resin for use.   Spin down the resin at 1,000 x g for a few seconds at 4 °C.   Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.    Repeat steps C3-5 two more times for a total of three washes.",
    "Add 250 µl of ice-cold binding buffer, all (50 µl) of the reaction mixture phosphorylated RSG and 3 µg His-14-3-3 to the resin.   Gently mix the mixture for 30 min at 4 °C on a microtube rotator to bind MBP-RSG to the amylose resin and His-14-3-3.   Spin down the resin at 1,000 x g for a few seconds at 4 °C.    Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.    Wash the resin with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer to remove ATP and unbound proteins.   Gently mix by inverting the tube several times.   Spin down the resin at 1,000 x g for a few seconds at 4 °C.    Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.   Repeat steps C11-14 three more times for a total of four washes.    Completely remove the supernatant by using a micropipettor equipped with GELoader Tips.      Dephosphorylation of RSG by λ protein phosphatase   Add 200 µl of ice-cold dephosphorylation buffer and 1 µl (400 U) of λ protein phosphatase to the resin.   Gently mix the mixture for 30 min at 4 °C on a microtube rotator.    Wash unbound proteins from the resin with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer.   Gently mix by inverting the tube several times.   Spin down the resin at 1,000 x g for a few seconds at 4 °C.   Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.   Repeat steps D3-6 three more times for a total of four washes.   Completely remove the supernatant by using a micropipettor equipped with GELoader tips.      Detection of phosphorylation state of RSG   Add 60 µl of 2x SDS protein sample buffer to the resin.   Heat the tubes for 5 min in a 95 °C heat block to denature the proteins.",
    "Load 25 µl of the supernatant and 3 µl of protein size marker and perform Phos-tag SDS-PAGE (Kinoshita and Kinoshita-Kikuta, 2011) for the detection of MBP-RSG phosphorylated with cold ATP or normal SDS-PAGE for the detection of MBP-RSG phosphorylated with [γ-32P] ATP.   Perform coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining of Phos-tag SDS-PAGE gel to examine the phosphorylation state of MBP-RSG phosphorylated with cold ATP.   To detect the phosphorylation state of MBP-RSG phosphorylated with [γ-32P] ATP, dry the SDS-PAGE gel and place an imaging plate over the dried gel. Expose overnight to visualize the radioactive signals. Scan the imaging plate by using an imaging system, Typhoon FLA 9500.   Perform immunoblot analysis with anti-14-3-3 (Igarashi et al., 2001) antibody or anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody for the detection of His-14-3-3 bound to MBP-RSG by using an imaging system, ImageQuant LAS 4000."
