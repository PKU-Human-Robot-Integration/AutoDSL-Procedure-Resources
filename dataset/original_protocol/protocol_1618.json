While gp14 is embedded in the outer membrane, gp15 and gp16 interact to form the periplasmic tunnel (PT) of the T7 DNA ejectosome that spans the periplasm through the peptidoglycan layer, across the inner membrane, and into the cytoplasm of the host E. coli cell. Here we describe the in vitro biochemical reconstitution of the gp15:gp16 complex (final stoichiometry 6:6) that was formed using a 3:1 molar ratio during incubation steps.\nExpression (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]): Follow the before you begin protocol for optimize expression of internal virion proteins[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1] for full preparations of gp15 and gp16 starting from fresh transformations of pET16-b_gp15 and pET16-b_gp16 in BL21-LOBSTR(DE3).\nNote: Expected molecular weights are gp15, 87 kDa and gp16, 146 kDa.\nPurification (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): Complete the before you begin protocol purification of soluble ejection proteins T7 gp15 and gp16[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] for 6 L LB each of gp15 and gp16.\nNote: For the next steps, we recommend ≥2 mg of gp15 and ≥1 mg of gp16.\nComponent concentration (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A): Separately, pool fractions of purified gp15 and gp16. Concentrate gp15 using a 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter concentrator to ∼1–2 mg/mL. Concentrate gp16 using a 50 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter concentrator to ∼5 mg/mL. Check the protein absorbance at 280 nm throughout the concentration process to monitor protein loss.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1180-Fig7.jpg",

Lipid bilayer apparatus set-up\n(A) Front, top, side and back views of custom-made Teflon measuring cuvette. It has a rectangular shape with the following dimensions: 49 mm length, 29 mm height, 21 mm width of the back (trans) side. The front (cis) side has a circular shape with a 40 mm diameter that has a glass wall insulated by an o-ring for viewing of the bilayer formation. The cuvette is partitioned into two equal compartments by a slightly inclined wall to prevent direct back light reflection. In the middle of the partition wall there is a thin-edged aperture with a diameter of 0.8 mm or 1.1 mm. The area of the opening is 0.5 mm2 or 0.95 mm2, accordingly.\n(B) Schematic of lipid bilayer apparatus experiments. Passage of ions across the bilayer can be detected, measured, and interpreted in resulting channel activity plots.\nNote: Concentrate samples slowly in short 2–5 min intervals at ∼1,000 rcf (or follow recommendations from manufacturer).\nNote: Between intervals, mix gently with pipette and be careful not to disrupt the filter membrane.",
    "Note: For problems that may arise during this procedure please refer to troubleshooting problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13] below.\nAssembly (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A): Mix gp15 and gp16 in a 3:1 molar ratio in GF buffer-I. Our best results were observed using 12.75 mM gp15 (1.44 mg) with 4.5 mM gp16 (0.856 mg) in a total volume of 1.3 mL. Mix by gently pipetting up and down a few times. Incubate on ice for 1 h.\nNote: For problems that may arise during this procedure please refer to troubleshooting problem 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15] below.\nComplex concentration: Concentrate the sample to one-third of the total volume using a 100 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter concentrator. Our best resulting sample was concentrated from 1.3 mL to 400 μL containing ∼2 mg. Concentrate in short intervals and mix by pipetting. Some precipitation may be observed.\nNote: For problems that may arise during this procedure please refer to troubleshooting problems 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13] and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15] below.\nGel Filtration (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B): Inject the complex sample on a calibrated analytical Superose 6 10/300 GL column equilibrated in GF buffer-I. Estimate the molecular weight of the resulting peaks and observe a shift for larger MW species compared to individual components. Run an SDS-PAGE gel for “inject” and peak fractions alongside a molecular weight standard to determine complex formation for fractions containing both components.\nOptional: For further evidence of interaction between DNA-ejectosome components gp15 and gp16, run a NativePAGE (Invitrogen) with individual components versus the complex and observe shifts in band migration. Follow manufacturer’s protocol for gel running conditions.\nStorage: The T7 periplasmic tunnel complex degrades over time and tends to aggregate if concentrated. Use within 1–3 days post-complex formation to avoid loss due to aggregation. Store at 4°C or on ice until use. Not recommended to flash freeze and store at −80°C.\nLipid bilayer experiments",
    "Timing: 8 h per protein sample\nNote: Refer to the workflow in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for an overview connecting the following sections: before you begin: optimize expression of internal virion proteins[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1], before you begin: purification of insoluble ejection protein T7 gp14[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3], step-by-step: lipid bilayer experiments[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], and step-by-step: sample preparation and screening for CryoEM studies[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3].\nLipid bilayer experiments are performed to determine if a protein has channel-forming properties (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). Detergent-solubilized channel-forming proteins insert into artificial lipid bilayers resulting in increase of measured conductance (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1180-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

Upward stepwise insertions are visible after protein addition indicating pore formation by gp14.

Let the chloroform evaporate for 15 min.\nTake 2 μL of priming lipid solution and apply around aperture at the front (cis) side. Let the chloroform evaporate for 15 min.",
    "Clean Ag/AgCl electrodes with water, then ethanol, then water, and dry by blotting with absorbent paper (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nNote: Electrodes are stored in 3M KCl solution between uses. When switching from one protein to another, it is recommended to clean electrodes by bathing them in pepsin solution (5% pepsin in 0.1 M HCl) for 2 h and then rinse well with water.\nFill the measuring cuvette with 10 mL of electrolyte solution (1 M KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nNote: Each side of the aperture has 5 ml volume. Start with the trans side. If solution does not come out to the cis side the aperture is clogged by the lipids. Use pipette tip to de-clog. The electrolyte solution should already have the measuring temperature at the beginning of the measurement, so that its specific conductivity does not increase due to an increase in temperature. It should therefore not be stored in the refrigerator, but at room temperature (20°C–22°C) or brought to room temperature beforehand.\nPlace electrodes into the measuring cuvette (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nPerform preliminary quality checks:\nVoltage source test: Set power source to 10 mV. Using a voltmeter connected to a trans side measure the voltage output, it should be 10 ± 0.5 mV.\nZero voltage test: Without applying voltage and bridged electrodes the reading should be 0 mV ± 0.03 mV.\nElectrode asymmetry test: In the case of differences in the concentration of the electrode filling solution, the electrodes themselves build up a voltage which is referred to as electrode asymmetry. If the bridging cable is attached, the electrode asymmetry will even out itself over time. Electrode asymmetry is measured without applied voltage and without bridging. The electrode asymmetry should not be more than 1 mV.\nSet voltage to -10 mV.",
    "Set up Keithley 428 current amplifier:\nGain: 106 V/A for membrane painting; 109 V/A for experiment recording.\nZero check: off position\nFilter rise time: 30 ms\nMake a membrane: The membrane is “painted’ on the trans side of the cuvette. Apply 3 μL of the painting lipid solution on the triangular-shaped Teflon loop. Slowly and gently move the loop up and down across the aperture on the back side of the cuvette. When the membrane is formed the ink needle of a chart recorder will go to zero position. Observe the appearance of black color in the aperture using light source and a scope.\nNote: Painting the membrane is one of the most difficult tasks of this method. It takes a certain amount of patience, and practice to master this step. One should therefore take their time, especially at the beginning.\nAssess the membrane stability: Before buffer or sample addition produce three separate membranes and record them for at least 15 min. These membranes are your baseline. This step ensures that priming of the cuvette went well, that all the components of the system are clean, and that there are no contaminations in the electrolyte solution (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A).\nNote: The first membrane will usually rupture by itself within first few minutes. This is normal. If subsequent membranes keep breaking it may indicate that the priming was inefficient or the painting solution is old. Replace the cuvette, painting solution, or repeat the cuvette priming process.",
    "Test the protein buffer: Once a stable baseline is recorded, add protein sample buffer to both sides of the cuvette and record three membranes for at least 15 min each. This step is used to exclude buffer components interference with the membrane stability. There should be no insertion-like events when only buffer is present in the cuvette (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nNote: It is recommended to start with 5 μl of buffer in the cuvette and end with 15 μl (0.05%–0.15% (v/v)). If later more protein sample (volume-wise) was added to the cuvette then repeat the protein buffer test with the same volume as in the added protein sample.\nTest the protein sample: Add protein of interest (ex. gp14) to both sides of the cuvette. When insertions occur, one will see a “jump” in the current. Record at least 100 insertions from several membranes (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C).\nNote: Start with 100 ng/ml of the protein (ex. gp14) in the cuvette. If no insertions are observed, paint new membrane and increase protein concentration in the cuvette. Determine optimal concentration of the protein for further experiments.\nAnalyze the recorded data using IGOR Pro 5.03 (WaveMetrics), make graphs with the SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software).\nNote: IGOR software uses a macro written by Dr. Harald Engelhardt (Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Munich, Germany) and converts the recorded voltage to the conductance using the formula:   G  =    V a   V e ∗ f v    ,  \nwhere G – conductance, Va – output voltage, Ve – applied voltage, fv – gain.\nSample preparation and screening for CryoEM studies\nTiming: 2–4 days\nNote: Both workflows in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] lead to this section. Refer to those workflows for previous steps.",
    "The successful assembly of T7 PT from purified gp15 and gp16 is validated by direct visualization using negative stain electron microscopy. After the PT is observed on a grid, several parameters should be screened for cryo-EM analysis, such as concentration, orientation, ice thickness, aggregation, and localization into holey carbon, all variables to optimize for high-resolution data collection. Here, we describe the steps taken to adjust these parameters.\nNegative stain sample preparation (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A): With purified individual components or gp15:gp16 complex, dilute to 0.01–0.05 mg/mL in the final gel filtration buffer or distilled water.\nPhysical charging: Glow discharge 2–4 nm carbon-coated 300 or 400-mesh copper grids (EMS) for 2 min at 25 mA in a vacuum chamber with the carbon-side facing up.\nNote: The carbon-side of a copper grid is usually darker and duller than the copper-side. Typically, sample is applied to the near-transparent carbon layer.\nAdsorption: While holding the glow-discharged grid by the edge with tweezers, pipette 2–4 μL onto the carbon side and allow adsorption for 1 min.\nNote: Reverse action tweezers are recommended for holding grids for longer periods of time and repetitive tasks.\nWashing: On a clean sheet of parafilm, pipette three 25 μL droplets of distilled water and two 25 μL droplets of 2 % uranyl acetate. Blot the excess sample from the grid with filter paper, then quickly wash the carbon-side of the grid by dabbing on the three water droplets.\nNote: When blotting, carefully touch the edges of the grid with the filter paper at a 90-degree angle. Do not use the torn edges of filter paper to avoid debris.",
    "Staining: Blot the excess water with filter paper and then hold the carbon-side of the grid on the first 2% uranyl acetate stain droplet for 10 s. Blot the excess stain with filter paper, and then hold on the second stain droplet for 1 min. Blot the excess.\nNote: Allow the grid to air-dry for at least 5 minutes before loading into a transmission electron microscope.\nCritical: Uranyl acetate is toxic and poses acute and chronic health hazards. Work with uranyl acetate in a fume hood, always wear gloves, and avoid inhalation or contact with skin.\nAlternatives: The choice of stain is sample dependent. Other staining reagents include uranyl formate, lanthanide acetate, ammonium molybdate, sodium phosphotungstate, and UranyLess (EMS).\nNegative stain TEM screening (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A): Load grids into a transmission electron microscope operated at 100–200 kV and observe sample particle distribution, purity, aggregation levels, conformational flexibility and heterogeneity of shape and size. Record micrographs for particle size analysis using ImageJ or processing with Relion for particle picking and 2D class average generation. Proceed to cryo-EM if sample quality is good (i.e., homogeneous particles, evenly distributed, with little to no aggregation).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1180-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Negative stain TEM and Cryo-EM screening\n(A) Diagram of negative stain TEM sample preparations.\n(B) Diagram of CryoEM sample preparations and representative screening of a vitrified grid.\nVitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Set-Up (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B):\nTurn on the vitrobot and attach blotting paper to the blotting pads inside the climate chamber.\nNote: The blotting paper needs to be replaced after a maximum of 16 blots.\nAttach the humidifier below the climate chamber and fill with 60 mL distilled water with a syringe through the tubing.\nOn the control screen, set the temperature and humidity of the climate chamber to 4°C and 100 percent humidity, respectively.",
    "Set blotting parameters on the control screen. These can be modified for each sample and grid.\nFill the coolant container peripheral ring with liquid nitrogen and allow all metal components to equilibrate.\nCritical: Liquid nitrogen may cause cryogenic burns or injury. Wear safety googles or a face shield and cryogenic gloves when handling liquid nitrogen.\nFill the central cup of the coolant container with liquid ethane and allow the ethane to cool until cloudy. Remove the metal spindle once the ethane is chilled.\nNote: Remove the metal spindle before the ethane solidifies. Solid ethane will bend your grids and could damage the tweezer and plunging apparatus.\nCritical: Liquid ethane is an extremely flammable gas and may cause cryogenic burns or injury. Avoid heat sources and wear safety googles or a face shield and cryogenic gloves when handling liquid ethane.\nLoad coolant container onto the platform ring and top off with liquid nitrogen in the peripheral ring during use.\nVitrification (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B): With purified individual components or gp15:gp16 complex, dilute to 1 mg/mL in the final gel filtration buffer or distilled water.\nPhysical charging: Glow discharge 300-mesh Quantifoil 1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids for 30 s at 25 mA in a vacuum chamber with the carbon-side facing up.\nAdsorption: Load grid on tweezers and raise the tweezer arm and coolant chamber using the control screen or foot pedal. Pipette 2.5 μL of 1 mg/mL sample through the sample port onto the grid. Allow adsorption for 10–60 s.\nBlotting and plunging: Adjust blotting parameters on the control screen for each grid/sample. Initiate the blotting/plunging procedure from the control screen or use the foot pedal.",
    "Note: We typically use 4–8 sec blot times with blot force 0-4. Wait and drain times are usually set to 0 sec. Blotting conditions for each sample were determined empirically.\nGrid transfer: Carefully disconnect the tweezers from the central axis without letting the grid touch the sides of the central cup. Quickly transfer the grid from the central cup to the peripheral ring filled with liquid nitrogen then carefully drop the grid into a slot of a grid storage box.\nNote: Any bent grids should be discarded.\nRepeat to prepare grids for each sample and conditions of interest.\nCryo-EM screening (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B): Load grids into cryo-electron microscope operated at 200 kV–300 kV and observe ice conditions, sample particle distribution, purity, aggregation levels, conformational flexibility and heterogeneity of shape and size. Record micrographs for particle size analysis using ImageJ or processing with Relion for particle picking and 2D class average generation. Proceed to cryo-EM data collection if grid and sample quality is good (i.e., homogeneous particles, evenly distributed, with little to no aggregation).\nOptional: If screening or loading into cryo-electron microscopes with an autoloader, use Autogrid C-clip rings and Autogrid C-clips for clipping and docking grids."
