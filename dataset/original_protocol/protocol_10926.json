    "1. Subjects\nRats\n\t\nOrder rats to arrive when they are approximately 90 days old and single-housed in standard rat cages.\n\t\tNote: Single housing is advised, as group housing produces variability due to interactions between animals in the home cage, particularly following stress exposure. SEFL has been demonstrated in male and female rats, in Long-Evans and Sprague Dawley rats, and in rats as young as 19 days old7,10.\nRandomly assign animals to at least two conditions: trauma (n = 8) and no trauma (n = 8) (see Rau et al.5 for additional control conditions).\nMice\n\t\nOrder mice to arrive when they are approximately 60 days old and single-housed in standard mouse cages. Single-house the mice for at least 4 weeks prior to trauma as well as throughout the experiment duration.\nRandomly assign animals to at least two conditions: trauma (n = 8) and no trauma (n = 8).\n2. Equipment Setup\nSet up one set of fear-conditioning chambers to serve as Context A and a second set of fear-conditioning chambers to serve as Context B (see Materials Table). Place each fear-conditioning chamber inside a sound-attenuating cubicle to prevent intrusion of outside noise (see Materials Table).\n\t\nEnsure that a method of illuminating the chambers with visible light (such as a white overhead house light) is present in the chambers serving as Context A (see Materials Table).\nEnsure that different solutions are available to clean the chambers between each animal and provide different odors for each chamber (e.g., diluted cleaning solution and 1% acetic acid).\n\t\tNote: It is critical that animal-generated odors be eliminated11.\nPlace plastic inserts in Context B to differentiate the internal layout of the two contexts. A black Plexiglas triangular insert is recommended. Alternatively, use a white plastic sheet to create a curved back wall (see Materials Table).",
    "Place grid floors in each fear conditioning chamber for footshock delivery, using a different grid pattern for each context to differentiate floor texture between contexts (see Materials Table).\n\t\tNote: Sufficiently distinct grid patterns include flat grids (all bars arranged in a single horizontal plane), staggered grids (bars arranged in two offset horizontal planes), and alternating grids (bars arranged in a single horizontal plane but of varying diameters).\nPlace clean metal pans beneath each grid floor to collect droppings. Scent pans with the cleaning solution (see Materials Table).\nProvide accurate timing and amplitude of footshock delivery for each context.\n\t\nConnect a shock generator and scrambler capable of delivering 1 mA or lower amplitude shocks to each grid floor for footshock delivery (see Materials Table).\n\t\tNote: The shock generators and scramblers should be located outside of the sound attenuating chamber, with cables connecting the generators and scrambler to the grid floors via openings in the sound attenuating chamber. This will prevent damage due to chewing, cleaning solution, etc.\nUse a multimeter to test the current being delivered by the shock generator by placing each probe on a different bar of the grid floor and confirming that the desired shock amplitude is produced (see Materials Table).\nEnsure that a method for controlling the timing and amplitude of shock delivery (e.g., computer software) is available (see Materials Table).\nEnsure that a method for video-recording each animal during each experimental session is available (see Materials Table).\n\tNote: It will be necessary to record both 1) when the chambers are illuminated by visible light and 2) when the chambers are dark. The latter can be accomplished by either using a night vision camera or illuminating and recording the darkened chambers using infrared or near-infrared light.",
    "Ensure that a distinctive method of transporting animals from the vivarium to Context B is available to further differentiate the two contexts.\n\tNote: While methods such as a black plastic tub (38 x 30 x 24 cm) divided into four compartments or clean empty cages have been successfully used, any other transport box that is distinctly different from the home cage can be used.\n3. SEFL Procedure for Rats and Mice\nHandle all rodents daily by gently removing them from the homecage and holding each for 60-90 seconds for at least 7 days before beginning the SEFL procedure.\nOn Day 1 of the SEFL procedure, place subjects in Context A, where they will receive the traumatic stressor.\n\t\nSet up Context A with one set of grid floors (e.g., flat grids) and illuminate the chambers with visible light.\nUse a multimeter to test the current being delivered by the shock generator by placing each probe on a different bar of the grid floor and confirming that the desired shock amplitude is produced.\n\t\tNote: Damage or corrosion of the bars can result in weak or uneven shock delivery. Liquids including urine touching the grid along the wall can also adversely affect shock delivery.\nWipe down the chamber walls and doors and spray the pans beneath the grid floors with one solution (e.g., diluted cleaning solution).\n\t\tNote: This is necessary to eliminate odors from the previous animals.\nTransport animals from the vivarium to the experimental room in their home cages placed on a cart and place individually into the fear conditioning chambers. Only bring one round’s worth of animals (determined by the number of fear conditioning chambers) to the experiment room at a time.",
    "Note: To avoid confounds due to order or timing, each round should contain animals in both the trauma and no trauma conditions.\nFor rat experiments, use the shock generator and scramblers to deliver 15 1-s, 1-mA footshocks randomly presented over 90 minutes (average ISI = 6 min) through the grid bars of the chambers containing trauma condition subjects. Expose the no trauma controls to the same context for 90 minutes without shock delivery.\nFor mouse experiments, use the shock generator and scramblers to deliver 10 1-s, 1-mA footshocks randomly presented over 60 minutes (average ISI = 6 min) through the grid floors of the chambers containing trauma condition subjects. Expose the no trauma controls to the same context for 60 minutes without shock delivery.\nAfter 90 minutes (rat experiments) or 60 minutes (mouse experiments), return all animals to their homecages and promptly return to the vivarium.\nOn Day 2 of the SEFL procedure, assess the fear to the trauma context if desired.\n\t\nSet up Context A as done on Day 1.\nTransport animals to the experiment room in their home cages as on Day 1.\nPlace animals in Context A for 8 minutes without shock delivery and video record the behavior during the entire session.\nAfter 8 minutes, return all animals to their homecages and promptly return to the vivarium.\nOn Day 3 of the SEFL procedure, expose all subjects to the mild stressor in Context B.\n\tNote: This procedure can occur anywhere from 24 hours to 90 days after the traumatic stressor9.",
    "Set up Context B with a different set of grid floors from the ones used in Context A (e.g., alternating or staggered grid floors) and black triangular or white curved Plexiglas inserts. Do not illuminate the chambers with visible light; although, infrared or near-infrared light can be used as necessary.\nUse a multimeter to test the current being delivered by the shock generator by placing each probe on a different bar of the grid floor and confirming that the desired shock amplitude is produced. Use a multimeter to test the current being delivered by the shock generator by placing each probe on a different bar of the grid floor and confirming that the desired shock amplitude is produced.\n\t\tNote: Damage or corrosion of the bars can result in weak or uneven shock delivery. Liquids including urine touching the grid along the wall can also adversely affect shock delivery.\nWipe down the chambers and spray the pans beneath the grid floors with the solution not used in Context A (e.g., 1% acetic acid).\nTransport animals from the vivarium to the experimental room in a method distinct from the method used for Context A (e.g., a black plastic tub) and place them individually into fear conditioning chambers. Only bring one round’s worth of animals to the experiment room at a time (determined by the number of fear conditioning chambers).\nExpose all animals to the mild stressor (described below) and video record freezing and activity during the session.\n\t\t\nAfter a 180-s baseline period, deliver either a single 1-s, 1-mA footshock (rats) or a single 2-s, 1-mA footshock (mice) to all animals.\n\t\t\tNote: Ensure that during the 180-s baseline period freezing should not exceed 5%12.\nRemove all animals 30 seconds after shock delivery and promptly return to vivarium.",
    "On Day 4 of the SEFL procedure, test fear to the mild stressor context.\n\t\nSet up Context B as done on Day 3.\nTransport animals from the vivarium to the experimental room in the same transport as done on Day 3.\nPlace animals in Context B for 8 minutes without shock delivery and video record freezing throughout the session.\nRemove all animals after 8 minutes and promptly return to the vivarium.\n4. Data Analysis\nMeasure fear during the recorded experimental sessions using freezing, defined as the lack of all movement except that which is needed for respiration.\n\tNote: Freezing is scored most accurately by a blind human scorer, but there are several automated programs that perform well. However, all automated systems must be calibrated to a human observer to be accurate13.\n\t\nTo score freezing by hand, have an experimenter blind to experimental conditions observes the subject every 4 seconds throughout the time period of interest3. At each observation, classify the subject as “freezing” or “not freezing”. Compare the number of freezing observations to the total number of observations to determine the percent time spent freezing.\nTo use automated video analysis to score freezing, first verify that the results from automated video analysis match the results obtained from hand-scoring, as a substantially different freezing score from automated analysis may produce inaccurate results.\n\t\tNote: A rat or a mouse that has never been shocked should show freezing between 0 and 5%, while higher values suggest poor calibration of the equipment\nUse the methods described above to measure fear during the time periods of interest (described below).\n\t\nMeasure fear to the trauma context as the percent time spent freezing across the entire 8-min test session on Day 2.",
    "Measure generalization of fear from the trauma context to the mild stressor context as the percent time spent freezing during the 3-min baseline period in Context B on Day 3 prior to shock delivery.\n\t\tNote: For SEFL, it is important to differentiate the contexts well enough so that there is not substantial generalization.\nMeasure fear immediately following the shock on Day 3 as the percent time spent freezing during the 30-s period that follows the shock.\nMeasure fear to the mild stressor context as the percent spent time across the entire 8-min test session on Day 4.\nMeasure shock reactivity by the amount, or velocity, of movement during the 3-s period during and immediately following the shock on Day 3.\n\tNote: ANOVAs are recommended for all data analysis, as additional groups (e.g., drug treatment) can be added as necessary.\nSubscription Required.
