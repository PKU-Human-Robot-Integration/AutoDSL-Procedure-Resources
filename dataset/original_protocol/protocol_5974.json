    "Notes: Figure 1 outlines the workflow of the procedure to provide an overview of the individual steps. This protocol does not require a sterile technique, but sterile equipment and reagents are used whenever possible, to minimize potential contamination and foster cell viability. Sterilize dissection tools with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol (glass beaker). Let tools dry off before use. Pre-chill endothelial cell buffer (see Recipes) and 6 cm Petri dish on ice. Thaw 25% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (see Recipes) in a 37 °C water bath, mix well by gently inverting the tube and immediately put on ice when thawed. Thaw and pre-warm 2,400 U/ml collagenase II (see Recipes) in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min before use. Cool centrifuge to 4 °C. The yield of this protocol is highly dependent on the correct choice of volumes and tube sizes. The protocol described below is designed for isolating cells from a pool of four adult mouse brains (see Notes). For additional brains/experimental groups add extra sample tubes to the process. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181114/20181114224713_6905.jpgFigure 1. Protocol overview for purification of murine brain endothelial cells isolated from cortices/hippocampi of adult mice. For details refer to Procedure A-H as indicated in this workflow chart. The image contains graphic elements from Motifolio toolkit.Brain tissue harvestSacrifice adult mice using carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation (adhere to institutional guidelines). Harvest up to four brains at a time.Spray the head/neck area with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol and remove the head from the torso using sharp surgical scissors (Figure 2). Carefully dissect the brain from the skull at room temperature. It is critical to preserve the integrity of the brain tissue, as cutting into or puncturing the tissue may lead to difficulties during the meningeal removal and the cortex/hippocampi dissection.",
    "Use blunt scissors to cut open the skull along the left and right side (enter through the spinal cord extension), while pushing the tip of the scissors gently outwards (Figure 2). Carefully lift the upper part of the skull few millimeters and make another cut half way through the middle of the skull and strip away the skull pieces side using forceps (Figure 2). Use the small spatula to remove the brain from the skull (Figure 2).Place brains in a 6 cm Petri dish on ice and add ice cold endothelial cell buffer to cover (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181114/20181114224737_2109.jpgFigure 2. Brain tissue harvest. Illustration of the brain tissue harvest procedure described in Procedure A (adult wild-type Balb/c mouse). Step 1 is animal sacrifice.Notes: From here on, process only one brain at a time until noted otherwise.  Ensure that the dissection process described in this section does not take longer than 15 min per brain. While practicing the technique, chill tissue covered in endothelial cell buffer on ice in-between steps to preserve cell viability. Alternatively, tissue dissection may be performed in a Petri dish on ice if the microscope setup allows. However, meninges will be easier to identify on a dark background. Cortex/hippocampi dissectionTransfer the brain to an empty 10 cm Petri dish to remove the cerebellum (including pons and medulla if applicable) and the olfactory bulb using a scalpel, while carefully stabilizing the brain with forceps.Place the brain onto an autoclaved sheet of Whatman filter paper and gently roll over the surface using a sterile spatula to crudely remove the meningeal layers surrounding the brain (Figure 3). Since brain tissue is soft and sticky, ensure to carefully separate it from the filter paper using a small spatula during rolling to minimize tissue loss.",
    "Cortical/hippocampal microvessels have distinct phenotypical properties that differ from those of meningeal vessels and inclusion of the later results in contamination with undesired endothelial cell populations.Use the small spatula (not forceps) to transfer the tissue onto a 10 cm Petri dish and cover it with ice cold endothelial cell buffer.Place the dish under a binocular microscope and continue to manually remove the remaining meninges using Ceramic Coated Dumont #5 forceps, while stabilizing the tissue with another set of forceps (Dumont #3 or #5) (Figure 3). Despite the fact that the meninges may be hard to see, as they are delicate and mostly transparent, aim to remove all meningeal structures. Pay particular attention to “red-colored” tissue areas, as they indicate erythrocyte-filled blood vessels, which form a network throughout the meningeal layers and therefore serve as an indicator as to which areas have to be cleaned from meninges.Separate the hemispheres with a clean cut along the interhemispheric fissure using a sterile scalpel blade (Figure 3).Transfer one hemisphere into a Petri dish with endothelial cell buffer on ice and continue to dissect the cortex and hippocampus of the remaining half.Grab a small area of the “whitish” brain tissue–previously enclosed by the cortices including midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, caudate putamen, ventral striatum, anterior olfactory nucleus, and other brain regions not listed here–in the posterior region with Dumont forceps #3 or #5. Then stab onto the tissue below in an almost parallel angle to the bench top, to cause incision using the Dumont forceps #5 like scissors (Figure 3). Keep cutting along the slightly more “pinkish” cortex until the undesired “whitish” tissue is removed. Ideally, you see the rim surface of the cortex and the embedded hippocampus after this dissection (Figure 3).",
    "However, if this is not the case, continue to remove undesired tissue parts piece by piece. Continue to remove meninges in the medial longitudinal fissure and flip over the hemisphere to thoroughly inspect and clean-up the other side of the cortex as well.Transfer cortex/hippocampus to a clean Petri dish on ice filled with endothelial cell buffer.Go through Steps B6 to B9 for the second hemisphere and thereafter start over at Step B1 with the next brain until all brains have been processed (~two hours total for 2 x 4 brains; do not exceed 3 h for this part of the procedure, as cell viability will be affected).Thereafter, process pooled tissue.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181114/20181114224755_3280.jpgFigure 3. Selected steps of the cortex/hippocampus dissection described in Procedure B. Bottom right image illustrates the location of the hippocampus indicated by the green dotted line. Tissue homogenization and primary digestion Wash the pooled brain tissue three times by repeatedly adding endothelial cell buffer, swirling the Petri dish, followed by careful aspiration using a vacuum pump.After the last aspiration, mince the tissue using two sterile scalpels into small pieces until a homogenous emulsion has formed.Add 4 ml endothelial cell buffer to the Petri dish and resuspend the tissue by pipetting up and down with a 10 ml pipette. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 ml Falcon tube kept on ice.Repeat Steps C3 and C4 two more times to rinse the Petri dish and top off with endothelial cell buffer to 15 ml.Centrifuge cell suspension for 7 min at 300 x g at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant using a vacuum pump. Estimate the volume of your tissue pellet (typically ~1.5 ml) and add endothelial cell buffer as well as pre-warmed collagenase II in a 1:1:1 ratio. Pipette gently up and down using a 5 ml pipette.",
    "Incubate the enzyme mixture in a 37 °C water bath for 50 min and thoroughly shake the tube after 25 and 50 min of incubation to homogenize the suspension until no white clumps are visible.Stop the enzymatic digestion (~4.5 ml volume) by adding endothelial cell buffer to 15 ml and mix suspension by thoroughly pipetting up and down.Centrifuge cell suspension for 7 min at 300 x g at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant using a vacuum pump. Myelin removal and erythrocyte depletionAdd 3 ml 25% BSA and transfer to a new 15 ml tube. Rinse the original tube one more time with 3 ml 25% BSA and then top off to 15 ml, thoroughly mixing the suspension with a 10 ml pipette.Centrifuge for 30 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C in order to separate the myelin (top) and to enrich for capillary fragments (bottom) (Figure 1D).Aspirate the myelin layer with a vacuum pump. Before removing the clear BSA supernatant, switch to a new tip to minimize residual myelin in the cell pellet.To deplete erythrocytes, incubate the pellet in 2 ml Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer for 90 s at room temperature with occasional shaking. Add 1 ml Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer with a P1000 pipette, transfer suspension to a new 15 ml Falcon tube, and rinse the tube one more time with Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer 1 ml and combine. Inhibit cell lysis by adding 13 ml endothelial cell buffer and put sample back on ice.Centrifuge cell suspension for 7 min at 300 x g at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant using a vacuum pump and leave ~2 ml in the tube. Use a 1 ml pipette to carefully remove the remaining supernatant.",
    "Secondary digestion–single cell suspensionResuspend the cell pellet in 2 ml endothelial cell buffer and transfer cell suspension to a new 15 ml Falcon tube.To digest the microvessel fragments into a single cell suspension, add 1 mg/ml Collagenase/Dispase and incubate the mixture in a 37 °C water bath for 13 min.Notice the formation of endothelial microvessel fragment aggregates clustered by DNA. Add 1 μg/ml DNase I, pipette up and down a few times until the microvessels are dissociated using a P1000 pipette, and incubate for an additional 2 min in the 37 °C water bath. To quench the digestion reaction, add 13 ml endothelial cell buffer and mix by gently inverting the tube (do not pipette up and down).Centrifuge cell suspension for 10 min at 300 x g at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant using a vacuum pump and leave ~2 ml in the tube. Use a 1 ml pipette to carefully remove the remaining supernatant and store cell pellet on ice.Resuspend the pelleted cells in FACS buffer (see Recipes). The total resuspension volume should be 200 μl per antibody cocktail FACS sample plus 50 µl for the unstained control (for additional controls see Notes section below). Distribute the resuspended cells into appropriately labeled 1.5 ml tubes for the antibody cocktail FACS sample (200 µl) and the unstained control (50 µl) and store on ice.Notes: Important controls for FACS parameter setup include single-color positive controls, to compensate for channel spillover. Since the sample cell numbers are a limiting factor, we recommend using compensation beads in combination with an unstained cell sample control to set up forward and side scatter. We further recommend to establish proper gating using FMO (fluorescence minus one) controls, in which cells are stained with all antibodies except one.",
    "This is particularly important for initial FACS setup and should be repeated when using new antibody batches, as signal intensity may vary from batch to batch. For detailed information see Tung et al. (2007).  Plan to run an experiment just for establishing these settings on your FACS device. In our hands, the procedure is highly reproducible and saved experimental settings with minor adjustments may be used for subsequent experiments, maximizing the available cell sample for sorting.  Immunostaining for FACS Label 5 ml FACS test tubes for each fluorochrome used in the experiment plus one for unstained control and add 150 µl FACS buffer per tube (compensation controls).Mix UltraComp eBeads by vigorously inverting at least 10 times and add three drops to a 1.5 ml tube and add 100 µl FACS buffer.Apply 50 µl of the diluted compensation bead dilution to each compensation control tube.Add antibodies at the same dilution (see Recipes) used for FACS sample staining (chose one antibody for PerCP-Cy5.5).Mix well by flicking the tube and incubate on ice for 20 min in the dark.Add all antibodies as indicated to the antibody cocktail FACS sample (see Recipes) and carefully mix by pipetting up and down using a P100 pipette (avoid bubbles).Incubate on ice for 30 min in the dark.During the incubation time, prepare collection tubes for desired downstream application:RNA extraction: prepare two 1.5 ml screw cap tubes with 750 µl RLT Plus lysis buffer each (see manufacturer guidelines). Ensure that the volume is not significantly lower than 750 µl as a ratio lower than 1:1 of lysis buffer to sorted sample may result in reduced RNA quality. Keep collection tubes at room temperature.Intact cells: prepare two 1.5 ml screw cap tubes with 500 µl FBS each and chill on ice.",
    "Wash off excess antibodies by adding 1 ml FACS buffer to each tube (FACS sample as well as compensation beads) and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g at 4 °C.Decant supernatant of compensation beads tubes.Carefully aspirate FACS sample supernatant using a P1000 and then P200 pipette. Resuspend FACS sample pellet in 300 µl and compensation beads in 200 µl FACS buffer.Keep compensation controls on ice and in the dark until FACS.Add 150 µl FACS buffer to the unstained cell sample kept on ice and mix well as above. Ensure to dissociate potential sample cell aggregates using a P200 pipette before transferring the FACS samples onto the blue filter cap of a 5 ml Test Tube with Cell Strainer.Spin cells through the filter for 2 min at 300 x g at 4 °C and store samples on ice in the dark.Transport samples and a 1:10 propidium iodide (PI) pre-dilution (in FACS buffer) to the FACS facility. Keep cells on ice and in the dark at all times.Notes: This protocol does not cover detailed instructions for FACS parameter setup. For assistance, please contact your FACS core facility manager or FACS machine vendor. Use a 100 µm nozzle. While sorting, keep the threshold rate around or below 100x the value of the set frequency (typically fewer than 2,800 events per second). Estimated sort time is 15-20 min per stained sample.  10%-25% of total events are CD31/MECA-99+ brain endothelial cells; sorted brain endothelial cell count ranges from 1-5 x 105 cells; average count from four adult mice: 3 x 105 cells. FACS and sample collectionRun unstained cells to set up forward (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A) (Figure 4).Run single-color controls to set FACS parameters and compensate for channel spillover.Add 1:3,000 (1:300 from 1:10 pre-dilution; equals 0.",

Quality control of FACS sorted cell populations from the murine brain. A-D. Microvascular tubes (MVT) were isolated (Fisher et al., 2007) and seeded on fibronectin-coated glass slides for double immunohistochemistry staining of brain endothelial marker CD31, pericyte marker Desmin, and astrocytic markers GFAP and Aqp4 indicating insufficient cell separation using mechanical tissue dissociation.

Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptomes of brain capillary endothelial cell (CAP), pericyte (PC), astrocyte (AC), and microglia (MG) single cell populations isolated using flow cytometry. For purification of CAP and PC populations, the outlined protocol was applied, while ACs and MGs were isolated using an unpublished method. PCA was calculated for normalized EVs with a difference of at least two-fold between any pair of samples (P < 0.05 [one-way ANOVA]) and with raw expression (EV) of >140 in 100% of replicates of at least one sample population. Numbers in parentheses indicate the proportion of total variability calculated for each principal component (PC).
