Store the prepared solution at 4°C.\nCritical: As tamoxifen is sensitive to light, it must be made and stored away from light in an amber or foil-wrapped tube.\nNote: Tamoxifen may take 1–7 h to completely dissolve depending on the dissolution method.\nInject tamoxifen into nestin:GCaMP3 mice.\nSelect an appropriate number of adult nestin:GCaMP3 mice.\nNote: The definition of “adult” is usually determined by sexual maturity, which is commonly accepted to be ∼6 weeks of age for mice. Older or younger mice can be used if needed. However, older mice have lower levels of adult neurogenesis, which decreases the success rate of imaging, whereas younger mice might be too delicate to survive the necessary surgical procedures.\nAdminister tamoxifen (120 mg/kg) into the intraperitoneal cavity five times at 1- or 2-day intervals. Store the solution at 4°C until the next injection.\nCritical: Avoid using tamoxifen that has been stored for more than 1 week. The efficiency of tamoxifen-induced recombination is severely impaired when using old or light-exposed tamoxifen.\nNote: The duration of the injection period is correlated with the degree of developmental variation of labeled ABNs. That is, the longer the injection period, the higher the chance of recording ABNs with different properties resulting from differences in their maturational stages.\nMaturation of labeled ABNs\nTiming: dependent on experimental design\nAllow ABNs to mature after tamoxifen injection.",
    "Wait a pre-determined period of time to allow GCaMP3-labeled ABNs to mature.\nNote: The length of the waiting period depends on the target age of ABNs at the time of Ca2+ imaging. Keep in mind that 1–2 weeks is needed to prepare for imaging. For example, if the target age of ABNs is 6 weeks, wait 4 weeks after tamoxifen injection to move on to the next step. If the target age of ABNs is 1 week or less, consider performing lens implantation before tamoxifen injection. So far, we have successfully performed Ca2+ imaging of ABNs as early as 3 days after the last tamoxifen injection.\nNote: GCaMP3 expression can be verified by examining brain sections from a tamoxifen-injected mouse using a fluorescence microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) before the next step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Note: We describe a specific protocol for imaging ABNs in the dentate gyrus (DG) in freely moving mice. The original miniscope technology used in this protocol was first developed by Ghosh et al., (2011)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]. For a more generalized protocol to image other brain regions, please refer to Resendez et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] for a recent overview. In vivo Ca2+ imaging of ABNs in the DG was first described by Danielson et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] in awake head-fixed mice.\nNote: We implanted EEG/EMG electrodes to identify sleep stages in combination with ABNs activity. Mammalian sleep contains two major orthogonal states: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Each sleep stage is characterized by prominent neural oscillatory patterns. For example, slow waves in the cortex are abundant during deep NREM sleep, whereas theta oscillations in the hippocampus occur during REM sleep, both of which play critical roles in memory consolidation (Boyce et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Marshall et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Details of sleep recording and analysis are available in Oishi et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17].\nAnesthetize the mouse with an anesthetic of choice (e.g., isoflurane).\nOpen a cranial window sufficiently large for lens and electrode implantation.\nShave hair from the surgical site.\nSecure the head of the mouse in a stereotaxic frame.\nCover the eyes of the mouse with white petrolatum cream to prevent dryness.\nDisinfect the skin at the surgical site.\nMake a small incision in the skin using a spring scissor along the sagittal line of the skull.\nClean the exposed skull with cotton swabs.\nScratch the skull surface using a drill bit to make it rough, which will facilitate later adhesion of glue and dental cement.",
    "Obtain a flat skull position by matching the height of two parallel points along the sagittal axis (±3 mm lateral from bregma) as well as the height of bregma and lambda points.\nMark the desired stereotaxic coordinates for the GRIN lens and EEG electrodes on the skull surface using the stereotaxic manipulator.\nDrill five holes in the skull: one for the GRIN lens, two over one hemisphere for EEG electrodes, and two over the contralateral hemisphere for anchoring electrodes (i.e., not attached to EEG wires; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 00:00–00:30).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Positions of the four screws and hole for the gradient-index (GRIN) lens\nThe blue arrow indicates the GRIN lens position. The green arrowhead indicates bregma.\nNote: The electrode holes should be just large enough to accommodate the tip of the electrodes. In Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], the holes were drilled above the frontal and parietal cortices on both sides of skull as an example: anteroposterior (AP) +1.5 mm and −3 mm and mediolateral (ML) ±1.5 mm and ±1.7 mm, respectively. The anchoring electrodes prevent the implant from becoming detached at later points in the experimental protocol.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S1. Drilling holes for implanting the GRIN lens and EEG electrodes, refer to steps 5j and k and 6a\nMake a cranial window for GRIN lens implantation using a drill (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 00:30–00:41).\nNote: The cranial window should be just large enough to accommodate the GRIN lens implant. We recommend using an Inscopix GRIN lens 1 mm in diameter and 4 mm in length to record ABNs in the dorsal DG. In this case, a 1.2-mm2 cranial window centered at AP −2 mm and ML +0.7 mm works well.\nImplant the EEG electrodes, anchoring screws, and GRIN lens.",
    "Insert the EEG electrodes and anchoring screws epidurally (i.e., not completely penetrating the skull; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 00:42–01:31).\nFor the lens hole, aspirate cortical tissue above the region of interest using a glass pipette connected to a vacuum pump in circular movements from the center to the periphery of the cranial window (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], 00:00–00:36). While aspirating the cortex, the brain tissue will first have a homogeneous appearance. Stop aspiration when white matter tracts of the corpus callosum and alveus hippocampus are visible as identified by striations (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. White matter tracts with white striations exposed during aspiration of cortical tissue\nThe area of white matter tracts is surrounded by the light blue dotted line. The cranial window (blue dotted line) is larger than the exposed area. Scale bar, 1 mm.\nNote: From this point onward, some bleeding is normal during the procedure. Continuously irrigate the exposed brain tissue with sterile saline while aspirating the cortex (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], 00:13–00:23).\nCritical: A surgical microscope is needed to observe distinctions in brain structure during surgery. In our experience, damaging the CA1 by aspiration usually destroys the structural organization of the DG.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S2. Aspirating cortical tissue for GRIN lens implantation, refer to step 6b and c\nAfter reaching the corpus callosum fibers, keep the exposed brain tissue irrigated with sterile saline while aspirating any blood present in the region to maintain visibility (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], 00:37–00:53).\nAttach a GRIN lens to a stereotaxic manipulator using a clip holder (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) and align it above the center of the cranial window (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], 00:00–00:15).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Setup for GRIN lens insertion",
    "A GRIN lens (blue arrow) is held by a clip holder (green arrow) and inserted into the hippocampus.\nNote: We made a lens holder by gluing a generic spring clip holder to the base of a manipulator bar. We recommend holding the GRIN lens at the tip (∼0.5-mm length) of the clip holder and keeping the lens straight (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], 00:00–00:09).\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S3. Implanting the GRIN lens, refer to step 6d–h\nCarefully lower the lens using 0.1-mm dorso-ventral steps into the hippocampus. The final coordinate of the objective surface of the GRIN lens is 1.3 mm lower than the top of the skull (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], 00:16–00:34).\nNote: We lower the lens at a rate of ∼500 μm/min. Tissue swelling and relaxation affect the quality of subsequent recordings. We do not recommend using a smaller diameter lens because the resulting reduction in field of view makes it substantially more difficult to observe a population of ABNs that is sparse in both number and activity.\nFix the GRIN lens to the skull and all four screws with a thin layer of cyanoacrylate adhesive (Loctite 454, referred to henceforth as Loctite glue) and allow it to cure for ∼5–10 min (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], 00:35–00:53).\nNote: We find that adding dental cement liquid on top of Loctite glue rapidly solidifies the adhesive and reduces this step to a few minutes.\nRelease the lens from the stereotaxic manipulator (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], 00:54–01:00).\nCover the skull using a layer of Loctite glue and dental cement liquid around the insertion point (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], 01:00–01:23) and allow it to completely cure.",
    "Attach the EEG/EMG socket to the skull using Loctite glue, add a drop of dental cement liquid, and allow it to completely cure (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4], 00:00–00:11).\nCritical: The EEG/EMG socket should be fixed far enough from the lens to avoid later collision between the socket and microscope.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S4. Implanting EEG/EMG electrodes, refer to step 6i–7\nInsert two wires into the cervical portion of the trapezoid muscles for EMG recording (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4], 00:12–00:33).\nApply carbon black powder-mixed dental cement (liquid + powder) to any exposed area of the skull as well as to the area where the Loctite glue meets the GRIN lens and EEG/EMG wires and let it solidify for ∼10 min (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4], 00:34–00:49).\nCritical: Completely cover the EEG/EMG wires with Loctite glue to prevent damage when the mouse scratches its head (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Electrodes and GRIN lens fixed with dental cement\nThe skull and electroencephalogram (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG) wires are completely covered with black dental cement. Note that the EEG/EMG socket (green arrow) and GRIN lens (blue arrow) are not covered.\nApply Loctite glue to the outer border of the dental cement to connect it to the surrounding skin and wait until it completely cures (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4], 00:50–01:00).\nCover the GRIN lens and surrounding area with silicone to protect it from damage resulting from mouse activity in the home cage (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4], 01:01–01:12).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. GRIN lens and the surrounding area covered with silicone\nThe silicone is indicated by dotted line.",
    "Optional: Attach a rectangular metal frame (12 × 19 × 1 mm) to the skull using dental cement and let it solidify for 5 min. This frame will prevent the mouse from scratching the lens and aid in manipulating the awake mouse when attaching the miniaturized fluorescent microscope (miniscope) and EEG/EMG cables before recording.\nFinish the surgical procedure.\nStop anesthesia.\nRemove the mouse from the stereotaxic holder.\nAdminister postoperative 5% glucose solution and ibuprofen (30 mg/kg).\nPlace the mouse in a clean cage partially covering a heating pad to prevent hypothermia and allow it to recover.\nHouse the operated mouse individually to avoid damage to the implant.\nNote: To prepare ibuprofen (30 mg/kg) solution, dissolve 30 mg ibuprofen powder in 100 μL of 100% ethanol, add 1 mL sunflower oil, and evaporate the ethanol by centrifuging.\nPostoperative recovery\nTiming: at least 1 week\nAllow operated mice to rest for at least 1 week with minimal manipulation.\nNote: We recommend keeping mice in the sleeping chamber/room during recovery to habituate them to the environment.\nNote: Manipulation of mice during this period may cause detachment of the lens and electrodes, as some degree of inflammation might still be present, making the implant more vulnerable to detachment from the skull.\nMiniscope baseplate attachment\nTiming: 30 min per mouse\nAttach a magnetic baseplate for the miniscope to lens-implanted mice.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an anesthetic of choice (e.g., isoflurane).\nSecure the head of the mouse in the stereotaxic frame.\nPrepare the miniscope.\nAttach the magnetic baseplate to the miniscope.\nSecure the miniscope to its gripper tool and attach it to a micromanipulator.\nConnect the recording hardware to the computer.\nPosition the miniscope above the head of the mouse.\nStart the image acquisition software.\nAttach the magnetic baseplate.",
    "Remove the silicone protection from the skull of the mouse.\nAdjust the position of the miniscope using the micromanipulator, centering it above the implanted lens.\nTurn on the LED light of the miniscope and lower it until the top surface of the lens becomes visible through the camera.\nCarefully continue lowering the miniscope until the DG becomes visible.\nNote: The DG will be recognizable by its abundant vasculature. Due to GCaMP3 expression in ABNs and our implantation method, this will be the first focusable structure.\nFrom this point, to adjust the imaging focus to the granular/subgranular layer, lower the miniscope ∼50 μm. The vasculature should become slightly out of focus at this point (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Fluorescent signals from the DG observed through the GRIN lens\nThe DG is shown (A) without or (B) with ΔF/F processing. Red arrows indicate vasculature, and the blue arrowhead indicates a Ca2+ transient in an ABN. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nOptional: When the outlines of GCaMP3-expressing ABNs can be visualized, we recommend switching to the nVista software ΔF/F function to confirm the presence of dynamic changes in fluorescence corresponding to Ca2+ transients (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nNote: Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of GCaMP3 and the small number of ABNs labeled using our protocol, the fluorescence signal from ABNs may be undetectable at this point. It may still be possible to observe ABN activity with post-recording processing of the images. The success rate is ∼50%.\nAfter choosing the optimal focal plane, secure the baseplate to the skull using dental cement (liquid + power) and allow it to completely cure (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8], Methods Video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Black baseplate secured above the GRIN lens using black dental cement\n(A) Top view.",
    "(B) Rear view. Note that the screw (blue arrows) and the surface of the baseplate are not covered by dental cement.\nCritical: When fixing the baseplate, there are three points at which dental cement should not be directly applied: the surface of the implanted lens, the screw for the magnetic baseplate, and the miniscope.\nNote: Fixing the baseplate without gaps will prevent dust and ambient illumination from interfering with the field of view during imaging.\nNote: Generic dental cement may shrink to a small degree when it becomes solid. If the position of the baseplate changes significantly, setting the baseplate 5–10 μm above the optimal focal plane before applying dental cement or using C&B Metabond as recommended by Inscopix may be helpful. In addition, the focal plane can be adjusted at the time of recording by turning the microscope as instructed by Inscopix.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S5. Fixing the baseplate, refer to step 13f\nFinish the imaging preparation.\nAfter the dental cement has solidified completely, release the miniscope from the gripper tool.\nDetach the miniscope from the magnetic baseplate, which should remain attached to the skull.\nAttach the baseplate cover to prevent dust on the lens.\nRelease the mouse and return it to its home cage.\nNote: At this point, mice are in principle ready for recording.\nHabituation for EEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging during sleep\nTiming: ∼6 h per day for at least 3 days per mouse\nHabituate mice to the miniscope and EEG/EMG cables.\nAttach the dummy miniscope and dummy EEG/EMG cables to the mouse.\nHold the mouse head on both sides of the implant (Methods Video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6], 00:00–00:23).",
    "Critical: The mouse will stop moving if its eyes are covered (Methods Video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]). Avoid applying too much force to the implant, which could cause its detachment later.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S6. Connecting the miniscope and EEG/EMG cables to the mouse, refer to steps 15–16\nRemove the baseplate cover and attach the dummy miniscope and dummy EEG/EMG cables (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9], Methods Video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6], 00:24–01:39).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Dummy miniscope and dummy EEG/EMG cables attached to the mouse\nThe dummy miniscope and the dummy EEG/EMG cables are indicated by a blue and a green arrow, respectively.\nNote: Mice might initially show difficulties moving around with the miniscope and EEG/EMG cables. We find that a minimum of 9 days of habituation is necessary for mice to freely move. As the goal is only to habituate mice, it is not necessary to use the real recording system at this point.\nPlace the mouse inside the sleeping chamber for ∼6 h (Methods Video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6], 01:40–02:02).\nNote: Periodically visually confirm whether the mouse sleeping. Mice should be able to fall asleep more quickly after each habituation session.\nFinish the habituation protocol.\nRemove the mouse from the sleeping chamber.\nDetach the dummy materials and attach the baseplate cover.\nReturn the mouse to its home cage.\nRepeat the habituation protocol on the following day until the mouse is able to sleep and freely move around inside the sleeping chamber.\nEEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging during sleep: day 1, baseline recording\nTiming: 3–6 h per mouse depending on desired imaging period\nNote: For illustrative purposes, we present a protocol for cued fear conditioning as previously described (Kumar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nRecord EEG/EMG and Ca2+ transients during sleep.\nPrepare the mouse for EEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging.",
    "Start the acquisition software and set the imaging parameters.\nNote: For consistency, use the same imaging settings/parameters for all mice. For lengthy imaging sessions, we recommend setting the acquisition rate at ∼5 Hz to reduce the file size. For 5 Hz recordings, we find that an LED intensity of 10%–30% of its maximum power for 4 h does not oversaturate any detected pixel. We usually do not observe cell death resulting from phototoxicity during lengthy imaging sessions, but a small degree of photobleaching is inevitable. As the signal-to-noise ratio of GCaMP3 is not as good as that for newer-generation Ca2+ sensors, we recommend leaving gain at 1 to reduce imaging noise.\nSecure the miniscope and EEG/EMG cables above the recording chamber.\nCritical: To avoid damage to the cables, ensure that they do not hang close to the mouse, which can bite and damage them. At the same time, there should be sufficient slack on the cables to avoid movement-induced cable twisting and strain.\nNote: We placed the EEG/EMG and miniscope cable close to each other so that their rotation axes are similar. During our recording period (maximum ∼4 h), we did not experience substantial tangling of the EEG/EMG and miniscope cables, presumably because we typically perform experiments during the early half of daytime, when mice are often sleeping. If tangling occurs, we recommend using a slip ring for the miniscope with a hole to accommodate the EEG/EMG cable passing through it (or vice versa).\nRemove the baseplate cover and attach the miniscope and EEG/EMG cables.\nStart EEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging simultaneously.\nCritical: Periodically monitor the state of the mouse and cables to ensure that that mouse is behaving naturally and there is no twisting of the cables.",
    "Note: We recommend closely monitoring for signs of sleep apnea. This can generally be achieved by monitoring for fragmented sleep during an NREM sleep episode.\nFinish the recordings.\nStop the recordings.\nDetach both the miniscope and EEG/EMG cables and reattach the dummy miniscope and EEG cable.\nEEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging during sleep: day 2, fear conditioning\nTiming: 3–6 h per mouse depending on the research aim\nFear condition mice with tones and foot shocks.\nPrepare the mouse for the fear conditioning chamber.\nRemove the baseplate cover and attach the miniscope.\nStart the Ca2+ imaging acquisition software and set the imaging parameters.\nArrange the cables above the conditioning chamber by taking the same precautions as those used for the sleeping chamber.\nNote: Use the dummy miniscope if the actual recoding equipment is not needed during conditioning.\nFear condition the mouse.\nPlace the mouse inside the conditioning chamber.\nPerform Ca2+ imaging for 10 min during the pre-conditioning period (i.e., pre-shock recording).\nStop the imaging and quickly detach the miniscope and reattach the dummy miniscope (<1 min) to avoid a change in either the shock condition or the field of view (due to hitting the miniscope against the wall during shock).\nPerform cued fear conditioning (Methods Video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7]).\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S7. Fear conditioning with the miniscope attached to the head, refer to step 23d\nQuickly reattach the miniscope and perform 5 min of Ca2+ imaging (i.e., post-shock recording).\nFinish the recording and return the mouse to the sleeping chamber.\nConnect the EEG/EMG cable and start EEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging simultaneously.\nRecord EEG/EMG activity and Ca2+ transients.\nTransfer the sleeping chamber to the sleep recording room.",
    "Note: If necessary, it is possible to record the activity of neurons during the foot shocks of fear conditioning (Grewe et al. 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). In this case, we recommend covering the interior walls of the conditioning chamber with a shock-absorbing material to prevent damage to the miniscope if the mouse hits the walls when reacting to the foot shocks.\nNote: Avoid detaching the miniscope and cables from the head of the mouse when transferring it to the sleeping chamber to avoid a change in the field of view. If necessary, disconnect the cables from the computer port and reconnect them after transferring the mouse.\nNote: If the mouse is not properly habituated to the experimental manipulation, it is possible that some procedures (e.g., plugging and unplugging the cables/miniscope) could stress the mouse and affect its freezing response. Therefore, we suggest confirming whether freezing is specifically observed in the shocked context. For a no-learning control group, a no shock or immediate shock protocol can be considered.\nStart the EEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging simultaneously.\nFinish the recording as done on the previous day.\nEEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging: day 3, fear conditioning test\nTiming: 5–10 min per mouse\nConfirm the establishment of a fear memory.\nPrepare the mouse for the fear conditioning chamber as done on the previous day.\nNote: Use the dummy miniscope if the actual recoding equipment is not needed during conditioning.\nConfirm the establishment of a fear memory.\nStart EEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging software.\nPlace the mouse inside the conditioning chamber.\nStart the EEG/EMG recording and Ca2+ imaging simultaneously.\nLeave the mouse inside the chamber for 5–10 min.",
    "Note: Attaching the miniscope during the test tends to reduce the overall amount of freezing (Kumar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). To avoid confounding effects, we habituated mice to the weight of the miniscope using a dummy miniscope and cables. A similar approach is widely adopted in tetrode experiments. We found that although mice tend to show low freezing behavior when the miniscope is attached, they freeze only in the learning context (Kumar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). If the freezing duration is still too short, longer habituation with the dummy microscope or counterbalancing the microscope should be considered. Alternatively, a slip ring could be used.\nFinish the recording as done on the previous day.\nAnatomical confirmation of the recorded signals\nTiming: dependent on the desired histological method\nVerify the position of the implanted GRIN lens post-mortem.\nObtain a brain sample\nEuthanize the mouse according to institutional guidelines.\nTranscardially perfuse the mouse with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nRemove the brain and place it inside a tube with 4% PFA at 4°C for 24 h.\nPause Point: The brain can be stored at 4°C for several days. In this case, exchange the PFA for phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after 24 h and protect the tube from light, but expect a natural decay of the fluorescence signal over time. Long exposure to PFA may interfere with immunohistochemical detection of antigens, some of which are critical for adult neurogenesis research, such as doublecortin (Moreno-Jimenez et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nOptional: A peristaltic pump can be used for perfusion. Replace the 4% PFA with 20%–30% sucrose solution if a cryostat will be used to slice the brain. After the brain sinks, remove it from the tube and cryopreserve it in an OCT mounting medium block at −80°C.\nSlice the brain.",
    "Slice the brain using a cryostat or vibratome at 50 μm thickness and collect the slices in plastic wells or dishes with desired buffer.\nNote: We use 60% glycerol/PBS solution for long-term storage of brain slices in a freezer. In case slices must be kept at 4°C, we recommend adding 0.1% sodium azide to the buffer to prevent bacterial contamination.\nConfirm the location of the implanted lens and GCaMP3 fluorescence signal.\nMount the brain slices on microscope slides using fluorescence-preserving medium.\nImage the slides with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/340-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Histological confirmation of GRIN lens position and GCaMP3 signal\nThe letters g, h, and ml indicate the granule cell layer, hilus, and molecular layer of the DG, respectively. The white line indicates the position of the lens, and the white dotted line indicates the border between the DG and stratum lacunosum moleculare. The expression of GCaMP3 is shown in green. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nNote: GCaMP3 fluorescence is usually sufficiently bright to be detected without immunohistochemical staining. If it is not possible to observe the fluorescence signal due to a particular reason (e.g., acetone pretreatment), a simple antibody stain targeting the GFP molecule is sufficient to confirm GCaMP3 expression. We found that using Malinol mounting medium is an economical option for rapid confirmation of the signal."
