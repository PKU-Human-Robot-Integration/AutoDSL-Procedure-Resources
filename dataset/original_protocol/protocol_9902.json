  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described were approved by the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH Publications, 8th edition, updated 2011).\nNOTE: The SD-OCT system used to develop the protocol below is described in the Table of Materials. While some of the procedures are specific to this particular system, the overall approach can be adapted for other OCT devices and animal models. Further, in our lab, these protocols are commonly used in mice and rats; however, the overall approach can be adopted to different animal models and SD-OCT devices provided an individual has the correct lens and capabilities on their device.\n1. Set up the optical coherence tomography equipment\nOpen the SD-OCT software (Table of Materials).\nDefine who is taking the OCT, the study, and the treatment arm (if relevant). Name these categories in a way that will help researchers search for the desired scans later during data analysis.\n\t\nIn the Patient/Exam tab, click Test Examiner. Select the name of the examiner. Use the Setup Examiners & Physicians button to add new examiners.\nClick Study Name to define the study. Click the Study tab to add a new study or modify treatments in an existing study. Click to the right of Select Treatment Arm to select a treatment arm.\nClick the Add Patient button, which is used to add a new timepoint for an entire group. When the window appears, enter ID number, First name, and Last name. Select Male or Female. Enter the Date of Birth.\nClick the Add Exam button to add the individual rats. To identify the rats, click on an exam. Click Edit Exam. Enter the ID number into the Enter Notes box. Click the Save Changes button.",
    "Attach the proper lens to the device (Figure 1B), select the corresponding Configuration in the software, and dial in the associated reference arm position.\n\tNOTE: The SD-OCT system described has customized lenses, preset scan patterns, and reference arm settings specific to the animal species and region of eye being imaged (retina or cornea, mouse or rat). Some of these details are specific to the SD-OCT system described (see table of materials). For example, not all devices offer manual adjustment of reference arm pathlength.\nIn the Patient/Exam tab, double click the highlighted exam to proceed to the Imaging tab and begin imaging or simply click the Imaging tab. If there is a default scan, right click to delete it.\nLoad a pre-set Scan Protocol by clicking the Select a protocol from the list button. Alternatively, add individual scans.\nFor rat models of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy and mouse models of retinal degeneration, choose a pre-set that consists of four images: 2 OD and 2 OS scans. For mouse myopia, choose a pre-set that consists of 8 images: 4 OD and 4 OS scans.\n\tNOTE: Pre-set imaging will be explained in more detail in Section 3. This is something each laboratory makes for themselves or with the manufacturer during on-site installation.\n2. Anesthetize the animal\nAdminister anesthetic.\n\t\nAnesthetize rats with ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (7.5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection.\nAnesthetize mice with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection.\nWait until animals are fully anesthetized and do not respond to toe pinch.\nAdminister pupil dilation drops (1% tropicamide). Wait for pupils to dilate before imaging.",
    "NOTE: Dilation of pupils increases the field of view but is not a requirement. Local (corneal) anesthetic drops (0.5% tetracaine) to numb the eye should also be used if anything will be touching the eye (for example, if applying contact lenses or using a guide). A guide is a device that is placed over the scan head and helps beginners to line up the eye and the scan head.\nAfter anesthetizing the rodent, place the rodent in a rodent alignment system that can rotate the animal in 3-dimensional space (Figure 1A, 1C, & 1D). Provide thermal support.\n\tNOTE: Currently, we use rodent alignment systems for mice and rats designed and sold with the SD-OCT device.\nApply liquid (e.g., saline or artificial tears) to keep the eyes lubricated. Ensure that the eye does not dry out during imaging so that the optical properties of the eye are maintained between scans (when the cornea is wet, the retina can be seen clearly).\n\t\nMake sure to maintain moisture in the opposite eye when scanning the first eye so it does not dry out.\nUse a delicate task wipe to wick away excess saline just before imaging, as too much or too little lubricant on the eye will affect the image quality.\n\tNOTE: The use of sterile lubricant gel is not recommended during OCT since it can interfere with imaging. If required, sterile lubricant gel can be used after the procedure. A contact lens can also be applied to ensure adequate moisture on the eye throughout the test. In our experience, a contact lens did not provide a marked improvement in image quality, but contact lenses do help reduce the risk of cornea drying during the imaging session.\n3. Rodent OCT imaging",
    "Begin with one eye (OS or OD) and image the contralateral eye after.\n\t\nPosition the animal using the two rotational motions of the rodent alignment system, such that the gaze is horizontal and looking down the axis of the OCT Lens (Figure 1D).\nUse the OCT in Free Run mode to orient the retina for data collection. Use the Aim mode (by clicking the Aim button) initially for a continuous display of both horizontal and vertical B-scans in real time.\nMove the scan head closer to the eye until the retina is visible (as mouse and rat retina lenses are fixed-focus, moving the lens toward the eye focuses deeper into the retina). Then use the rodent alignment system to adjust the animal position up/down and swivel/twist to position the optic nerve head in the center, make the horizontal scan horizontal, and the vertical scan vertical (Figure 1A).\nAdjust the working distance such that the retinal image is flat and not curved.\nAdjust the reference arm position to keep the image near the top of the display window. Be careful not to push in too far or the eye image will flip back on itself.\nRetinal imaging\n\t\nFor glaucoma, retinal degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy models: Define a volume scan that consists of 1000 x 100 x 1 (A scans x B scans x repeated B scans) for averaging. In rats, take a volume scan that is 3 x 3 mm. In mice, take a 1.5 x 1.5 mm volume scan.",
    "Center the optic nerve in the horizontal and the vertical access so that the volume scan is in the center. Take time to make sure the optic nerve head is at the center of the scan and straight along the nasal-temporal and superior-inferior axes (Figure 2). Scan and re-center to make sure it is exactly in the center, if needed. Repeat this scan as necessary until the optic nerve head is centered and aligned along both axes. Click the Snapshot button to take a photo.\n\t\tNOTE: Some SD-OCT devices have the option of optically manipulating the curvature of the eye (e.g., the image is flattened) by adjusting the distance of the eye from the light source with the reference arm. We recommend flattening and centering the images when taking direct thickness measurements through the retinal layers to improve accuracy along the anterior-posterior direction.\nClick the Save button to save the image.\nTake a radial scan centered at the optic nerve head that is 1000 x 4 x 20 (A-scan x B-scan x repeated B-scans). Use repeated B scans to enhance image clarity of the eye or retina, which will help to interpret regions of the eye or layers of the retina during data analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Again, in rats this radial scan is 3 mm, while in mice the radial scan is 1.5 mm.\nSave the image.\nRepeat steps 3.1 through 3.2.5 in the contralateral eye.\nAxial length measurements\n\t\nFor projects that involve imaging the whole eye, such as mouse myopia, take three scans of the entire eye and one retina scan for each eye. Choose a pre-set that consists of a radial scan that is 500 x 20 x 1 and encompasses the full diameter of the eye.",
    "NOTE: This setting provides an image of the entire length of the mouse eye from the cornea to the choroid.\nCenter the middle of the eye and retina in the field of view. Take three radial scans (whole eye scans): a linear B scan that is 1000 x 5 x 2 and two additional linear B scans of 1000 x 5 x 2 at the same location. Save the images.\nAfterward, if desired, zoom in and take a volume or rectangular scan (retina scan) similar to the description in 3.2 that consists of 1000 x 20 A scans x B scans. Save the volume scan.\nRepeat steps 3.3 through 3.3.3 in the contralateral eye.\n\t\tNOTE: Axial length measurements are only possible on small eyes (mouse or smaller) since the imaging window of current systems is not large enough to capture a larger eye.\n4. Post-imaging steps\nStore saved data on a cloud, which is good practice for data management and allows for easy access for later analysis. Perform data analysis with custom software developed in a mathematical modeling program (Table of Materials).\nRemove the rodent from the rodent alignment system and give an intraperitoneal injection of atipamezole (1 mg/kg for rats and mice) to reverse the effects of the xylazine, so that the rodent will wake up more quickly.\nAllow rodents to recover on a heating pad on low heat. Give additional saline drops as needed. Return rodents to their home cage when they have regained full ambulation.\nClose program and turn off the OCT.\n5. Post-processing of OCT images\nProcess the images using custom software developed in a mathematical modeling program to suit specific OCT needs (e.g., measure the thickness of areas of interest by manually marking the images).",
    "Depending on the purpose of the image (mouse retina, rat retina, or myopia/axial length), use one of three different programs:\n\t\nFor processing the retina, select the OCT scans to load. First, define the center of the optic nerve head with a simple click.\nWatch as the program generates vertical lines defining distances on either side of the optic nerve head. Note that in the rat retina, these lines are at 0.5 mm and 1.2 mm away from the center of the optic nerve head, for a total of 4 vertical lines representing the nasal-temporal and inferior-superior axes of the eye depending on the radial B scan currently analyzed.\n\t\tNOTE: In the mouse retina, these vertical lines are at 0.25 mm and 0.5 mm from the optic nerve head center.\nDelineate the following layers along each line:\n\t\tThe retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), external limiting membrane (ELM), inner segments/outer segments (IS/OS), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and total retinal thickness.\n\t\tNOTE: The radial scan does not typically have nasal/temporal and superior/inferior labels when it is opened. Scans may be created such that they have an n/t and s/I orientation, and those scans in particular are analyzed later.\nAfter an image has been delineated and the program closed, export these measurements into a spreadsheet software for data analysis.\nUse these length and thickness values from step 5 to make comparisons between groups, for example, determining if there are regional differences (n/t/s/i), or longitudinal changes.\nFor retinal measurements, first determine if there are any differences in the nasal-temporal and inferior-superior axis at the 0.5 mm and 1.2 mm distances.",
    "NOTE: If differences in quadrants are not observed, the 0.5 mm and 1.2 mm measurements may be averaged together. This is a similar approach for the mouse retinal scans only at 0.25 mm and 0.5 mm.\nFor myopia studies, use this program to assess the ocular parameters along the optical axis of the eye. Open the mathematical modeling program. First, select an image to load.\n\t\nAfter loading the image, manually mark each scan (radial and B scans). Mark the anterior and posterior edges of the cornea, lens, vitreous chamber, and retina, so that the program will calculate corneal thickness, lens thickness, anterior and vitreous chamber depth, total retinal thickness, total axial length.\nAfter marking, exit the program which prompts a save menu. Save the delineated values in a spreadsheet software and average the three separate scans together.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
