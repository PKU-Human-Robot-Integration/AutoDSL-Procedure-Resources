    "Before starting:This protocol requires obtaining acute brain slices or acute slices from other tissue explants. Refer to Bio-protocol ‘Obtaining Acute Brain Slices’ (Papouin and Haydon, 2018) for a full and detailed description of that procedure. The present protocol requires the use of some material also described in Bio-protocol ‘Obtaining Acute Brain Slices’, such as a ‘nest beaker’ (Figure 3) and modified Pasteur pipette dropper (Figures 3 and 4). For a full description and instructions on how to build these, please refer to Bio-protocol ‘Obtaining Acute Brain Slices’.1.Nest beaker2.Modified Pasteur pipette dropperimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117014919_3417.jpgFigure 3.

Break the thinnest end of a glass disposable Pasteur pipet, and insert that end in a Dropper bulb.Setting up: Prepare 1 L of stock ACSF the day prior and store overnight at 4 °C (see Recipes). On the day of the experiment, prepare 300 ml of ice-cold slicing ACSF (see Recipes) for acute brain slicing and refer to Bio-protocol ‘Obtaining Acute Brain Slices’ for a detailed procedure on how to obtain brain slices. Prepare 150 ml of recovery ACSF in the ‘nest beaker’ as instructed in Bio-protocol ‘Obtaining Acute Brain Slices’.Reserve the rest of the ACSF (~550 ml) to use as ‘Experimental ACSF’ (see Recipes)Obtain brain slices (or explants of the tissue of interest) See Bio-protocol    ‘Obtaining Acute Brain Slices’ Papouin and Haydon (2018). This is a very classic procedure used routinely in many labs for in vitro electrophysiology and various descriptions can be found in textbooks, on PubMed (for instance, Ting et al., 2014), or on Jove website (https://www.jove.com/video/2330[href=https://www.jove.com/video/2330]).Incubate slices to obtain conditioned mediumIn the case of the dorsal hippocampus, typically 6-8 hemi-slices should be obtained from an adult male mouse. This may vary depending on your brain region or tissue of interest.",
    "Once the recovery is over (Papouin and Haydon, 2018), transfer hemi-slices individually in a Petri dish filled with room temperature oxygenated recovery ACSF (from the nest beaker–a few ml will suffice), and carefully separate the hippocampus from the rest of the slice with spring scissors and fine forceps (Figure 5A). To minimize manipulation and damage to slices, a small portion of cortex immediately above the hippocampus (motor and somatosensory cortex typically) can be left attached (it would therefore participate in the following incubation and conditioned medium preparation). Transfer the ‘isolated’ hippocampal slices back to the nest beaker and allow an additional 15 min of recovery. This hippocampus isolation procedure can be greatly facilitated by removing the oxygenation tube from the Petri dish, on the condition that the procedure only takes 1 or 2 min and that slices are immediately transferred back to the nest beaker. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117015520_7960.pngFigure 5. Incubation of hippocampal slices to obtain conditioned medium. A. In a Petri dish containing recovery ACSF, separate the hippocampus from the rest of the slice with spring scissors and fine forceps. B. After briefly transferring slices into experimental ACSF, transfer them into a 1.7 ml microtube filled to 1.5 ml with RT experimental ACSF. Oxygenate gently and leave in a tube rack for 90 min.Using the modified Pasteur pipette (Figure 4), gently transfer all slices in a small Petri dish containing oxygenated experimental ACSF (see Recipes) at RT. Make sure the slices are not swirling around because of the oxygenation. This step is only required to transfer slices from recovery ACSF to conditioning ACSF (Step B3).After a few seconds, transfer 3 to 4 hippocampal slices at the bottom of a 1.7 ml microtube with the modified Pasteur pipette, and fill the tube up to 1.5 ml with RT experimental ACSF.",
    "Insert oxygenation tubing and gently oxygenate (Figure 5B). Reduce the rate of oxygenation so that the content of the tubes is not splashing and so that the slices are not swirling. Slices should remain at the bottom of the tube, gently waving. Incubate for 90 min at RT on a tube rack, while regularly checking that the oxygenation is appropriate. Carefully transfer the conditioned medium (CM) with a 1 ml pipette into a clean microtube and immediately freeze at -80 °C until used for D-serine measurement. If used at the same day, store at 4 °C. Be careful not to pipette any tissue with the CM. It is safer to leave a few µl in the tube. Unless they are treated differently, pool together the CM from all slice incubations in a 15 ml tube. The remaining experimental ACSF (i.e., vehicle ACSF) should be stored along with the CM samples, at -80 °C or 4 °C. Freeze the incubated tissue left at the bottom of the tubes at -80 °C until protein extraction and optic density measurement is performed with a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (not described in this protocol).Prepare biosensorsThis protocol was designed for the use of Sarissa probes. It can easily be adapted for other D-serine sensors. If using Sarissa D-serine probes, prepare the biosensors according to manufacturer’s instructions Sarissa Biomedical[href=http://www.sarissa-biomedical.com/products/sarissaprobes.aspx] (see also Dale et al., 2005) or as follows:Run the vehicle ACSF (same ACSF that was used to obtain CM from the hippocampal slices) through the electrophysiology chamber and turn the chamber heater to 33 °C. Once the flow is steady and desired temperature is reached, mount the D-serine and the Null sensor probes on the biosensor-holder attached to the micromanipulators (Figure 1).",
    "Using the micromanipulators, submerge the probes in the recording chamber and position them so that they are close to each other and at the same depth (Figures 1 and 6). Preferably, the two probes should be facing each other, at a similar angle respective to the flow. Let sensors rehydrate for 15-30 min. Note that while rehydrating, the sensors will swell in size (like a sponge). Give the sensors enough space to rehydrate without coming into contact with one another or the bottom of the chamber. The probe part of the biosensors is extremely fragile: make sure it does not come into contact with anything that could damage it.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117015731_1797.jpgFigure 6. Biosensor probe submersion and positioning in the recording chamberNotes: Before starting ‘D- Run conditioned medium on biosensors’ make sure the perfusion line is as short as possible. Make sure the perfusion rate is no greater than 0.5 ml/min. Make sure that the sensor part of the probe is constantly submerged. Once the probes are rehydrated, they cannot be exposed to the air more than a few seconds. Exposing the sensors to the air while polarized at +500 mV will result in immediate and irreversible damage to the sensor. We strongly recommend running a trial run with dummy sensors. Using the bipotentiostat and the polarity command on the software interface, manually polarize the sensors at +500 mV and switch the polarity to -500 mV and back, cycling back and forth about 10 to 12 times (see Figure 7). Allow polarizing to +500 mV for at least 60 min or until capacitive decay is imperceptible over the course of a 15-20 min ‘run’ (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117015900_7952.jpgFigure 7.",
    "Print screen of a calibration experiment (10 μM D-serine) run on a D-serine sensor (top red trace) and null sensor (bottom blue trace) using the DY2000 software. Note the parameters used, in particular, sampling rate: 50 Hz, Duration of a run: 1,000 sec, Sensors potential: 0.5 V and A/V scale factors. Note that at the end of each run, the software will show a ‘Ready…’ signal (bottom right-hand corner), signaling that a new run can be started (by pressing the RUN button, bottom right-hand corner). However, the run that just ended is not automatically saved. Make sure to press Save (bottom left, green button) prior to starting another run or data will be lost. Also note that ‘noise’ artifacts typically appear on both traces. However, D-serine perfusion elicits no current on the null sensor. In fact, one can still detect a ~20 pA capacitive decay over the course of 1,000 sec recording on the null sensor trace.Run conditioned medium on biosensorsThaw the conditioned media on ice and then leave at RT. Tubes may contain some deposit. Do not perfuse the deposit through the line, instead pipette out the CM into a clean tube. Quickly switch the perfusion line from the vehicle solution to the tube containing the CM. Make sure there are no bubbles in the line (we recommend ‘pinching’ the perfusion line when switching solutions). Once the volume of CM runs through, switch the line back to the vehicle solution for as long as necessary to obtain a full wash-in/wash-out curve (Figure 8) and to clean the line of residual D-serine before the next measurement.",
    "If the next CMs to be run on the sensors were obtained on a different day using different vehicle ACSF, run the corresponding vehicle solution for at least 15 min before running the next CM. Make sure the sensors are not exposed to the air during this process.Note: The DY2000 software provided with the biopotentiostat requires saving the results from each run after the run is complete. It is therefore critical to remember to click SAVE at the end of each induvial run (Figure 7).It appears that different sensors tend to give very different reading qualities and steadiness. We recommend proceeding to Procedure D only once, it is ascertained that the set of biosensors provides a steady and clean amperometric signal devoid of artifacts and fluctuations due to perfusion flow or electrical noise. In our study, we chose to abort or exclude all experiments in which the baseline behavior of the sensors would prevent accurate and reliable evaluation of D-serine levels in CM.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117020033_9577.jpgFigure 8. Print screen of the Clampfit analysis of a CM D-serine measurement. Top trace: D-serine sensor. Middle trace: Null sensor. Bottom trace: D-serine sensor minus null sensor. Cursors 1-2 show where the baseline subtraction is made so that the baseline portion of the trace reads 0 pA. Cursors 3-4 show where the mean peak response is measured.Calibrate the biosensorsIn advance, prepare standard solutions of D-serine of, for example, 0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 µM using serial dilutions in vehicle ACSF. We recommend increasing the accuracy of the calibration around the concentrations of D-serine you expect to detect in the CM. Switch from the vehicle solution to the D-serine standard solution, beginning with the lowest concentration standard.",
    "Run each of the D-serine standard solutions through the line until a plateau is reached (Figure 9) before switching back to vehicle ACSF. Allow sufficient time between each solution to thoroughly and completely wash-out after each application (this can take up to 20 min for the highest concentrations depending on your set-up).Notes: For Procedures D and E, when switching from one solution to the other, make sure no interruption in the perfusion flow occurs to guarantee that the amount of liquid (and liquid flow) remains constant in the chamber. Proceeding otherwise could compromise the immersion of the sensors and expose and irreversibly damage them.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117020124_7324.jpgFigure 9. Print screen of the Clampfit analysis of a 1 μM D-serine calibration experiment. Top trace: D-serine sensor. Middle trace: Null sensor. Bottom trace: D-serine sensor minus null sensor. Cursors 1-2 show where the baseline subtraction is made so that the baseline trace reads 0 pA. Cursors 3-4 show where the mean peak response is measured. Artifacts were intentionally created on traces around the start of perfusion of the 1 μM D-serine solution and after ~3 ml of perfusion. This type of experiment was used to determine the minimal volume of liquid required to measure D-serine concentration in CM reliably.Discard or store the biosensorsMake sure that the biosensors are no longer polarized and the bipotentiostat is turned off before handling and unplugging the biosensors. If sensors are to be reused, follow manufacturer’s instructions. Quickly transfer the sensors to Buffer A (see manufacturer’s instructions) in a rehydration pot at 4 °C and place in a fridge. Alternatively, from our experience, we found that if handled properly, sensors can be kept overnight in cold ACSF (4 °C) and reused at least once within the next 48 h without major loss of sensitivity."
