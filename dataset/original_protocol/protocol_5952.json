    "Notes: This protocol was optimized for U2OS cells but can be adapted to any adherent metazoan cell line. Use 500 μl of buffer for every wash-step if 12-well plates are used, otherwise the volume needs to be adjusted.Validation of antibody for VANIMA by immunofluorescence (see Note 1)Seed around 105 cells of U2OS cells in a 12-well plate containing growth medium and a glass coverslip.Let cells re-attach to the coverslip surface overnight.Pre-warm 4% PFA, diluted in PBS to 37 °C in a water bath.Remove growth medium from the cells and rinse them twice with PBS.Fix the cells by adding the pre-warmed 4% PFA for 5 min at RT.Rinse the cells two times with PBS.Permeabilize the cells by incubating them in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT.Rinse the cells twice with PBS.Incubate the cells with different dilutions of your antibody in PBS supplemented with 10% FCS for 1 h at RT.Wash the cells twice with PBS supplemented with 0.02% Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT.Wash the cells once with PBS for 5 min at RT.Incubate the cells with the corresponding fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody in the supplier recommended dilution (like Alexa Fluor 488 goat-anti-mouse IgG in a dilution of 1/3,000) in 10% FCS in PBS for 1 h at RT.Repeat the wash-steps as mentioned in Steps A10 and A11.Mount the coverslip on a microscope slide using 6-10 μl of Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI.Observe your cells under the microscope to define if the antibody shows the expected staining of the target (see Figure 1 and Note 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181031/20181031234811_8264.jpgFigure 1.

    "Note: Labeling of antibodies or Fabs can only be performed with purified proteins. The purification of antibodies is described in the following section B. However, procedure B can be skipped if the antibody is already pure, and/or if a commercially available antibody is in PBS (see Notes of Procedure D). Purification of mouse monoclonal antibodies for electroporation (see Figure 2A)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181031/20181031234833_3776.jpgFigure 2. Analysis of antibodies and Fabs by SDS-PAGE. A. Purified aliquots of antibodies (Lane 1) or Fabs (Lane 2) were chemically-labeled with Alexa488 and subsequently analyzed by a 12% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Five microgram of the antibody and Fab were loaded on the SDS-PAGE. For the antibody (Lane 1), the heavy (50 kDa) and light chain (25 kDa) are visible and for the Fab (Lane 2) a double band is detected which correspond to the Fd chain and the light chain of the Fab. B. Corresponds to the same gel shown in A analyzed under UV illumination (wavelength range from 10 nm to 400 nm) before staining to excite the Alexa488 fluorophore and visualize the fluorescent dyes on the antibodies/Fabs.Transfer 1 ml of Protein G Sepharose FastFlow beads into a 15 ml tube.Centrifuge the bead solution at 277 x g for 3 min at 4 °C to pellet the beads.Remove the storage solution and add 5 ml of PBS. Resuspend the beads and centrifuge them again as mentioned before.Repeat Steps B2 and B3 for 4 times to equilibrate the beads in PBS and to remove all the storage solution.Remove all PBS from the beads and add 2 ml of antibody solution with a concentration of around 1 mg/ml to the beads.Incubate the beads for 2 h at 4 °C under constant shaking.Centrifuge the beads for 5 min at 277 x g at 4 °C.",
    "Remove the supernatant and keep it on ice. This is the flow through (FT) which shouldn’t contain any antibodies anymore.Add 2 ml of PBS to the beads, resuspend them and transfer them to a Poly-Prep chromatography column.Add a total of 20 ml of PBS to wash the beads and to remove all unspecific bound proteins.Prepare ten 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes with 70 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.2 for fractionation and neutralization.After all the PBS passed through the column, start the elution of the antibody from the beads by adding stepwise 10 ml of 0.1 M glycine-HCl pH 2.7 in 1 ml steps and collect the fractions in the prepared Eppendorf tubes containing the neutralization buffer.Analyze an aliquot of every elution fraction by SDS-PAGE using a 12% SDS-acrylamide gel. Fifteen microliter of the following samples can be loaded:The input antibody solutionThe flow-through (FT)All ten fractions collectedPerform Coomassie staining after the electrophoresis and pool all the fractions containing the purified antibodies.Dialyze the pooled fractions against a total of 4 L of PBS in two steps using DiaEasy dialyzer tubes, the first step overnight and the second for 4 h with 2 L of PBS each at 4 °C. Measure the concentration of the dialyzed antibody by 280 nm absorption and an extinction coefficient of 1.37 using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Concentrate the purified antibodies using the 4 ml Amicon filter units with a cutoff of 10 kDa by centrifugation at 4,000 x g until the concentration is 1 mg/ml or higher.Note: This protocol is optimized for an antibody input of 200 μg which corresponds to antibody samples that are commercially available. Digestion of monoclonal antibodies to Fab fragments (see Note 3 and Figure 2A)Prepare 200 μg of monoclonal antibodies in PBS (1 mg/ml) (see Procedure B).Add 1.2 μl of 0.",
    "17 M TCEP (1 mM final concentration) in 200 μl of antibody solution.Transfer 100 μl of magnetic Papain coated bead solution per digestion into 0.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Use an Eppendorf magnetic stand to fix the magnetic beads and remove the storage solution.Wash the beads 3 x each with 300 μl of PBS by resuspending them in the buffer and afterwards removing the washing buffer again with the help of the magnet.Remove all PBS and add the antibody solution with TCEP to the beads.Incubate for 3 h at 37 °C under shaking.Remove and collect the supernatant (S1) from the beads using the magnet (this includes the Fab’s).Wash the beads again 3 x with PBS and store them at 4 °C in PBS to be able to reuse them.For the purification of the Fab fragments, transfer 100 μl of Protein A Sepharose beads into a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Equilibrate the beads by washing them 4 x each with 300 μl of PBS. Centrifuge them for each wash-step for 3 min at 277 x g.Remove all PBS and add supernatant (S1) from the digestion to the beads.Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C under shaking.Centrifuge for 5 min at 277 x g and collect the supernatant (S2).Wash beads with 300 μl of PBS and centrifuge again.Collect wash step and pool with supernatant (S2).Concentrate the fraction S2 using an Amicon filter unit with a cutoff of 10 kDa (0.5 ml or 4 ml tubes) to about 100 μl volume (5 min at 14,000 x g). This is now fraction S3.Determine the concentration of the Fab by measuring the absorption at 280 nm and an extinction coefficient of 1.37 using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer.",
    "Perform an SDS-PAGE using a 4%-15% acrylamide gradient gel and 1 µl of each of the following samples that need to be boiled for 5 min before loading:Input antibody solutionSupernatant S1Supernatant S2Supernatant S3Filtrate from the Amicon concentration stepThe Fab fragments are now purified and ready for labeling.Fluorescent labeling of monoclonal antibodies or Fab fragments for VANIMA (see Note 4)Note: In our experience, all fluorophores from the Alexa and Atto families are working very well. Other dyes and kits would need to be tested.Prepare 1 L of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate pH 8.2 (see Recipes).Dialyze 100 μg of antibody/Fab solution in a volume of 100 μl (1 mg/ml) against 1 L of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate for 4 h at 4 °C using DiaEasy dialyzing tubes.Note: The dialysis against the labeling buffer (0.1 M sodium bicarbonate) is an important step as it will raise the pH of the antibody solution over a pH of 8 which will increase labeling efficiency. The dialysis also showed to give better labeling efficiencies (3-4 dyes per molecule more) than the pH raising step described in the Invitrogen labeling protocol. Mix the antibody/Fab solution with fluorescent dyes as written in the manufacturer’s protocol and incubate at RT for 1 h in the dark. Mix the solution every 15 min by inverting the tube. The labeling kits used to label the antibodies/Fabs are the Alexa Fluor Monoclonal Antibody labeling kits from Invitrogen (see Materials and Reagents).Remove non-bound dyes by purifying the labeling mix using the gel filtration columns supplied in the labeling kit.Note: Washing of the gel filtration column with PBS prior to loading of the labeling reaction is recommended as it will remove any traces of NaN3 that is present in the storage buffer of the gel filtration beads. Concentrate the labeled antibody/Fab by using 0.",
    "5 ml Amicon filter units with a cut-off of 10 kDa. Centrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 x g to concentrate the solution to a volume of approximately 50 μl.Measure the concentration of the labeled antibody using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and the Protein and Labels mode.Labeling efficiency can be visualized by SDS-PAGE and UV illumination (see Figure 2B) and quantified by measuring the absorption at 280 nm and at the dye specific wavelength. The dye/antibody labeling ratio can then be calculated using the formula mentioned in the protocol of Invitrogen.Note: To label antibodies or Fabs, the labeling kits are using N-hydroxysuccinimide ester fluorophores that react with the amine group at the tip of the side chain of lysines. This works fine with antibodies that do not harbor lysine residues in their binding site (paratope). If the binding capacity of the labeled antibodies or Fab (that can be easily tested by IF) is affected by this technique, we propose to set up a site-directed labeling. This labeling procedure consists in the preparation of (Fab’)2 fragments, which can be specifically labeled at the typical cysteine residues in the C-terminal of the Fab’ (hinge region) with maleimide-activated fluorophores upon mild reduction. Whilst this method preserves theoretically the antibody-binding site from any deleterious chemical alteration, it allows the addition of a maximum of two to three fluorophore molecules only per antibody or Fab. Electroporation procedure for monoclonal antibodies or Fab fragments (see also Video 1)Notes:The Neon transfection system and the corresponding Neon transduction kits are used for antibody transduction. The purified antibody, or Fab fragments, need to be diluted in sterile PBS with no other ingredients prior to electroporation as preservatives like sodium azide or traces of BSA will lower the viability of your cells after electroporation significantly.",
    "Furthermore, the working solution of labeled antibodies or Fab fragments should have a concentration of 1-2 mg/ml. The concentration of the antibody/Fab solution should be as high as possible to decrease the volume needed for electroporation since the volume needed for one electroporation should not exceed 5 µl to avoid that the cells are getting too diluted. This protocol describes electroporation using the 10 μl Neon tips, but 100 μl Neon tips can be used as well. In this case the number of cells and antibodies/Fabs need to be adjusted accordingly. All buffer and solutions need to be filtered and sterile for electroporation to avoid contamination of the antibodies and cells. Pre-warm 2.5% trypsin and the growth culture medium without antibiotics to 37 °C prior to the experiment.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Electroporation procedure Transfer the volume corresponding to 1-5 μg of antibody/Fab solution (between 1-2 mg/ml) into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and keep them in the dark on ice. For example, 2 µl of antibody solution with a concentration of 1 mg/ml if you want to electroporate 2 µg of antibodies.Add antibiotics free growth medium into the cell culture plate (12-well plate with glass coverslip) or live-imaging chamber slides (μ-slides 8-well glass bottom from Ibidi) and store them in the incubator at 37 °C.Wash the U2OS cells twice with PBS.Detach the cells from the surface by incubating them with 2.5% trypsin for 4 min and dilute them in antibiotic-free growth medium. Count the cells and transfer the volume of cell suspension needed for a final cell number of 8 x 105 cells to a 15-ml tube and pellet the cells by centrifuging them at 200 x g for 5 min. Every electroporation uses 105 cells which means that with this pellet one can perform 8 transductions in total.",
    "Note: A total of 8 electroporation experiments can be performed with a pellet of 8 x 105 cells (105 cells per transduction). Even if a lower number of electroporations are planned it is still better to keep a higher cell number as the lower number will result in very small pellets and inaccuracies which can lower cell viability drastically. Remove the growth medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 4 ml of PBS and centrifuge them again.Remove the PBS and resuspend the pellet in 80 μl of resuspension buffer (R-buffer).Note: As soon as the cells are resuspended in R-buffer, it is important to proceed quickly to the electroporation. Cell viability could decrease significantly if the cells remain longer than 15 min in R-buffer. The resuspension buffer (R-buffer) is part of the electroporation kit from Invitrogen and therefore its composition is confidential. However, we also tested 250 mM sucrose buffer in 1x PBS (Brees and Fransen, 2014) or just simple 1x PBS and they also worked for the electroporation of antibodies. Mix 10 μl of the resuspended cells with the antibody/Fab solution and pipette this mix with the Neon pipette using the 10 μl Neon tips. Be careful that no bubble can be seen in the Neon tip as this will induce an electric short-circuit which will kill the cells during the electroporation.Put the Neon pipette into the pipette station and electroporate the cells using the following parameters:Voltage: 1550 VNumber of pulses: 3Time width of pulse: 10 msPipette the cells after the electric pulse directly into the cell culture plate prepared in Step E2.Repeat Steps E8-E10 until all transduction have been performed.Incubate the cells in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "For Fab transductions, the cells can be observed or fixed as early as 6 h post electroporation (see Figure 3C).For full-length antibody transductions, the incubation time can vary depending on the neo-synthesis rate of the target protein in the cell and its localization (see Note 3 and Figures 3A, 3B and 3D).The same protocol as in Procedure A can be followed if the cells need to be fixed starting with Step A3 but except that for the electroporation of labeled antibodies/Fabs Steps A6-A12 can be skipped.For live-cell imaging, the samples can be observed under the microscope after the incubation time (see Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181031/20181031234852_0621.jpgFigure 3. Imaging results after the electroporation of antibodies or Fabs. A. U2OS cells were electroporated with anti-RPB1-Alexa488 labeled antibodies and the same cell was imaged by confocal microscopy 6 h and 26 h post-electroporation. The transport of the labeled antibody from the cytoplasm into the nucleus can be detected. B. Same as in (A), but the cells were fixed 24 h after electroporation and the antibody labeled RPB1 was visualized using confocal microscopy. C. Electroporation as in (A), but this time anti-RPB1-Alexa488 Fab fragments were transduced. The cells were fixed and imaged 6 h post-electroporation by confocal microscopy and specific nuclear staining for RPB1 can be observed. D. U2OS cells were electroporated with an antibody against MBP (maltose binding protein), which is not present in human cells. The cells were fixed 24 h after electroporation and the localization of the antibody was visualized using confocal microscopy. Even after 24 h, the antibody stays in the cytoplasm as it has no target protein for the transport into the nucleus. Scale bars = 10 μm."
