    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHere, we will describe how to determine the FEL of the proteasomal ATPase complex and use it to study the ATPase dynamics. We will first cover the steps for the FEL model construction and explain the details on determining the model parameters using the single-molecule proteasome-nucleotide interaction assay and the 26S proteasome activity assay. We will then explain how to simulate the dynamics of the ATPase complex based on its FEL and provide examples for how to obtain mechanistic insights from the simulation results.\nFEL model construction\nTiming: 1 week\nIn this section, we will explain how to construct a nucleotide-dependent FEL of the ATPase complex on the 26S proteasome. The procedure has three steps: 1. Defining proteasome’s conformational space based on its cryo-EM structures; 2. Parameterizing the free energy as a function of the ATPase conformation and the nucleotide distribution; 3. Experimentally determining the model parameters.\nAnalyze cryo-EM structures of the proteasome.\nLaunch Pymol.\nDefine the nucleotide-binding pocket of each ATPase subunit (Rpt1∼6) based on the structure of EA1 state by selecting amino acids within 6–9 Å of the bound nucleotide.\nNote: The Pymol script is available as Pymol_script1_DefineATPpocket.txt. The PDB files of the identified pockets are saved in the folder ATPpocket.\nCalculate the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of the nucleotide pocket.\nAlign structures of each nucleotide-binding pocket in different states of the proteasome.\nCalculate the RMSD of the aligned atoms of the cis elements of the nucleotide pocket.\nNote: The Pymol script is available as Pymol_script2_RMSD.txt. The RMSD is reported in the command window (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3028-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Note: The observation that the SESAs of the ATPase interfaces mostly adopt binary values in the cryo-EM structures is the basis for step 2 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nDefine the conformational space in the FEL model.\nDefine each conformation in the FEL by the status of the six ATPase domain interfaces, being either open (small SESA) or closed (large SESA).\nNote: The total number of open interfaces in each conformation is constrained to be either 2 or 3, since only 2 or 3 open interfaces have been observed in the cryo-EM structures of the proteasome. Five conformations having 3 + 3 or 2 + 2+2 symmetry in the ATPase architecture are excluded to avoid ambiguity in assigning substrate-ATPase interaction. The FEL totally contains 30 discrete conformations (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3028_13.csv\nDefine each state in the FEL model as a unique combination of an ATPase conformation and a nucleotide distribution in the six binding pockets.\nNote: In our practice, each nucleotide pocket can be empty, ATP-bound, ADP-bound, or ATP-γS-bound. The total number of states in the nucleotide-dependent FEL is 30   ×   46 = 122880.\nNote: \"Interface\": the 6 digits indicate the status of Rpt6-Rpt3, Rpt3-Rpt4, Rpt4-Rpt5, Rpt5-Rpt1, Rpt1-Rpt2, Rpt2-Rpt6 interfaces: \"0\" means open interface; \"1\" means closed interface. “Engagement\": the 6 digits indicate the substrate engagement status of Rpt6, Rpt3, Rpt4, Rpt5, Rpt1, Rpt2 subunits: \"0\" means disengaged subunit; \"1\" means engaged subunit.\nCollect the empirical rules for FEL model construction based on cryo-EM observations.",
    "Note: There is no gold standard for generalizing the observations as rules in the model. More rules than necessary might be collected at the beginning. The importance of each rule needs to be assessed later by the model to generate a minimal set of rules that still allow accurate prediction of proteasome’s behaviors. Here we list the important rules we found.\nA series of closed interfaces arrange the substrate-interacting motif pore-1 loop (PL1) of consecutive ATPases into a staircase architecture. Those ATPases are defined as “engaged” subunits with 2-amino acid (AAs) axial separation between their PL1s (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nOne or a stretch of ATPase subunits that are flanked by open interfaces on both sides are disengaged from substrate interaction, and their PL1s move to the top registry of the staircase.\nEach state of the ATPase complex contains at least one disengaged subunit.\nNote: In the scenarios involving three ATPase segments, the largest segment is assumed to interact with the substrate.\nDuring each step of conformational transition, the substrate translocation distance is taken as the difference between the average staircase positions of those engaged ATPases before and after the transition.\nParameterize the free-energy function.\nThe free energy of each state is expressed as the sum of the contributions from each individual ATPase interface that depends on the following key parameters:\nThe nucleotide binding rate    k  o n    , binding energy of nucleotide to the cis pocket of the engaged subunit    e P   , binding energy of the nucleotide to the cis pocket of the disengaged subunit    e P  A P O    , basal energy of nucleotide-independent interaction between adjacent ATPases    e B    are all inferred from published results.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19],20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]\nThe nucleotide unbinding rate    k  o f f     is calculated based on the formula:\nk\no\nf\nf\n=\nk\no\nn\n·",

We will first describe how to set up the simulation, and then will describe how to determine the kinetic parameters listed in the section of FEL model construction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] using the 26S proteasome activity assay. Finally, we will present various applications of the FEL model as examples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3028-Fig5.jpg",
    "Figure 5. Monte Carlo simulation of ATPase dynamics using the FEL model\n(A) A block diagram for simulating the dynamics of the ATPase complex using the FEL model.\n(B) One example of the FEL-model predictions. The translocation rate of cycB_NT-iRFP at various concentrations of ATP-Mg2+ displayed a non-monotonic behavior, which is well supported by the experimental measurements (red curve). Error bars represent the standard deviation of fifteen measurements at five substrate concentrations, each with three replicates. Reproduced from Fang et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nLaunch MATLAB.\nSingle run with predetermined parameters\nAssign the kinetic parameters with appropriate numbers in the command window:\n>> p1 = [0.3333 -0.2576 0.1984 72.8000 1.0340];\nNote: The details of five elements in p1 are listed in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]. The default values used for demonstration were determined by matching the simulation results with the ADP titration experiment, which will be discussed in the next section.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3028_15.csv\nAssign the nucleotide concentrations in the command window:\n>> nt1 = [0 0 500];\nNote: Three elements in nt1 represent the concentration of ADP, ATP-γS and ATP molecules in μM. 500 μM ATP is the standard nucleotide condition in the system.\nRun the simulation by calling the main function FELrun in the command window:\n>> ret = FELrun(p1, nt1);\nNote: The simulation step number is adjustable as the variable Nsteps in the script FELrun.m. We usually start with 100000. Preliminary test can be performed to make sure the ATPase complex reaches steady state after certain steps.\nWhen the program finishes, save the simulation results (the structure array ret) in the command window with a customized filename OutputFileName:\n>> save(‘OutputFileName.mat’, ‘ret');\nNote: The details of the fields in the structure array ret are summarized in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3028_16.csv",
    "Get the conformational dynamics and the work output of the ATPase machine from the saved structure array cstate.\nNote: The details of the fields in the structure array cstate are summarized in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3028_17.csv\nNote: ∗The number of the target conformations with the lowest energy to consider can be adjusted as the variable Nstates in the script evolN.m. We usually start with 1 or 2.\nDetermine the kinetic parameters in the FEL model\nExperimentally measure the degradation rates at various ADP concentrations from 0 to 10 mM in addition to 500 μM ATP using the 26S proteasome activity assay.\nOptimize the last four parameters in p1 (the first one is fixed) using a gradient descent method to identify the values allowing the best match of the simulated translocation rates with experimental values at all ADP concentrations (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: Remember to also change the input variable nt1 according to the concentration of ADP used in the 26S proteasome activity assay.\nPredict proteasome behaviors using the FEL model\nA primary application of the FEL model is to understand the molecular mechanisms of the proteasome’s functions that are driven by the ATPase dynamics which are inaccessible through direct experimental approaches. Here, we provide a few examples of using the FEL model to predict proteasome’s behaviors and obtain mechanistic insights. We normally simulate at least 100,000 steps or until the desired property converges.\nPredict the substrate translocation rate at a given condition. Here we take different ATP concentrations as an example (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nRun the simulation with various ATP concentrations from 1 μM to 30 mM.\nFor each condition tested, calculate the translocation rate as cstate.dis/ cstate.time, where cstate is saved in the structure array ret shown in steps 23–24.",
    "Experimentally determine the degradation rate through the 26S proteasome activity assay with the same group of ATP concentrations.\nCompare the simulation results with the experimental results.\nPredict ATP hydrolysis rate.\nRun the simulation with a fixed parameter set similar as in step 27.\nFor each condition tested, calculate the ATP hydrolysis rate as cstate.ATPhy/ cstate.time.\nCompare the results with experimental measurements using e.g., Malachite green assay.\nPredict the molecular transition paths between any two states of the ATPase complex.\nSet up the simulation using the starting state (conformation and nucleotide distribution) as the initial condition.\nSimulate the FEL model for   N   steps. Stop the simulation as soon as the ATPase reaches the end state. Record the intermediate steps.\nRepeat the same simulation for   M   times.\nPredict the backward translocation rate of an unfolding-resistant substrate.\nPredefine a peptide track length    L 0    which is the distance between the PL1s to the proteolytic sits inside the proteasome chamber. The substrate starts with a translocated distance    L 0    at   t = 0   when its unfolding-resistance domain is encountered by the ATPase complex, presumably its OB ring.\nNote: We set    L 0    to 20–30 AAs in our practice based on the structure of the proteasome.\nRun the simulation with an infinite energy barrier for forward translocating the unfolding-resistance domain.\nThe backward translocation occurs due to the stochasticity of the ATPase dynamics, without any additional assumption. The translocation process ends when the backward translocated distance is larger than    L 0   , when the substrate is assumed to escape from the proteasome.\nNote: Substrate reentry is not considered due to a loss of the ubiquitin signal.\nThe residence time of the unfolding-resistant domain on the proteasome is reported as cstate.time.\nThe average backward translocation rate is calculated as cstate.dis/ cstate.time.\nPredict phenotypes of ATPase mutants.",
    "Depending on the desired mutation, set the hydrolysis rate constant of the mutated subunit to zero (Walker B mutation), or set the binding constant to zero (Walker A mutation).\nRun the simulation and quantitatively evaluate the effects of the mutation on various features of the machine including the translocation rate (step 27), the ATP hydrolysis rate (step 28), and the conformational distribution which is reported as cstate.cfV.\nPredict the effect of the Lid subcomplex on the ATPase dynamics.\nNote: Based on the cryo-EM structures, the Lid subcomplex appears to only form extended interactions with the ATPase complex when the latter adopts a particular conformation as in the SA state. We therefore make a simplifying assumption that the Lid-ATPase interaction in a EA-like conformation stabilizes the ATPase by lowing its free energy.\nIn the simulation, lower the standard free energy of the EA-like conformation by 1–3 kcal/mol. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in this range.\nNote: The value of the energy is appropriately chosen for the best consistency with experimental results used in the section of Determine the kinetic parameters in the FEL model. More details have been discussed in the previous work.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] A more realistic estimation of the free-energy changes is likely to render more accurate predictions.\nRun the simulation with this extra energy term and quantitatively evaluate its effects on the conformational distribution reported as cstate.cfV.\nPredict the global dynamical space of the proteasome, which contains the steady-state distribution of the conformations and the transition rates between each two conformations.\nRun the simulation till reaching the steady state at any given condition.\nThe steady-state distribution of the proteasomal conformations is reported as cstate.cfV.\nThe transition between each two conformations can be extracted from cstate.cfM."
