  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by and followed guidelines of the University at Buffalo Institutional Animal Care and Use committee.\n1. Fluid percussion injury\nWear a lab coat or surgical gown, surgical mask, surgical gloves, and head covering and sterilize all tools and materials that contact the surgical site.\nAnesthetize a 10-12-week-old, male, Wistar rat (350-400 g) with 3% isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen in an induction chamber of appropriate size for rats. Remove the rat from the induction chamber and move it to the prep area once it is unconscious. Put the sterile ophthalmic ointment into both eyes.\nShave the hair on the rat’s head with electric clippers with a #40 blade from just above the eyes to the caudal base of the ears to produce enough surgical field. Remove any loose, clipped hair from the site.\nClean the surgical site by applying 2% chlorohexidine scrub to the shaved scalp followed by 70% ethanol. Start at the center and move outward in concentric circles away from the incision site. Repeat this process 3 times. Apply Betadine solution to the site in the same fashion and allowed to dry. \nPlace the anesthetized rat into the stereotaxic frame and maintain anesthesia at 2-3% isoflurane-1 L/min oxygen via nosecone. Check for loss of withdrawal reflex of hindlimb and loss of palpebral reflex to ensure the rat is in a surgical plane of anesthesia.\nMonitor the respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature and oxygen saturation throughout the surgery. Maintain heart rate between 300-400 bpm, and SpO2 above 90%.",
    "NOTE: A pulse-oximeter attached to a rear foot can be used to provide the constant read out of heart rate and SpO2. A heart rate above 400 bpm indicates the rat is not sufficiently anesthetized. A self-regulating warming pad, coupled to a rectal thermometer, set at 37 °C, can be positioned under the rat throughout the surgery to maintain body temperature.A stereomicroscope with a light source in combination with an optic fiber lamp are helpful for visualizing the procedure.\nUse a 23 g needle to inject 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride intradermally into the scalp at the incision site for local analgesia 10 - 15 minutes prior to making an incision. \nMake a 1.5-2.5 cm midline incision through the skin and muscle of the scalp using a #10 scalpel blade. Retract the skin and muscle to expose the skull and provide a clear surgical field. Reflect the underlying fascia and fatty tissue away from the bone with sterile cotton swabs.\n\tNOTE: An electric cautery unit is useful for achieving quick hemostasis.\nShave down the lateral ridge of the left parietal bone using a surgical curette to produce a smooth flat surface so that the base of the female-female Luer lock hub can rest flush with the skull.\nIrrigate the skull surface and surrounding tissues with 2.0 mg/mL gentamicin solution in sterile saline. Blot excess solution with a sterile swabs.\nApply 3% hydrogen peroxide to the skull to dry the bone. \n\tNOTE: If the bone is not sufficiently dry the dental cement will not adhere properly and form a solid seal.\nCreate a 5 mm diameter craniectomy site through the left parietal bone.",
    "NOTE: A trephine bit placed into a power drill attached to the stereotactic frame can be helpful to initiate the craniectomy. Use a hand drill with a 5 mm diameter trephine to slowly finish the craniectomy through the remaining bone. When close to completing the craniectomy, rotate the trephine in reverse to prevent rupture of the underlying dura mater. There will be a thinning of the skull around the perimeter of the disk and the skull flap will feel loose when pressed lightly.\nRemove the bone flap with the surgical curette and smooth tissue forceps.\n\tNOTE: Some bleeding may occur, but hemostasis can be quickly achieved by applying gentle pressure with sterile cotton swabs.\nUse a stereomicroscope and illumination to visually inspect the dura for any signs of rupture.  A thin rim of bone will remain around the circumference of the craniectomy site.  Gently remove this rim with smooth tissue forceps taking care not to rupture the dura. \nSwab the skull with 70% ethanol to remove any bone dust and to dry the skull.\nApply a thin layer of cyanoacrylate gel glue around the bottom edge of the Luer lock hub and secure it to the skull over the craniectomy without obstructing the opening. Use caution not to bring the glue in contact with the dura. Further, seal the Luer lock in place with an additional thin layer of glue around the outside base of the hub.\nPrepare a slurry of dental cement. Apply the cement to the surface of the skull around and over the base of the Luer lock hub to secure it in place.",
    "Fill the Luer lock hub with a sterile preservative free artificial cereberal spinal fluid (CSF) solution (pH 7.4) using a syringe and needle so that a convex bolus of saline can be seen above the top of the rim.\n\tNOTE: The solution will keep the dura moist as the dental cement dries as well as serves as an indication of the integrity of the seal. If the solution level falls at all, that is an indication of a leak in the system and the Luer lock must be removed and replaced.\nOnce the dental cement is completely cured, discontinue gas anesthesia and remove the rat from the stereotaxic frame.\nPlace the rat on a platform next to the FPI device.\nThe FPI device has a curved metal tip that extends from the pressure transducer at the end of the fluid reservoir. Secure a 12 cm length of pressure tubing to the end of the curved tip with the opposite end terminating in a 2 cm male Luer lock twist connector. Secure the rat to the FPI device by connecting the female end of the hub on the rat's skull to the male connector.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the connection is tightly secured and that all air bubbles have been removed from the system.\nPlace the animal in sternal recumbency and repeatedly check for return of withdrawal reflex. As soon as the rat regains withdrawal reflex but is still sedated, release the pendulum of the FPI device to cause a single 20 ms pressure pulse and induce injury.",
    "NOTE: It is important to not induce the injury while the animal is deeply anesthetized as this tends to cause increased mortality due to neurogenic-induced pulmonary edema. All devices show variability. However, on the device used for this experiment, a 17° angle placement of the hammer produces a 2.2 - 2.3 atmospheric pressure pulse. Uninjured, sham animals undergo all of the same procedures with the exception of the actual fluid pulse to the induce injury.\nImmediately disconnect the rat from the FPI device after injury, place it in sternal recumbency, and provide supplemental oxygen (1 L/min) via a nose cone until spontaneous breathing returns. Apnea is an anticipated consequence of the injury. If necessary, provide periodic manual breaths via a bag valve mask until the rat begins to spontaneously breathe on its own.\n\tNOTE: Typically, apnea lasts less than 2 min. A transient rapid rise in heart rate (>500 bpm) is observed immediately after the administration of the pressure pulse due to a catecholamine burst. This can be monitored with a pulse oximeter attached to the rat’s foot and can serve as a possible indicator that a severe injury has occurred.\nMonitor the rat continuously and record the time of return of righting reflex (stable ambulation on all four limbs).\nThe magnitude of the atmospheric pressure pulse for each rat should be within ± 0.05 atmospheres of each other. Confirm that each of the pressure pulse produces a smooth signal on the oscilloscope with consistent amplitude and duration.",
    "NOTE: A noisy signal may indicate air bubbles in the system that must be removed prior to delivering the injury pulse. Atmospheric pressure pulses that produce a severe injury, in this experiment, are those that typically result in animal righting times of 30-60 min. This range of righting times are associated with a mortality rate of approximately 40-50%).\nAdminister 10 mL of prewarmed saline subcutaneously as a supportive care.\nReturn the rat to its home cage and allow it to recover for at least 4 h.\n\tNOTE: Increased mortality has been observed when the rats are placed immediately back under anesthesia.\n2. Implantation of cortical EEG electrodes and video-EEG recording\nAt 4 h after injury, anesthetize the rat as previously described and place it back into the stereotactic frame to remove the Luer lock hub and dental cement. \n\tNOTE: The hub and cement will easily snap off with moderate pressure. When removing the hub, check carefully for any rupture or damage to the dura. Immediatly euthanize any animal with damage to the dura.\nApply a small drop of 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride to the skull in each of the locations where 5 pilot holes are to be drilled (see Figure 1).\nDrill pilot holes through the skull with a hand-held 0.1 mm drill bit.\nSecure a stainless-steel electrode screw into each pilot hole at the following locations: a reference screw is placed caudal to the lambda over the cerebellum. Recording electrodes are placed: 1) over the hemisphere ipsilateral and rostral to the craniectomy; 2) over the hemisphere ipsilateral and caudal to the craniectomy; 3) over the hemisphere contralateral and rostral to the craniectomy; 4) over the hemisphere contralateral and caudal to the craniectomy.\nSwab the skull with 70% ethanol to remove any bone dust.",
    "Cover the craniectomy site with a thin layer of sterile bone wax to cover the exposed dura. \nConnect an electrode array to the 5 EEG electrodes by wrapping the exposed end of a color-coded electrode wire tightly around its designated stainless-steel electrode screw.  \n\tNOTE: The opposite ends of each electrode wire is positioned into a specific, designated location within the pedestal connector.\nPrepare a slurry of bone cement.\nCollect the electrode wires into a coil underneath the pedestal and secure the wires and pedestal into place with bone cement. Hold the pedestal in position until the bone cement has cured.\n\tNOTE: The bone must be particularly dry and void of any residual blood in order to achieve proper adhesion and prevent premature removal of the transmitter. \nAttach the wireless transmitter with fresh batteries to the pedestal before removing the animal from the stereotactic frame.\nPlace the animal in its home cage and place the cage in proximity to the receiver and in view of a designated video camera. Initiate video/EEG recording.\n3. Collection of video-EEG recordings\nPrior to collecting EEG signals, do a frequency sweep of the room where rats will be housed for EEG collection to identify any potential interfering frequencies to prevent the collection of EEG recording with any frequency that has background noise.\nSet all transmitters to specific frequencies that are free of interference.\nSet the sampling frequency and the input range of each programmable transmitter.",
    "NOTE: This can be done using a smart tool provided by the system manufacturer. Transmitters can sample at a maximum rate of 1000 Hz, and a maximum input range of ±10 mV. In this experiment, EEG recordings between 0.5 Hz to 30 Hz were analyzed. Therefore, the sample rate was set at 250 Hz. We typically observe Amplitudes of less than 1 mV. Therefore, the set input range was at ±2 mV.\nUse EEG collection software provided by the manufacturer to continuously record video-EEG beginning on the day of injury linking each wireless transmitter via a unique frequency to a specific receiver.\n\tNOTE: Each transmitter receiver pair is capable of monitoring 4 monopolar EEG channels, and acceleration in the X, Y and Z planes. EEG data can be written to a storage server. The video data should be saved on a NAS device linked to the storage server. The EEG analysis software synchronizes the video and EEG recording based on the time maintained by the storage server.\nUse the video collection software to record video of each rat with its own 2 MP resolution camera (1920 x 1080) configured to record at 30 frames/s.\n\tNOTE: Each camera has its own infrared illumination for video collection at night.\nConfigure the system to automatically save all video and EEG recordings to a storage server every 24 h. The videos produce rather large files.\n4. Video/EEG analysis\nSynchronize the video with each EEG recording at 1/10 s resolution. Do this by using the system manufacturers video/EEG analysis software that creates a metafile with the stamp of the precise time of both of the EEG and the video.\nManually screen through EEG recordings to identify index events that define seizure activity.",
    "Using the video/EEG analysis software and index EEG events, create a configuration file that uses key parameters (i.e., power in specific frequency bands, the ratio of frequency bands to the total power, acceleration threshold, etc.) to define the characteristics of the potential seizure events.\nRun the EEG analysis software to identify potential regions of EEG recording that qualify based on the parameters selected in the configuration file.\n\tNOTE: The EEG analysis software allows for automatic seizure detection and highlights regions of interest in the EEG signals and provides FFT power spectrum analysis across the signal.\nConfirm potential convulsive seizures by using video recordings collected during acquisition, which are synchronized with each rat’s respective EEG recordings."
