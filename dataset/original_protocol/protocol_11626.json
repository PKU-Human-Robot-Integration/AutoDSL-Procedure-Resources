    "All mice experiments were approved by the local authorities (Region of Ioannina, Greece) and conducted in accordance with the European Communities Council Directives 2010/63/EU. Experiments were conducted with respect to the principles of the 3Rs. All the CD-1 mice used for the experiments were kept in the animal house facility of the University of Ioannina, Greece, in a room with controlled temperature (22 °C) and humidity (60%) and were fed ad libitum. The animal house has a license to operate a facility for breeding (EL33-BIObr01), supply (EL33-BIOsup01), and experiments (EL33BIO-exp01).\n1. Preparation of reagents\nDilute 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) powder (see the Table of Materials) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (see the Table of Materials) to a final concentration of 200 mM. Μake 10 µL aliquots, and store at −20 °C. Use the solution within 1 month.\n\tNOTE: IBMX powder is kept at −20 °C.\nPrepare all the immunofluorescence buffers, and store them at 4 °C.\n\t\nPrepare sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by diluting one PBS tablet (see the Table of Materials) in 200 mL of ddH2Ο.\nMake PHEM buffer by adding in 80 mL of ddH2Ο, 0.59575 g of HEPES, 1.81422 g of PIPES, 0.38035 g of EGTA, and 0.04066 g of MgCl2 (see the Table of Materials) while agitating with a magnetic stirrer (see the Table of Materials), and simultaneously add NaOH (see the Table of Materials) until the pH reaches 6.9 (check using a pH/ORP meter [see the Table of Materials]). Then, add ddH2Ο to a final volume of 100 mL.",
    "Prepare paraformaldehyde-Triton-X-100 (PFA-Tx-100) buffer by diluting PFA powder (see the Table of Materials) in PHEM buffer while agitating with a magnetic stirrer under heating at a final concentration of 4% PFA. Then, filter the buffer using a syringe and a 0.2 µm filter (see the Table of Materials), and add 0.5% Tx-100 (see the Table of Materials). Prepare approximately 10 mL of PFA-Tx-100 (0.4 g of PFA, 50 µL of Tx-100), which is enough for one experiment. Store it at 4 °C for 1 week maximum.\n\t\t​CAUTION: Wear gloves to handle PFA, and avoid contact with skin and eyes.\nPrepare washing buffer by adding bovine serum albumin (final concentration: 0.5% w/v BSA) (see the Table of Materials) in PBS, and agitate mechanically. Add 10% w/v NaN3 buffer (sodium azide) at a 1:1,000 dilution to minimize the risk of fungal and bacterial contamination. Make a 10% w/v NaN3 buffer by adding 1 g of NaN3 powder (see the Table of Materials) to 10 mL of ddH2O; store the NaN3 buffer at room temperature.\nPrepare blocking buffer by adding BSA (final concentration: 3% w/v) in PBS and agitating mechanically. Add 10% NaN3 buffer at a 1:1,000 dilution.\n2. Collection of GV oocytes from dissected ovaries and induction of DSBs\nNOTE: All the tools and solutions should be sterile. Oocyte handling is conducted by using a mouth pipette under a stereo microscope (see the Table of Materials), and all the drops are covered with mineral oil (see the Table of Materials and Figure 1E).\nInject mice intraperitoneally with 7 international units (IU) of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) (see the Table of Materials) 46-48 h before culling the mice by cervical dislocation.\n\tNOTE: All the mice used should be 8-12 weeks old.",
    "Filter M2 culture medium (see the Table of Materials) with a syringe and a 0.2 µm filter, and add IBMX 200 mM to a final concentration 200 µM in a 14 mL round-bottom tube (see the Table of Materials) to keep the oocytes arrested at prophase I. Then, prepare drops of M2-IBMX medium in a plastic tissue culture dish (see the Table of Materials), and place it on a hot block (see the Table of Materials) at 37 °C for at least 30 min before oocyte isolation. Store the M2 at 4 °C.\nSacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation, dissect the ovaries, and place them in a 5 mL round-bottom tube (see the Table of Materials) with M2-IBMX.\nTransfer the ovaries to a plastic lid containing 1.5 mL of M2-IBMX, remove any peri-ovarian adipose tissue or fallopian tube segments, and release the COCs by mechanical perforation of the ovaries with a 27 G needle (see the Table of Materials and Figure 1A-C).\nTransfer the COCs to a culture dish with drops of M2-IBMX (approximately 25-30 µL each), and remove the cumulus cells by repeated pipetting using a narrow-bore glass Pasteur pipette (see the Table of Materials and Figure 1D).\nSelect SN GV-stage oocytes, and transfer them in a drop (25 µL) of M2-IBMX medium on a hot block at 37 °C protected from light (Figure 1F).\n\t\nLook for SN oocytes based on their bigger size and centrally placed nuclei in contrast with NSN oocytes, in which the nuclei are positioned peripherally21. In any case, observe the DNA configuration under a confocal microscope before taking the final decision about the type of GV oocyte (SN or NSN).",
    "Induce DSBs using etoposide (see the Table of Materials). Place the GV-stage oocytes in drops (25 µL each) of the genotoxic agent for 1 h on the hot block at 37 °C in dark conditions.\n\t​NOTE: Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that introduces DSBs to the DNA22. Keep the etoposide in 10 µL aliquots of 20 mg/mL at room temperature protected from light. The concentrations that have been tested are 5 µg/mL, 20 µg/mL, and 50 µg/mL.\nTo keep the GV-stage oocytes arrested for a prolonged period, place the oocytes in drops of M16 culture medium (see the Table of Materials) supplemented with 400 µM IBMX in an incubator (see the Table of Materials) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Store the M16 at 4 °C, filter the medium with a syringe and a 0.2 µm filter, and incubate it for at least 1 h before use.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65494/65494fig01.jpg",

Oocyte fixation and immunofluorescence\nNOTE: Oocyte handling is conducted by using a mouth pipette under a stereo microscope, and all the drops are covered with mineral oil.\nPlace the control and etoposide-treated GV oocytes in different plastic tissue culture dishes with PFA-Tx-100 buffer for 40 min at room temperature.\nWash the oocytes in three different drops of washing buffer (50 µL each) at room temperature. Leave the oocytes for 5 min in each drop.\nPlace the oocytes in drops of blocking buffer (25 µL each) for 1 h on a hot block at 37 °C.\nPrepare the primary antibody that recognizes γH2AX (rabbit phospho-Η2ΑΧ) (Ser139) (see the Table of Materials) (stock solution: 1 mg/mL). Use a 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, and place the oocytes in drops of primary antibody (15 µL each) at 4 °C overnight.",
    "NOTE: Phospho-Η2ΑΧ (γH2AX) is a common marker for detecting DSBs in both somatic cells and GV oocytes18,23.\nThe following day, wash the oocytes in three different drops of washing buffer (50 µL each) at room temperature. Leave the oocytes for 5 min in each drop.\nPrepare the secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (see the Table of Materials) (stock solution: 2 mg/mL). Use a 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, and place the oocytes in drops of secondary antibody (15 µL each) for 1 h on a hot block at 37 °C protected from light.\nTransfer the oocytes into drops of DRAQ7 (25 µL each) (stock solution: 0.3 mM; see the Table of Materials), which is a far-red fluorescent DNA dye that only stains DNA in permeabilized cells. Use a 1:250 dilution in washing buffer for 10 min at room temperature in dark conditions.\nWash the oocytes in three different drops of washing buffer (50 µL each) at room temperature. Leave them for 5 min in each drop, and then transfer them to small drops (approximately 5 µL each) of washing buffer in a 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dish (see the Table of Materials) for confocal microscopy (Figure 2A).\n\t​NOTE: The washing of both the DNA stain and secondary antibody is performed at the same time.\n4. Confocal microscopy\nNOTE: Confocal microscopy should be performed immediately to avoid the reduction in the fluorescence intensity after the placement of the oocytes in glass-bottom dishes. Access to a confocal microscope (see the Table of Materials) with a motorized stage is required.\nMicroscope setup\n\t\nIn the confocal system, switch on the laser controller, the lasers, the microscope controller, the lamps for the transmitted light, and the PC (Figure 2B, D).\nOpen the confocal software, and choose the 40x oil lens.",
    "Place the dish into the specimen holder, and try to focus on the oocytes by moving the stage on XY and Z axes using the joystick (Figure 2C).\nScanning of the oocytes\n\t\nSet the laser power, the gain, and the pinhole size independently for each experiment in order to minimize any saturation.\nFor each oocyte, set the area of interest, specifically in the nucleus at the DNA area. Define the borders of the DNA area, and adjust the z step size to 3 µm. Then, start the scanning.\nSave the images for each cell in the selected folder.\nWhen the scanning is completed, exit the software, shut down the computer, and turn off the laser controller, the lasers, the microscope controller, and the lamps for the transmitted light.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65494/65494fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Confocal microscopy.

Imaging analysis\nDownload Fiji ImageJ-win64 in the browser (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads), open it, and import the data as TIFF stack files.\n\tNOTE: Open each oocyte file separately.\nClick on Image | Color | Split Channels to split all the channels.\nClick on LUT (Look up Table), and choose the preferred colors for each channel.",
    "Click on Image | Color | Merge Channels to merge the channels for γΗ2ΑΧ and DNA. Leave the brightfield channel unmerged.\nIn NSN oocytes and in SN oocytes with low levels of DNA damage, γΗ2ΑΧ is detected as foci in the DNA region. In this case, click on the \"Multi-point\" or point command, and select every γΗ2ΑΧ focus that coincides with the DNA. Repeat this step for all the stacks.\nIn SN oocytes with high levels of DNA damage, the γΗ2ΑΧ signal is distributed throughout the whole DNA region. In this case, click on Image | Stacks | Z project, and with the Freehand selections command, select the entire DNA area.\nTo measure the γΗ2ΑΧ fluorescence, click on Analyze | Measure, and copy the measurements into a .xlsx file. Then, calculate the mean fluorescence, normalize the values, and count the number of foci before creating any graphs.\nClick on Analyze | Set Scale to set the scale and then on Analyze | Tools | Scale bar to add a scale bar to the channels."
