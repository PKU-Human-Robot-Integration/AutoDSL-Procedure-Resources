    "Acute cellular and systemic responses are essential for mammals to adapt to environmental, physiological, and pathophysiological conditions causing oxygen (O2) deficiency (hypoxia). The carotid body (CB), located in the carotid bifurcation, is the main arterial chemoreceptor responsible for detecting decreases in blood O2 tension (hypoxemia) in order to trigger hyperventilation and sympathetic activation. The CB is organized in clusters of cells (glomeruli) and each glomerulus is composed of O2-sensitive glomus cells and other cell types. Recently, a signaling role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been reported underlying molecular mechanisms of acute O2 sensing (Ortega-Sáenz and López-Barneo, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). These findings would not have been possible without the development of redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) probes (Dooley et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Cannon and Remington, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Waypa et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). roGFP probes contain engineered cysteine residues, which form disulfide bonds in the presence of oxidants. This causes reciprocal changes in emission intensity when excited at two different wavelengths (see review by Cannon and Remington, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] for detailed biophysical properties of roGFPs). roGFP probes can react with several natural and synthetic redox reagents (Dooley et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), but are highly sensitive to H2O2, which is produced in mitochondria in the presence of superoxide dismutase. Using genetic targeting sequences, roGFP probes can be expressed in different intracellular compartments. These ratiometric redox probes allow us to detect rapid changes in intracellular redox status, with a time course of s/min within the dynamic range of the cellular (transmitter release) and systemic (increase in ventilation) physiological responses to hypoxia. In the current protocol, step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] are presented from CB sample preparation, roGFP probe transduction, to real-time measurement of ROS production by microfluorimetry. This method helps understand molecular mechanisms of acute O2 sensing by arterial chemoreceptors.",
    "Moreover, it may also be applied to study other physiological and pathological processes where acute ROS production plays a signaling role.",
    "Preparation of CB slices and transduction of roGFP probes by adenoviral infection\nTiming: 2 h\nMouse CBs are dissected and sectioned quickly (Ortega-Sáenz et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). roGFP probes incorporated in adenoviral vectors are transduced to CB glomus cells by adenoviral infection (Arias-Mayenco et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). CB slices are then cultured for 48 h before measurement of ROS production by microfluorimetry.\nCarotid body dissection\nSacrifice mouse with intraperitoneal administration of a lethal dose of sodium thiopental (120 to 150 mg/kg).\nQuickly dissect carotid bifurcation under a microscope and place it in ice-cooled and modified 0 Ca2+ Tyrode’s solution (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/649-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(I) Slices (150-μm thick) of the agarose block (circle) containing a CB section (arrow). The slices are floating in a small plastic tube filled with Modified 0 Ca2+ Tyrode’s solution. Scale bar, 2 mm.\nDissect CB from the carotid bifurcation by removing superior cervical ganglion, adjacent arteries, fat, and connective tissues (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C–1E).\nNote: Other anesthetic or ways of sacrifice can also be applied without interfering in the success of the experiment.\nCarotid body slicing\nEmbed CB in 1% (wt/vol) low melting-point agarose in PBS, which has been pre-warmed to 42°C, and quickly place the agarose block on ice for solidification (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G). Agarose blocks are prepared using a fragment (about 1 cm in length) of 1 mL syringe, with both ends perfectly polished and one end sealed with parafilm (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G).\nRemove the solidified agarose block from the syringe fragment, make a smaller agarose cylinder containing the CBs, and fix it to a specimen disc with cyanoacrylate. Place the specimen disc inside the buffer tray of a vibratome (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H). Fill the tray with cold, modified 0 Ca2+ Tyrode’s solution.\nMake 150 μm-thick slices using a standard razor blade (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I). Transfer slices to a plastic container and wash them twice with cold sterile PBS.\nCritical: The temperature of agarose solution for embedment should be maintained between 40°C–42°C. A temperature lower than 40°C may affect CB embedment and CB sectioning, whereas a temperature above 42°C may affect the viability of CB cells.\nCritical: The speed to section CB embedded in the agarose block needs to be maintained between 0.1 and 0.16 mm/s. CB may detach from agarose block if the speed is too high.\nAlternatives: Modified 0 Ca2+ Tyrode’s solution can be replaced with PBS without affecting the quality of CB slices.\nBrief enzymatic treatment",
    "Incubate CB sections with enzymatic digestion solution for 5 min at 37°C in a water bath with shaking.\nTransfer CB sections to a 35-mm petri dish and wash the sections with cold PBS twice.\nNote: Enzymatic treatment is performed to partially digest and loosen connective tissues in the surface of CB slices. This treatment seems to help the appearance of glomeruli on the surface of CB slices during culturing. This step is not necessary for rat CB.\nCulture and transduction of roGFP probes to CB sections by adenoviral infection\nRemove PBS completely and add culture medium, which has been pre-equilibrated in cell culture incubator of 21% O2, 5% CO2 at 37°C.\nCritical: The culture medium should be equilibrated with pH and temperature in the incubator right before use. The correct pH (7.4) of culture medium is important for CB recovery from sectioning and enzymatic treatment, and for survival during the time of culture.\nTransduce roGFP probes into CB cells by adenoviral infection. roGFP DNA construct has been incorporated previously in adenoviral vector. One μl of adenovirus with a stock concentration of 1–1.2 × 1012 viral particles/mL is added to 2 mL of complete culture medium.\nCritical: The amount of adenovirus necessary for infection may vary from one lot of virus production to another. To maximize transduction efficiency, functional viral titration may be performed, and approximately 400,000 pfu/mL of adenovirus is recommended for each infection.\nAdenovirus with different roGFP constructs are available to target specific subcellular compartments: cytosol, cyto-roGFP (VQAd ro-GFP); mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), IMS-roGFP (VQAd CMV GDP-roGFP); and mitochondrial matrix, matrix-roGFP (VQAd CMV mito-roGFP) (Waypa et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).",
    "Culture CB sections in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 21% O2 at 37°C for 24 h. CB slices from each mouse (4–6 slices) are cultured in a 35-mm petri dish. Before putting in the incubator, shake the dish slightly and horizontally to avoid slice overlapping.\nReplace the medium with adenovirus-free culture medium and incubate CB sections for an additional 24 h before microfluorimetric recording of ROS production.\nAlternatives: If necessary, cells may be incubated with adenovirus-containing culture medium for 48 h until microfluorimetric recording to allow maximum roGFP expression. This may be useful especially when the transduction efficiency is low.\nCritical: The optimal culturing time of CB slices is 24 to 48 h, which allows the recovery of typical CB glomerulus morphology and response to physiological stimuli, such as hypoxia and hypercapnia. CB slices can be maintained in relatively good conditions for up to 4–5 days (Fernández-Agüera et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). However, the number of O2 responding cells in CB sections decreases with time after reaching a maximum number at about 48 h. It is essential to maintain CB slices healthy, since the response to hypoxia of CB glomus cells can be easily lost.\nNote: When possible, it is recommended to use young adult mice (2–3 months). Although feasible, older mice tend to contain more connective tissue, which may affect the quality of tissue sectioning and enzymatic treatment.\nReal-time recording of ROS production from CB slices using roGFP probes by microfluorimetry\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "ROS production is recorded in real-time using a microfluorimetric setup 48 h after adenoviral infection. As shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, our microfluorimetric setup consists of a direct microscope equipped with a 60×/0.90w objective, a filter wheel, a 150 W xenon lamp, a monochromator, a CCD camera and a computer. The monochromator allows to excite samples at different wavelength. The emitted fluorescence passes through a band-pass filter and is detected by a CCD camera. Monochromator, CCD camera, and image acquisition are controlled by Live Acquisition software.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/649-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

See text for details.\n(B and C) Representative carotid body (CB) slice 48 h after adenoviral infection in bright field (B) and with excitation of 480 nm and emission of 535 nm (C), demonstrating green fluorescent signal due to roGFP expression.

Scale bar, 10 μm.\n(D) Representative recording of fluorescent signals excited at 400 nm and 480 nm with an emission at 535 nm and the ratio of fluorescent signals (400/480) of a CB glomus cell. DTT, dithiothreitol.",
    "roGFP expression in CB section can be observed (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). ROS production in different subcellular compartments, such as mitochondrial IMS, mitochondrial matrix, and cytosol, can be measured using roGFP probe targeted to each compartment (Waypa et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). roGFPs have two fluorescence excitation peaks (400 and 484 nm), which allows ratiometric measurements to determine reversible changes of redox state (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). The presence of oxidants causes a disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues in roGFP and an increase in the fluorescent signal at the 400 nm excitation wavelength and a decrease at 480 nm wavelength. In addition, basal level redox state can be determined by in situ calibration of roGFP probes with excess reducing agent (dithiothreitol) to achieve maximum reduction and oxidant (H2O2) to achieve maximum oxidation. Effect of hypoxia on ROS production from CB glomus cells can be studied using recording solutions bubbled with gas mixtures containing different O2 content.\nTransfer a CB slice to the recording chamber of microfluorimetric setup, which has been filled with pre-warmed recording solution, and maintain a continuous flow of recording solution.\nNote: The recording solution is pre-warmed to 37°C and kept in a water bath of 37°C during the experiment in order to maintain the recording temperature at 30°C–33°C.\nNote: The volume of recording solution in the recording chamber is minimized to ≈ 0.2 mL during recording to facilitate fast changes of experimental condition. The flow rate of recording solution is about 4 mL/min.\nUse a dichroic Di02-R488 (Semrock) and a band-pass filter FF01-520/35 (Semrock) for recording.\nSelect single glomus cell (region of interest, ROI) with strong green fluorescent signal, indicating high level of roGFP expression. Several ROIs can be selected in the same field for simultaneous recording.",
    "Critical: To avoid florescent signal bleaching during experiment, it is recommended to decrease exposure time right after ROI selection.\nNote: Adenoviral infection results in transduction of roGFP probes not only in glomus cells, but also in other cell types in CB. Immunohistochemical analyses indicate that after 48 h in culture, most of the cells in the glomeruli that appear at the surface of the slice are glomus cells (tyrosine hydroxylase positive) (Pardal et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). These cells can be easily distinguished morphologically from other cell types in CB glomeruli under microscope. Glomus cells are round with big nucleus and form compact clusters. Glomus cell clusters without compact structure usually indicate a poor quality of culture and may not be suitable for experiment.\nEstablish the acquisition protocol at the beginning of the experiment using Live Acquisition software (T.I.L.L. Photonics). A spatial resolution of 8 x 8 pixels, an excitation time of 20 milliseconds and an acquisition interval of 5 s are used. Two fluorescence excitation wavelengths (400 and 484 nm) are selected with the emission wavelength of 535 nm. The resulting 400/484 ratio is recorded to determine reversible changes of redox state in each selected ROI. Background fluorescent signal is subtracted from an area of CB section without green fluorescent signal.\nTo study the effect of hypoxia on ROS production, recording solution is bubbled with gas mixtures containing different percentage of O2. For normoxic condition, the gas mixture is comprised of 20% O2, 5% CO2, and 75% N2 (O2 tension ~145 mmHg). For hypoxic treatment, a gas mixture with 5% CO2 and 95% N2 is used so that an O2 tension of ~10 to 15 mmHg is reached in the recording chamber.",
    "Critical: To avoid potential artifact, the switch from normoxic to hypoxic condition is achieved changing only the gas mixture used to bubble the recording solution instead of changing perfusing tube and recording solution. With the flow rate of 4 mL/s and the low volume (0.2 mL) of recording solution in the recording chamber, gas concentration in the recording chamber is equilibrated rapidly with the bubbled gas mixture.\nNote: Oxygen tension in the recording solution can be monitored using an oxygen electrode, which is an insulated carbon or platinum fiber polarized to −700 mV. Redox currents generated at the tip of the electrode are proportional to the amount of dissolved O2 in the recording solution (Ganfornina and López-Barneo, 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). In addition, gas mixtures with different O2 levels can be used to study dose-dependent effect of hypoxia on ROS production (Arias-Mayenco et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nDetermine basal level redox state of CB glomus cells at the end of experiment. Record 400/484 ratio with cyto-roGFP. Perform in situ calibration of roGFP probes by treating CB slice with 1 mM dithiothreitol to achieve maximum reduction (0% oxidation) and 0.1 mM H2O2 to achieve maximum oxidation (100% oxidation).\nCritical: During experiment, ROIs may move away from the recording region due to subtle movements of the CB slice. Recording may be paused to re-localize ROIs before resuming the recording."
