Pull the glass capillaries with a P-1000 micropipette puller with heat: 850, vel: 30, and time: 250.\nNote: Store the pulled glass capillaries in a closed container to avoid dust, which may clog the micropipette. Autoclaving of micropipettes is not necessary.\nTrim the tip of the glass micropipette with microscissors.\nCut off about 1–2 mm of excess glass.\nBevel the micropipette tip with a microforge.\nRefine the length of the micropipette tip to about 4.5–5 mm.\nNote: The approximate aperture size of the glass micropipette was measured under a microscope with a microscope graduated slide, using a micropipette chipper to create a tip with a 30–40 μm aperture.\nNote: Smaller tips may easily cause clogging; larger tips may cause tissue damage and make it difficult to penetrate the spinal cord.\nAssemble the microinjection system (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3165-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Intra-spinal dorsal horn microinjection\n(A) The components of the microinjection system. This microinjection system comprises a stereotaxic instrument, microsyringe, micropump, spine clamps, and illumination lights.\n(B) Joint Teflon tubing connects the glass micropipette with the microsyringe.\n(C) The schematic showing the intra-spinal dorsal horn injection site (red X).\n(D) Photograph showing intra-spinal dorsal horn injection site.\n(E) Schematic illustration of intra-spinal dorsal horn injection.\nSet up the stereotaxic frame.\nMount the microsyringe injector into the manipulator of the micropump.\nConnect the injector to the controller.\nFix the microsyringe so that the vernier scale is visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nAttach one of the glass micropipettes to the microsyringe using the Joint Teflon tubing.\nCarefully fill the microsyringe and micropipette with mineral oil and make sure that no air bubbles remain in the micropipette.",
    "Use aseptic techniques when handling the micropipette, avoiding contact with the tip.\nPrepare the virus solution. On the day of the injection, defrost a stock aliquot of the required purified virus on the ice and keep it on the ice before the injection.\nCritical: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, which may reduce the effective titer of the virus. If necessary, the defrosted virus aliquot can be kept at 4°C for up to 3 days.\nNote: Different serotypes of AAVs have different tropisms. There is no known universal serotype that works for all neurons. There are 15 different types of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. For the specific type of neurons, if low or no expression is observed with one serotype, one should test other serotypes.\nNote: Based on our experience and literature, rAAV8 under the control of a hSyn promoter could drive gene expression in spinal dorsal horn neurons, and rAAV2/5, a serotype showing a preferential tropism for astrocytes, under the control of a gfap promoter was used to drive gene expression in spinal dorsal horn astrocytes.\nDilute the virus particles with sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS) if needed and prepare the appropriate amount of virus solution as required by the experiment.\nCritical: The appropriate titer depends on the purpose of the experiment and should be determined by preliminary experiments. The titer used in the current protocol was 2.6E+11 GC/mL.",
    "Note: Taking excess and some loss while loading the capillary into account, therefore, if each mouse needs 1 mL of virus solution, about 2.5 mL of virus solution will be needed for each mouse. Viruses are infectious reagents and should be handled according to the relevant guidelines. In most cases, rAAVs-related experiments can be handled at biosafety level 1 laboratories. Transport and store the virus on the ice when not in use.\nLoad the virus. Move the tip of the micropipette carefully into the virus solution, and control the micropump connected to the micro syringe to load the virus solution at a rate of 200 nL/s.\nAnesthetize animals and surgical site preparation\nTiming: about 15 min\nThis section describes animal anesthesia and pre-surgery preparation for virus injection.\nWeigh the animal using a digital scale. Record the preoperative weight to determine the required anesthetic dose and to facilitate postoperative weight monitoring.\nNote: Mice aged 10–12 weeks (approximately 22–25 g) were selected and used in this protocol.\nNote: Injections can be given to young or old animals if the experimental design requires. In principle, any strain and both sexes can be used, but the same background strain should be used to compare the behavior between different transgenic mouse strains. If you expect or want to investigate sex differences, analyze male and female animals in different groups.\nAnesthetize mice with 5% isoflurane. Place the mice in the anesthesia induction chamber at 5% and then keep them under 2%–3% isoflurane anesthesia once asleep.\nCritical: Monitor the respiration rate throughout the surgery and adjust anesthesia as required.\nPre-surgery preparation.\nPlace the animal in the stereotaxic frame on a heat mat and maintain anesthesia at 2%–3% isoflurane.\nShave the fur from the lower back to the neck of the mouse and remove the hair carefully.",
    "Disinfect the shaved skin with 75% ethanol pads followed by 1% povidone-iodine (3 times).\nIsolate the aseptically prepared site with a surgical drape.\nPlace lubricant eye ointment on each eye to protect the eyes from drying during the operation. Reapply lubricant as necessary.\nIntraspinal dorsal horn microinjection without laminectomy\nTiming: about 40 min\nThis section describes how to perform minimally invasive methods for microinjection of the virus into the mouse spinal dorsal horn.\nIncise the skin at the Th12-L3 (critical step).\nFix the mouse on a stereoscope frame with lug rods and keep it under 2%–3% isoflurane anesthesia.\nGently press fingers on the rib of the mouse to find the Th12-L3 vertebra through the skin.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] When the mouse is lying on a table, the highest point of the back is around the Th13 vertebrate (the last rib), as marked in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, which is used to locate the 13 thoracic vertebrates.\nUse a No. 10 scalpel to make a 3–4 cm incision in the skin at the Th12-L3, exposing the muscle. Gently stretch the skin and press firmly with the scalpel blade to make sure the incision is clean.\nNote: The spinal cord does not extend the entire length of the spinal vertebrae because the spinal cord stops growing earlier in postpartum development. This means that the target spinal level may be under different named vertebrae. The L4 spinal segment is located below the first lumbar spine (L1). L1 is located caudally in the vertebra that supports the last pair of ribs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nStabilize the target vertebra.\nPlace the animal on a rolled-up tissue pad and lift it onto the spine clamp of the stereoscopic frame.\nSecure the animal to a stereotaxic frame with the spinal clamps apparatus at the rostral and caudal sites of the incision respectively.",
    "Critical: Fixation of the target vertebra prevents movement of the vertebra due to breathing and allows for an accurate virus injection.\nLocate the injection site (critical step).\nSeparate the fascia covering the spine and remove the paraspinal muscle around the left side of the interspace between the Th13 and L1 vertebrae.\nUsing the 13th rib, the last rib, to locate the 13th thoracic vertebrate. L1 is located caudally in the vertebra that supports the 13th ribs) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nIncise the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane with the tip of a 30G needle to make a small hole that allows the micropipette to insert directly into the spinal dorsal horn through the hole (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nMove the glass micropipette approximately 500 μm lateral from the midline.\nInsert the tip into the spinal dorsal horn 250 μm in depth from the surface of the dorsal root entry zone (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCritical: Throughout the surgery, keep the exposed tissues moist with sterile 0.9% NaCl.\nVirus injection.\nWait for 2 min after the glass micropipette is in place to allow the nervous tissue to accommodate the glass micropipette.\nSet the injection volume of the pump as 500 nL.\nProgram the injection speed as 100 nL/min.\nPress the start button of the pump to start the injection.\nAfter the injection is complete, check the scale to see whether the virus level decreases, leave the micropipette for 5 min to balance the pressure, and then slowly withdraw the syringe.\nAfter microinjection, suture the superficial tissue layers with absorbable 6-0 sutures, close the skin with 6-0 non-absorbable nylon sutures, and keep the animal on a heating pad until recovery.\nSpinal cord fixation and cryosection\nTiming: about 15 min\nThis section describes the procedures of fixation, dehydration, cryosection, and mounting of the spinal cord tissues for imaging.",
    "Three weeks after the virus injection, anesthetize the animals by the injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p.), perfuse transcardially with about 20 mL 1x PBS, and fix with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde/1x PBS.\nRemove the whole spine.\nPostfix with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde/1x PBS for about 12 h at 4°C.\nPlace in 30% sucrose solution for 24 h at 4°C.\nNote: The spinal cord is ready for processing when saturated with 30% sucrose – as indicated when the spinal cord sinks to the bottom of the solution.\nSection the spinal cord.\nDissect the L3-L5 segments of the spinal cord.\nEmbed the spinal cord section in the OCT compound.\nSection 40 μm thick transverse slices from anterior to posterior with the cryostat.\nMount the spinal cord sections on the adhesive slide with cover glass with the aqueous mounting medium containing DAPI. Once the mounting solution solidifies, seal it with nail polish.\nConfocal imaging and dendritic spine analysis\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis section describes how to identify wide dynamic range neurons and how to analyze dendritic spine morphology in the spinal dorsal horn.\nCapture the wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons with only the EGFP channel visible to the experimenter using a confocal microscope with a 63x oil immersion objective. Take the Z-series at an interval of 0.37 mm for each dendrite.",
    "Note: Identify WDR neurons with the five criteria based on previous studies3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]: Neurons are located within lamina 4 and 5; EGFP-positive neurons must have had dendrites and spines that were completely impregnated, appearing as a continuous length; At least one dendrite extended into an adjacent lamina relative to the origin of the cell body; At least one-half of the primary dendritic branches remained within the thickness of the tissue section, such that their endings were not cut and instead appeared to taper into an ending; The cell body diameter fell between 20 and 50 mm.\nMeasure the dendritic spines.\nObtain and visualize the dendritic spine image from EGFP-expressing neurons with 3D confocal stacks using Imaris software (Bitplane Scientific Software).\nClassify the spines emanating from dendrites with a clear head structure.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nCount the dendritic spines from the secondary and tertiary segments of the dendrite using the Imaris filament tool.\nRecord the length of selected dendrites and the number of dendritic spines. Determine the dendrite spine density by calculating the number of spines of dendrite length and express as the spine density per 10 μm of dendrites.\nF-actin to G-actin ratio measurement\nTiming: about 2 days\nThis section describes how to prepare and measure the F-actin and G-actin from spinal dorsal horn tissues.\nIn parallel with morphology analysis, we used a separate group of animals to measure F-actin to G-actin ratio in the spinal dorsal horn.\nIsolate the spinal dorsal horn from the 4th lumbar of mice, homogenize in cold lysis buffer 1, centrifuge at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4°C, and measure the soluble actin (G-actin) in the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the insoluble F-actin in the pellet in lysis buffer plus an equal volume of buffer 2 and incubate on ice for 1 h to convert F-actin into soluble G-actin, with gentle mixing every 15 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4°C, and measure the F-actin in this supernatant. Proportionally load the samples from the supernatant (G-actin) and pellet (F-actin) fractions and analyze them by western blotting."
