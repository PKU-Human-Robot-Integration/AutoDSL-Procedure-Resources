    "1. Cell Harvesting and Freezing\nGrow 1-8 g of cell material using the appropriate culturing conditions for the cell line of interest25,26. This protocol is optimized for up to 8 grams of cells (~109 cells), modified from references19,27,28. Typically, ~5 g of HEK-293 or HeLa cells can be obtained from eight 500 cm2 culture plates grown to ~90% confluency.\n\tCAUTION: These protocols use liquid nitrogen (LN2), capable of causing severe cryogenic burns. Don protective clothing and exercise appropriate handling precautions.\nPour off the growth medium (waste) into a large beaker.\nPlace the culture dish on ice in a large rectangular ice pan.\nAdd 20 ml of ice-cold 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to the culture dish and release the cells from the dish using a large cell scraper; transfer the cells to a 50 ml tube, pre-chilled on ice; hold the tube on ice.\n\tNOTE: For all cell handling steps use an electro-pipettor set to \"low\" and 25 ml pipettes to avoid excessive shearing of cells during transfer manipulations. Arrange 50 ml collection tubes and 1x PBS in an ice bucket prior to initiating the procedure.\nAdd an additional 10 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS to the same dish. Collect the remaining cells and transfer them to the 50 ml tube.\nRepeat for each dish; cell suspensions from different dishes may be combined to reduce sample number and plastic waste.\n\tNOTE: Because the cells themselves will not constitute a large proportion of the suspension volume, three plates worth of cell suspension can be combined into two 50 ml tubes. Because 50 ml tubes actually hold more than the nominal volume, eight plates can typically be spread across five such tubes.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C.",
    "Carefully pour off the supernatant. Resuspend each pellet in 10 ml ice-cold 1x PBS. Consolidate the resuspended pellets, up to 5 per 50 ml tube, to reduce sample number.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C.\nCarefully pour off the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml ice-cold 1x PBS\nRemove the plunger from a 20 ml syringe and set it aside. Cap the nozzle of the syringe and transfer the cell suspension to it.\nPlace the syringe inside a 50 ml tube and centrifuge 5 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant with a fine tip pipette attached to a vacuum trap system until just the top layer of cells begins to be sucked up. This results in a wet cell pellet.\nUncap the syringe, insert the plunger and drip the cells directly into a large plastic beaker filled with LN2, held in an LN2 bath in a Styrofoam box. Forcibly plunge the remaining cells from the syringe.\nTransfer the frozen cells to 50 ml tubes by pouring. Loosely cap the tubes to allow excess LN2 to evaporate; hold them overnight at -80 °C. Tighten caps fully the next day. The frozen cell may be stored in this way at -80 °C until cryomilling.\n\tNOTE: Do not tightly close the tubes before all the LN2 has visibly evaporated, otherwise excessive pressure may cause the tube to explode. Not closing the tubes after the LN2 has dissipated may result in the accumulation of frost on the cells material, adding excess water weight and effectively reducing the protein concentration upon milling.\n2. Cryogenic Disruption of Frozen Cells",
    "NOTE: All tools for milling and manipulations should be pre-cooled with LN2. A small decanter will be required for adding LN2 within the jar and for pouring LN2 over the top of the closed milling jar. A homemade tool is shown in reference19. Cryogenic gloves will be needed to handle the LN2 cooled milling apparatus. The milling jar lids used here (see Table of Materials) typically ship with a rubber gasket installed; this will need to be replaced with a commercially available Teflon lid gasket to reliably execute the following protocol. Furthermore, because pressure from gaseous N2 can build up to high levels within the jar during milling, we recommend installing a commercially available 5 bar/500 kPa pressure valve as a safety release precaution28.\nRemove cell beads from -80 °C storage and hold in a 50 ml tube holder in an LN2 bath.\nPre-cool the 50 ml jar, two 20 mm balls, and lid in a clean rectangular ice bucket containing LN2. Pre-cool the Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) insulator if using one; either a set of pucks (see reference27), or a sleeve-and-puck (see Figure 2). Pre-cooling is complete when the violent boiling of LN2 calms.\nSet appropriate counterbalance on the mill.\n\tNOTE: This will be equal to the mass of the jar, jar lid, the milling balls being used, and the quantity of cells to be added to the jar. If any PTFE insulators are used, their mass should also be included. We suggest recording the masses of the jar, lid, and balls (and their combined mass, including any insulator used) in advance and recording them on an informational sheet stored near the mill.\nUsing forceps, place the two pre-cooled 20 mm milling balls and the frozen cells inside the pre-cooled milling jar.",
    "Note: Due to small losses of material on the jar and ball surfaces during milling, the percentage of recovered material increases as the mass of cells milled increases. By the method described, material losses are very modest, being on the order of ~0.3 g wet cell weight (WCW). The manufacturer’s guidelines indicate the maximum volume of sample loaded should be ~1/3 of jar volume.29 The total volume of the balls should be ~1/3 and remaining ~1/3 free space is for free movement of the balls.\nAdd LN2 to the jar up to ~½ full, place the lid on the jar and transfer the assembly to the mill.\n\tNOTE: First install the chosen insulator if using one.\nClamp the assembly in place and perform three cycles of milling using following program: 400 rpm, 3 min, reverse-rotation each minute, no interval break. Cool the milling jar with LN2 in between each cycle.\n\tNOTE: During milling a distinct clunking noise is generated as the balls collide within the jar in planetary motion. If these sounds are not heard, milling is not occurring. Terminate the milling cycle, do not count this cycle, move the jar assembly back to LN2 and examine the contents of the jar. Ensure no ice has formed and if it has, chip it away from the jar walls with a pre-cooled spatula. Start again from step 2.5.",
    "If using no insulator or insulator pucks, move the jar assembly back to LN2 between cycles to re-cool and add LN2 to ~½ full each time. The LN2 added will evaporate within the jar as the temperature of the jar increases during milling. This results in pressure build-up within the jar. Therefore, when disengaging the jar from the mill, release the clamp very slowly. If the clamp is released rapidly, cell powder may escape with rapid depressurization. A slow release of the clamp allows the pressure to escape from the jar in a gentle, controlled fashion, and prevents loss of cell material. The gentle escape of gaseous N2 can often be heard hissing as the clamp is slowly released — this is normal.\n\tIf using a sleeve-and-puck insulator, the jar assembly can be left in the mill and LN2 added to the insulator/jar assembly in situ.\nMove the jar back to LN2, and let rest momentarily to cool. If using a sleeve-and-puck insulator, the jar can be removed from the sleeve with the aid of two spatulas, providing leverage on either side. Once the jar is resting in LN2, carefully remove the lid, remove the balls using forceps, and transfer the powder to a pre-cooled 50 ml tube using a pre-cooled spatula. Adding a little LN2 to the open jar / powder can help to dislodge powder that is caked onto the balls, before removing them.\n\tNOTE: Once the jar has been opened, add a small amount of LN2 to it before removing the balls. This will help to recover powder caked on the surfaces. Cell powder should be held at -80 °C or below until use. In our experience, cell powder can be stored in this way, essentially indefinitely, without affecting performance.",
    "3. Affinity Capture of Protein Complexes from Cell Extracts\nNOTE: The following protocol implements affinity media comprised of an affinity ligand, bait, or antibody that interacts with the protein of interest, coupled to micron-scale paramagnetic beads. These can be prepared in-house19,30, using commercially available kits, or purchased as ready-made reagents.\nCell Extract Preparation\n\tNOTE: When handling cell powder, remember to use utensils and tubes pre-cooled with LN2. Tubes containing the cell powder should always be held on LN2 when not at -80 °C. Place the 50 ml tube(s) containing cell powder in a tube rack, in a Styrofoam container with LN2.\n\t\nWeigh out 100 mg of cell powder into a 1.5 or 2 ml microfuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: We have observed that this quantity of cells is a good starting point that will typically yield the target protein in the tens to hundreds of nanograms range after affinity capture for a moderately expressed protein (~50 kDa mass, present at thousands of copies per cell), presuming the extraction and capture efficiencies of the target are ≳70%. Such yields provide for direct visualization of the purified fraction by SDS-PAGE and protein staining.\nTare analytical balance with the empty microfuge tube. Dispense cell powder into a tube using an LN2 cooled spoon or spatula. Check the mass of the powder dispensed within tube on the analytical balance.\n\t\tNOTE: To ease the weighing out of cell powders, small volumetric measuring spoons may be used. These have been found to give reproducible results (see reference19). We have found best results using screw-cap or 'safe-lock' microcentrifuge tubes. Pressure from evaporating LN2 that may enter the tubes can cause standard microcentrifuge tubes to pop open during subsequent warming just prior to the addition of the extraction solution - potentially resulting in loss of the sample.",
    "Open the tube (or loosen screw-cap) with cell powder and let stand at RT for 1 min. This will release pressure within the tube and prevent the immediate freezing of the extraction solution when added to the powder. No thawing is observed during this 1 min incubation.\nAdd 400 µl of extractant supplemented with protease inhibitors and vortex briefly, then hold on ice while proceeding to step 3.1.5. Samples should be held on ice between all subsequent manipulations until elution.\n\t\tNOTE: The best composition of the extractant will depend upon the protein complex(es) to be purified. Some general guidance is provided in Table 1 and the supporting references.\nUse a microtip ultrasonicator to give the sample a brief low energy pulse to disperse any aggregates. (Ultra)sonicate with 4 pulses (2 sec each, 2 A; approximately 15-20 J of total energy).\n\t\tNOTE: Vortexing dispenses the cell powder into the extractant, but depending on the solution character, some aggregates may be observed. We have found that dispersing these aggregates provides for the best yield during subsequent affinity capture. A brief microtip sonication easily disperses these aggregates. The solution should appear semi-translucent but homogenous, without obvious aggregates. Water bath sonicators tend to be too low power to efficiently disperse such aggregates without significantly longer sample handling times, but may be suitable with appropriate settings.\nClarify the extract by centrifugation (e.g., 20,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C).\n\t\tNOTE: An aliquot of the clarified cell extract may be saved for comparison to the contents of the pellet, the post-affinity capture supernatant, and the fractions obtained after elution from the affinity medium to determine the efficiency of extraction and capture of the target protein, e.g., by western blot (see Discussion).\nRemove the supernatant (clarified extract) and proceed to the affinity capture.",
    "NOTE: The pellet may be re-extracted in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer at 70 °C to determine the degree of release of the target protein during the initial non-denaturing extraction by comparison to the extract obtained in step 3.1.6.\nAffinity Capture\nPrewash the magnetic affinity medium. This can be done while cell extracts are being centrifuged.\nPlace the tube(s) on the magnet. The beads will accumulate on the side of the tube within seconds, permitting the storage solution to be removed.\nAdd 500 µl of extraction solution to beads. Briefly vortex mix at medium speed (sufficient to resuspend). Pulse-spin the tubes in a mini-centrifuge to collect all contents to the bottom. Doing so ensures the minimum carryover of solutions. Place tubes on the magnet and aspirate the solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Magnetic media with distinctive characteristics are available from a wide variety of commercial suppliers. Results may vary depending upon these characteristics, including bead size, uniformity, surface coating, and antibody coupling chemistry. Side-by-side trials in your application are recommended before settling on a choice reagent.\nInitiate the affinity capture by transferring the clarified cell extract to a 1.5-2.0 ml tube containing pre-washed affinity medium and vortex briefly to resuspend.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4 °C with continuous gentle mixing on a rotator wheel; the beads should remain suspended throughout the incubation.",
    "Pulse-spin the tubes in a mini-centrifuge to collect all contents to the bottom of the tube. Aspirate the supernatant and wash the beads three times with 1 ml of cold extraction solution as described in step 3.2.3. Place the tubes on the magnet. Remove the solution. Proceed to add the next solution and repeat.  During the 2nd wash, transfer the beads and wash solution together to a fresh microfuge tube by pipetting. This reduces sample contamination, at the point of elution, by random proteins adsorbed to the walls of the tube used for incubation with the cell extract. After the 3rd wash, the beads should be pulse-spun briefly in a mini-centrifuge to collect all contents to the bottom. Place the tube back on the magnet, and remove any residual liquid. This permits removal of the last few µl of solution before eluting, ensuring the eluted samples will have uniform volumes. It also ensures the elution will be efficacious, as the elution solution will not be diluted by residual wash; such residues can also contribute to salt effects and alter the migration of proteins in SDS-PAGE (see below).   \n\t\tNOTE: An aliquot of the post-binding supernatant may be saved for comparison to the clarified extract generated in 3.1.6. by western blot. The result will indicate the degree of depletion of the target protein from the cell extract.\nElute in either a native or denaturing manner; consider the strategy best for the downstream application1.\n\t\tNOTE: The details of native elution strategies will depend upon the affinity tag used (See Discussion). For most users, denaturing elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by analysis of the sample by SDS-PAGE with protein staining31, will be the most practical initial approach.",
    "NOTE: The composition of the sample buffer will depend on the electrophoresis system being used. Many labs cast their own Tris-glycine gels, making use of discontinuous electrophoresis and the Laemmli buffer system32-34. A common sample buffer recipe (1x) includes: 10% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mM DTT, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.8, 0.0004% (w/v) bromophenol blue31. We suggest preparing a 1.1x stock that omits DTT. 1/10th the volume of 500 mM DTT should be added to the sample before SDS-PAGE (see below). Many commercially available SDS-PAGE systems are also available; these may include system-specific sample buffers.\nAdd SDS-PAGE sample buffer without reducing agent (to mitigate the release of antibody chains from the beads) and incubate for 5-10 min at room temperature with agitation.\n\t\tNOTE: This will interfere with most affinity-based interactions, releasing the captured proteins into the supernatant. More persistent interactions may benefit from elevated temperature for release (typically 70 °C is sufficient).\nCollect and save the supernatant. Samples may be frozen at -20 °C for brief storage (a few days) or -80 °C for extended storage until analysis is desired.\nSubject the samples to SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining using standard techniques31. MS may be used to characterize the sample composition1. Individual protein bands may be excised for identification or the entire sample may be characterized in a single analysis by electrophoresing the sample only briefly (4-6 mm into the gel) and processing all the proteins in the sample together as a 'gel plug.'\n\t\tNOTE: Add DTT before initiating electrophoresis. If planning to proceed to MS, samples may be alkylated after electrophoresis35; however, it is frequently more convenient to alkylate prior to electrophoresis36."
