    "This protocol was in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The procedure was explained to all participants before commencement of the study.\n1. Participant screening\nRecruit 15 healthy women in their twenties through convenience sampling. Check medical history verbally. Exclude participants with cardiopulmonary disease.\nExplain the procedure to the participant.\nAsk the participant to refrain from eating and drinking 2 h prior to the commencement of the measurement and to bring a tight-fitting black shirt.\n2. Procedure\nPreparation for the procedure\n\t\nCalibrate the gas analyzer that has integrated components of a pneumotachograph and oxygen/carbon dioxide concentration meters 15 – 30 min before the measurement. Follow manufacturer's protocols.\nAttach a video camera to a tripod at a distance of 1.5 m from the chair the participant will sit on. Prepare to record a lateral view of the sitting participant in a range from the top of the cranium to the seat of the chair.\nInstruct the waiting participant to put on the tight-fitting black shirt in a cubicle, and when ready, stand by the side of the chair in the laboratory.\nPlace three electrodes (positive, negative and ground) on the skin of the chest in standing, each with a wire to connect to a transmitter that relays to the electrocardiograph.\nSeat the participant comfortably for 5 min in a chair with a back support at an angle of 70° and, if necessary, insert a small cushion in the neck and/or lumbar region.\nExplain to the participant deep breathing with a natural breathing (NB) pattern of slow and deep breaths, breathing in through the nose and blowing out through the mouth with no consideration or knowledge given on specific movement of the chest.",
    "Ask the participant to take a natural deep breath without any guidance. Prepare to begin measurement if the investigator is satisfied with breathing performance. Observe the participant's thoracoabdominal movement during inspiration and expiration.\nMeasurement of deep breathing with the NB pattern\n\t\nFit the participant with a sampling mask over the mouth and nose for measurement of the expired gas. Perform a seal test: close the hole for the sampling tube of the mask with a finger and ask the participant to breathe out gently and confirm whether air leaks from the mask. Connect a sampling tube to the mask for measurement of the ventilatory parameters.\nAsk the participant to refrain from talking during the procedure.\nInstruct the participant to rest for 5 min, and simultaneously begin recording the expired gas and heart rate, together with video capture. After the 5 min rest phase, instruct the participant to begin deep breathing for 5 min with NB pattern. On termination, instruct the participant to rest for 5 min.\nContinue recording and measuring throughout the three phases.\nPerform only one three-phase trial for each participant.\nRest phase\n\t\nInform the participant that the experimenter will take off the mask and allow her a 10 min intermission phase.\nInstruct the participant that she may sit and talk in the laboratory, but not drink. Begin timing the intermission phase with a stopwatch at the moment of taking off the mask.\nMeasurement of deep breathing with the diaphragmatic breathing (DB) pattern\nSeat the participant as in step 2.1.5.",
    "Explain to the participant deep breathing with a diaphragmatic breathing (DB) pattern. Ask the participant to lace her fingers, place them on her abdomen and take a deep breath in through the nose, expanding the abdomen under the hands and then blowing out through the mouth and gently retracting the abdomen.\nInstruct the participant to practice this deep breathing with the DB pattern until the investigator is satisfied. Observe that thoracoabdominal expansion takes place during inspiration followed by its contraction on expiration.\nFit the participant with a sampling mask over the mouth and nose for measurement of the expired gas. Perform a seal test: close the hole for the sampling tube of the mask with a finger and ask the participant to breathe out gently and confirm whether air leaks from the mask. Connect a sampling tube to the mask for measurement of the ventilatory parameters.\nAsk the participant to refrain from talking during the measurement.\nInstruct the participant to rest for 5 min, and simultaneously begin recording the expired gas and heart rate, together with video capture. After the 5 min rest phase, instruct the participant to begin deep breathing for 5 min with the DB pattern. On termination, instruct the participant to rest for 5 min. Continue recording and measuring throughout the three phases.\nTake the mask off the participant following the 5 min rest phase.\nAsk the participant immediately which of the two deep breathing techniques was more comfortable. Record the participant’s response on a spreadsheet.\nRemove the electrodes, leads and transmitter from the participant and let her leave.\nPerform only one three-phase trial for each participant.\n3. Measurement of the Ventilatory Parameters\nSample the breath-by-breath expired gas using a gas analyzer (see Table of Materials and Figure 2).",
    "Measure the following ventilatory parameters: oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), expired minute ventilation (VE), respiratory rate (f), tidal volume (VT), expiratory time (Te), and inspiratory time (Ti).\nMeasure the heart rate using a medical telemetry sensor for the electrocardiograph (see Table of Materials and Figure 2), which is connected to the gas analyzer.\n\t\tNOTE: The gas analyzer is operated using computer software provided by the manufacturer (Table of Materials).\nCollect the data for each 5 min phase of rest and deep breathing for NB and DB patterns. Save the data on the ventilatory parameters in CSV format using computer software (see Table of Materials and Figure 3,4).\n\t\nCollect mean data for each 5 min phase of this protocol. Average data for the optionally set phase is obtained on a breath-by-breath basis.\nEnter the data for each participant into the spreadsheet program (see Table of Materials and Figure 5) and determine the mean and standard deviation (SD) for the initial rest and deep breathing phases for NB and DB.\n4. Assessment of the Breathing Pattern\nRecord thoracoabdominal movement from a lateral view of the participant using a video camera (Table of Materials).\nMake sure that the background color is in sharp contrast to the participant’s silhouette.\nRecord the video image at 1/30 s per frame, which is the standard speed for the video camera used.\nUpload the motion-images into a personal computer using video editing software 1 (Table of Materials).\nObserve 5 min video images of the deep breathing phases at double speed under visual assessment and classify the breathing patterns as upper costal, diaphragmatic or thoracoabdominal. Use video editing software 2 (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Video images are analyzed by a cardiopulmonary physical therapist (MY).\n5. Participants’ preferred pattern for deep breathing",
    "Prepare a spreadsheet for the participant's response.\nAsk the participant which of the two deep breathing techniques is more comfortable following the measurement of the DB pattern.\nFill in the spreadsheet with the participant's response.\nBe ready to listen to the participant if she wants to talk about the procedure. Do not include the participant’s comments in the analysis.\n6. Statistical Analysis\nNOTE: Perform statistical analysis using commercial computer software (Table of Materials), and then provide all the button clicks.\nVentilatory parameters\n\t\nDo not analyze the 5 min rest phase following the two deep breathing phases in this protocol.\nDetermine the mean and SD for the initial rest phases and deep breathing phases for each parameter.\nEmploy two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (2-way ANOVA) to evaluate the ventilatory parameters and heart rate for the initial rest phases and two deep breathing phases.\n\t\tNOTE: Factor \"instruction\" includes two levels NB and DB, and factor \"phase\" has two levels rest phase and deep breathing phase.\nUsing the Bonferroni method, evaluate between each factor for parameter measurement, yielding significant interaction following 2-way ANOVA.\nClassification of breathing patterns exhibited by the participants including their preferred pattern for deep breathing.\n\t\nCategorize the number of participants according to their breathing pattern in upper costal, diaphragmatic or thoracoabdominal breathing.\nCompile from the spreadsheet the number of participants according to their preferred pattern of deep breathing.\nSubscription Required.
