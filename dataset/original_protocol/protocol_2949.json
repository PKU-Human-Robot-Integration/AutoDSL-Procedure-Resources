For representative purposes, we have utilized the human ovarian cancer cell line BG1 previously described to express sufficient amounts of E-cadherin.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] We describe the required cell culture conditions, cell line transfection using appropriate controls, and evaluation of knock-in cells using either fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or flow cytometry for EGFP+ cell sorting or analysis, respectively. A schematic flowchart for the knock-in procedure is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2692-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. A schematic flowchart highlighting the key steps from cell culture to flow cytometry\nSeeding of the BG1 ovarian cancer cell line.\nGrow the cells in a T75 culture flask using RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin.\nAfter reaching 80% confluence, harvest the cells using 1× Trypsin-EDTA (10× Trypsin-EDTA diluted 1:10 with PBS).\nCount the cells using either an automated cell counter or manual Neubauer counting chamber and prepare a cell suspension of 1 million cells per mL.\nSeed the cells at a density of 150′000 cells per well into a 12-well plate.\nPrepare a 12-well plate by adding 1 mL of culture media containing 150′000 cells per well.\nGently homogeneously distribute the cells in each well by manual horizontal shaking.\nOne day after cell seeding, prepare the plasmid combinations and perform the transfection.\nPrepare the plasmid pools and appropriate controls in 1.5 mL tubes as suggested in Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2692_18.csv\nTransient transfection of cancer cells.\nExchange the culture medium of the cells at least 1–3 h before transfection using 1 mL of culture medium.",
    "Add 100 μL of serum-free RPMI to each plasmid pool and vortex gently.\nPre-warm the ViaFect reagent to 20°C–22°C and mix by inverting it.\nAdd 4 μL of ViaFect to each plasmid pool, vortex gently, and spin down briefly.\nIncubate the reactions at 20°C–22°C for 20 min.\nAdd the reactions dropwise to the cells in the 12-well plate.\nSlightly rock the plate to distribute the DNA-ViaFect, then incubate the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 until the next day (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nCritical: Be sure to use an early passage of your cell line of interest as the entire process of the knock-in generation will include multiple passaging steps.\nA high concentration of plasmids is of benefit but for the transfection, they should be diluted allowing to pipet at least 1 μL to increase accuracy.\nIt is important to add appropriate controls to the transfection setup in order to know the overall efficiency of the transfection reagent in combination with the cell line of interest (e.g., pmaxGFP or pEGFP-N1) as well as the successful cleavage by the Cas9 (by comparing to the mutant hCas9_D10A) and, finally, to assess the signal generated by double-cut EGFP only alone. A non-transfected control should also be included.\nThe plasmid amounts provided in the table above are specifically for a 12-well format. Consequently, the amounts must be adapted if the format is changed but we suggest keeping the ratio of the plasmids.\nMajor step two: Flow cytometry analysis and FACS enrichment of EGFP+ cells\nTiming: 4–7 weeks (for steps 3 to 5)",
    "After transfection, incubate the cells for 48 h or until they reach ∼80% confluency and perform analysis by flow cytometry in order to determine the percentage of EGFP+ cells together with the transfection efficiency (control plasmid). The percentage of the knock-in population might be very low at this stage. After keeping them in culture for up to two weeks, enrich the transfected cells for the EGFP+ population by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Keep the EGFP+ cells under appropriate culture conditions until a sufficient cell number is reached for re-analysis. In order to achieve >80% EGFP+ cells, at least 2 to 3 FACS sorts are necessary. The procedure is explained in detail below.\nPreparing cells for flow cytometry analysis.\nCritical: This should be done earliest 48 hours after transfection or when the cells reach ∼80% confluence. This initial analysis is crucial to determine the transfection efficiency, i.e. the percentage of EGFP+ cells in the ‘transfection efficiency’ control.\nRemove the culture medium and wash the cells by adding 300 μL of 1× PBS per well.\nRemove the PBS and add 300 μL of 1× Trypsin-EDTA.\nIncubate cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 until they completely detach from the plate (up to 15 min in the case of BG1).\nAdd 600 μL of culture medium to stop the Trypsin reaction.\nGently pipet the cells up and down to detach all remaining cells and to dissolve clumps.\nPlace 300 μL of the suspensions into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (for flow cytometry analysis) and plate the remaining 600 μL into a new 6-well plate.",
    "Note: The aim is to expand the knock-in cells (not the controls) at least to a T25 or a T75 flask for FACS (described in the next step). The controls can be kept for additional 2–3 passages and re-analyzed by flow cytometry at each passage to determine whether the GFP signal is decreasing.\nCentrifuge the Eppendorf tubes for flow cytometry analysis at 400 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C and resuspend in 120 μL of flow cytometry buffer (1× PBS containing 1% of FBS).\nTransfer the cell suspensions to a 96-well plate and proceed to flow cytometry analysis, in our case by CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter, USA) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2692-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Expected outcome after integration of the EGFP reporter at the C-terminal E-cadherin encoding genomic locus\n(A) Flow cytometry 48 h after transfection, red box highlights the knock-in sample. Note: There might be some differences in gating cell populations as we used different CytoFLEX flow cytometers throughout the entire experiment.\n(B) Representative flow cytometry of cancer cells 6 days after transfection and after 1 and 3 rounds of FACS enrichment, red box highlights the knock-in sample.\n(C) Genotyping PCR showing successful integration of EGFP: The expected band at 954 bp indicates the wildtype whereas the additional band at 1712 bp (only visible in the knock-in sample) indicates successful knock-in. In silico analysis for second and third PCR should reveal only one band in the knock-in sample, CDH1_PCR_F1/EGFP_N_R 572 bp and EGFP_C_F/CDH1_PCR_R1 554 bp.\n(D) Representative Western blot for wildtype and knock-in cells harboring the EGFP-encoding DNA sequence indicated by the red arrow.\n(E) Confocal live cell imaging showing endogenous E-cadherin preferentially localized at the cell membrane.",
    "(F) Immunofluorescence of knock-in cells stained with antibody to E-cadherin shows colocalization of the EGFP and E-cadherin, DAPI nuclear staining, antibody to E-cadherin, and EGFP.\nPreparing cells for FACS.\nNote: The cells should have reached 80% confluence of a T25 or a T75 flask. The following protocol considers a T75 flask.\nRemove the culture medium and wash the cells by adding 3 mL of 1× PBS.\nRemove the PBS and add 3 mL of 1× Trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 until completely detached from the flask.\nAdd 6 mL of culture medium to stop the Trypsin reaction, gently rinse the flask by pipetting and transfer the cells to a 15 mL tube.\nRemove 0.5 mL of the suspension and plate it in a T25 flask to keep a backup of the cells in case problems occur during or after the sorting. Centrifuge the remaining cells at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C, and remove the supernatant.\nOptional: DAPI staining for live/dead distinction during FACS: Resuspend the cells in 200 μL of DAPI solution (DAPI diluted 1:5000 in flow cytometry buffer) and incubate for 5 min at 20°C–22°C in the dark. Centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C, remove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of flow cytometry buffer. Repeat this washing step twice more. Remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of flow cytometry buffer and pass through a FACS tube with a cell strainer cap (70 μm).\nPrepare a second tube containing culture media which will be used to collect the sorted cells.\nNote: The collection tube size should be adapted to the number of cells expected to be positive.\nProceed to the sorting.",
    "Centrifuge the sorted cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C, remove the supernatant very carefully and leave ∼300–500 μL of liquid in the tube.\nResuspend the cells and plate them into a well.\nAdd an appropriate volume of fresh culture medium on top (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nNote: The well size should correspond to the number of collected cells, e.g. around 1000 cells can be plated in a 48- or 24-well plate depending on the doubling time of the cell line (in our case, BG1 is a fast-growing cell line).\nFurther procedure:\nExchange the medium one day after sorting.\nExpand the cell culture until reaching a sufficient number of cells (25cm2 culture flask with ∼3 × 106 live cells) for flow cytometry analysis to determine the EGFP+ enriched population and repeat step 3 (Preparing cells for flow cytometry analysis) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nRepeat step 4 (Preparing cells for FACS) if another enrichment is necessary. These enrichment cycles should be repeated until the desired percentage of EGFP+ cells is reached (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nAs soon as the cells have been sufficiently enriched, expand them and either proceed to your individual experiments or freeze them using freezing medium (FBS containing 10% DMSO, filtered 0.2 μm).\nPause point: Cells can be frozen at this point and are stable at −80°C for up to 12 months or several years when stored in liquid nitrogen.\nCritical: It is crucial to choose an appropriate well size to plate the cells after sorting. The cells will not grow well or take more time to reach full confluence if the chosen well size is too large. The doubling time of the cell line should also be considered.\nMajor step three: Validation of the CDH1 knock-in cells by PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence",
    "Timing: 1 week (this is flexible as not everything has to be performed at the same time) (for steps 6 to 8)\nThe successful integration of the EGFP-encoding DNA sequence at the C-terminus of E-cadherin must be further validated, in addition to the confirmation by flow cytometry analysis. Here, we address genomic DNA and the expression of the tagged protein.\nGenomic DNA isolation and genotyping PCR:\nHarvest the EGFP+ enriched cell line using 1× Trypsin-EDTA as usual and take ∼106 cells in a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove the medium and resuspend in 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C and remove the supernatant.\nPause point: The cell pellet can be stored at -20°C until further processed.\nPerform genomic DNA isolation with the DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (LINK[href=https://www.qiagen.com/ch/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit?catno=69504]).\nNote: Concerning the elution, 25–50 μL of the provided elution buffer is usually sufficient depending on the number of cells.\nMeasure the concentration and quality of the extracted genomic DNA by Nanodrop.\nNote: Concentrations above 200 ng/μL, A260/280–1.8 and A260/230 2.0–2.2 can be considered pure and of good quality.\nDilute the genomic DNA to 100 ng/μL.",
    "Prepare the PCR reaction master mix following Table 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl9] below. Please note that the volumes given are for one reaction. These should be multiplied by the total amount of reactions needed. In our case, we prepared the master mix for four reactions (BG1 wildtype, BG1 CDH1-EGFP knock-in, water control, and one additional reaction to compensate for pipetting errors). In addition, three independent master mixes should be prepared, one for each primer pair: CDH1_PCR_F1 / CDH1_PCR_R1, CDH1_PCR_F1 / EGFP-N_R, EGFP-C_F / CDH1_PCR_R1. Prepare the master mix in 1.5 mL tubes without adding the DNA. Pipet 9 μL of the master mix into four PCR tubes and add the respective DNA or ddH2O to each tube. Mix the tubes gently and spin them down briefly.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2692_19.csv\nPlace the PCR tubes into the thermocycler and apply the following programme (Table 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl10]):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2692_20.csv\nIn the meantime, prepare a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel.\nWhen the PCR reaction is finished, add 2 μL of 6× Loading dye to each sample, mix and spin down briefly.\nLoad everything onto the agarose gel and let it run at 120 V for ∼20–30 min or until a sufficient separation has been achieved.\nTake an image of the gel using a gel doc system (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nCritical: It is important to start the genomic DNA extraction with a sufficient number of cells in order to obtain high-quality DNA with a sufficient yield.\nIt is also important to adapt the PCR master mix if you are using a different polymerase and to change the PCR conditions and percentage of agarose gel depending on the expected size of your amplicon. If the wildtype and knock-in bands only show a small difference in size, you should also increase the time of gel electrophoresis for better separation.",
    "Preparation of protein lysates for Western blot analysis.\nPreparation of protein lysates:\nCulture the cells in a petri dish (10 cm diameter) until reaching 80%–90% confluence.\nRemove the culture medium and wash the cells with 5 mL of cold 1× PBS.\nCompletely remove the PBS and add 350 μL of 1× RIPA (dilute 10× RIPA with ddH2O) containing 1:100 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, i.e., 3.5 μL.\nImmediately place the dish on ice and incubate for 5 min.\nHarvest the cells with a cell scraper and transfer the cell suspension into a 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate on ice for 20 min.\nCentrifuge full speed at 4°C for 20 min.\nTransfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: From now on, always keep the protein lysates on ice.\nPause point: The protein lysates can be stored at -80°C for long-term storage. Thaw on ice for further usage.\nMeasure the protein concentration with Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (LINK[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23227?SID=srch-srp-23227]).\nDilute the protein lysates to a concentration of 2 μg/μL using ddH2O and add 4× gel loading buffer (incl. DTT: add 100 μL of 2M DTT solution to 400 μL of 4× gel loading buffer).\nBoil at 95°C for 5 min to denature the proteins. From this point on, the samples can be handled at 20°C–22°C. The boiled lysates can be loaded onto an acrylamide gel or stored at −20°C.\nPause point: The boiled protein lysates can be stored at −20°C for long-term storage. After thawing, heat them up for 2 min at 60°C. They are now ready to use.\nPreparation of 10% acrylamide/bis gels for Western blot.\nNote: This should be done inside a chemical hood.\nClean the glass plates (Bio-Rad, thickness 1.5 mm) with ddH2O, then with 70% ethanol and assemble them according to the manufacturer.",
    "Prepare the resolving gel in a 50 mL tube combining the following reagents in the given order (consider 10 mL per gel) in Table 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl11]:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2692_21.csv\nNote: As soon as the TEMED has been added, pour the gel immediately as the polymerization will begin.\nPour the gel between the assembled glass plates leaving enough space for the stacking gel (∼1.5 cm from the top).\nAdd a layer of isopropanol or ddH2O on top and leave the gel to solidify for ∼45 min.\nPrepare the stacking gel in a 50 mL tube combining the following reagents in the given order (consider 3 mL per gel) in Table 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl12]:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2692_22.csv\nNote: As soon as the TEMED has been added, pour the gel immediately as the polymerization will begin.\nPour off the layer of isopropanol or ddH2O and pour the stacking gel by filling the glass plates completely to the top.\nImmediately add the comb (in our case with 10 wells) which must be suitable for 1.5 mm glass plates.\nLeave the gel to solidify for ∼15 min.\nPause point: The gels can now be wrapped in moist tissue paper and kept in a sealed plastic bag at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nAssembly and SDS-PAGE.\nPrepare 1× Running Buffer: Dilute 10× Running Buffer by adding 100 mL–900 mL of ddH2O.\nRemove the glass plates with the gels from the Bio-Rad system, remove the combs carefully and rinse the glass plates and the wells with ddH2O.\nAssemble the glass plates with the gels inside the electrophoresis apparatus and fill up the middle with 1× Running Buffer until reaching the top of the glass plates. Fill up the outside of the glass plates as far as indicated on the chamber.",
    "Load 5 μL of the ladder and the desired amount of the protein lysates into the wells.\nClose the electrophoresis apparatus and apply 90 V until the samples reach the resolving gel, then increase to 120 V until a good separation is achieved. This can be verified by following the separation of the ladder.\nNote: At some point, the smallest proteins will leak out of the bottom of the gel and be lost, so stop it in time.\nTransfer onto PVDF membrane.\nPrepare 1× Transfer buffer as described in the following table and place it at 4°C. It can be reused up to 3 times.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2692_23.csv\nSoak a PVDF membrane in methanol inside a glass petri dish for 30 s, then transfer it to ddH2O.\nSoak sponges and Whatman paper in a container with 1× Transfer buffer.\nRemove the glass plates from the electrophoresis apparatus, separate the plates and place the gel into the container with 1× Transfer buffer.\nAssemble the sandwich consisting of a sponge, Whatman paper, gel, PVDF membrane, Whatman paper, and sponge and place it inside the transfer apparatus.\nFill the chamber with 1× Transfer buffer and add a container with ice.\nApply 75 V for 1.5 h in total. Exchange the ice cuvette after 45 min.\nNote: The transfer time might have to be adapted depending on the protein size. For large proteins, it might be necessary to exchange the ice again and add e.g. 30 min of transfer time.\nAlternatives: Nitrocellulose can also be used instead of PVDF membranes.\nBlocking:\nPrepare 1× TBST: Dilute 50 mL of 10× TBS in 450 mL ddH2O and add 500 μL of Tween 20.",
    "Prepare 1× TBST with 3% BSA, e.g., weigh 1.5 g and dissolve in 50 mL of 1× TBST by placing it on a roller shaker at 20°C–22°C.\nPlace the PVDF membrane in a small container with 20 mL of 1× TBST with 3% BSA.\nKeep it at 20°C–22°C for at least 30 min with gentle agitation.\nPrimary antibodies.\nPrepare the primary antibody solutions in 50 mL tubes by taking 5 mL of 1× TBST with 3% BSA and adding the desired primary antibody following the manufacturer’s recommended dilution for Western blot.\nPrepare a clean surface and place the PVDF membrane on top.\nCut it at the desired size (use the ladder bands to know where to cut).\nPlace the membrane pieces in the corresponding primary antibody containing 50 mL tubes.\nIncubate at 4°C for 16 h overnight on a roller shaker.\nRemove the membrane pieces from the tubes and place them in individual boxes.\nNote: The tubes containing the primary antibody solution can be frozen at −20°C and reused several times.\nAdd 5 mL of 1× TBST to each membrane piece and incubate for 10 min with gentle agitation at 20°C–22°C. Then discard the solution.

    "Place the membrane on a clean surface, e.g., a piece of plastic foil which has been cleaned with 70% ethanol and drain excess liquid with a tissue (avoid touching the surface of the membrane with the tissue).\nMix equal amounts of SuperSignal™ West Dura Luminol/Enhancer and SuperSignal™ West Dura Stable Peroxide from the kit SuperSignal™ West Dura Extended Duration Substrate and distribute dropwise onto the membrane until the whole surface is covered.\nPerform the measurement at a gel doc, in our case a Vilber Fusion FX, according to the manufacturer and save a digital image of the membrane (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nNote: The exposure time depends on the expression/abundance of the protein of interest and must be optimized.\nImmunofluorescence imaging.\nCell culture.\nCulture the cells until reaching 80% confluence.\nNote: Independent of the confluency, knock-in cells can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy anytime using brightfield and EGFP channel (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E). In order to increase the quality of fluorescence imaging, we recommend culturing cells on microscopy-compatible culture dishes (e.g. Sarstedt, #94.6170.802).\nHarvest the cells using 1× Trypsin-EDTA as usual and count the cells using either an automated cell counter or manual Neubauer counting chamber.\nAdd 20′000–50′000 cells in 500 μL of culture medium into each well of an 8-well glass chamber slide (detachable, Sarstedt, #94.6170.802).\nPipet up and down to distribute the cells homogeneously.\nCulture the slide inside a petri dish (10 cm diameter; containing a wet tissue to avoid evaporation of the medium) for 2 days at 37°C and 5% CO2 or until the cells reach 80% confluence.\nNote: The desired confluence depends on the protein of interest which shall be visualized. A too-high or too-small density might influence the protein expression.\nFixation, permeabilization, and blocking.\nCarefully remove the culture medium and wash once by adding 300 μL of 1× PBS.",
    "Note: All the pipetting steps must be done very carefully as the cells might otherwise be detached quite easily from the slide.\nFix the cells by adding 150 μL of 4% formalin solution carefully to the cells and incubate for 10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nNote: Handling 4% formalin solution should always be done using a chemical hood. This includes the following washing steps until being sure that all remaining formalin is removed.\nCarefully remove the formalin solution and add 500 μL of 1× PBS to wash. Repeat this washing step twice more.\nPause point: At this step, the slide can be kept at 4°C for up to 2 weeks but the cells must be covered well with PBS to avoid drying out.\nPermeabilize the cells by adding the permeabilization buffer and incubate for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Avoid a longer incubation time.\nRemove the permeabilization buffer and wash once with 500 μL of 1× PBS.\nRemove the 1× PBS and add 200 μL of blocking buffer.\nIncubate at least for 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nOptional: The blocking can also be done overnight at 4°C.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution by adding the primary antibody to the antibody dilution buffer in an appropriate dilution for immunofluorescence suggested by the manufacturer.\nRemove the blocking buffer and add 250 μL of the primary antibody solution and incubate 16 h overnight at 4°C.\nStaining and mounting.\nRemove the primary antibody solution and add 500 μL of washing buffer.
