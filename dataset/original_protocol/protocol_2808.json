S1pr5 expression is associated with recirculation and mature NK cells, and thus S1pr5FM+ cells are currently or are derived from circulating NK cells. Granzyme C expression is associated with tissue-resident ILC1 cells, and thus GzmcFM+ cells are currently or are derived from resident ILC1s. Given the leakiness of S1pr5eGFP-iCre in some mice during development upstream of hematopoiesis, an additional step generating bone marrow chimeras via transfer of non-fate mapped Lineage-Sca1+cKit+ (LSK) cells, which include the hematopoietic stem cells, is required, whereas GzmcFM mice can be analyzed directly.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2507-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Experimental outlines and schematics\n(A) General steps involved in the generation and analysis of fate-mapped mice.\n(B) General steps involved in the ILCp transfer and analysis experiment.\n(C) General steps involved in the ex vivo killing assay experiment.\nGenerate S1pr5FM bone marrow chimeras. First, select S1pr5FM mice with minimal leaky FM expression in peripheral blood to use as bone marrow donors.\nNote: It can be difficult to predict the required ratio of donor to recipient mice given that the range of stochastic S1pr5FM expression in the LSK compartment can range from 0% to 99% depending on the donor mouse. Thus, checking the peripheral blood can be a good way to ensure use of donor mice with as little non-specific fate mapping as possible, as the percentage of YFP expression by blood cells roughly correlates with rate of stochastic Cre expression/fate mapping in bone marrow LSKs.",
    "Collect blood (less than 50 μL) via tail vein nick of potential bone marrow donor mice (S1pr5FM mice).\nWarm mouse by putting under heat lamp for 5 min.\nPlace mouse in restrainer and wipe tail with alcohol wipe.\nCreate small nick on tail vein at distal end of tail with a disposable scalpel.\nCollect blood with a heparinized capillary tube.\nPlace capillary tube with blood into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube pre-filled with 5 μL 0.1 M EDTA to prevent clotting.\nWrap mouse tail with paper towel and apply pressure at point of nick to stop bleeding before returning mouse to cage.\nFlush blood from capillary tube by pipetting ∼800 μL red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer into top of capillary tube, collecting it into Eppendorf tube below.\nLet sit for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nTransfer to 15 mL conical tube, add 5 mL chilled PBS, and spin down tube for 6 min at 550 rcf and 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μL FACS buffer.\nTransfer sample through piece of nylon mesh material into 1.2 mL polypropylene microtiter tube.\nRun sample on LSR-II with FSC, SSC, FITC and PE channels recording.\nAnalyze data using FlowJo software, gating on cells based on morphology, and measuring YFP expression (S1pr5FM) which should be expressed in both the FITC and PE channels.\nNote: Accurate S1pr5 fate-mapping should be expressed only in patrolling monocytes and NK cells in the blood, which should be below 10% of cells. Choose donor mice with the lowest level of non-specific fate mapping in the blood to ensure highest number of FM-negative LSKs during sort.\nLethally irradiate (900 rad) recipient CD45.1+ C57BL/6 mice 12–24 h before cell transfer.\nIsolate bone marrow from femur and tibia of S1pr5FM (CD45.2+) donor mice.",

The sorter needs to have been properly calibrated for the experiment, with appropriate compensation controls run. After compensation, it can be helpful to record a small part of the sample to use to draw gates before collecting cells. If the gating is not precise and some fate-mapped LSKs are inadvertently included, this can lead to incorrect interpretation of the fate-mapping experiment.\nTransfer at least 5,000 sorted non-fate-mapped LSKs per recipient mouse.\nResuspend sorted sample in 100 μL sterile PBS per 5,000 cells.\nInject 100 μL intraveneously, via either tail vein or retroorbital injection, into irradiated recipient mice.\nMaintain recipient mice on chow supplemented with the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (sulfatrim diet) for at least two weeks post-irradiation as their immune system reconstitutes.\nAge mice for 4-6 weeks to allow immune system to reconstitute before analysis.\nAnalyze cellular phenotype of S1pr5FM chimeras and GzmcFM mice.
