Delivery of these reagents occurs by two main routes: electroporation or microinjection of pronuclear stage zygotes. Before delivery can occur, the CRISPR-Cas9 reagents must be prepared and combined into a mix. While similar, mixes for electroporation and microinjection differ in the amounts of each reagent to be delivered, as shown in the tables below. Microinjection mixes with Cas9 mRNA transcript can be aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_4.csv\nTo assist with molar to mass conversion, please visit NEBioCalculator® version 1.15.0 at https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/[href=https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_7.csv\nElectroporation and/or microinjection of pronuclear stage zygotes are usually performed by transgenic core facilities. For detailed procedures on electroporation or microinjection, please refer to the following publications: Efficient mouse genome engineering by CRISPR-EZ technology6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and Manipulating the Mouse Embryo; A Laboratory Manual, Fourth Edition.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] For the generation of Scyl1AIv4 mice, microinjection was used. Additional models are being generated using both microinjection and electroporation with similar results.\nPCR optimization\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the procedure to optimize PCR reactions for the characterization of potential founders. For all genotyping procedures, Qiagen Taq Polymerase (Qiagen, 201205) is used. Control genomic DNA can be obtained from a wild-type mouse tail biopsy. Tail biopsies are prepared as follows:\nPrepare Tail Lysis Buffer, as shown in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nExtract genomic DNA by adding 300 μL of Tail Lysis Buffer to the biopsy and incubating at 55°C for 4–16 h.\nThe next day, incubate the digested biopsies at 95°C for 10 min to heat inactivate the Proteinase K.",
    "To optimize PCR genotyping conditions, the optimal annealing temperature of a primer pair can be determined by testing identical reactions across a range of annealing temperatures and two concentrations of MgCl2. This procedure can be performed prior to obtaining potential founders so that when mice are obtained, genotyping can be performed quickly.\nFor a given pair of primers, prepare, on ice, separate PCR mixes with low and high MgCl2 concentrations, as detailed below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_8.csv\nDistribute 50 μL of master mix per reaction in 8 wells of a 96 well plate so that each well corresponds to a different annealing temperature.\nUse the cycling conditions displayed in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_9.csv\nLoad 10 μL of PCR product on a 1%–2% agarose gel at 120 V for approximately 40 min in 1× TAE Buffer.\nImage gel and save picture for your records.\nSelect the best amplification condition.\nOn-target PCR genotyping\nTiming: 1 week\nThis procedure describes the characterization, at the genomic level, of potential founders. To analyze on-target gene editing, the guide target region is PCR amplified and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and direct Sanger sequencing. Founders with potential insertion of the AIv4 cassette are further analyzed by TOPO® TA cloning® and Sanger sequencing (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2476-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The splice donor site is indicated in green. loxP sites are shown in black. The branch point is shown in blue. The bipartite polypyrimidine tract is shown in yellow. The splice acceptor site is shown in red.\nAfter receiving biopsies, extract genomic DNA by adding 300 μL of Tail Lysis Buffer to each sample and incubating at 55°C for 4–16 h.\nThe next day, incubate the digested biopsies at 95°C for 10 min to heat inactivate the Proteinase K.\nFor each biopsy, set up PCR reactions on ice using previously established PCR conditions. The table below describes how to make the PCR mix with optional MgCl2. Also include:\nA positive control (wild-type mouse genomic DNA).\nA negative control (no DNA).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_10.csv\nUse the cycling conditions, as illustrated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_11.csv\nFollowing amplification, put aside:\n10 μL to run on a 2% agarose gel.\n15 μL for TOPO® TA cloning® and Sanger sequencing.\n25 μL for sample preparation using ExoSAP-IT PCR Product Cleanup Reagent (Affymetrix, 78200) and direct Sanger sequencing.\nTOPO® TA cloning®\nTiming: 1 week",
    "To the 15 μL PCR product set aside for TOPO® TA cloning® in step 13.b, add 1 μL Taq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, 201205) and 1 μL dNTP Mix (Qiagen, 201901).\nIncubate at 72°C for 10 min.\nUsing the TOPO® TA Cloning® Kit for Subcloning (Invitrogen, K450001), set up the TOPO® TA cloning® reaction(s) at room temperature, as described in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_12.csv\nGently mix the reaction and allow to sit at room temperature for 1 h.\nTransform DH5α competent E. coli (New England Biolabs, C2987H), according to the TOPO® TA cloning® kit user guide using blue/white selection (https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/topota_man.pdf[href=https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/topota_man.pdf]).\nPick 30 white colonies per plate and culture them overnight in LB medium containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin.\nIsolate plasmid DNA using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, 27106X4) (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=22df6325-9579-4aa0-819c-788f73d81a09&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=22df6325-9579-4aa0-819c-788f73d81a09&lang=en]).\nDigest 5 μL of each plasmid using EcoRI (New England Biolabs, R3101L).\nRun digested plasmids on a 2% agarose gel at 120 V for 1 h.\nPCR fragments of various sizes should be observed. The larger fragment will likely contain the AIv4 cassette, whereas shorter fragments will likely be wild type or contain indels.An example of digested plasmids containing various fragment sizes is presented in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nPlasmids containing PCR products with the larger fragment (corresponding to the AIv4 cassette) should be sequenced using the M13R and T7 primers, following the protocol in the “sanger sequencing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]” section of this manuscript.\nSanger sequencing\nTiming: 1 week\nDirect sequencing of post-PCR products and sequencing of TOPO® TA cloning® plasmids are both important for the characterization of mouse models generated using the DECAI approach. The former allows for the detection of editing events and to determine the rate of editing in potential founder animals. The latter is used to confirm the proper arrangement of the allele (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "For direct sequencing of post-PCR products, set up ExoSAP-IT PCR Product Cleanup (Affymetrix, 78200) reactions as follows:\nCombine 25 μL of a PCR product with 1 μL of ExoSAP-IT reagent (Affymetrix, 78200) in a well of a 96-well plate or 200 μL microfuge tube.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min to degrade remaining primers and nucleotides, then at 80°C for 15 min to inactivate ExoSAP-IT reagent.\nSet up sequencing reactions using the BigDye™ Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosciences, 4337456) in a 96-well plate, as demonstrated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_13.csv\nSpin down the 96-well plate to ensure all reagents are at the bottom of the well.\nTransfer the 96-well plate to a thermal cycler for cycle sequencing, using the conditions below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_14.csv\nWhen cycle sequencing has finished, centrifuge the 96-well plate at 1,000 × g for 1 min.\nPremix the BigDye XTerminator™ Solution and SAM™ Solution (Applied Biosystems, 4376493), as shown below:\nMake sure the BigDye Xterminator™ Solution (Applied Biosystems, 4376493) is homogenous before pipetting.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2476_15.csv\nDispense 55 μL of the premixed solution per well of a MicroAmp® Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate (Applied Biosystems, 4306737).\nTransfer the total volume (10 μL) of each cycle sequencing reaction from the 96-well plate into the MicroAmp® Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate (Applied Biosystems, 4306737) with the premixed XTerminator solution.\nSeal the MicroAmp® Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate (Applied Biosystems, 4306737) with clear adhesive film and vortex the plate for 30 min.\nWhen the plate has finished shaking, centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 2 min.\nWithout disturbing the pellet, carefully remove the adhesive film and replace it with a SeqStudio™ Septa 96-Well (Applied Biosystems, A35641) on the plate. Immediately transfer the MicroAmp® Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate (Applied Biosystems, 4306737) to the SeqStudio™ Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, A35644) and begin the capillary electrophoresis run.",
    "Analyze sequencing data using SnapGene.\nOff-target PCR genotyping\nTiming: 1 week\nOne downside of using CRISPR-Cas9 technology for genome editing is the potential to introduce mutations at off-target locations. However, the use of a hit-and-run strategy, as described here, where Cas9 mRNA transcript or Cas9 proteins are used, rarely results in the introduction of off-target mutations. Nevertheless, it is recommended to analyze a few potential off-target sites for genetic alterations.\nOff-target analysis should be performed on genomic DNA from each potential founder. For each potential off-target, setup PCR reactions and direct sequencing using specific off-target primer pairs, as described in the “On-target PCR genotyping” and “sanger sequencing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]” sections.\nAnimal breeding\nTiming: 1 year\nAfter characterization of founder animals, mice bearing the AIv4 cassette must be outbred to wild-type mice for at least two subsequent generations. From this generation, heterozygous mice can be crossed together to produce mice homozygous for the artificial intron (Scyl1AIv4/AIv4) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). These mice are then bred to B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J mice to produce mice that are CMV-Cre+ and heterozygous for the recombined allele (CMV-Cre+;Scyl1+/AIv4Δ). Finally, mice homozygous for the recombined allele are produced from a cross between CMV-Cre+;Scyl1+/AIv4Δ and Scyl1AIv4/AIv4 mice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2476-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Founder animals must be characterized at the genomic level using PCR amplification, TOPO® TA cloning® and Sanger sequencing. F1 and F2 mice must be characterized at the genomic level using PCR amplification, TOPO® TA cloning® and Sanger sequencing to confirm germline transmission of the proper allele. F3 mice must be genotype at the genomic and protein level using PCR amplification, direct Sanger sequencing and western blotting. F4 mice must be characterized at the genomic level using PCR amplification and direct Sanger sequencing. The Scyl1AIv4 allele should also be characterized by TOPO® TA Cloning® and Sanger sequencing.

S1E154D-F1 (red) and S1E154D-R1 (yellow) were used for genotyping F0, F1, and F2 mice. Using this primer pair, amplicons of 667 bp, 868 bp, and 721 bp are obtained for wild-type, Scyl1AIv4, and Scyl1AIv4Δ alleles, respectively. For routine genotyping, a second primer pair, Scyl1_AIv4_F51 (blue) and Scyl1_AIv4_R52 (green), were designed to more easily distinguish the wild-type allele from the Scyl1AIv4Δ allele. Using this second set of primers, amplicons of 304 bp, 505 bp, and 358 bp are obtained for wild-type, Scyl1AIv4, and Scyl1AIv4Δ alleles, respectively.\n(B) PCR genotyping of Scyl1+/+, Scyl1+/AIv4, F1 or F2 animals obtained from F0 or F1 outbreeds to wild-type C57BL/6J mice.

This is further confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n(D) PCR genotyping of potential off-target cleavage sites in F1 animals. Three potential off-target sites were identified, as described in the “guide sequence selection[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]” section of this manuscript. Primer pairs were designed to amplify each site: Scyl1_AIv4_OT1-F1 and Scyl1_AIv4_OT1-R2 generate a 504 bp fragment corresponding to off-target site 1, Scyl1_AIv4_OT2-F1 and Scyl1_AIv4_OT2-R2 generate a 563 bp fragment corresponding to off-target site 2, and Scyl1_AIv4_OT3-F1 and Scyl1_AIv4_OT3-R2 generate a 474 bp fragment corresponding to off-target site 3.

A ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm for a high-quality RNA preparation should be around 2.0.\nAssess the quality of the RNA using the Agilent TapeStation system (Agilent, G2992AA), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/G2964-90000_TapeStation_USR_ENU.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/G2964-90000_TapeStation_USR_ENU.pdf]).\nUsing the ProtoScript® II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, E6560L) with the d(T)23 VN primer, produce cDNA from 100 ng of total RNA, as described by the manufacturer (https://www.neb.com/protocols/2013/01/23/first-strand-cdna-synthesis-protocols-e6560[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2013/01/23/first-strand-cdna-synthesis-protocols-e6560]).\nMeasure Scyl1 transcript expression using TaqMan 2× Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, 4444557) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assay Probe Mm00452459_m1(FAM). Normalize against Gapdh expression using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay Probe Mm99999915_g1 (FAM).\nQuantify the relative expression of Scyl1 using the ΔΔCt method.\nGraph the values obtained in the previous step for each genotype.\nAlternative splicing analysis\nTiming: 1 week\nWhen engineering genetic modifications, there is a chance that the newly engineered allele behaves unexpectedly. This is particularly true for conditional alleles where the location of loxP sites within introns, promoters, or 3′ untranslated regions, may affect expression or splicing events resulting in reduced expression of a gene or generation of aberrant transcripts. Similarly, generation of conditional alleles using reversible cassettes like COIN or CRIPSR-FLIP which expose a strong splice acceptor site followed by a STOP cassette upon Cre-mediated recombination, may also produce aberrant transcripts.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] To test whether abnormal transcripts are produced from the engineered Scyl1AIv4 and Scyl1AIv4Δ alleles, RNA transcripts can be analyzed by RT-PCR, TOPO® TA cloning®, and Sanger sequencing (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). The following section describes a step-by-step procedure for the identification and analysis of transcripts produced from the Scyl1AIv4 and Scyl1AIv4Δ alleles.",
    "For multiple exon genes, design a primer pair to amplify a cDNA fragment encompassing the targeted exon, the exon immediately upstream, and one or more exons downstream of the targeted exon. In the case of single exon genes, primers should be designed to amplify the entirety of the targeted exon, if possible. For Scyl1, the following primers were designed to amplify the region from exon 2 to exon 5.\nRT-Scyl1_F21: CGCAGTGTCCATCTTCGTGTA.\nRT-Scyl1_R51: CCCGGCAGTTCTGCAGGAA.\nExtract total RNA from the cerebellum of mice with control, AIv4, and AIv4Δ alleles using the RNeasy Maxi Kit (Qiagen, 75162) with the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, 79254), according to the manufacturer’s protocol (see step 31).\nQuantify and assess the quality of the RNA according to steps 32 and 33.\nSet up and run the RT-PCR reaction following the OneTaq One-Step RT-PCR Kit (New England Biolabs, E5315S) procedure using RT-Scyl1_F21 and RT-Scyl1_R51.\nLoad 10 μL of RT-PCR product on a 2% agarose gel at 120 V for approximately 90 min in 1× TAE Buffer.\nImage gel and save picture for your records.\nAnalyze the nature of the transcripts using TOPO® TA cloning® and Sanger sequencing, as described previously in this manuscript. Alternatively, this analysis could be performed using RNA sequencing."
