    "Heterologous expression and purification of phosphataseInoculate a single colony of E. coli cells containing the GST-vector, GST-SCP1-WT (wild type) or GST-SCP1-DN (dominant-negative) plasmid into 10 ml LB medium and grow overnight (ON) at 37 °C.Transfer 2 ml of ON culture to a 250 ml flask containing 48 ml of LB medium.Incubate at 37 °C in a shaker at 200 rpm until OD600 reaches to 0.5. Induce with IPTG at a final concentration of 1 mM for 4 h.Transfer the cell culture into a 50 ml tube. Spin down at room temperature for 5 min, 3,000 x g to collect cells. Discard supernatant, wash the cell pellet once with 1x PBS. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μl IP lysis buffer without phosSTOP and then put the 50 ml tube on ice for 30 min. Vortex for 15 sec every 10 min. Spin at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant into a new Eppendorf tube.Prepare a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione sepharose 4B in lysis buffer, and add 50 μl of slurry to the supernatant. Rotate for 1 h at 4 °C.Collect the beads by spinning at 1,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and wash the beads 3 times with 1x PBS. Store in 1 beads volume of PBS supplemented with 10% glycerol at 4 °C if not going on to the next step immediately.To elute GST protein from beads, add 1 bead volume of GST elution buffer, vortex for 10 min at 4 °C. Collect supernatant, repeat one more time, and combine the supernatants. Use BCA Protein Assay Kit to quantify the concentration of protein.Expression and purification of phosphorylated c-MycTransfect HKE293T cells (at a density of 1.",
    "5 x 106 in a 100 mm dish) with 5 µg of HA-c-Myc plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000. Harvest the cells in 1 ml of 1x PBS by using a cell scraper after a 36-48 h incubation.Collect the cell pellet by spinning at 1,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant, and lyse the cells in 500 µl lysis buffer on ice for 30 min.Collect the lysate by spinning at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, and then transfer the cell lysate into a new Eppendorf tube.Use 1 μg of c-Myc antibody to immunoprecipitate HA-c-Myc protein from 1 mg/500 μl HEK293T cell lysate. Gently rotate for 1 h at 4 °C.Wash protein A/G beads 3 times with IP lysis buffer. Add 30 μl (60 μl 50% slurry) to the cell lysate (step 2d) and rotate for 1 h at 4 °C.Collect the beads by spinning at 1,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Wash 3 times with 0.5 ml ice-cold IP lysis buffer.Store the beads in 1 bead volume of PBS supplemented with 10% glycerol on ice before use.Pick 5 µl solution and 1 µg BSA to run SDS-PAGE gel, and stain the gel with Coomassie blue, using 1 µg BSA as control, to determine HA-c-Myc immunocomplex concentration.Dephosphorylation assayAdd the 0.1 µg HA-c-Myc, with 0.5 μg of bacterially-expressed GST-vector, GST-SCP1-WT (wild-type) or GST-SCP1-DN (dominant-negative) in 50 μl phosphatase buffer.Incubate the mixture at 37 °C for 30 min. Add 1 bead volume of 2x SDS loading buffer into the mixture. Stop the phosphatase reaction by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Half of each sample is fractioned by SDS-PAGE and detect phosphatase on the gel by Coomassie blue staining (Simpson, 2010).",
    "The other half of each sample is used to detect the phosphorylation status of c-MYC at Ser62 by Western blotting using anti-pSer62 antibody.After phosphorylation detection, strip the membrane using 0.8 N NaOH for 30 sec. Detect total c-Myc protein substrate with anti-c-Myc antibody."
