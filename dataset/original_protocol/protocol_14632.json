    "The MRI images were provided by the Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences and the usage of these images was approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University institutional review board.\n1. Image-Based Nasal Airway Preparation\nAcquire magnetic resonance (MR) images of a healthy non-smoking 53-year-old male (weight 73 kg and height 173 cm) that consist of 72 coronal cross-sections spaced 1.5 mm apart spanning the nostrils to the nasopharynx4.\nOpen Imaging Program (e.g., MIMICS)\nTo import images, click \"File\", \"Import images\". Select the MR images and click \"Ok\".\nTo construct the 3-D model, click \"Segmentation\", then \"Threshold\" to set the grey scale range between -1020 and -500. Click \"Segmentation\", \"Calculate 3D\".\nClick \"Segmentation\" and \"Calculate polylines\". Select the 3-D body, and click \"Ok\" to generate the polylines that define the solid geometry. Export the polylines as an IGES file.\nOpen Model Development Software (e.g., Gambit)\nClick \"File\", \"Import\", \"IGES\" to import the IGES file into the program. Click \"Edge command button\" on the right panel; click \"Create Edge\" and select \"NURBS\" to reconstruct smooth contours.\nClick \"Face command button\", then click \"Form face\". Select \"Wireframe\" to build a surface from edges. Continue to build all surfaces that cover the whole airway. Retain the nasal anatomical details such as the uvula, epiglottal fold, and laryngeal sinus (Figure 1). Click \"File\", \"Export\" \"IGES\" to export the nasal airway model.\nOpen Meshing Software (e.g., ICEM CFD)\nClick \"File\", \"Import Geometry\", \"Legacy\" and \"STEP/IES\" to import the nasal airway model. Click \"Create Parts\" to divide the airway surfaces into five different regions: nasal vestibule, nasal valve, turbinate region, olfactory, and nasopharynx.\nTo generate computational mesh inside the airway, click \"Mesh\", \"Global Mesh Setup\". Specify the maximum mesh size as 0.1 mm and click \"Apply\".",
    "To add a body-fitted mesh in the near-wall region, click \"Compute Mesh\", \"Prism Mesh\". Specify the number of layers as 5 and the expanding ratio as 1.25 and click \"Apply\".\n2. Passive Control of Particles\nVestibular Intubation: Front vs. Back\nOpen Model Development Software to develop the nasal model with front vestibular intubation. Click \"Volume\", then \"Move/copy\" to change the location of the nebulizer catheter 5 mm into the vestibule from nostril tip. Click \"injection\" to release 60,000 particles (150 nm) into the nostril.\nOpen the fluid simulation software (e.g., ANSYS Fluent) to compute particle deposition rates inside the nose. To compute the airflow field inside the airway, select the laminar flow model by clicking \"Define\", \"Models\", \"Viscous\"; chose \"Laminar\" under \"Viscous model\".\nSelect the \"Discrete Phase Model\" to track particle motions. Check \"Saffman Lift Force\" under \"Discrete Phase Model\". Click \"Report\", then choose \"Sample Trajectories\"; select \"nasal\" under \"Boundaries\" and click \"Compute\" to find the number of particles deposited in the predefined olfactory region. Calculate the deposition rate as the ratio of the amount of deposited particles to the amount of particles entering the nostrils.\nRepeat steps 2.1.2 for 1 µm particles.\nFollow the step 2.1.1, insert the spray nozzle 5 mm into the vestibule from the back of the nostril. Repeat steps 2.1.2, and 2.1.3 to compute deposition rate for 150 nm particles. Repeat step 2.1.4 for 1 µm particles (back-intubation).\nDeep Intubation\nFollow procedure 2.1.1 to insert the nebulizer catheter right beneath the olfactory region. Release 60,000 submicron particles (150 nm) from the nebulizer.\nUse fluid and simulation software to compute particle deposition rates inside the nose on both total and local basis by following similar procedures as listed in 2.1.2. Repeat this procedure for 1 µm particles.",
    "Repeat the above procedures while exercising breathing-holding and exhalation, respectively. Click \"Define\", then \"Boundary Conditions\" to open the boundary condition panel. Specify zero velocity at the two nostrils for breathing-holding. Specify vacuum pressure (200 Pa) at the nostrils and zero pressure at the outlet for exhalation.\n3. Active Control: Magnetophoretic Guidance\nTest in a Two-Plate Channel\nOpen magnetic particle tracking software (e.g., COMSOL). Click \"Geometry\", and \"Rectangle\" to build the two-plate channel. Click \"Rectangle\" to build the magnets around the two-plate channel.\nCompute the particle trajectories and deposition rate. Click \"Model 1\", \"Laminar flow\" and \"Inlet 1\"; specify the inlet velocity as 0.5 m/s. Click \"Model 1\", \"Magnetic Fields\", and \"Magnetic Flux Conservation\", specify the strength of the three magnets (1 × 105 A/m).\nClick \"Model 1\", \"Particle Tracking for Fluid Flow\", and \"Particle Properties\"; specify the particle diameter (15 µm), density (1.78 g/cm3). Click \"Inlet\" to release 3,000 particles. Click \"Magnetophoretic Force\", specify particle relative permeability (50). Click \"Compute\".\nTo find how many particles depositing in the selected area, click \"Results\", \"1D Plot Group\" and \"Plot\". Calculate the deposition rate as the ratio of the amount of particle deposited in certain area to the amount of particles entering the geometry.\nTo adjust the magnet strength, click \"Model 1\", then \"Magnetic Fields\"; choose \"Magnetic Flux Conservation\", and change the magnet strength under \"Magnetization\". Increase the magnet strength by an increment of 1 × 104 A/m and click \"Compute\".\nRepeat this procedure until the appropriate magnets arrangement was obtained for effective drug delivery to the olfactory region.\nTest in the 2-D Idealized Nose Model",
    "Apply the magnetic strengths obtained in 3.1 into a 2-D nose model by putting three magnets 1 mm above the nose. Click \"Model 1\", \"Geometry 1\" to specify the size and position of the magnet. Click \"Model 1\", \"Particle Tracking for Fluid Flow\", \"Inlet\" to release 3,000 particles into the left nostril. Click \"Particle Properties\" to specify the particle size as 15 µm.\nSimulate the particle trajectories and subsequent olfactory delivery efficiencies by following similar procedures as listed in 3.1.2.\nAdjust the magnet layout and strength to improve olfactory delivery efficiency. To adjust the magnet size and position, click \"Model 1\", then \"Geometry 1\"; choose the magnet of interest, change the values of width, depth, height or x, y, z. Follow 3.1.5 to adjust the magnet strength.\nTest in the 3-D Anatomically Accurate Nose Model\nImport the 3-D nasal airway model into Magnetic Particle Tracking software. Follow the procedure 3.2.1, put four magnets 1 mm above the nose and release 3,000 particles of 15 µm in diameter from one selected point only.\nUse Magnetic Particle Tracking software to track particle trajectories and compute olfactory delivery efficiencies by following similar procedures as listed in 3.2.1 - 3.2.3.\nFollowing 3.2.3, adjust the magnet layout and strength in the 3D model to improve the targeted delivery to the olfactory region.\nTest particle size ranging from 1 - 30 µm to find the right particle size for optimal magnetophoretic guidance to the olfactory region.\nSubscription Required.
