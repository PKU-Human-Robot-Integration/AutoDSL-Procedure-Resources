    "Blood is collected from healthy individuals with the approval of the ethics committee of the University of Ottawa (H11-13-06).\n1. Microchannel Fabrication\nThe microchannels are fabricated based on the standard photolithography methods19.\nDesign the microchannel geometry using a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and print the configuration on a transparency photo-mask. These masks are crucial since they dictate the light path during the fabrication process. In this case, the microchannel dimensions are 120 µm in thickness, 60 µm in depth and 7 mm in length.\nIn a cleanroom, spin coat an epoxy based negative photo-resist on a silicon wafer at 2,000 rpm for 30 sec to obtain the desired microchannel depth (60 µm).\nExpose the wafer and the photo-mask under a UV lamp at 650 mJ/cm2 for 70 sec. Ensure to expose only the transparent areas of the photo-mask to the UV-light. The exposure of the transparent areas allows for polymerization of the chains resulting in a hardening of the photo-resist. Immerse the silicon piece into a developer to remove excess of photo-resist.\nOnce the mold is fabricated, mix a silicon based elastomer and a curing agent at a ratio of 10:1 to create a solution of poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS). Put the PDMS solution in a vacuum chamber to degas. Pour it into the mold and heat it at 60 °C for 90 min to create microchannels. Then bond the individual channels to a glass slide using oxygen plasma bonding for 90 sec.\n\tNOTE: the PDMS degas process is performed in order to eliminate the air bubbles engendered by the mixing process.",
    "Ensure that the microchannel dimensions allow for successful testing. In this protocol, the microchannels have a rectangular cross-section of 120 x 60 µm. In comparison, an average RBC has a diameter of 8 µm and a thickness of 2 µm. Therefore, the microchannel width is sufficient to observe proper aggregation and accurately determine the velocity profiles.\n2. Blood Preparation\nCollect blood from healthy volunteer donors, after approval of an ethics committee. Treat the blood with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) present in the collection tubes (7.2 mg EDTA in 4 ml of blood).\n\tNOTE: The EDTA is used to avoid blood clotting.\nCentrifuge the blood samples three times for 10 min at 1,400 x g (3,000 rpm) in order to separate the blood constituents. As a result of the centrifugation, observe three distinct layers.\n\tNOTE: The three layers are the RBC layer (located at the bottom of the tube), the buffy coat (consisting of white blood cells and platelets located on top of the RBC layer) and the plasma layer (located on top of all the other constituents).\n\t\nAfter the first centrifugation, collect blood plasma using a blood pipette. Avoid any contact with the buffy coat.\nCollect and dispose of the buffy coat in a container with bleach diluted at 10%.\nAdd 3 ml of PBS pH 7.4 to each of the tubes with the remaining RBC layer and ensure the proper balance of the centrifuge. Gently mix the tubes and centrifuge once again at 1,400 x g (3,000 rpm) for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the PBS solution does not contain any Magnesium or Calcium since they could alter the cell adhesion.",
    "Dispose of the PBS in the tubes after the second centrifugation and remove the remaining buffy coat if present. Repeat steps 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 for the third centrifugation to yield clean RBCs.\nMix the required amount (0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 ml) of the clean RBCs with plasma (0.95, 0.9 and 0.85 ml) in a 1 ml tube in order to obtain RBC-suspensions with the corresponding (5%, 10% and 15%) hematocrit. Check hematocrits with a microcentrifuge.\n3. Fluids Preparation\nIntroduce two fluids in the double Y-microchannel: RBC-suspensions and PBS.\nAdd 60 µl of the fluorescent tracer particles solution (1% solid, dparticle = 0.86 µm, λabs = 542 nm and λemission = 612 nm) into the 1 ml RBC-suspension tubes.\n\tNOTE: The fluorescent tracer particles (internally dyed polystyrene particles) are used to measure the velocity of the flow within the microchannel. These particles fluoresce when exposed to the corresponding wavelength of the laser beam (λ = 542 nm).\nPrepare a PBS pH 7.4 solution and add 60 µl of the same fluorescent tracer particles solution in 1 ml of the PBS solution.\n4. Aggregates Size Measurements\nTo insert the fluids (RBC-suspensions and PBS) in the microchannel, use two glass syringes of 25 µl and 100 µl. This will help to reduce the compliance of the system. Connect the microchannel to the syringes via tubing and connectors fitting the entry holes. Fill the glass syringes using the pressure difference existing between the fluid container and the syringe. Ensure no bubbles are present in the system. As an alternative method, use a pressure controlled system to drive both fluids in the microchannel.",
    "Place the microchannel on an inverted microscope stage connected to a high speed camera and a µPIV system. Program the syringe pump to the desired flow rates (e.g., Q = 2 µl/hr for blood engendering a flowrate of Q = 8 µl/hr for PBS).\n\tNOTE: Only one syringe pump is used. Using two different glass syringes, with two different internal diameters, it is possible to vary to the flowrate entering each branch of the Y-microchannel.\nInsert both fluids in the double Y-microchannel each from a different entry branch and at different flowrates as shown in Figure 1. In order to test different shear rates, change the pump flowrate. This maintains the same appropriate ratio (4 in this case) between the two branches20 (Figures 2 and 3). Wait for the flow to reach steady state before acquiring the measurements: visually inspect the high speed camera images for a smooth flow.\n\tNOTE: The ratio is crucial in obtaining a linear velocity profile within the blood layer.\nVisualize the RBCs using the high speed camera. Connect the camera to a computer to control, record and save the images of the fluid flow. Once the two fluid flows reach steady state, start recording.\n\t\nAcquire several images for better processing results. Determine an optimal camera exposure time for a clear image of the aggregates.\n\t\tNOTE: The camera exposure time for this case was 0.5 msec. The choice of time interval between each frame is based on the camera frame rate and the flow rate in the microchannel. The time between each frame processed in this procedure was 60 msec. Therefore a camera capable of recording 18 frames per seconds is sufficient.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid blood settling in the tube and syringe, which could lead to erroneous measurements.",
    "Using image processing techniques (a MATLAB program in this case) to ameliorate the image quality, detect the aggregates in each of the images based on pixel intensities (illustrated in Figure 4) as follows:\n\t\nEnhance the images contrast using the histogram equalizer method to obtain a better image quality for each frame.\nConvert the greyscale images into binary images. For this purpose, set a threshold value, ranging from 0 to 1, that dictates the conversion of each pixel. Any pixel in the image below the threshold value will be detected as a black pixel, while the pixels with values larger than the threshold will be detected as white pixels.\nFill the holes (if present and necessary) corresponding to the gaps within one aggregate for better results.\nDetect the cells by determining neighboring white pixels in the binary image so that adjacent cells are associated as aggregates.\nLabel the different aggregates detected and convert the binary image into a red-green-blue (RGB) image for better visualization. Combine the original frames with each of the corresponding processed images to verify the efficiency of the image processing technique and ensure that all the cells are taken into consideration, as shown in Figure 5. Perform steps 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 for all the frames captured.\nCalculate the area of each aggregate detected in the frame based on the number of pixels detected. Based on the lens magnification used, calculate the conversion factor, using a calibration reticule, and convert the results to µm2. Average the aggregate sizes detected in each frame and then average the results for all frames to obtain the average aggregate size for each recording of RBC-suspensions.",
    "Calculate the area of one RBC to determine a representative estimated number of RBCs within each detected aggregate. Using these results, calculate the distribution of the percentage of RBCs within each aggregate as a function of the aggregate sizes (represented by the estimated number of cells in each aggregate), as shown in Figure 6.\n\t\tNOTE: To measure the RBC aggregates, ImageJ software could be used (instead of MATLAB) to perform the same tasks on each frame.\n5. Fluid Velocity and Shear Rate Measurements\nDetermine the fluid velocity and hence the shear rate using a µPIV system.\nOnce the data is acquired using the high speed camera, switch to the double pulsed camera used for the µPIV system. Use an imaging software for image acquisition of the flow and the image processing for velocity field determination.\nTake all the precautions necessary, depending on the class of the laser, before turning on the laser. Then turn on the system, the camera and the laser.\nCalibrate the camera based on the lens magnification used. For this purpose, use a microscale of 10 µm precision under the microscope and set the size of 1 pixel in the image.\nStart the laser and visualize the particles in both fluids. Find the middle plane of the microchannel by focusing on the fastest particles in the flow (i.e., the fastest particles should be the brightest).\nSet the dt (time interval between two consecutive frames) to ensure the proper displacement of the particle. The fastest particles should move about 5 to 10 pixels between both images.\nStart recording the flow. Set the software to acquire 100 pairs of images, 5 msec apart. Perform steps 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 for all the different RBC-suspensions and for different shear rates.",
    "NOTE: More details of the methodology are given in the study of Pitts and Fenech21.\nProcess the recordings acquired using the cross-correlation method with the imaging software.\n\tNOTE: This consists of discretizing the pair of images into small windows of predetermined size (based on the fluid flow and the time interval chosen by the user) called correlation windows and following the displacement of the particles in each window.\n\t\nFirst, determine if the images acquired require pre-processing (including background subtraction, “base-clipping”22 or image overlapping23,24) for better data processing.\nThen choose the correlation window size and shape, as well of the percentage of images overlapping. A detailed study was performed by Pitts et al.25 to determine the optimal parameters and image pre-processing techniques for blood flow in different channel configurations. Express the results as an average velocity field calculated from the 100 image pairs and the Root Mean Square (RMS) error in velocity.\nExtract a velocity profile at the channel outlet, from the processed data as shown in Figure 7. For a better profile, average the velocity field in space.\n\tNOTE: The bars composing the velocity profile correspond to the correlation window size chosen relative to the channel width. The RMS error in velocity is also shown in Figure 7, representing the error in the experimental velocity estimation.\nTurn off the laser once all the measurements and processing are performed,. Shut down all the components of the system: software, cameras, moving stage, computers and laser.",
    "To calculate the shear rate, first detect and estimate the blood thickness in the microchannel based on the high speed camera recording. For this purpose, average all the frames in the specific recording to obtain a background image of the video. Delimit the blood layer (as shown in Figure 8 for the RBC-suspensions flowing at 10 µl/hr when suspended at 5%, 10% and 15% hematocrit). Obtain the velocity value for the corresponding blood layer thickness and calculate the shear rate by dividing the velocity value by the blood layer thickness.\nSubscription Required.
