    "The local state's animal care committee (Service de la Consommation et des Affaires Vétérinaires [SCAV], Lausanne, Switzerland) approved all experiments (authorization VD3224; 01.06.2017) and all experiments were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.\n1. Animal housing and Preparation\nHouse 6 to 8 week-old C57BL/6J male mice in the animal facility for at least 1 week prior to the beginning of the experiments in order for the mice to get used to their new housing conditions. For practical reasons, mice of the same experimental group are usually housed together.\nKeep the mice in a temperature-controlled room (22 ± 1 °C) with a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water.\n2. Determination of the Maximal Speed and Standard Assessment of Performance Improvement by Treadmill Incremental Test\nNOTE: The following steps are critical to completing the training protocols.\nUse a motorized treadmill for mice where mice can be on multiple lanes alongside each other, with a 0° inclination and mounted with an electric grid set to 0.2 mA at the back of the lane, in order to encourage the mice to run.\nPrior to the first test, submit the mice to 4 days of acclimatization to the treadmill, according to the following protocol.\nOn day 1, have mice run for 10 min at 4.8 m/min.\nOn day 2, have the mice run for 10 min at 6 m/min.\nOn day 3, have the mice run for 10 min at 7.2 m/min.\nOn day 4, have the mice run for 10 min at 8.4 m/min.\nOn day 5, submit the mice to an incremental test to exhaustion, according to the following protocol.\nLet the mice warm up for 5 min at 4.8 m/min (at a 0° inclination).",
    "Increase the speed by 1.2 m/min every 3 min (e.g., 5 min at 4.8 m/min, then 3 min at 6 m/min, 3 min at 7.2 m/min, 3 min at 8.4 m/min, etc.) until exhaustion, which is reached when the mouse either spends 3 consecutive seconds on the electric grid or receives 100 shocks (displayed by the apparatus).\nWrite down the achieved speed (considered as the Vmax), duration, distance, number of shocks, and total time spent on the grid.\nNOTE: Typically, Vmax was 28.8 ± 3.7 m/min.\nMid-training, resubmit the mice to this test in order to readjust the speeds of training to the updated Vmax of the mice (e.g., if the training protocol lasts 8 weeks, then perform a mid-training incremental test at 4 weeks. In that case, replace one of the scheduled trainings by the test), and do so again at the end of the study in order to assess performance improvements.\nImplement a 48 h rest period before and after this test.\nNOTE: All the incremental tests were performed in the morning.\n3. Hypoxic Environment\nFor the training sessions in hypoxia, place the treadmill in the hypoxic box (Figure 1) linked to a gas mixer. Use a calibrated oximeter to regularly control the ambient fraction of oxygen (FiO2 [i.e., the level of hypoxia]) in the box.\nSet the gas mixer on 100% of nitrogen (N2) and use the oximeter to verify the level of hypoxia. Once FiO2 = 0.13, change the parameter of the gas mixer from 100% N2 to 13% O2.",
    "In order to avoid prolonged passive exposure to hypoxia, place the mice in a temporary smaller cage with litter and enrichment, and quickly place it in the box once FiO2 = 0.13 has been reached. Verify that the environment is still at 13% O2 after putting the cage in; if not, readjust it.\nRegularly verify the level of O2 over the course of a training session to make sure that it remains at FiO2 = 0.13 ± 0.002.\n4. Normoxic Environment\nFor the training sessions in normoxia, keep the treadmill in the hypoxic box, but remove the gloves so that there is ambient air (FiO2 = 0.21). The aim is to recreate the same training environment as the mice in hypoxia.\n5. Supramaximal Intensity Training\nPlace the mice on individual lanes in the treadmill (at a 0° inclination) and submit them to the following protocol.\nHave the mice warm up for 5 min at 4.8 m/min, followed by 5 min at 9 m/min.\nSet the speed of the sprints to 150% of the previously determined Vmax.\nNOTE: Typically, the sprint velocity was 42.1 ± 5.5 m/min.\nTrain the mice for four sets of 5x 10 s sprints with 20 s of rest between each sprint. The interset rest is 5 min (Figure 2).\nNOTE: Add a cooldown period if the total workload of the training session needs to match that of another training group.\nPerform this training 3x per week, with preferably 48 h between training sessions.",
    "Use cotton swabs as a complementary method to electric shocks to encourage the mice to run. Place a cotton swab in a slit at the top of the lane, between the mouse and the electric grid, and gently nudge the mouse when it reaches the back of the treadmill. This will avoid the delivery of electric shocks and stimulate the mice to run in a softer way.\n6. Low-intensity Training\nPlace the mice on individual lanes in the treadmill (at a 0° inclination) and submit them to the following protocol.\nHave the mice warm up for 5 min at 4.8 m/min, followed by 5 min at 7.2 m/min.\nSet the speed of the continuous running session to 40% of the previously determined Vmax.\nNOTE: Typically, the continuous running velocity was 9.9 m/min.\nTrain the mice for 40 min.\nPerform this training 3x per week with preferably 48 h between training sessions.\nUse cotton swabs as a complementary method to electric shocks to encourage the mice to run.\n7. Mice Euthanasia and Organ Extraction\nAt the end of the training protocol and at least 24 h after the last incremental test, anesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber using isoflurane (4%–5% in O2 to induce anesthesia, and 1%–2% in 100% O2 to maintain anesthesia). Confirm proper anesthetization using the paw retraction reflex (firmly pinch the animal's paw; anesthesia is considered proper when the animal does not react to the stimulus).\nUsing a 25 G needle, perform a percutaneous cardiac puncture, to collect maximum blood volume as previously described19.\nPerform a cervical dislocation and remove the skin of the mouse by cutting through the first layer of skin on the abdomen with round-tip scissors and pulling on the two sides of the incision (toward the head and the tail).",
    "Cut through the peritoneum under the ribcage on the left side of the mouse with thin-point-tip scissors to reach the spleen and extract it if needed.\nNOTE: Dissect out muscles if needed.\nDissect out the pulmonary artery.\nUsing both small scissors and forceps, remove the thoracic cage and clear the heart-lung area.\nWith \"self-closing\" tweezers, pinch the heart as close as possible to the apex and pull gently to stretch the base of the aortic arch and the pulmonary artery.\nUsing the right hand, insert curved tweezers under the pulmonary artery and the aorta, and then move the tweezers back a little to hold only the pulmonary artery (Figure 3).\nUse the left hand to insert another pair of tweezers to replace the one held with the right hand.\nUsing sharp straight microscissors in the right hand, dissect the pulmonary artery as close to the heart as possible on one side, and as far away as possible on the other side.\nNOTE: It does not matter which hand holds which instrument, although we have found it easier to cut with the right hand than with the left.\nPut it in a 2 mL tube with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and keep on ice.\nPerform a whole-body perfusion.\nAt the top of the right lower limb of the mouse, use tweezers to clear out the external-internal right iliac artery down to the right femoral artery (under the inguinal ligament). Using sharp straight microscissors, make a full cut in the femoral artery.\nInsert a 5 mL 25 G syringe filled with cold PBS in the left ventricle of the heart and gently inject the cold PBS to remove the remaining blood from the vessels.",
    "NOTE: Due to the extraction of the pulmonary artery, it is possible that PBS does not circulate all the way to the incision.\nUsing tweezers, remove the soft tissue surrounding the aorta from the left and right inguinal ligaments to the heart as thoroughly as possible.\nNOTE: The heart can be extracted for further analysis if necessary.\nUsing both tweezers and microscissors, dissect out the heart up to the lowest point of the external iliac artery (in both left and right limbs) and place the entirely dissected-out section in a 10 cm-diameter dish with cold PBS.\nUsing tweezers and/or microscissors, finish cleaning the remaining fat around the aorta and arteries by gently pulling or cutting it away from the vessels.\nUsing microscissors, cut the left iliac artery at the left-right iliac artery bifurcation and store it for further analysis.\nUsing microscissors, cut the abdominal aorta under the left renal artery, and place the extracted vessel in cold PBS buffer on ice (Figure 4).\nKeep the remaining cleaned vessel, from the aortic arch to right above the left renal artery, in storage for further analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58708/58708fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Picture of the dissected vessels.

Ex Vivo Vascular Function Assessment\nNOTE: A wash corresponds to the emptying and refilling of the chambers with Krebs.",
    "According to a previously described protocol20, cut the isolated pulmonary artery, abdominal aorta, and right iliac artery segments into vascular rings of 1.0–2.0 mm long and mount each ring on two 0.1 mm-diameter stirrups passed through the lumen.\nSuspend the vessel rings in vertical organ chambers filled with 10 mL of modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (118.3 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 25.0 mM NaHCO3, and 11.1 mM glucose) maintained at 37 °C and aerated with 95% O2-5% CO2 (pH 7.4). One stirrup is anchored to the bottom of the organ chamber and the other one is connected to a strain gauge for the measurement of isometric force in grams.\nBring the vessels to their optimal resting tension: stretch the rings to 0.5 g for the pulmonary artery, 1.5 g for the iliac artery, and 2 g for the abdominal aorta, and wash them after a 20 min period of equilibration. Repeat the stretch-equilibration-wash steps 1x.\nTo test the viability of the vessels, contract the rings with 235 µL of KCl (10-1 M) for 10 min, wash them for another 10 min, and contract again with 235 µL of KCl (10-1 M) for about 20 min until reaching a plateau.\nWash the vessels again for 10 min and add 58.4 µL of indomethacin (10-5 M) (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase activity) for at least 20 min in order to avoid possible interference of endogenous prostanoids.\nAdd cumulative doses of phenylephrine (Phe) from 10-9 (10 µL) to 10-4 M (or 10-9 to 10-5 M for the pulmonary artery; 9 µL for all concentrations above 10-9 M) to contract the vessels.\nAfter the last dose of Phe, wait for about 1 h until the vessels reach a relatively stable contraction state (plateau).",
    "Add cumulative doses of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh), from 10-9 to 10-4 M (58.4 µL for 10-9 M, and alternately 12.6 µL and 40 µL for all concentrations above 10-9 M), to induce nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxation.\nAt the end of the relaxation curve, wash the vessels for 10 min, and add 58.4 µL of indomethacin (10-5 M), as well as 184 µL of NG-nitro-L-arginine (NLA, 10-4 M), which is an inhibitor of the NOS, for at least 20 min.\nContract the vessels again with a unique dose of 10 µL of Phe (10-5 and 10-4 M for the pulmonary artery and 10-4 M for the abdominal aorta and the iliac artery) for 1 h, to induce a relatively stable contraction.\nAdd a unique dose of 40 µL of ACh (10-4 M) until reaching a plateau.\nWash the vessels again for 10 min, before adding 58.4 µL of indomethacin (10-5 M) and 184 µL of NLA (10-4 M) for 20 min.\nContract the vessels with 10 µL of Phe (10-5 and 10-4 M) for 1 h.\nAdd cumulative doses (10-9 [58.4 µL] to 10-4 M [40 µL for all concentrations above 10-9 M]) of the NO donor diethylamine (DEA)/NO, in order to assess the endothelium-independent NO-induced relaxation.\nAt the end of the experiment, store the vessels in liquid nitrogen for future analyses if needed.\nSubscription Required.
