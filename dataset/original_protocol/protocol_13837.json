    "All women (over 18 years of age) as well as all minor girls and their parents signed an informed consent form to preserve the fertility of the patient at risk of POI. This protocol is considered as a routine ART procedure in our center for fertility preservation. It follows the guidelines of our institutions human research ethics committee.\n1. Quality control\nInclude female age ≤ 38 years, containing circulating anti-mullerian hormone concentration >1 ng/mL and showing the presence of an increased risk of POI due to gonadotoxic treatment. Exclude women eligible for oocyte vitrification for fertility preservation procedure, women with a condition that prevents giving a fully informed consent or women with a high risk of complications from anesthesia or surgery.\nConfirm the presence of a signed patient consent before initiating this procedure.\nIdentify two vacant locations within two distinct cryopreservation storage tanks. Half of the cryotubes/straws will be kept in the first storage tank while the other half of the cryotubes/straws will be kept in the other tank to minimize the risk of a total loss of the samples in the case of a tank failure.\nCheck the availability and functionality of all medical devices required in this protocol. Sterile surgical dissecting scissors with sharp straight blades and finely sharpened points as well as sterile atraumatic tissue forceps are recommended for the dissection step.\nCheck that all quality-control steps have been respected for all medical devices (particularly, validation and routine control of sterilization processes, expiration/lot number verification and tracking).\nMaintain an aseptic/a sterile environment throughout the procedure and realize with caution all the safety precautions.\nUse different dishes, pipettes, and surgical instruments for each patient.\n2. The day before the preservation",
    "Prepare one sterile 60 mm IVF Petri dish containing an IVF medium covered with mineral oil and incubate the dish overnight at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% O2 and 5% CO2. Use this dish to collect the cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) that will be potentially retrieved from the tissue (see section 7.2).\nPrepare one sterile 35 mm IVF Petri dish containing IVF medium and incubate the dish overnight at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% O2 and 5% CO2. Use this dish for the oocyte denudation step (see section 9.1).\nPrepare one sterile 35 mm IVF Petri dish containing IVF medium covered with mineral oil and incubate the dish overnight at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% O2 and 5% CO2. Use this dish to collect the oocytes after the denudation step (see section 9.4).\n3. Ovarian tissue collection and transport\nPerform the laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia using one 10 mm port positioned at the umbilicus and two 5 mm ports, one positioned at the left-lower quadrant and another one positioned at the right.\nPerform a partial or complete unilateral oophorectomy according to the consensus decision of the oncologist, the surgeon and the medical staff of the ART unit based on the ovarian reserve, the size, and the macroscopic aspect of both ovaries (Figure 1, A1–B1) and the planned gonadotoxic protocol. Perform oophorectomy with sharp scissors or a surgical staple. Do not use any dissection device that could induce collateral, electric, or thermal injury to the ovarian tissue that is to be preserved.\n\tNOTE: A complete unilateral oophorectomy is generally performed in prepubertal girls16,22, whereas a partial unilateral oophorectomy could be commonly achieved in adult patients with large ovaries and/or a high ovarian reserve.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61777/61777fig01.jpg",

The tissue must be completely immersed in the culture medium.\nImmediately transport the ovarian tissue in an insulated pouch at 4 °C to the ART laboratory for optimal results.\n\tNOTE: If necessary, the ovarian tissue can be transport at cold temperatures (around 4 °C) to the laboratory for up to 26 h after the collection without threatening the quality of the tissue23.\n4. Ovarian tissue preparation\nTransfer the ovarian tissue into a sterile 90 mm IVF Petri dish containing 20 mL of pre-cooled culture medium at 4 °C.\nPut the Petri dish containing the ovarian tissue on a cold plate (at 4 °C) placed on a vertical laminar flow clean bench to minimize the risk of microorganism contamination.\n5. Manual follicle aspiration from ovarian tissue samples\nAspirate visible antral follicles (if present on the surface of ovarian tissue) with a 21 G syringe needle connected to a 1 mL disposable syringe.\n\tNOTE: This step could be tricky. An alternative may be to gently open each visible antral follicle with a scalpel and rinse the inside of each follicle with IVF media in order to softly release COCs within the dissection media.",
    "Flush the collected follicular fluids into a sterile 60 mm IVF Petri dish containing 5 mL of IVF culture medium at room temperature.\nRinse the syringe with 1 mL of IVF culture medium at room temperature and flush the liquid into the same IVF Petri dish. Repeat this step two times.\nIdentify and isolate the COCs under an inverted microscope (50x–200x magnification).\nTransfer the healthy COCs with a pipette into a new sterile 60 mm IVF Petri dish containing pre-equilibrated IVF medium covered with oil at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% O2 and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Healthy COCs contain a translucent oocyte. Discard the atretic COCs presenting a brown coloured oocyte.\nStore the IVF Petri dish in the incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% O2 and 5% CO2 until the denudation step (see step 9).\n6. Ovarian tissue dissection\nPrepare the fresh freezing solution in a 50 mL sterile tube. The freezing solution contains 1.5M dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 10% of human serum albumin in IVF culture medium. Gently vortex.\n\tNOTE: It should be prepared just before use.\nCut the ovarian tissue and remove medulla as much as possible (Figure 1, B4).\nCut the ovarian cortex into slices measuring 10 mm x 10 mm x 1 mm or 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm x 1 mm in the case of complete or partial unilateral oophorectomy, respectively (Figure 1, A2–B2–B3). The cutting is performed with sterile surgical sharp scissors and atraumatic forceps.\n\tNOTE: One slice of ovarian tissue is kept intact with both ovarian cortex and medulla for further histological analysis (see step 8).",
    "After the dissection, perform two washing steps (or more, if required) for each ovarian cortical sample in 1 mL of IVF culture medium to remove blood. After the washing, transfer all the tissue samples into a new 60 mm Petri dish with fresh IVF culture medium.\nPlace each ovarian cortical sample in a cryotube containing 1 mL of freezing solution.\n\tNOTE: Mixing is unnecessary. The slice of ovarian tissue kept for further histological analysis is not cryopreserved (see step 8).\nKeep the samples for 30 min at 4 °C for equilibration with the freezing solution.\nCryopreserve all samples with a slow freezing technique. The cooling rate is -2 °C/min from +4 °C until -9 °C, -50 °C/min until -30 °C; hold during 1 min, +4 °C/min until -15 °C, -2 °C/min until -40 °C; and finally -25 °C/min until -150 °C using a programmable freezer.\nRemove the cryotubes immediately and plunge them into liquid nitrogen at -196 °C.\nPlace half of the cryotubes in a first liquid nitrogen storage tank and the other half of the cryotubes in a second liquid nitrogen tank.\n7. Manual COC isolation from the dissection spent media\nIdentify COCs from the dissection spent media under a microscope (50x–200x magnification) (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61777/61777fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Mature and immature COCs retrieved from ovarian tissue. Mature (A) and immature (B1–B3,C1–C2) COCs retrieved from ovarian tissue.

    "Transfer the healthy COCs with a pipette into a new sterile 60 mm IVF Petri Dish containing pre-equilibrated IVF medium covered with oil at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% O2 and 5% CO2 (see step 2.1).\n\tNOTE: Discard the atretic COCs.\nStore the IVF Petri dish in the incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% O2 and 5% CO2 until the denudation step (see step 9).\n8. Ovarian tissue histological analysis\nFix the remaining slice of ovarian tissue (containing both ovarian cortex and medulla) in a 3% formalin solution in a chemical clean bench for histological examination.\n\tNOTE: It should be performed only once the cortical samples are successfully frozen and stored.\n\tCAUTION: The formalin solution is irritating, corrosive, and toxic. This step should be carried out carefully and outside the IVF laboratory.\nPrescribe a complete histological analysis of this ovarian tissue sample with an evaluation of the potential presence of malignant cells as well as a description of the number and type of ovarian follicles (i.e., primordial, primary, secondary, and antral follicles, respectively).\n9. Oocyte denudation and selection\nPerform oocyte denudation. Briefly expose COCs to hyaluronidase solution (80 IU/mL or final concentration 0.1 mg/mL) with gentle pipetting (repeated aspirating and expelling the COCs into the denudation solution) using a large diameter pipette tip (volume 0.1–20 µL, length: 40.5 mm, diameter work cone: 6 mm, diameter opening: 0.36 mm) for 30 s, immediately followed by two washing steps in pre-equilibrated medium covered with mineral oil to remove the excess enzyme (see step 2.1).\nOptimize the removal of cumulus and corona radiata cells by gentle pipetting using a 150 µm pipette tip in pre-equilibrated IVF medium (see step 2.1).",
    "Perform a selection step of healthy oocytes using an inverted microscope (200x–400x magnification). The maturation stage of healthy oocytes could be GV, MI, or MII-stage oocytes (Figure 3). Healthy oocytes have the following morphological characteristics: an intact and round cytoplasm, a size between 100–150 µm, and a pale color.\n\tNOTE: Discard atretic and unhealthy oocytes (Figure 3, D1–D3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61777/61777fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Mature and Immature oocytes retrieved from ovarian tissue. (A) Mature oocyte (Metaphase II-stage oocyte: presence of the first polar body (PB, arrow), no visible nucleus), (B1–B2) Immature oocytes (Metaphase I-stage oocyte: no polar body, no visible nucleus), (C1–C3) Immature oocytes (Germinal Vesicle-stage (VG) oocytes: no polar body, presence of a large halo with nucleoli within the cytoplasm (arrow)).

Oocyte vitrification\nConfirm patient/specimen identification.\nPerform a new selection step of healthy oocytes using an inverted microscope (200x–400x magnification).\n\tNOTE: Discard atretic and unhealthy oocytes.\nTake a picture of each healthy oocyte using an inverted microscope just before the vitrification step. Note the maturation stage of each oocyte.\n\tNOTE: Attach all these data (image, size, maturation stage) in the file of the patient.\nUse different identification numbers per straw to differentiate them if cryopreserving more than one straw per patient.\nCryopreserve one or two oocyte(s) per straw.\n\tNOTE: Mature and immature viable oocytes must be cryopreserved separately. When cryopreserving two oocytes together in the same straw, it is recommended to select oocytes with similar morphological characteristics.",
    "Cryopreserve healthy oocytes using a vitrification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (see Table of Materials).\nLoad the cryopreserve oocytes on an appropriate device for cryostorage in liquid nitrogen according to the manufacturer’s instructions (see Table of Materials).\nPlace half of the straws in a first liquid nitrogen storage tank and the other half of the straws in a second liquid nitrogen tank.\nSubscription Required.
