    "Animal HandlingIndividualize the mice in cages with food and water available ad libitum and house them in a room with an inverted light cycle (light phase from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. and dark phase from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.). Ideally, this room will be the same as the room housing the self-administration chambers. The complete experimental procedure will take place during the dark phase.For best results, keep the same experimenter during the full experimental sequence. This will facilitate habituation and will decrease stress in mice. Silence and soft movements are mandatory to decrease the alertness of the mice throughout the whole procedure.Habituate the mice to the experimenter for 7 days, as follows. Every day, the experimenter will handle each mouse for 2 min, grabbing them gently by the tail with the lowest force possible and placing them on the arm that will be used to move the mice from their cage to the weighing scale and afterwards to the self-administration boxes. Aggressive behavior should decrease dramatically after the first 2 habituation sessions.Food Operant TrainingOn the last day of habituation to the experimenter, mice are weighed and the standard food is removed from the home cage to achieve a 10% reduction in body weight on the following day. Three standard food self-administration pellets will be placed in the home cage to provide minimal food consumption and decrease neophobic behavior during food self-administration sessions. During the following days, pre-weighed standard pellets of 1, 1.5, 2, or 2.5 g are left together with the self-administration pellets in each home cage once a day, to maintain 90% of the initial weight. Hence, mice are weighed every day.At this point, add the following manipulation before weighing the animal: Place a tissue paper over the palm of the hand.",
    "Grab the mouse by the tail with the other hand and place the mouse over the tissue paper. Close the hand holding the tissue paper, wrapping the mouse for 5 s. Release the mouse and place it in the weighing scale. This will habituate the mice to the manipulation needed to place the tube on the catheter for intravenous drug self-administration.Pre-weighed standard pellets of 1, 1.5, 2, or 2.5 g are left in each home cage once a day, to maintain 90% of the initial weight for each individual mouse. Animals keep receiving 3 standard food self-administration pellets on their cage every day.Three days after starting food deprivation, mice start training in the mouse operant chambers to nose-poke for food pellets. This training will consist of daily 1-h sessions and will take place at the same hour every day for 5 days. Before starting the food self-administration sessions, it is important to double check the functioning of the chambers, including home lights, cue lights, nose poke sensors, and pellet delivery systems. After the sessions, the chambers must be cleaned and the food magazine emptied before the following session. The food deprivation regime is maintained during the whole period of evaluation of the operant behavior. Water is available ad libitum during the whole experiment, except during the operant sessions.The start of the food self-administration session is signaled with the lighting of the house light placed on the ceiling of the box during the first 3 s. This light is then turned off during the remaining duration of the session. Immediately after this event, the cue light of the active nose poke is also lighted, and one priming pellet is delivered in the food magazine to remind the functioning of the chamber.",
    "Once the session is started, a fixed ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement (FR1) is used during the whole training period (one nose-poke on the active hole results in the delivery of one reinforcer, together with a light stimulus for 2 s). Thus, nose-poking the active hole results in the lighting of its corresponding cue light for 2 s and the delivery of one food self-administration pellet in the central magazine, whereas nose-poking the inactive hole has no consequences. Since the door of the chamber is placed in one side of the box, one of the two holes is closer to the door. To avoid a possible bias associated with this lack of symmetry, it is important to counterbalance the composition of the experimental groups to have similar amounts of mice nose-poking to active or inactive holes on each side of the box.The delivery of reinforcers is followed by a timeout period of 10 s, where no cues are presented, and no reward is provided following active nose-pokes.Food self-administration sessions last 1 h, or until the mouse nose-pokes 100 times on the active hole, whichever happens first. These sessions are carried out at the same hour for 5 consecutive days. Active and inactive nose pokes are recorded.Animals are weighed after every food training session. Pre-weighed food pellets of 1, 1.5, 2, or 2.5 g are left in their home cage to maintain the 90% of the initial weight. After the last food training session, the food restriction ends and ad libitum access to food is provided again.Catheter PreparationFile the cannulas (22-gauge tubing) at their long end until blunt (Figure 2A).Twist the long end of the cannula with a clamp, making a 90º angle (Figure 2B).Cut 6.5 cm of silastic tubing #508-001 (tube 1) and 1.",
    "5 cm of silastic tubing #508-003 (tube 2). These measurements are the appropriate ones for a 7-week-old C57BL6/J male mouse.Soak tube 1 in limonene 97% and let it expand for 15 min.Make a little ball (0.2–0.5 cm in diameter) with silicone and place it 1.5 cm from the tip of tube 1. This will be the edge that will allow fixing tube 1 to the jugular vein and will avoid the ejection of the catheter during implantation and afterwards.Insert silastic tube 1 to cover completely the long side of the cannula and let it dry for at least 1 h.Seal the cannula-tube 1 junction with silicone (Figure 2C).Soak tube 2 in limonene 97% and let it expand for approximately 20 min.Insert silastic tube 2 to cover the long side of the cannula, also covering the junction between the tube 1 and the cannula, and let it dry overnight. This is important to protect the tube 1 from the cement applied on the next steps.After preparing the mold (Figure 2D), place the cannula with the tubes into the mold (Figure 2E), and close it tight (Figure 2F).Prepare dental cement as indicated by the manufacturer and fill the mold. The amount of cement to be used is important, since if there were excess cement it would be annoying for the mouse; for this reason, do not overfill the mold, just adjust the amount to the form of the mold.Put a piece of tulle of 1 cm x 1 cm covering the bottom side of each catheter, and let it dry for 10–15 min (Figure 2G).Remove the catheters from the mold.Clean possible excess of dental cement.The catheter should be like Figure 2H.Let it dry for 2 days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4348/bioprotoc-12-05-4348-g002.jpgFigure 2. Cathether fabrication.",
    "After filing the cannulas (A), twist them making a 90º angle (B) and join the two different silastic to the cannula (C). After opening the mold (D), place the cannula into the mold (E) and close the mold tight (F). Fill the mold with dental cement and place a piece of tulle in the bottom of the catheter (G). The cement should dry and the excess cleaned until the catheter looks like (H).Surgery for Drug Self-administrationAnesthetize the mouse with ketamine/medetomidine solution 10 mL/kg i.p.Spread xilin over the mouse’s eyes to keep them moist during the surgical procedure.Shave the chest and the back of the mouse, and use cotton swabs to spread ethanol over the skin, followed by application of iodine over the same skin surface.Look for the interscapular zone on the back of the mouse and make a 1–2 cm incision through the skin, parallel to the spine. Use scissors to separate the skin from the underlying muscle and make room for the catheter.Use the curved forceps to separate the skin from the muscle in the area where the tube 1 cannula will be placed (on the right shoulder).Turn over the animal and locate the heartbeat in the chest. With the forceps, grasp the skin above the heartbeat location on the superior right side of the chest, where the jugular vein is located. Make an incision on the skin and perform blunt dissection towards the path made from the back with the curved forceps on the right shoulder.Insert the forceps going through the incision of the chest until a hole in the back, and pass the catheter through the open path over the shoulder. It is important to double check that the catheter is correctly sealed by infusing heparin (0.1% in saline) through it.",
    "Find and dissect the jugular vein eliminating the surrounding fat and muscle fibers.Once the jugular vein is exposed, pointed forceps (Dumont forceps) are inserted under the vein from the right side of the mouse and other pointed forceps are inserted from the left side. Rotate these two forceps to separate the vein from the surrounding tissue (Figure 3A).Pass a bent silk suture thread under the vein from the left to the right side. Cut the bent silk along the fold to generate two different silk segments. Tie the lower thread loosely around the right leg of the animal. In the upper thread, make a simple knot with a firm movement, to cut off the blood supply (Figure 3B).Locate a straight area in the vein path to perform the catheterization and pierce the vein with a 20 G 1½ needle. Remove the needle and insert the catheter guide as far as possible into the hole made by the needle (Figure 3C).Slide the catheter silastic tube into the jugular vein until reaching the silicone ball of the catheter. Check the entry of blood to the catheter to confirm correct placement (Figure 3D).Tighten the lower knot to secure the catheter and administer 0.2 mL of heparin (0.1% in saline), to keep the catheter full of liquid (Figure 3E).Tie with additional knots the upper and lower threads to secure the catheter. Then make two additional knots with the ends of the threads on the left and two extra knots with the ends of the threads on the right.Insert the catheter tubing 1.5 cm into the right jugular vein and anchor with suture. The remaining tubing runs subcutaneously to the cannula, which exits at the midscapular region.Suture the chest and coat with antibiotic ointment (Bactroban, GlaxoSmithKline, Madrid, Spain).Infuse 0.025 mL of heparin (0.",
    "3 mg/kg) and close the short side of the cannula with a cap, to avoid the inclusion of air. Place the catheter tulle under the skin, suture the skin on top of the catheter to fix the tube, and close it tightly (Figure 3F).Spread blastoestimulin on the sutured areas. Administer atipamezole (2 mg/kg) i.p. followed by gentamicin (1 mg/kg), meloxicam (2 mg/kg), and glucose serum s.c (0.9 mL).After surgery, animals are allowed to recover for 3 days prior to initiation of the self-administration sessions.The patency of the i.v. catheters is evaluated after the last self-administration session and whenever the behavior appears to deviate dramatically from that observed previously. This patency is assessed by infusion of thiopental (Tiobarbital 0.5 g B. Braun, Barcelona, Spain) through the catheter (1.25 mg/kg). When prominent signs of anesthesia are not apparent within 3 s of the infusion, the mouse must be removed from the experiment. The success rate for the maintenance of the patency of the catheter of a procedure with a duration of 12 days should be higher than 80%.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4348/bioprotoc-12-05-4348-g003.jpgFigure 3. Surgical procedure for intravenous jugular catheterization. Once the jugular vein is localized (A), two threads are tied around the vein (B), using the upper thread to cut blood supply. With the help of a 20 G 1½ needle the vein is pierced (C) and the silastic tube slides into the vein until reaching the silicone ball of the catheter (D). Then, after checking the entry of blood to the catheter, the lower knot is tightened to secure the catheter and heparin is administered to keep the catheter full of liquid (E).",
    "After having secured the catheter with a net of sutures, the catheter tulle is placed under the skin and the skin is sutured on top of the catheter to fix the tube (F).Software Preparation before Self-medication SessionOpen Med-PC IV Software.Click on “File” and “Open Session”. In this window, the experimental procedure must be selected (Procedure) (Figure 4A). The correct procedure file for each box should be selected considering the placement of the active nose-poke (right or left) (Figure 4B). Select the boxes that will be starting the self-administration session and press OK. This must be done for each box participating in the session.The ID of the study animal, the name of the experiment, the session, and the experimental group can be introduced, as well as a filename for the resulting data file (Figure 4B). The procedure is the programming code by which the program is governed to perform the desired actions (which are at least the active and inactive nose-poking, duration of the session, duration of the time-out, and activation of lights).Click on “Configure” and “Signals”. Select the box, choose the option Issue START Command, and press Issue (Figure 4C). This turns on the house light (Figure 4D) and, when the light turns off, the nose-pokes become active (Figure 4E).A priming reinforcer is delivered in each session (Figure 4F). If no priming pellet was delivered, mark the option Simulate Response, select the correct active nose-poke (1= left, 2= right), and press Issue.After the end of the session, the number of active and inactive nose pokes is recorded (Figure 4G). The data file is located on the Data folder of the Med-PC Software.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4348/bioprotoc-12-05-4348-g004.jpgFigure 4. Med-PC IV software.

E) Start of the procedure, where the display shows the cue light ON and the pump ON (numbers 4 and 5 in red, respectively). F) Priming infusion given by the experimenter. G) Display of the data obtained during the session.Drug Self-administration ProcedureAfter completion of food self-administration training, the pain animal model of chronic pain is conducted, and behavioral tests of nociception can be performed to confirm the induction of pain sensitization (Bura et al., 2018, Cabañero et al., 2020).Once the pain sensitization is induced, the i.v. catheter is implanted to allow i.v. self-administration.Three days after catheter implantation, mice start the drug self-administration sessions, where the food reinforcer is substituted by drug or vehicle infusions.Self-administration sessions are conducted at the same hour every day and under a fixed ratio of 1 of reinforcement, i.e., one nose poke induces the delivery of one i.v. infusion. Sessions are conducted during 10–12 consecutive days, until vehicle-treated mice have reached a stable extinction of food-maintained operant behavior.To prevent gas embolism, the pumps are manually adjusted, to remove the remaining air bubbles from the tubes that will bind the syringes loaded with drug or vehicle with the animals. This is done before placing the animals in the operant boxes, by manually rotating the pump knob to expel liquid through the tube until no bubbles are seen.",
    "Mice are kindly immobilized as previously described (Section B, point 2), the catheter cap is removed, and the catheter is connected to the infusion pump with the primed tubes.Sessions last 1 h or until 60 active nose-pokes, with active and inactive nose-pokes being recorded after each session.A thiopental test is performed at the end of the experimental procedure to prove the patency of the catheter. Animals with a functional catheter must fall asleep after the infusion of 0.5 mL of thiopental; animals with a negative thiopental test are discarded."
