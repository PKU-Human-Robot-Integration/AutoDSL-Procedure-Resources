    "1. Fabrication of Silicone Rubber Molds\nProduce or purchase a desired topographic surface for casting. For this publication a standard 100 mm etched silicon wafer will be described (Figure 1).\nWeigh out polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) potting (component A) and catalyst (component B) solution in a 1:9 ratio (9 g potting and 1 g catalyst) as provided in the purchased kit.\nMix solutions thoroughly to initiate curing process.\nPlace silicon wafer surface within a casting dish.\nWeigh out 4.5 g of PDMS solution onto silicon wafer.\nSpread PDMS solution as to cover a 100 mm diameter area of the wafer surface.\nTilt wafer to spread PDMS solution evenly.\nCover wafer with 100 mm diameter petri dish lid.\nPlace casting setup into 60 °C oven over night, making certain that curing is taking place on a flat surface.\nPlace cured PDMS/silicon wafer into 70% ethanol bath before removal.\nBegin removing PDMS from wafer by using razor blade to lift edge (entire circumference) first.\nGently pull PDMS off using forceps within a 70% ethanol bath being careful not to tear silicone rubber casting.\nPunch out individual PDMS molds using 14 mm hole punch. This diameter is designed to fit into a 24-well plate setup.\n2. Production of Silk Solution\nBring 2 L of distilled water (dH2O) to a boil within a glass beaker 7 .\nCut 5 g of Bombyx mori silkworm cocoons into thirds.\nDispose of extensively contaminated cocoons as indicated by excessive insect particulates coating the inner cocoon surface.\nMeasure 4.24 g of sodium carbonate.\nAdd sodium carbonate slowly to boiling dH2O volume to prevent boiling over of water, and allow complete dissolution before continuing.\nAdd cocoon pieces to boiling dH2O for 40 min., and use a Teflon coated stir bar to stir cocoons during boiling process.",
    "After boiling, carefully drain dH2O into sink and ring out the silk extract by hand to remove excess water.\nWash silk extract three times for 20 min. each in 1 L of dH2O in a lab beaker, and use a stir bar to circulate volume within beaker.\nAfter washing, ring out the silk extract by hand and place silk fiber extract inside a chemical hood to allow for drying for a 12 hr. period.\nNext day, weigh the dried silk fibers, which is typically ~3.5 g: ___________-g\nPrepare 9.3 M LiBr solution for a 20% w/v solution of silk. Utilize following equations to calculate necessary weight and volumes:\n\t\n(Silk extract weight from step 10) x (4) = ___________-mL of total 9.3 M LiBr solution\n[(807.705) x (LiBr volume from part 11.a)]/1000 = ___________ g of LiBr to add to dH2O\nAdd measured LiBr weight into a glass beaker of the following dH2O volume:\n\t\n(0.8) x (calculated volume from step 11.a) = ___________ mL of dH2O\nPour this solution into an appropriate sized graduated cylinder, and bring solution up to final volume as calculated in part 11.a.\nPlace the silk extract into beaker and pour LiBr solution over the silk fibers making sure the silk fibers are immersed within LiBr solution using a lab spatula.\nPlace the dissolved silk into 60 °C oven for 4 hr:\n\tStart time: ___________\n\tEnd time: ___________\nUsing an appropriate sized syringe draw up 12 mL of the silk solution. Place an 18G needle on end of the syringe, and then inject the solution into a dialysis casette (3,500 MW coutoff, Slide-A-Lyzer, Thermo Scientific). After filling the cassette, draw the remaining air out of the cassette with the emptied syringe.\nPlace filled dialysis cassette within 1 L of dH2O.",
    "Change dH2O volume after 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr and then every 12 hr 3x for a total of 6 changes:\n\t\nBegin: ___________\n1hr: ___________\n4hr: ___________\n8 hr: ___________\n12 hr: ___________\n12 hr: ___________\n12 hr: ___________\nEnd: ___________\nAfter dialysis, slowly collect the silk solution from cassettes with syringe. Place solution into 10,000 g rated centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge the solution twice at 10,000 g at 4 °C for 20-min each. After each centrifugation place supernatant into a new tube.\nStore thr silk solution in 4 °C refrigerator.\nPipette 2 samples of 0.5 mL silk solution into small weigh dish, and place weigh dishes inside a 60 °C dry oven for 12 hours or until the silk solution dries.\nWeigh the remaining solid silk film from both samples to measure silk solution percent weight to volume protein concentration:\n\t\nWeight of combined 2 silk film samples:___________ mg\n(Weight from 23.a) x (100) = ___________% silk\n3. Preparation of Silk Films and Culture System Setup\nPrepare PDMS casting surfaces by cleaning with clear tape to remove dust.\nClean PDMS substrates by soaking in 70% EtOH and wash three times with dH2O.\nPlace 14 mm PDMS molds onto holder plate, which is typically a 24 well plate lid.\nTo produce a 50 μm thick film, spread 70 μls of 8% silk solution on PDMS molds using a liquid spreading tool that is typically a 1 mL syringe tip 2.\nAllow the silk films to dry uncovered on a clean bench running an air flow pressure of 150 Pa for a period of 90 min or until films are dry.",
    "Once films are dry place entire set of films, including PDMS molds, into a water-annealing chamber for >4 hrs to produce a water insoluble film. This is typically an empty desiccator chamber with water in the bottom of the basin pulled at a 25 kPa vacuum 15 .\nRemove silk films from water-annealing chamber and place onto a clean bench.\nPrepare a 70% EtOH bath within a 35 mm Petri dish, and place control substrates (i.e. glass or plastic surfaces) and stainless steel rings within wells for at least 10 min to sterilize.\nRemove silk films from PDMS molds using forceps, dip them into 70% EtOH, and place sample into 24-well plate prefilled with 1 mL of 70% EtOH making sure patterned side is facing up to allow for cell adhesion.\nAfter placing each silk film sample into a corresponding well place stainless steel ring weights (11.65 mm inner diameter, 15.45 mm outer diameter, and 1.18 mm thickness) on top.\nAllow samples with rings to incubate for 10 minutes to ensure sterility.\nRemove EtOH and wash each sample 3x with 1 mL of PBS. Let each wash sit for 5 min to allow for complete diffusion.\nRemove PBS using aspirating glass pipette, while making sure to remove majority of bubbles beneath silk film samples.\nPrepare cell line for seeding. As an example, trypsinize human corneal-limbal epithelial (HCLE) cell line with 0.25% trypsin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution for 7-min. Deactivate trypsin using 1:1 volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) passage media with 10% FBS added. Centrifuge trypsinized HCLE cells, add 8-mL of keratinocyte-serum free media (K-SFM) to cell pellet, gently agitate to disperse HCLEs, and generate cell count.\nSample 500 μL of HCLE suspension per well typically using a 10,000 cells/cm2 density.",
    "Place cultures within incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and run desired experimental protocol.\n4. Representative Results\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3646/3646fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
