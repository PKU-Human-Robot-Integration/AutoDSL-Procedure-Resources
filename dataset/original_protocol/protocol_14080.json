    "Supplies and reagents listed below are for the determination of the whole kidney nephron number in one mouse, that is, two kidneys. Modifications for the use of the acid maceration method for rat are identified with asterisks. All experimental protocols conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Mississippi Medical Center.\n1. Kidney Isolation Procedure\nWeigh the mouse (or other species) and euthanize it with an isoflurane (5% - 8%) overdose or pentobarbital (150 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection).\nOnce the mouse is euthanized, open its abdominal cavity using fine surgical scissors along the midline.\nCarefully lift the intestines and reproductive adipose to the right side of the abdominal cavity. By gross dissection, isolate the left kidney. Using fine surgical scissors, cut the left renal artery and vein and carefully remove the left kidney, placing the kidney into an appropriately labeled (mouse number/identifier) weigh boat containing phosphor-buffered saline (PBS).\nRepeat the procedure for the right kidney.\nRemove each kidney from its respective weigh boat and place it onto a surgical gauze pre-moistened with PBS.\nLeaving the kidney on the surgical gauze, quickly remove any adherent non-renal tissue (such as perirenal adipose or adrenal gland) followed by the removal of the renal capsule. Weigh each kidney individually, recording the weight of the left and right kidney separately in a laboratory notebook.\n2. Homogenization, Incubation, and Straining Procedures\nOnce each kidney is weighed, drain each weigh boat of PBS and place the kidneys back into the appropriately labeled weigh boat. Using a clean razor blade, cut the kidney in half, lengthwise. Place each kidney half facing down and cut each half into 2-mm or smaller pieces.",
    "Using the same razorblade, carefully collect and place the chopped kidney pieces into a labeled 15-mL conical tube (mouse number/identifier; left versus right kidney).\nRepeat the procedure for the opposite kidney, using a new razor blade. Place the chopped kidney into a separately labeled 15-mL conical tube.\nIn a well-ventilated fume hood, add 5 mL of 6 M hydrochloric (HCl) acid to each 15-mL conical tube.\nReplace the cap to the conical tube, gently agitate the kidney/HCl mixture, and place the 15-mL conical tube into a preheated water bath set at 37 °C for 90 min (*120 min for rat kidneys).\nBriefly agitate each 15-mL tube every 15 min during the incubation in order to ensure that all tissue is exposed to HCl acid.\nInsert an 18-G needle into a 5-mL syringe (*10-mL syringe for rat) and carefully remove the syringe plunger. Place the syringe in a 50-mL conical tube (tube #1) in a fume hood.\nRemove the kidney/HCl solution from the water bath and pour the tissue solution into the open end of the syringe and set the 15-mL conical tube aside in a test tube rack. Carefully replace the plunger and slowly push the plunger so as to extrude the solution through the needle and into tube #1.\nWash the 15-mL conical tube with 5 mL of PBS solution. Swirl the PBS in the 15-mL conical tube so as to solubilize any remaining kidney tissue.\nAgain, carefully remove the plunger from the 5-mL syringe containing the 18-G needle and pour the contents from the 15-mL conical tube into the open end of the syringe. Carefully replace the plunger and flush the syringe by gently pushing down on the plunger, into tube #1. Repeat this process 2x (performed 3x in total).",
    "Insert a 21-G needle into a new 5-mL syringe (*10-mL syringe for rat) and carefully remove the syringe plunger. Place the syringe with the 21-G needle attached into a new 50-mL conical tube (tube #2).\nPour the contents from tube #1 into the open end of the syringe containing the 21-G needle. Carefully insert the plunger and flush the syringe by gently pushing down on the syringe plunger and placing the extruded solution into tube #2.\nWash tube #1 with 5 mL of PBS solution. Swirl the PBS in tube #1 so as to solubilize any remaining kidney tissue.\nAgain, carefully remove the plunger from the 5-mL syringe containing the 18-G needle and pour the contents from tube #1 into the open end of the syringe. Carefully replace the plunger and flush the syringe by gently pushing down on the plunger, extruding solution into tube #2. Repeat this process 2x (performed 3x in total).\nBring the total volume of tube #2 up to 50 mL by adding additional PBS, up to the 50-mL line on tube #2.\nIncubate tube #2 containing the kidney tissue solution in a tube rack on a rocker plate in a refrigerator set at 4 °C overnight (minimum 8 - 10 h).\n3. Counting of Glomeruli and Extrapolation of the Nephron Number\nRemove tube #2 from the refrigerator and resuspend the pelleted tissue by gently inverting the tube several times in order to create a homogenous solution. We recommend counting glomeruli within 5 d after processing.\nCarefully aliquot 500 µL of the kidney solution into a single well of a 12-well plate. Repeat this 2x, placing each aliquot into a separate well so that there are three wells of kidney solution per kidney, for analysis in triplicate.",
    "Add 500 µL of PBS to each of the three wells containing the kidney solution, for a 1:1 dilution.\nUsing an inverted microscope, count the number of glomeruli per well. Counting is aided by using a grid of 16 separate sections placed on the bottom of each well. Count the number of glomeruli per each gridded section and then sum the count per grid to get the total number of glomeruli per well. Glomeruli are readily identifiable by their spherical structure. Additional identifiers included a reddish hue due to blood-filled capillaries, as well as pre- or post-arterioles that remain attached to the body of individual glomeruli (Figure 1).\nAdd the total number of glomeruli counted per each of the three wells and then divide them by three for the average number of glomeruli per 500 µL of kidney solution. If the variance in the average number of glomeruli per well is greater than 10%, repeat the nephron-counting procedure, paying close attention to the homogeneous nature of the kidney solution. Multiply the number of glomeruli counted per well times 100 for the average number of glomeruli per kidney. Total nephron number can be expressed per kidney or, using kidney weight, per mg or g of tissue.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
