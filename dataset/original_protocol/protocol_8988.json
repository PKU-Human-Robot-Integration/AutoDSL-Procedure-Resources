    "1. Preparing Rat Astrocyte Culture for Conditioned Media and Astrocyte-neuron Cocultures.\nPrepare dissection buffer (BSS, see Table 1 for recipe) and store at 4 °C until ready for use.\nAnesthetize neonatal rat pups (P0-P2) with isoflurane in a 500 ml beaker.\nWhen pups are immobile, spray with 70% ethanol and decapitate.\nRemove the brain.\n\t\nHold the head firmly with a pair of Dumont #5 forceps, and use fine scissors to make a midline incision through the skin and skull.\nExpose the brain by reflecting the skull to the sides, and remove the brain into a dish containing cold BSS.\nSeparate the cerebral hemispheres from the diencephalon and the brain stem under a dissecting scope. Carefully remove all meninges by stabilizing the tissue with one pair of forceps and gently pulling away the meninges with another pair of forceps.\nCollect all hemispheres in one 60 mm dish. Using small scissors, mince tissue as finely as possible. Then transfer the minced tissue to a 50 ml conical tube.\nAdd 1.5 ml of 1% DNase I and 1.5 ml of 2.5% trypsin and 12 ml of BSS (total volume of 15ml) to brains. Incubate in a shaking water bath for 15 min at 37 °C. To ensure good mixing, tube is swirled by hand every 5 min.\nTransfer supernatant through a 70 μm cell strainer over a new 50 ml conical tube. Add 3 ml FBS to this supernatant.\nTo the remaining pieces, add 13.5 ml of BSS and 1.5 ml 2.5% trypsin and incubate in the shaking waterbath for another 15 min.\nTransfer the remaining supernatant through the cell strainer and combine with the supernatant from Step 1.8.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 RPM for 5 min to pellet the cells.",
    "Resuspend pellets in 5 ml of glial media. Supernatant can be centrifuged again to pellet the remaining cells.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer.\nPlate cells at a density of 1 x 107 per 150 cm2 flask.\nChange media to fresh glial media the day after plating. Afterwards, feed cells twice a week with glial media.\nWhen cells have reached >80% confluency (approximately 10 days after plating), freeze cells down in 90% horse serum and 10% DMSO and keep stocks in liquid nitrogen. Cells are frozen at 2 x 106 per vial. Approximately 5 vials can be frozen from each flask.\nAbout 10-14 days before setting up the hippocampal culture, glial cells are plated from the frozen stocks. We usually plate five 6-well plates, which is enough to support the growth of 90 coverslips of hippocampal neurons (three 15 mm round coverslips per well). We also plate an additional eight to ten 60 mm dishes of glial cells, which is used for conditioning N2.1 media for transfection. The day before neuronal culture, cells should be fed with NB27 media. The astrocytes should ideally be >90% confluent at this point. We find that freezing greatly reduces the number of microglia in the astroglial cultures. Since increased neurotoxicity is observed when microglia is present in the astroglial cultures, we always use astroglial culture prepared from frozen stocks for coculture with neurons.\n2. Neuronal Culture\nClean glass coverslips by first rinsing in milliQ water 2x. They are then soaked in concentrated nitric acid for 24 hr, and rinsed with milliQ water for at least five times over a total of 2 hr. Coverslips are dried and sterilized by baking in an oven at 225 °C for 6 hr.",
    "Transfer coverslips to 60 mm dishes after sterilization. Place four dots of sterile paraffin near the outer edge of each coverslip to keep neurons separate from glial cells during coculture.\nCoat coverslips with 1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine in 0.1 M borate buffer overnight in 37 °C incubator.\nThe next day, rinse coverslips twice in sterile milliQ water for at least 15 min each. They are then incubated overnight in plating media in 37 °C incubator.\nEuthanize pregnant rat (E18) by isoflurane anesthesia followed by pneumothorax, and euthanize embryonic rats by decapitation. Remove brains and dissect out the cerebral hemispheres as described above.\nDissect out the hippocampi from the cerebral hemisphere. Place all hippocampi into a 15 ml conical tube, and digest with 0.25% trypsin (0.5 ml 2.5% Trypsin, 4.5 ml BSS) at 37 ℃ for 15 min.\nDigested hippocampi are rinsed in BSS 3x for 5 min each. They are then triturated with a glass Pasteur pipette, and the cell density is determined by using a hemocytometer. Neurons are then seeded at a density of 2 x 105 cells per 60 mm dish.\nAbout 2-4 hr after plating, transfer coverslips with attached neurons to the dishes containing astroglial cells, with neurons facing down towards the glia. At DIV3, add cytosine arabinoside to the cells at a final concentration of 5 μM to stop glia proliferation.\n3. Calcium Transfection\nCondition N2.1 media on glia the day before transfection.\nOn the day of the transfection, take conditioned N2.1 media off of glia and transfer into a new dish. Transfer coverslips with neurons into the conditioned N2.1 media. Let equilibrate in incubator for 10-30 min.",
    "To one set of sterile tubes, combine 1-4 μg of DNA, 12.5 μl of 2 M CaCl2, and sterile H2O for a total volume of 100 μl. To a second set of tubes, add 100 μl of 2x HBS.\nAdd ⅛ volume of 2x HBS (12.5 μl) at a time to the tube containing the CaCl2/DNA mixture, vortexing for a few seconds each time. Allow the tubes to sit for 15 min.\nAfter 15 min incubation, add the transfection mixture dropwise to the cells. Incubate for 1-1.5 hr. A layer of sand-like precipitates should be visible under the microscope using a 10X objective.\nAfter incubation, rinse coverslips twice with warm HBS wash buffer.\nReturn coverslips to original dishes with glia, add kynurenic acid to a final concentration of 0.5 mM.\nTransfected neurons can be imaged live or processed for immunocytochemistry as early as the next day. Neurons can survive up to three weeks after transfection.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
