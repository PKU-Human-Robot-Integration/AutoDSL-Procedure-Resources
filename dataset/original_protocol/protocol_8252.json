    "All animal experiments were approved by the local authorities and conducted according to the German animal welfare act (84-02.05.20.13.097).\n1. General Remarks on Animal Experiments\nPerform all mouse experiments in accordance with the guidelines of the respective institutional animal care and use committee.\nKeep mice under standardized conditions and according to international guidelines such as the Federation for Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).\nNOTE: In general this isolation technique can be used for mice independent of age, gender or genetic background. To obtain a sufficient cell number, 4–10 week old males are preferred, because biological properties can vary with age and gender.\n2. Preparation of Solutions, Media and Coating\nPrepare digestion solution (DS) by mixing 2.2 mL of Dulbecco´s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 200 μL Collagenase-Dispase and 45 μL Desoxyribonuclease (DNase).\nPrepare 500 mL of Endothelial cell medium (ECM) by mixing 450 mL of DMEM with 50 mL FCS (approximately 10%), 0.25 mL basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF (20 μg/mL; approximately 0.05%) and 5 mL penicillin-streptomycin (approximately 1%). Perform sterile filtration in a glass tube (diameter of filter pores: 0.2 μm). Afterwards store the solution at 4 °C.\nCoat cell culture plates as described below.\nFor cultivation of freshly isolated primary murine MEC cover the whole surface with 1 mL per well of a 6 well cell culture plate with a gelatin based speed coating solution (see Table of Materials) according to manufacturer’s instructions for 3–5 min at room temperature (RT).\nAspirate and discard coating solution. Rinse each well with 2 mL sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.1–7.5 in two consecutive washing steps.\nAspirate and discard PBS. Fill up wells with 1 mL volume of ECM.\n3. Isolation of Primary Murine Muscle Microvascular Endothelial Cells (MMEC)",
    "Euthanize one adult 4–12 weeks old, male mouse by cervical dislocation without any anaesthesia. The aim is to quickly separate the spinal cord from the brain so as to provide the animal with a fast and painless death.\nSever the extremities.\nUse a surgical sharp/blunt (cutting edge 42 mm, straight) and sharp/sharp (cutting edge 23 mm, straight) scissor, a straight (serrated, 2 mm x 1.25 mm x 12 cm) and a curved (serrated, 1.3 mm x 1 mm x 13 cm) forceps.\nDisinfect all surgical instruments with 70% ethanol.\nPosition the animal on its back, moisten the legs with 70% ethanol. Sever the whole leg by cutting at the hip joint with the sharp/blunt surgical scissor. Place the extremities in a closed cell culture dish (35 mm x 10 mm).\nNOTE: From now on perform every step under a sterile laminar flow hood and work with sterilized instruments.\nIsolate muscle tissue (preferentially use the musculus quadriceps femoris or musculus triceps surae from both legs).\nCut the skin open from the hip to the toe-tip by using a sharp/sharp scissor and curved forceps. Hold the toe or footpad with the straight forceps. Peel off the skin with the curved forceps from the toe to the hip.\nIsolate the musculus quadriceps femoris by cutting the tendon from the knee and sever the muscle along the femur to the hip. Isolate the musculus triceps surae by severing the Achilles tendon. Hereafter, cut along the tibia to the popliteal fossa and remove the muscle.\nNOTE: If large vessels (A. femoralis, A. tibialis anterior, A. tibialis posterior, A. fibularis) are visible in the isolated muscles, remove vessels to avoid contamination by macrovascular endothelium.",
    "To remove large vessels, hold the part of muscle not containing large vessels with a curved forceps and cut it off next to the vessel. For this protocol, 1 g or less muscle tissue equal to both quadriceps femoris and triceps surae is recommended.\nAdd 2,445 µL DS (from step 2.1) to a cell culture dish (35 mm x 10 mm) and determine the weight.\nTransfer all muscle pieces to this cell culture dish containing the 2445 µL DS and determine the weight. The difference of both measured values provides the dry weight of muscle tissue which must not exceed 1 g.\nCut the whole muscle tissue into small pieces (≤2 mm cubes, about 100 pieces) by using the sharp/sharp scissor.\nDissociate the muscle tissue.\n\tNOTE: This step takes about 120 min.\n\t\nStore muscle/DS suspension at 37 °C (incubator with 5% CO2) for 1.5 h. Mix the suspension carefully every 20 min for about 5 min using a 1 mL insulin syringe.\nTransfer suspension to a 70 μm nylon cell strainer placed on a 50 mL tube and collect the flow through. Wash the cell strainer with 8 mL of DMEM and collect the flow through.\nDiscard cell strainer and centrifuge suspension for 10 min at 300 x g at 20 °C. Carefully remove supernatant.\nCAUTION: pellet is easy to lose.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of an Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK) lysing buffer (see enclosed Table of Materials) for the lysis of red blood cells and incubate for 30 s at RT. Add 9 mL DMEM + 10% FCS to stop the reaction and transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nDeplete CD45+ cells following the CD45 microbeads manufacturer’s instructions. For all following steps of CD45+ depletion use MCS buffer (see enclosed Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: This step takes about 60 min.\n\t\nDetermine cell numbers using a Neubauer cell counting chamber (expect about 5 x 106 cells per g muscle tissue).\nCentrifuge suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Take off supernatant completely and resuspend cell pellet in 90 µL MCS buffer (per 107 cells or less). Add 10 μL of CD45 microbeads (per 107 cells or less).\nMix cell suspension and incubate for 15 min in the fridge at 4–8 °C.\nAdd 1mL MCS buffer (per 107 cells or less). Centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant completely and resuspend cells in 500 μL MCS buffer.\nFor magnetic cell separation use a large magnetic column (LMC) with a reservoir volume of 8 mL and a capacity of up to 2 x 109 total cells. Position the LMC in the magnetic field of the separator.\nRinse with 3 mL of MCS buffer into the reservoir of the LMC. After rinsing, place a 15 mL conical tube below the column to collect flow through. Apply the whole cell suspension (500 µL) onto the column and let it completely flow through.\nWash the column three times by adding 3 mL of MCS buffer into the reservoir and wait until the column´s reservoir is empty before performing the next washing step.\nCollect the unlabeled cells passing the column use for further separation steps (representing the CD45- fraction). Labeled cells (representing the CD45+ fraction) accumulated in the column can be discarded.\nAccumulate CD31+ cells following CD31 microbeads manufacturer’s instructions. For all following steps of CD31+ accumulation use MCS buffer.\n\tNOTE: This step takes about 60 min.\n\t\nDetermine cell number using a Neubauer cell counting chamber (expect about 4 x 106 cells per g muscle tissue).",
    "Centrifuge obtained unlabeled cell suspension from step 3.5 for 10 min at 300 x g at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant completely.

Rinse the MMC with 500 µL of MCS buffer. After rinsing, place a 15 mL conical tube below the column to collect flow through.\nApply the whole cell suspension (500 µL) onto the column and let it completely flow through.\nWash the column three times by adding 500 µL of MCS buffer and wait until the column’s reservoir is empty before performing the next washing step. Unlabeled cells passing the column represent the CD45- CD31- fraction. Store them for further quality controls.\nRemove column from the separator and place it on a suitable collection tube (15 mL tube). Pipette 2 mL MCS buffer onto the column. Immediately flush out the magnetically labeled cells by firmly pushing the plunger into the column. This CD45- CD31+ fraction represents the enriched primary murine EC.",
    "Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 350 x g at 20 °C. Remove supernatant completely and resuspend cells (expect around 0.6 x 106 cells per g muscle tissue) in 1 mL ECM (see step 2.2.). Transfer cells (0.5–0.7 x 106 cells) to a single well of a coated 6-well culture plate (from step 2.3) containing 1 mL of ECM.\nFor cultivation, incubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a sterile incubator.
