    "1. Equipment setup\nNOTE: The methods described here use a plunge freezing instrument with a single blotting arm. Some instruments are equipped with two blotting arms and we advise the user to check manufacturers' instructions to adjust the instrument so only one blotting arm is in use.\nEnsure that a light microscope is positioned near to the plunge freezing instrument, ideally so that both the microscope and plunge freezer are in easy reach of the user.\nSet up and cool the automated plunge freezer according to the manufacturers' instructions.\n\tNOTE: The sample chamber temperature should be set to the temperature at which the crystals were grown. Do not place blotting paper in the sample chamber.\n\tCAUTION: Liquid ethane is a highly flammable explosive and must only be used in a well-ventilated area away from potential spark sources.\nLabel grid boxes appropriately and cool them in a small dewar using liquid nitrogen.\nCarefully place grids, carbon film side up, on an appropriate carrier for glow discharging (such as a glass microscope slide wrapped in parafilm).\nGlow discharge cryoTEM grids for 25 s at 0.39 mBar, using a current of 15 mA. Glow discharge just before the grids will be used. Keep the glow discharged grids in a covered Petri dish until ready; if 30 min lapses after glow discharge, repeat the glow discharging.\n\t​NOTE: With the plunge freezer ready and grids prepared, attention can turn to the sample.\n2. Determining initial blotting parameters\nSet the relative humidity of the sample chamber to 90% and the blotting time to 5 s and ensure that the plunge freezer is set to automatically plunge the sample after blotting is complete.",
    "NOTE: These starting parameters are most suitable for the Leica GP plunge freezer, other parameters such as blotting force are available on the FEI Vitrobot. However, in our experience crystal integrity is more likely to be maintained by the use of a single blotting arm.\nTo be able to seal the crystallization tray once the well of interest is opened, cut a small strip of tape and fold over one end to create a tab to ease opening of the seal and carefully place to one side.\nCut open the seal over the crystallization well, including the reservoir. Working quickly, apply 2-5 µL of reservoir solution to the crystal containing drop to maintain liquid volume in the drop.\nUse the tab of tape to then reseal the well and ensure that the crystallization drop does not dry out.\nWhile momentarily holding open the tape over the crystallization well, transfer 10 µL of the reservoir solution to a 0.5 mL tube to use for later steps.\nReseal the well.\nPlace a piece of pre-cut blotting paper on the blotting arm of the plunge freezing instrument.\nPlace a single glow discharged grid in the plunge freezing forceps and load into the instrument such that the carbon side faces away from the blotting arm.\nEnsure that the relative humidity within the blotting chamber is at 90%.\nRotate the forceps so the carbon-film side faces the blotting arm.\nUsing a 2.5 µL pipette, apply 2 µL of reservoir solution from the 0.5 mL tube to the non-support (shiny copper) side of the cryoTEM grid.",
    "Rotate the grid so that the carbon support side is facing away from the blotting arm and repeat the process, carefully applying the liquid to the carbon-film support side of the grid. Avoid touching the carbon-film with the pipette tip so as to not damage the carbon-film. The liquid should spread across the grid due to the charge deposited during glow discharging.\nInitiate the blotting process while observing the grid. A viewing scope is available on the Leica GP2 for this purpose.\nObserve whether the liquid is drawn from the carbon surface of the grid during this time, this starts with the majority of the liquid bolus on the grid flattening out as the liquid is wicked through the grid. As the liquid in each grid square is reduced further, a wave of 'popping' across the surface of the grid can be observed. If this effect is observed, blotting can be stopped within 2-3 s of the popping effect ending. It is not necessary to plunge the test grid which can be discarded.\nIf the so-called 'popping' effect is not observed, repeat steps 2.11-2.14, each time extending the blotting time by 1-2 s until the popping effect is observed just before the blotting arm retracts from the grid. Note this time for step 3.\n\t​NOTE: It is important that blotting stops as soon as this popping effect has occurred to ensure that during the process, crystals do not become dehydrated from over-blotting. Use the crystallization solution from the reservoir for back blotting and dilution of the sample, as it ensures that the crystals are subject to a consistent solution, reducing the risk of destabilizing the crystals.\n3. Harvesting crystals\nPlace the crystallization plate under the light microscope and position the target well within the field of view.",
    "Place a fresh, glow discharged grid in the plunge freezer forceps and mount the forceps in the plunge freezer, with the carbon-film side facing away from the blotting arm.\nRotate the forceps so the carbon-film side faces the blotting arm.\nUsing a 2.5 µL pipette, apply 2 µL of reservoir solution from the 0.5 mL tube to the non-support side of the cryoTEM grid and rotate the grid so that the carbon-film support side is facing the sample port of the plunge freezer.\nPeel back the temporary seal and with the pipette set to 2 µL, gently aspirate the crystallization drop repeatedly to suspend the microcrystals (it is important to not introduce air bubbles to the drop).\n\tNOTE: It is critical to observe this process under the light microscope to ensure that crystals are released from any surface skin or the base of the well. If the crystals are stuck and not drawn up with aspiration, either the pipette tip or other crystallization tools such as an acupuncture needle, can be used to gently dislodge the crystals. Depending on the size of the crystals and the depth of field of the light microscope, it is sometimes possible to view, using the microscope, the crystals entering the pipette tip.\nTransfer 2 µL of the aspirated microcrystal slurry to the plunge freezer and apply all the sample to the carbon side of cryoTEM grid.\nBlot for the time determined in step 2 and immediately initiate plunge-freezing. While blotting, observe for the occurrence of a popping wave effect across the grid and note whether this occurred completely across the grid. The presence of crystals can affect the initial blotting time, and this may need to be adjusted for subsequent grids by 1-2 s.",
    "Working quickly, transfer the grid from the liquid ethane to the grid box immersed in liquid nitrogen. Residual ethane can turn to an opaque white solid on the grid when it enters liquid nitrogen. To reduce this, remove the grid steadily from the liquid ethane, then quickly transfer to the liquid nitrogen reservoir.\nOnce 4 grids have been placed in the grid box, secure the lid of the box with the screw and transfer it either to a foam dewar of liquid nitrogen to allow for further sample assessment with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or to a liquid nitrogen storage dewar using an appropriate storage container.\n4. Sample density assessment by light microscopy\nCAUTION: This method is destructive. If there is limited availability of sample, such as only one or two crystallization droplets, it is recommended that this step is skipped. After plunge freezing samples (step 3.7) the distribution of crystals across the grid can be assessed.\nMount a dry, room temperature cryoTEM grid in the plunge-freezer forceps and place the forceps on their side on the light microscope, with the grid in the field of view. Set an appropriate magnification and focus so that the whole grid and individual grid squares can be resolved.\nFollow steps 3.1-3.7.\nInstead of transferring the grid to the grid box (step 3.8), retract the plunged grid from the liquid ethane by resetting the plunge-freezer.\n\tCAUTION: The grid and sample will warm to room temperature and cannot be used for further diffraction experiments.\nRemove the forceps from the plunge freezing instrument.\nWhilst holding the grid within the forceps, place the grid under the light microscope - the focus will already be roughly set.",
    "Perform a fine focus and assess the density of the crystals across the grid. A good grid will contain several isolated crystals away from the grid bars within each grid square and clumping of crystals is minimal.\nWhere the density of crystals within the grid results in clumping of crystals with only a few isolated crystals, further dilute the crystal slurry with reservoir solution and repeat step 3. Take care when diluting samples so that the dilution does not result in the dissolution of the crystals.\nDilute the crystals in steps using small volumes of 0.5-1 µL.\n5. Sample assessment by scanning electron microscopy\nNOTE: Microcrystal preparation on cryoTEM grids is best assessed with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) under cryogenic conditions, this can be achieved with an SEM fitted with a cryo-stage. At VMXm, a JEOL JSM-IT100 SEM (tungsten source) with a Quorum PP3006 airlock and cryostage are utilized. To ensure minimal radiation damage when viewing samples on VMXm28,29, the following settings are used: 5 kV accelerating voltage; a spot size of 40 (arbitrary units on the JEOL JSM-IT100); 10 mm working distance. Images are recorded using the secondary electron detector, for sample alignment and focusing a dwell time of 0.8 µs is used while high-resolution images of single crystals are captured using a dwell time of 16 µs. It is important before loading a sample into the SEM that the microscope is aligned as per manufacturer instructions. It is advised that only a single grid is loaded into the SEM while any remaining grids prepared with the same parameters are reserved for X-ray diffraction experiments.\nPrepare the SEM by cooling the sample cryo-stage to -180 °C as per manufacturer's instruction. Follow the instructions for loading cryoTEM grids into the specific system available.",
    "With the sample loaded in the SEM, turn on the electron beam, align sample and set focus using a high magnification (0.8 µs dwell time).\nFirst, perform the initial assessment with the whole of the grid in view at low magnification (x45). Record an image at this magnification.\nIncrease the magnification to allow closer inspection of individual grid squares, individual crystals should be very clearly observable.\nMove around the grid, capturing still images (16 µs dwell time) of crystals ensuring they meet the following requirements before proceeding:\n\t\nEnsure that grids are flat, and the carbon support film is largely intact.\nEnsure that there are numerous single crystals with a narrow halo of vitrified liquid surrounding the crystal.\nEnsure that the holes in the carbon support film are visible.\nEnsure that there are no large regions of vitrified liquid as defined by a dark and smooth appearance.\nEnsure that there is little or no hexagonal ice, or surface ice scattered across the grid.\nEnsure that crystals are evenly distributed across the support film and are not overlapping.\nAt this point, accurately measure the dimensions of a number of crystals to allow for an accurate X-ray beam size correlation during later diffraction experiments.\nSamples that can be reliably retrieved from the SEM and maintained at cryogenic temperatures can be later used for X-ray diffraction experiments. If this is not possible, dispose of these samples.",
    "​NOTE: While imaging both the whole grid and individual microcrystals (approximately x45 and x700 magnification respectively), an assessment should be made on whether to proceed to the beamline with grids prepared using the same parameters or whether some parameters may need adjusting during step 3. The grids should meet the tests described in step 5.5. If the grids do not meet these criteria, further optimization during step 3 is required before repeating step 5.\n6. Preparing grid for diffraction experiments at VMXm\nCool the required number of VMXm sample holders (Figure 4A) (up to 5) loaded into the sample cartridge (with lid) with the sample loader in a large foam dewar (Figure 4B) using liquid nitrogen - this can require a large volume of liquid nitrogen. The liquid nitrogen level should be just above the sample position on the sample loader.\nPrepare circlips and tools.\nPlace tools including clipping tool, forceps and VMXm sample forceps, into holes in the sample loader to cool. It can be useful to arrange a spotlight above the dewar.\nSwiftly transfer the grid box containing the microcrystal loaded grids to the grid box recess on the sample loader and unscrew the lid such that it is loose and rotatable (do not remove).\nUnder liquid nitrogen remove the lid from the sample cartridge with large forceps and place it underneath the sample loader.\nUse the VMXm sample forceps to lift the sample holder onto the sample loader, ensuring that the holder is facing upwards so that it can accept a grid. When in the correct position, a small pin on the sample loader will engage with the small hole in the middle of the sample holder.",
    "With the cooled fine forceps, carefully lift the grid from the grid box and transfer close to the grid opening on the sample holder. Rotate the grid so that it lays flat (it does not matter which way the support film side is facing).\nGently lower the forceps so that the grid is as close as possible above the grid opening (be careful to not bend the grid) and release the grid into the opening. If the grid does not seat properly, carefully use the fine forceps to nudge the grid into position or gently tap the sample holder with the larger forceps.\nSwiftly place the pre-cooled circlip tool over the grid in the grid opening and seat the circlip by pressing the button. It can be helpful to apply 2 depressions of the button to ensure the circlip is properly seated.\nTop up the liquid nitrogen so the level is ~1.5 cm above the sample holder. Using the VMXm sample forceps, carefully lift the loaded sample holder up and over the small pin on the sample loader and back into the sample cartridge. Note the position number of the sample holder in the sample cartridge.\nContinue to load grids into the sample holders until all samples are loaded.\nReturn the grid boxes to the storage dewar if samples remain inside and remove the sample loader from the dewar to create more space.\nReplace the cartridge lid on the cartridge, ensuring that the pin on the top of the cartridge engages with the hole in the lid.\nCool and fill the VMXm airlock dewar with liquid nitrogen and place next to the foam dewar containing the loaded sample cartridge.",
    "Using the VMXm cartridge tool, carefully engage the tool in the ridges on the side of the cartridge and swiftly lift the cartridge into the airlock dewar.\nEnsure that the liquid nitrogen level covers the cartridge.\nPlace lid on the airlock dewar and proceed to the VMXm endstation with the loaded sample cartridge.\n\tNOTE: Loading of the sample cartridge into the VMXm endstation will be performed by beamline staff."
