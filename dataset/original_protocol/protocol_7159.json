    "This procedure describes plasmid construction, strain engineering, and gain-of-function analysis of cgRNA-DNA repair in yeast. The purpose of this method is to confer random gain-of-function mutagenesis in an artificially engineered STOP codon on the cgRNA delivery plasmid (pEDJ508) into a dysfunctional ectopic his3 cassette in the pEDJ506 integration plasmid (PGK1pro-HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5-ADH1t). Strains must be RNase H knock-out mutants for the system to function. Successful CRAIDE mutants are functionally screened on selective dropout plates following system induction (Figure 1).CRAIDE target sequence and plasmid designThe pEDJ506 plasmid contains an integration cassette for chromosome XII with PGK1pro-HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5-ADH1t in reverse orientation. Here, the native HIS3 sequence is disrupted by a 29 bp deletion and an insertion of 23 bases comprising the gRNA seed sequence and protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5 sequence is given below, with Δ29 depicted in orange, PAM in blue, the gRNA seed sequence in bold, and the start codon (ATG) in green:CTACATAAGAACACCTTTGGTGGAGGGAACATCGTTGGTACCATTGGGCGAGGTGGCTTCTCTTATGGCAACCGCAAGAGCCTTGAACGCACTCTCACTACGGTGATGATCATTCTTGCCTCGCAGACAATCAACGTGGAGGGTAATTCTGCTAGCCTCTGCAAAGCTTTCAAGAAAATGCGGGATCATCTCGCAAGAGAGATCTCCTACTTTCTCCCTTTGCAAACCAAGTTCGACAACTGCGTACGGCCTGTTCGAAAGATCTACCACCGCTCTGGAAAGTGCCTCATCCAAAGGCGCAAATCCTGATCCAAACCTTTTTACTCCACGCACGGCCCCTAGGGCCTCTTTAAAAGCTTGACCGAGAGCAATCCCGCAGTCTTCAGTGGTGTGATGGTCGTCTATGTGTAAGTCACCAATGCACTC-∆29-CCGTCGAGGAATTTTTACTAACACCAGAGCATGTATCATATGGTCCAGAAACCCTATACCTGTGTGGACGTTAATCACTTGCGATTGTGTGGCCTGTTCTGCTACTGCTTCTGCCTCTTTTTCTGGGAAGATCGAGTGCTCTATCGCTAGGGGACCACCCTTTAAAGAGATCGCAATCTGAATCTTGGTTTCATTTGTAATACGCTTTACTAGGGCTTTCTGCTCTGT CAT The pEDJ508 plasmid is engineered to express his3 with an engineered STOP-codon (inside the Δ29 missing from pEDJ506) and a frame-shifting artificial intron (AI). This his3 sequence is fused to a gRNA to make a chimeric gRNA (cgRNA) for targeting the HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5 sequence from pEDJ506 in the genome. The error-prone T7 RNA polymerase transcribes the cgRNA from which the AI is spliced out, to give the complete open reading frame of his3, still maintaining the STOP-codon, including Δ29 missing from pEDJ506, and yet excluding the 23 bp insertion in that plasmid (this removal also terminates Cas9 targeting in HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5). The STOP-codon is subject to random mutagenesis introduced with error-prone T7 RNA polymerase, to create permissive mutations that can be introduced into HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5 from cgRNA-DNA double-strand break repair.",
    "The full expression cassette in pEDJ508 is given below, with all components depicted: insulator (ADH1 terminator—grey), T7 promoter (pink), STOP-codon (red), AI (yellow), gRNA seed sequence (bold), gRNA structural sequence (purple), and the T7 terminator (cyan). The start codon (ATG) is omitted in this design.Note: Any portion of a target gene/sequence can be selected for mutagenesis, but homology arms should be as long as possible and at least 200 bp on either side of the Cas9 binding site matching the cgRNA seed sequence. The homologous sequence must contain a mutation that disrupts Cas9 targeting to protect the plasmid, and later to protect the engineered target gene/sequence. With pEDJ508, 29 bp are reintroduced into the target sequence, within which a STOP-codon has been artificially engineered. This design ensures that only evolving cgRNA can be used for templating homology-directed repair of the targeted gene and restoring its function (HIS3).

CRAIDE flow chart referring to main text illustrating B. Baseline strain design, C. Transformation of CRAIDE plasmids, and D. System induction and gain-of-function. Individual steps 1-5 are shown for panel B, and resulting strains are shown in parentheses in panels B and C. Plasmid expression cassettes are described for each plasmid in panel C with T7RNAP* referring to the T7RNAP(F11L;T613A) variant. Plasmids pEDJ333 and pMLB10 are inducible with galactose, and pEDJ508 is transcribed by T7RNAP(F11L;T613A) for introducing random mutations into the resulting cgRNA_HIS3_stop transcript. cgRNA_HIS3_stop does not translate into a functional protein, and mutagenesis of the built-in stop-codon is necessary to functionally repair the Cas9-targeted HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5 expression cassette residing in the genome of Sc138.",
    "Panel D highlights relevant conditions in liquid cultures (indicated with vials) for inducing CRAIDE and for plate-based scoring of HIS3 gain-of-function mutants after a 48 h induction in strains expressing cgRNA_HIS3_stop (Sc146) or an empty control plasmid (Sc147).Baseline strain designCas9 transformation for strain engineering Strains are overviewed in Table 3. First, a single colony of catalog strain CEN.PK2-1C is grown overnight in 0.5 mL of YPD in a 14 mL culture tube at 250 rpm and 30°C, and diluted 10-fold in fresh YPD the next morning. After 4 h of incubation under the same conditions, 100 μL of the culture is transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and pelleted at 13,000 × g for 30 s by centrifugation at room temperature. The supernatant is discarded by pipetting. To the cell pellet, add 1 μg of a centromeric plasmid constitutively expressing Cas9 with LEU2 as its marker (pEDJ391), 10 μL of ssDNA (boiled for 5 min), 36 μL of lithium acetate (1 M), 74 μL of MilliQ water minus the volume of added plasmid, and 240 μL PEG 3350 (50%). Resuspend the pellet in the transformation mix by pipetting up and down and then vortex it for a few seconds until a homogenous suspension occurs. Incubate the transformation mix at 42°C for 40 min and then centrifuge it at 13,000 × g for 30 s before removing the supernatant by pipetting. Resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of MilliQ water and plate it with glass beads on synthetic complete dropout medium without L-leucine (SC-L). Dry the plate with the lid off in a safety cabinet, before incubating it for 2 days in a stationary 30°C incubator, to obtain strain Sc35.RNase H deletions Inoculate a single colony of strain Sc35 in 0.",
    "5 mL of SC-L in a 14 mL culture tube and incubated overnight at 250 rpm and 30°C. The next morning, add 4.5 mL of fresh SC-L to the overnight culture and incubate for another 4 h before transformation. The transformation was done as before, but this time with 1 nmol each of two double-stranded 90-mer oligos targeting RNH1 and RNH201 for knock-out (45 bases homology immediately up- and downstream of the open reading frames) and 1 μg of gRNA plasmid pEDJ8 (2× gRNA plasmid targeting RNH1 and RNH201 with URA3 selection marker). Plate the transformed pellet on SC-LU and incubate for 3 days at 30°C, to obtain strain Sc36. In the resulting colonies, colony PCR (cPCR) with oligos interspaced by 500-1,000 bases following genetic deletion verified knock-out of RNH1 and RNH201. Perform cPCR by picking 12 different colonies with toothpicks and resuspending each colony in two PCR tubes, one for testing rnh1 and one for rnh201, with 8 μL of MilliQ water and 1 μL of each primer per knock-out. Heat the suspension in a Thermal Cycler at 98°C for 15 min and add 10 μL of OneTaq 2× MM to a final volume of 20 μL in each tube. Return the reactions to the Thermal Cycler and run the following program:98°C for 30 s40× (98°C for 30 s; 50°C for 20 s; 68°C for 1 min/kb)10°C foreverLoad the final reactions on a 1% agarose gel. The gel is made by dissolving 4 g of agarose in 400 mL of 1× TAE buffer by heating, and cast in a Sub-Cell GT UV-Transparent Mini-Gel tray with 20 μL RedSafe and Fixed-Height Combs in a Mini-Gel caster. Run the loaded gel with 10 μL of GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder at 90 V for 30 min, in a DNA electrophoresis chamber.",
    "The power is supplied from a PowerPac Basic Power Supply, and gel imaging is done with a Molecular Imager Gel Doc.Note: Double knock-outs were infrequent using this approach, and sequentially knocking out RNH1 and RNH201 can be used as an alternate strategy. Please also note that rnh1 rnh201 double knock-out strains require an incubation time approximately 50% longer compared to wild-type. HIS3 deletion To completely remove the open reading frame of native HIS3, to avoid genetic crossover during downstream analyses, a single colony from strain Sc36 is prepared for transformation in SC-L, as before. Transform 1 μg of gRNA plasmid pEDJ332 (contains nourseothricin resistance marker) with 1 nmol of a double-stranded 90-mer oligo, designed as before to knock out HIS3. After heat shock at 42°C, resuspend the pellet in 500 μL of YPD and incubate it at 800 rpm and 30°C for 2 h. Centrifuge the culture at 13,000 × g for 30 s, discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of sterile MilliQ water, and then plate it out on SC-L containing nourseothricin. After 3 days at 30°C, screen the resulting colonies by cPCR, to verify the removal of the HIS3 open reading frame, resulting in strain Sc43.Strain curing (plasmid removal) Before proceeding to the next engineering step, the Sc43 strain must be cured for all other plasmids than pEDJ391, which contains Cas9. Inoculate a single colony of strain Sc43 in 1 mL of SC-L and incubate it over-night at 250 rpm and 30°C. Dilute 10 μL of the overnight culture in 990 μL of sterile MiiliQ water, from which another 10 μL is diluted into 990 μL of sterile MiiliQ water. Repeat this dilution strategy again, plate 100 μL from all dilutions on SC-L, and incubate this for 3 days at 30°C.",
    "From each plate, perform three replica-plates to selective plates: SC+nourseothricin, SC-U, and SC-H. Replica-plating was achieved on a replication block with Whatman paper. Pick a single colony that did not grow on any of the three replica plates from the original plate following another overnight incubation of all plates at 30°C.Dysfunctional his3 design integration (HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5)Inoculate the cured Sc43 in 0.5 mL of SC-L and allow to grow overnight at 250 rpm and 30°C. Prepare the strain for transformation as before. In the meantime, linearize pEDJ506, which contains HIS3_23Δ29-XII-5, by restriction digest with NotI by mixing 3 μg of pEDJ506, with 2 μL of FastDigest buffer, 2 μL of NotI (20 U), and MiiliQ water to a total volume of 20 μL. Incubate the digest at 37°C in a stationary incubator for 4 h, prior to column purification with a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit. Add 130 μL of NTI buffer to the digest and transfer it to a spin column. Discard the flow-through following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 s. Add 700 μL of NT3 buffer to the spin column and repeat the centrifugation. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the spin column at 13,000 × g for 1 min to dry the membrane. Add 60 μL of sterile MiiliQ water to the spin column, transfer this to a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 30 s. Use the entire eluate for co-transformation with 1 μg of gRNA plasmid pCfB3050, which contains the nourseothricin resistance marker, using the same protocol as before. Resuspend the transformed pellet in 500 μL of YPD and incubate it at 800 rpm and 30°C for 2 h.",
    "Centrifuge the culture at 13,000 × g for 30 s, discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of sterile MiiliQ water, and then plate it out on SC-L containing nourseothricin. Screen the resulting transformants after 3 days incubation at 30°C for integration by cPCR, resulting in strain Sc138. Cure Sc138 essentially as before, but pre-grow it in YPD instead of SC-L, to completely eliminate all plasmids before proceeding to the introduction of CRAIDE plasmids.Transformation of CRAIDE plasmids into engineered yeastInoculate the Sc138 cured strain in 0.5 mL of YPD and prepare it for transformation as before. Sequentially, transform 1.5 μg of plasmid pEDJ333 (GAL1p-Cas9-CYC1t, LEU2) with Cas9, and 1.5 μg of plasmid pMLB10 (GAL1p-T7RNAP(F11L;T613A)-CYC1t, TRP1) with error-prone T7 RNA polymerase, as before. After 3 days at 30°C on SC-LW, inoculate a single transformant in 0.5 mL of SC-LW and prepare it for transformation, as before. Transform 1.5 μg of pEDJ508 (cgRNA_HIS3_stop, URA3) or pEDJ400 (control, URA3), and incubate it on SC-LWU as before, to obtain strains Sc146 and Sc147, respectively.Note: Cas9 and error-prone T7 RNA polymerase are both under galactose-inducible control from the GAL1 promoter.System induction and screen for gain-of-function mutants (HIS3+)Workflow preparations Prepare at least thirteen 14 mL cultivation tubes, to contain 5 mL of SC-LWU with 2% glucose.Strain inoculations Use an inoculation loop to inoculate each cultivation tube with a single colony from the transformation plates. Inoculate at least 10 colonies for strain Sc146, and at least three colonies for control strain Sc147. Incubate overnight (20 h) at 250 rpm and 30°C (system OFF).System induction Pellet overnight cultures by centrifugation (2,000 rpm for 5 min), discard the supernatant, and wash once in 5 mL of sterile MiiliQ water.",
    "Resuspend pellets in 2 mL of SC-LWU with 2% galactose (system ON) and measure OD600 by spectrophotometry on 1 mL of culture per cuvette. Adjust to OD600 = 2.0 in 2 mL total volume, using SC-LWU with 2% galactose in new cultivation tubes. Incubate cultivation tubes for 48 h at 250 rpm and 30°C.Screen for gain-of-function mutants (plates) Measure the final OD600 by spectrophotometry and plate 5 × 300 μL from each culture on five synthetic dropout plates without histidine (SC-H) containing 2% glucose (system OFF). In addition, dilute 10 μL of the cultures in 990 μL of MiiliQ water and, as before, plate a 10× dilution series with 3 × 100 μL per dilution on non-selective plates (SC-LWU). Incubate all plates in a stationary incubator at 30 °C for 5 days, and score the resulting colonies.Note: The resulting colonies have acquired HIS3+ at the targeted locus and an equal the number of successful functional cgRNA-DNA repair events. Screen for gain-of-function mutants and sequencing (liquid cultures) Optional: Add 5 mL of SC-H with 2% glucose to cultivation tubes with the culture remnants (~190 μL per tube) and incubate at 250 rpm and 30°C for an additional 72 h. Transfer and harvest 500 μL from each culture tube in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, by centrifugation and resuspension of pellets in 400 μL of 400 mM lithium acetate. Incubate at 70°C for 15 min, pellet the remnants by centrifugation, and transfer 300 μL of the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Add 30 μL of 3 M sodium acetate and 900 μL of 100% ethanol, and incubate at -80°C for 1 h. Spin down in a pre-cooled centrifuge (4°C) at full speed for 20 min, discard the supernatant, and wash once with 70% ethanol.",
    "Centrifuge at full speed for 5 min at room temperature, and discard the supernatant. Dry the pellets at 60°C for 5-10 min, and resuspend in 100 μL of MiiliQ water by gentle pipetting. Use 100-400 ng as template for PCR with OneTaq, 2× MM, and oligos: F_Seq (CAAGTTCTTAGATGCTTTC) and R_Seq (CTACATAAGAACACCTTTGGTG). Allow elongation to occur for 2 min, to amplify the targeted locus (HIS3+). Sanger sequencing of the amplification product can be done to verify mutagenesis in the region of interest."
