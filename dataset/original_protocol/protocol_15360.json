    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n1. In vitro HIF-1α bioluminescence assay\nMaterials and Methods:\n \nHuman metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 transfected with a novel HIF-1-dependent reporter gene, 5HRE-ODD-luc was generated by Dr. Harada.\nIn hypoxic condition, the enhanced expression of oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD)-Luciferase fusion protein is driven by 5 copies of hypoxia-response element (5HRE). The presence of ODD causes the degradation of ODD-Luc protein resulting in extremely low background luciferase activity in normoxic conditions. Therefore, this novel system can be used to detect hypoxic regions in a tumor by real time imaging. The construction of this 5HRE-ODD-luc expression vector has been reported by Harada et al1,2.\nCulture cells under normoxia or hypoxia:\n \nMaintain the recombinant MDA-MB231 cells in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-DMEM medium containing 1% glutamine, antibiotics of 400 μg/ml of G418 and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nFor the in vitro HIF-1α bioluminescence assay, plate 3 x 105 MDA-MB231 cells expressing 5HRE-ODD-luc vector in each well of two six well dish.\nAllow cells to attach the dish wall after overnight incubation and then transfer one dish into a hypoxia chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc. Del Mar, CA) for hypoxia studies, while keep the other dish under normoxic condition (21% O2).\nReassemble the chamber and gas the chamber with 0.1% O2 by connecting the inlet port tubing with a gas cylinder.\n  Note: Both inlet and outlet port clamps must be open during this procedure.\nDisconnect gas source after chamber has been purged and seal chamber by closing plastic clamps.\nPlace the chamber in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n  Note: The chamber must be humidified to prevent excessive evaporation of cultures. This can be accomplished by placing 10 - 20 ml sterile water in the chamber.",
    "Bioluminescence assay:\n \nAfter 24 hr incubation, remove the medium and wash the cells quickly with ice cold PBS (2X).\nAdd 1 ml of cold PBS with 100 μl of Luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St Louis, MO).\nAcquire BL imaging (IVIS Spectrum system, Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA) with various exposure times (1, 30, 60, 180 s).\nMeasure light intensity in each well using the Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences).\n2. Establishment of a breast cancer brain metastasis model\nPreparation of the MDA-MB231/5HRE-ODD-luc cells\n \nRetrieve and culture the MDA-MB231/5HRE-ODD-luc cells in DEME medium containing 10% FBS, 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nReplace medium every 2-3 days. Tripsinize and wash the cells when they reach 80% confluence.\nCount appropriate number of cells and resuspend them in serum free DEME medium with 25% Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with a final concentration of 105 cells in 4 μl volume.\nPlace cells on ice prior to intracranial injection.\nSurgical implantation\n \nFemale nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu; National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) at 4-6 weeks old are used in this study.\nAnesthetize (3% isoflurane/ O2 in an induction chamber; isoflurane from Baxter International Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA) and maintain the animals with isoflurane (1%) in oxygen (1 dm3/min) during the surgical procedure3.\nThe right parietal skin should be prepped with betadine and then 70% alcohol prior to incision.\nUsing a high-speed drill, burr a 1 mm hole in the right hemisphere of the skull, 1mm anterior to the coronal suture and 2 mm lateral to saggital suture.",
    "Draw 4 μl cell mixture (105 cells) using a 10 μl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). Inject the cells directly into right caudal diencephalon, 1.5 mm beneath the dura mater using a custom-made 32G Hamilton needle. Keep the needle in place for about 30 s before withdrawal. Usage of a 32G fine needle minimizes tissue damage.\nFill the burr hole with bone wax and close the scalp with absorbable sutures.\nPrepare the incision region with 70% alcohol.\nApply buprenorphine analgesia every 12 hrs for two days.\n3. In vivo bioluminescence imaging of tumor hypoxia dynamics in breast cancer brain metastasis\nInitiate longitudinal bioluminescence imaging (IVIS Spectrum system) two weeks after intracranial implantation and repeat once a week for 8-10 weeks.\nAnesthetize three mice at a time (3% isoflurane/ O2 in an induction chamber)\nAdminister a solution of D-luciferin (120 mg/kg in PBS in a total volume of 80 μl; Gold Biotechnology) subcutaneously in the neck region of each mouse as described in detail previously4.\nD-luciferin is non-toxic and has been shown to be capable of penetrating intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cell membranes3,5.\nPlace the 3 mice in the imaging chamber and maintained with isoflurane (1%) in oxygen (1 dm3/min) during imaging.\nFive minutes after luciferin injection, acquire BL imaging with an array of various exposure time (1, 30, 60, 180 s).\nOur observations show that the peak light emission time is about 5 mins after subcutaneous administration of luciferin in the neck region3,4.\nAnalyze data with the Living Imaging software (Caliper Life Sciences) by using absolute photon counts (photons/s) in a region of interest (ROI), manually drawn to outline the BLI signal of the brain.\nPlot time course curve of photon counts to indicate tumor hypoxia dynamics.",
    "Immediately after the last BLI, administer pimonidazole, the hypoxia marker and 1 hr later, sacrifice the mice and dissect the brains. Embed the whole brains in Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) medium and freeze in -80 °C freezer. Subsequent histological Cresyl violet staining and immunohistochemical staining against luciferase, hypoxia marker pimonidazole, and HIF-1α performed to validate imaging observations.\n4. Representative results:\nAs shown in Fig.1, significantly higher BLI signal was observed after the transfected cells incubated in the hypoxic chamber (1% O2) for 24 hrs. Weak light emission was observed from the control cells under normoxia. This may result from the overcrowded cell population after 24 hr culture of 3 x 105 cells, which induced a stress signal to the cells to overexpress HIF-1α. Nonetheless, in vivo BLI results were validated by immunohistochemical staining showing colocalization between tumor hypoxia and luciferase expression.\nAn automated array of exposure times enables continuous acquisitions of a series of images, which facilitates capture of a weak signal with longer exposure time, and strong signals using a shorter time without saturating the CCD.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3175/3175fig1.jpg\nFigure 1 In vitro HIF-1α bioluminescence assay. Top row: 3 x 105 MDA-MB231/5HRE-ODD-luc cells incubated in each well of a 6-well-dish in a hypoxia chamber (0.1% O2) for 24 hr before the medium was removed, washed and replaced with 1 ml PBS. Immediately after 100 μl luciferin was added into each well, BLI was acquired with an array of exposure times (1, 30, 60, 180 s). Strong luminescence was observed from representative wells. Bottom row: As a control, 3 x 105 cells incubated under normoxia (21% O2) emitted weak light.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3175/3175fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2 In vivo bioluminescence imaging of tumor hypoxia dynamics. A) A weak light signal from right side of mouse brain was first visualized 5 weeks after intracranial implantation of MDA-MB231/5HRE-ODD-luc breast cancer cells. Increased optical signal was observed over additional 6 weeks, indicating increased tumor hypoxia. B) The plot showed the time course curve of quantitative photon counts of light signal.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3175/3175fig3.jpg\nFigure 3 Colocaliztion of luciferase and hypoxia detected by immunohisto-chemical staining. A frozen mouse brain bearing a metastasis of breast cancer MDA-MB231/5HRE-ODD-luc embedded in O.C.T. was sectioned. A 10 μm section immunostained with hypoxic marker, pimonidazole, revealed intratumoral heterogeneity of hypoxia, which was found to correlate spatially with luciferase expression detected by anti-luciferase staining.
