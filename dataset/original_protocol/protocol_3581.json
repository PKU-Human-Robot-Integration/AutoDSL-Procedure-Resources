    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMaintaining F0 females flies prior to dissection\nTiming: 1–7 days\nCollect and set up a cross of 20–30 virgin females and 5–10 males at 25°C in a vial with standard fly food.\nTransfer flies to a new vial every 1–2 days until the day of dissection to ensure flies do not become immobilized on wet yeast.\nCritical: If including genetic perturbation, RNAi or transgene expression that could possibly also affect male reproduction, ensure that the males kept with the females to be imaged are wildtype. This is to negate any compounding effects on male reproductive health that might indirectly affect female reproductive health.\nOptional: The food can also be supplemented with dry yeast as this is believed to boost reproduction.\nNote: Here flies are maintained for 3–5 days prior to dissection to ensure enough time for mating and healthy reproduction but not long enough for the negative effects of aging. This can, however, be adjusted to enable investigation of reproduction and/or aging on GSC biology.\nNote: When combining live imaging with RNAi or other genetic perturbations, it may be necessary to raise the flies at different temperatures. For example, increasing the temperature to 29°C may enhance RNAi knockdown. This will need to be determined empirically for each experiment and the temperatures described here will need to be altered to reflect this.\nOvary dissection and mounting\nTiming: 30–60 min\nPreheat 5 mL SIM, 1 mL fSIM and 2 mL iSIM to 37°C.\nNote: This step is to stop the precipitation of fibrinogen in fSIM following thawing. We also warm all media used to prevent any dramatic temperature changes during washing and mounting of dissected tissue.",
    "Prior to ovary dissection, set up a 6-well plate or glass dissection dish with 3× wells with 500 μL SIM for fly washes prior to dissection, 2× wells on a glass dissection dish with 500 μL SIM for dissection and a single well with 200 μL fSIM.\nAnesthetize the flies by pumping CO2 into the vial or incubating at 4°C for 5 min or until they fall to the bottom of the vial and take 2–3 females.\nCritical: Take care to ensure the flies do not get stuck in yeast paste as they fall when anesthetized.\nEuthanize the flies by submerging them in 70% ethanol for 1 min.\nCritical: Take care not to injure the fly abdomen or submerge them in ethanol for too long to avoid alcohol toxicity.\nTransfer the flies to the dissection dish and wash them for 1 min in each of the first three wells of SIM.\nTransfer the flies to the fourth well of SIM and dissect the ovaries of all the flies (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/506-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Ovary microdissection\n(A) Schematic illustrating the dissection of the Drosophila ovary and microdissection of the ovarioles for live imaging. (Centre) Image of an eyelash tool.\n(B) Bright-field and confocal images of ovarioles with and without the overlying muscle sheath. Phalloidin is used to label the F-actin-rich transverse muscle fibers and DAPI labeling of DNA is used to visualize the germline and somatic cells of the ovariole. An asterisk labels the germarium. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nTurn the female on her back and, using forceps, pull at the ovipositor to remove the posterior of the abdomen.\nIf the ovaries do not remain attached to the posterior of the abdomen as you pull away, lightly pinch the abdomen and they will pop out.",
    "Critical: If combining live imaging with RNAi or other genetic perturbation that disrupts GSC/ovary function, then the ovaries may appear underdeveloped, shrunken and fibrous. This is most likely due to the absence of later stage egg chambers resulting in smaller ovarioles that are essentially just the individual germaria encased in the fibrous muscle sheath. These can still be dissected in the same way but with greater care as the germaria can be easily lost.\nTransfer the ovaries to a final well of SIM for microdissection of individual ovarioles.\nUsing an eyelash tool, comb through the ovaries to break through the overlying muscle sheath and tease apart the individual ovarioles (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: We find that an eyelash glued to a toothpick with nail varnish provides an ideal tool for microdissection of the ovarioles; strong enough to break through the muscle layer but not too firm as to damage the tissue.\nSever the muscle sheath connected at the anterior tip of the terminal filament or most posterior egg chamber if necessary, using the eyelash tool or dissection scissors. Make sure to remove as much muscle sheath as possible.\nCritical: Many ovarioles will remain tightly ensheathed by the overlying muscle layer. In this case the ovarioles are held tightly together (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Once removed, the ovarioles appear elongated and stretched out. Only select ovarioles for imaging that are easily removed from the muscle sheath to avoid inducing mechanical stress.\nTransfer 5–10 ovarioles in 10 μL of SIM to the dissection dish well containing 200 μL fSIM.\nPipette the ovarioles in 5–10 μL fSIM onto a 35 mm FluoroDish glass bottom dish and spread the droplet thin with the eyelash tool. This helps stop the ovarioles floating away from the glass bottom.",
    "Try to position the ovarioles using the eyelash tool so they are close together.\nNote: This is not essential but helps when searching for germaria on the microscope. Repositioning the ovarioles may be difficult given the delicacy of the tissue and media surface tension.\nCarefully add 1–2 μL thrombin (10 U/mL) dropwise (0.5 μL at a time) to form the fibrinogen-thrombin clot. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nNote: It is important to minimize contact between the pipette tip and media when adding the thrombin, as the clot begins forming rapidly upon mixing.\nCover the FluoroDish and leave for 10 min to allow clot formation at 20°C.\nCritical: Make sure you allow the clot long enough to solidify. There is a subtle increase in opaqueness upon clot formation.\nAdd 100 μL of iSIM prewarmed to 25°C and apply a piece of damp tissue paper to the edge of the dish to prevent drying out. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3].\nLive confocal microscopy\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIn this section, the microscopy setup and settings are outlined to visualize cytoskeletal projections in the germline.\nFor imaging experiments, we use a Leica TCS SP8 AOBS inverted confocal microscope and imaging is carried out at 25°C.\nUse a HC PL APO CS2 motCORR 63×/1.2 water objective and 1.5× optical zoom\nSet the pinhole to 1 airy unit and scan speed to 400 Hz unidirectional and acquire an image of 512 pixels per line and 256–512 lines at 8 bit. Acquiring an image at 512 × 512 pixels with these settings resulted in a pixel size of 241 nm × 241 nm and an image size of 123 μm × 123 μm.",
    "Use the 488 and 561 nm laser excitation lines. Collect images using the hybrid detectors with the white laser set to 70% with 488 nm (10%) and 574 nm (5%) with 2× line averaging. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nNote: The settings described here are used to image LifeAct.GFP (488 nm) and H2B.mRFP (574 nm).\nSet the z stack to be acquired continuously at 0.75 μm intervals of 10–20 z stacks making sure to contain all of the germarium or anterior germarium. This will allow a final temporal resolution of 30–60 s to be achieved.\nLocate germaria on the glass coverslip using brightfield illumination and pick a germarium that is lying relatively flat to the coverslip. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nUse fluorescence illumination to identify the GSCs and the niche cells (in this example, by their anterior localization and the absence of transgene expression or, if using a fluorescent histone marker, by their compact nuclei relative to the germ cells) and ensure the niche cells are oriented orthogonal to the GSCs. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9].\nSet up a time lapse for up to 3 h.\nOptional: Depending on temporal resolution restrictions, it is also possible to image multiple fields of view to image more than one germarium at a time.\nImage processing\nTiming: 30 min\nOpen movies in Fiji using Bio-Formats Importer with the settings below (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/506-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Displayed in center and right are single z slices at the beginning and end of the movie.\n(B) Adjust the brightness and apply a bleach correction.\n(C) Apply a 3D Gaussian blur.\n(D) Create a maximum projection z stack and crop as appropriate.\nSee Methods video S1 in Wilcockson and Ashe (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11].\nView stack with: Hyperstack.\nColor mode: Composite.",
    "Adjust the brightness and apply an exponential fit bleach correction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nApply a 0.5x × 0.5y × 0.5z pixel-wide 3D Gaussian blur (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCreate a maximum projection z stack to encompass the region/structure of interest.\nIn Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D a z stack of the first 10 z slices of an 18 z slice movie is generated so as not obscure the view of the eGFP-Tubulin labeled GSC projection.\nCrop the image as appropriate by drawing a rectangle around the region of interest and using the crop function (Ctrl+Shift+x).\nMeasuring projection length:\nUse the line tool to draw over the length of the projection and use Analyze > Measure to determine the length of the projection.\nSave Movies as .avi files with the desired number of frames per second (for example, movies used here are either progressed at 5 or 15 frames per second).\nNote: Further information regarding the analysis of the germ cell projections, GSC signaling levels and GSC-niche adhesion can be found in Wilcockson and Ashe (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]."
