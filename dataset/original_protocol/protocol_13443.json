    "All procedures performed in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Ohio State University in accordance with NIH guidelines.\n1. Solution preparation\nNOTE: Please see Table 2 for buffer concentrations.\nPre-isolation (up to 2 weeks in advance of myocyte isolation)\n\t\nPerfusion buffer base: Prepare 1 L of perfusion buffer base (NaCl, KCl, NaH2PO4, HEPES, Glucose, and BDM) in 1 L of ultrapure 18.2 MΩ·cm H2O. Adjust to pH 7.4 prior to 0.22 µm sterile filtration. Store at 4 °C until the day of isolation.\nClearing buffer: Prepare 1 L of clearing buffer (NaCl, KCl, NaH2PO4, HEPES, Glucose, EDTA, and BDM) in 1 L of ultrapure 18.2 MΩ·cm H2O. Adjust to pH 7.4 prior to 0.22 µm sterile filtration. Store at 4 °C until the day of isolation.\n100 mM CaCl2 stock solution: Weigh out 1.11 g of CaCl2 and dissolve into 100 mL of ultrapure 18.2 MΩ·cm H2O. Store at room temperature until the day of isolation.\nLiberase aliquots: Dissolve 5 mg of digestive enzymes in 5 mL of sterile, RNase-free water. Prepare 0.8 mL aliquots and store at -20 °C until the day of isolation.\nLaminate the dishes: Apply 100 µL of 40 µg/mL mouse laminin to sterile, glass-bottom 30 mL Petri dishes. Allow to sit for 30 min and remove excess laminin. Set the laminin on a Petri dish with UV incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Store at 4 °C until the day of isolation (laminated Petri dishes can be used for up to 2 weeks).",
    "DMEM media: In a biosafety cabinet, add 2.5 mL of FBS, 0.5 mL of Penicillin-Streptomycin (50 U/mL-50 µg), and 1 mL of 500 mM BDM to 46 mL of DMEM. Store at 4 °C until the day of isolation (media can be used for up to 2 weeks).\nM199 media: Prepare 1 L of M199 media (NaHCO3, HEPES, L-glutathione, M199, BDM, and BSA) in 1 L of ultrapure 18.2 MΩ·cm H2O. Adjust to pH 7.4 prior to sterile filtration (0.22 µm filter). Store at 4 °C until the day of isolation.\n500 mM BDM stock: Add 0.5 g of BDM to 10 mL of ultrapure 18.2 MΩ·cm H2O. Store at 4 °C until the day of isolation.\nStabilizing platform creation: Mold playdough around the base of the needle screwed into the Luer stopcock. Mold to the Petri dish that will contain the heart and ensure that the needle is at proper height for ventricle injection (~5 mm above bottom of dish).\nThe day of isolation\n\t\nPerfusion buffer: On the day of the isolation, add 9.5 mg of MgCl2 to 100 mL of perfusion buffer base. Allow to mix completely before removing 30 mL of completed perfusion buffer and place in a clean, wide-mouth, 100 mL glass bottle with a screw cap lid (digestion buffer).\n\t\t​NOTE: These additions can be made on the day of isolation without additional pH adjustments as their addition negligibly alters the pH.\n\t\t\nRemove 12 mL of perfusion buffer and set to the side (stop buffer). Pour the remaining 58 mL of perfusion buffer into another clean, wide-mouth, 100 mL glass bottle with a screw cap lid. Store the remaining perfusion buffer at 37 °C throughout isolation.",
    "Digestion buffer: Add 7.5 µL of 100 mM CaCl2 to 30 mL of perfusion buffer for a final concentration of 25 µM. Immediately prior to the isolation, add 770 µL of Liberase to the digestion buffer for a final concentration of 26 µg/mL.\nStop buffer: Dissolve 240 mg of BSA in 12 mL of perfusion buffer. Store at 37 °C throughout isolation.\nClearing buffer: Prepare a 3 mL syringe of clearing buffer and clear the needle of bubbles. Store on ice until isolation.\n2. Manifold preparation\nClear the temperature-controlled manifold with freshly prepared perfusion buffer, being careful to ensure no bubbles remain. Using a Luer lock connector, screw in a 27 G needle, and clear of bubbles. A cleared manifold is essential for a successful isolation.\n3. Animal preparation\nInject the mouse intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 20 mg/kg xylazine by body weight immediately prior to the isolation. This procedure used a male, 4-month-old C57Bl/6 mouse.\nIf needed, place the mouse on a heated surgical pad to encourage sedation. Tent the arms of the mouse, and tape the limbs and base of the tail to a blue lab diaper. Ensure that the animal is fully anesthetized by the withdrawal of toe-pinch reflex. Apply a sterile drape around the surgical area.\n4. Cardiomyocyte isolation procedure\nExpose the sternum of the mouse and, lateral to the midline, cut proximally through the ribs and to the axilla. Gently cut fully through the diaphragm, ensuring shallow cuts to avoid the heart. Clamp the sternum with a hemostat and fold the ribs backwards to expose the thoracic cavity.",
    "Gently remove the pericardium from the heart and cut fully through the inferior vena cava, immediately distal to the heart. Use a 3 mL syringe with a 27 G needle to quickly inject 3 mL of ice-cold clearing buffer into the right ventricle of the heart over 1 min.\nGently hold the heart using tweezers and pull away from the body, exposing as much of the aorta as possible. Using a hemostat, clamp the ascending aorta, being careful not to clamp the atria, and excise the heart from the chest.\nQuickly transfer the clamped heart to the lid of a polypropylene Petri dish with approximately 10 mL of warm perfusion buffer. Place the clamped heart into the supporting platform and use a stabilized 27 G needle attached to the manifold to inject 10 mL of temperature-controlled 37 °C perfusion buffer into the left ventricle over 5 min.\nTransfer the clamped heart and supporting platform to a Petri dish with approximately 5 mL of digestion buffer. Exchange input syringes for a 50 mL syringe with 25 mL of digestion buffer.\nClear the manifold of any bubbles and remaining perfusion buffer before injection. Carefully replace the needle into the same needle position in the left ventricular apex.\nUse a perfusion pump to inject temperature-controlled 37 °C digestion buffer into the left ventricle for 15 min using a 50 mL syringe. Control the temperature of the solution with a water jacket previously calibrated to eject 37 °C solution at the end of the needle.",
    "Remove the ventricles from the atria and transfer to a 10 mL beaker. Add 3 mL of digestion buffer to the beaker and, using sharp scissors, cut the ventricles into large chunks. Cover the beaker with aluminum foil and place in a shaking water bath preheated to 37 °C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, being careful to avoid removing any chunks of tissue. Resuspend the tissue chunks in 3 mL of digestion buffer and triturate for approximately 4 min or until a homogenous mixture is achieved.\nFilter the cells through a 70 µm nylon cell strainer into a 50 mL polypropylene tube.\nReturn the filtrate to a 14 mL round-bottom polypropylene tube and centrifuge for 1 min at 100 rpm. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of stop buffer.\nAdd 54 µL of 100 mM CaCl2 stock to the resuspended cells for a final CaCl2 concentration of 1.8 mM. This step can also be performed stepwise to increase cell yield.\nAllow live cells to settle by gravity for 10 min before removing the supernatant containing dead cells. Resuspend the pellet in storage solution (perfusion solution with 200 µM CaCl2). These cells can now be used for functional experiments (i.e., calcium imaging/contraction, patch clamp, etc.), culture, etc.\n\t​NOTE: The cells may also be resuspended in lab- or experiment-dependent solutions.\n5. Cell culture\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer or by a field view count using a gridded cover slip. As myocytes are very large, counting using a hemocytometer is not always accurate. This is used to get an idea of approximately how many cells were obtained from the isolation.\nDilute the cells to ~25,000 cells/mL with DMEM media. Add 1 mL of cell solution to each well.",
    "Incubate at 37 °C, 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 2 h.\nGently aspirate DMEM media from each well and add 2 mL of M199 media.\nIncubate at 37 °C, 95% O2, 5% CO2 for up to 24 h.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
