    "Animal and housing: Obtain 8-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice. At 10 weeks old, give the C57Bl/6 mice free access to water and a high-fat diet (DIO diet: 35% kcal from fat, 25.8% caseine, 1.30% mineral AIN, 1.30% vitamins, 1.70% dicalcium phosphate, 0.7% calcium carbonate, 2.10% citrate potassium, 0.026% choline bitartrate, 8.9% sucrose, 0.384% cystine, 6.5% cellulose, 31.7% lard, 3.3% soybean oil, and 16.29% maltodextrine) for 8 (SG) or 14 (RYGB) weeks prior to the bariatric surgeries. To promote weight gain, give the mice dedicated to the RYGB surgery (sham & RYGB) water containing 20% fructose (w/v) in addition to the high-fat diet.\nEthics Statement: All protocol steps described below follow the guidelines of the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of Pays de la Loire under the approval number 01953.01.\n1. General Preoperative Preparation\nFast the mice for 6 h before the surgery. Gel diet food was given 3 days before surgery and exclusively one day before surgery. Induce anesthesia in a chamber with 5% isoflurane (0.4 L/min) and O2 (dioxygen; 0.4 L/min). Perform a toe-pinch test to confirm that the anesthetization is effective. Administer analgesics (0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine), antibiotics (10 mg/kg marbofloxacine), and pro-kinetics (1 mg/kg metoclopramide) via subcutaneous injections.\nAllocate a specific work area for surgical procedures (distant from laboratory traffic and ventilation fans). Clean the surgical area with dedicated hard surface disinfectants. Place a heating pad on the working space area to maintain mouse homeothermy during the surgery. Apply a clean, absorbent underpad over the heating pad.\nShave the abdomen from sternum to pelvis using an electric razor. Wrap the mouse abdomen in sterilized plastic wrap (Figures 1A and 2A) and place the mouse in supine position on the heating pad.",
    "Apply vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Place the mouse in the nose cone and maintain anesthesia with 2% isoflurane (0.4 L/min) and O2 (0.4 L/min).\nBefore beginning the surgery, put on a sterile examination gown, a disposable scrubs cap, a facemask, and sterile gloves. Open an autoclaved package containing a sterilized surgical instrument set, which is required for all steps of the surgery. Cut a window in the sterilized plastic wrap and disinfect the skin with 2 successive povidone-iodine solutions.\n2. Sleeve Gastrectomy: Surgical Procedure\nMedian laparotomy (Figure 1B)\nUnder a binocular microscope and with a scalpel, perform a midline incision from the sternum to the middle of the abdomen to open the abdominal cavity (do not damage the abdominal muscles). Protect the skin with a sterile compress soaked with 37 °C saline solution.\nStomach exposure (Figure 1C)\nGently mobilize the stomach using moistened-cotton swabs. Free the stomach from its lateral close connective tissue attachments using moistened cotton swabs or micro scissors.\nGently, externalize the stomach fully and place a hemostatic collagen compress behind the stomach. Suture the pylorus and esophagus vessels along the stomach greater curvature with 8.0 non-absorbable sutures to avoid future bleeding (Figure 1D and E). Note: Hemostat use can induce tissue damage, make sure to only use it on tissue that aim to be resected.\nResection of the cardiac region of stomach (fundus)\nPerform a gastrotomy on the anatomical line present between the pyloric region (corpus) and the cardiac region of stomach (fundus) (Figure 1F).\nRemove residual food with 2 moistened cotton swabs towards each side of the stomach. Using micro scissors, cut the stomach along the boundary between the fundus and the corpus of the stomach (Figure 1G).",
    "Press a hemostatic collagen compress for 2 min in case of major bleeding. Close the stomach opening with 8.0 non-absorbable sutures from the gastro-oesophagal junction to the end of the incision (Figure 1H).\nResection of the pyloric region of stomach (corpus)\nComplete the stomach resection along the greater curvature so as to remove approximately 80% of the stomach (Figure 1I). Standardize the width of the SG to 3 mm. Press a hemostatic collagen compress for 2 min in case of major bleeding.\nClose the opening of the pyloric region of the stomach with 8.0 non-absorbable suture (Figure 1J). Gently roll 2 moistened cotton swabs towards each side of the stomach to ensure that the suture is leak-proof.\nComplete with 8.0 non-absorbable sutures in case of leakage. Remove the hemostatic collagen compresses and return the stomach to the abdominal cavity. Leave a hemostatic collagen compress against the suture.\nAbdominal closure\nClose the muscle layer of the abdominal wall with 5.0 non-absorbable sutures (Figure 1K). Reduce anesthesia by reducing the isoflurane concentration to 1%. Close the skin using 5.0 non-absorbable sutures (Figure 1L).\n3. Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Surgical Procedure\nMedian laparotomy\nUnder a binocular microscope and with a scalpel, perform a midline incision from the sternum to the middle of the abdomen to open the abdominal cavity (do not damage the abdominal muscles). Protect the skin with a sterile compress soaked with 37 °C saline solution (Figure 2B).\nBiliopancreatic limb and alimentary limb\nExternalize the intestine (Figure 2C). Measure 8 cm from the pylorus and perform two ligatures of the intestine with 5.0 non-absorbable sutures (Figure 2D).\nCut the intestine between the two ligatures (Figure 2E). Place the proximal limb of the two ends in the upper-left quadrant of the abdomen. Note: This will be used as the alimentary limb (Figure 2F).",
    "Place the distal limb of the two ends facing the alimentary limb 6 cm below the proximal limb (Figure 2F).\n\t\tNOTE: This will be used as the biliary limb.\nJejuno-jejunostomy\nCut both the proximal limb and the intestine loop using micro scissors and perform two antimesenteric incisions of the same length (Figure 2G and 2H).\nPerform side-to-side anastomosis with two 8.0 non-absorbable sutures. Perform the dorsal side anastomosis first (Figure 2I), followed by the ventral side anastomosis (Figure 2J).\nGently roll 2 moistened cotton swabs towards each side of the anastomosis to ensure that the suture is leak-proof. Complete with 8.0 non-absorbable sutures in case of leakage.\nGastro-jejunostomy\nGently mobilize the stomach using moistened cotton swabs. Free the stomach from its lateral close connective tissue attachments using moistened cotton swabs or micro scissors.\nGently, externalize the stomach fully, placing a re-absorbable hemostatic collagen compress behind the stomach. Perform a ligature of the pylorus using a 5.0 non-absorbable suture passed through the omentum using curved micro forceps (Figure 2K and 2L).\nCut both the ventral side of the stomach, 1.5 cm from the pylorus, and the distal limb using micro scissors, creating two incisions of the same length (Figure 2M).\nPerform side-to-side anastomosis with two 8.0 non-absorbable sutures. Start with the dorsal side anastomosis (Figure 2N), and then perform the ventral side anastomosis (Figure 2O). Gently roll 2 moistened-cotton swabs towards each side of the anastomosis to ensure that the suture is leak-proof. Complete with 8.0 non-absorbable sutures in case of leakage.\nAbdominal closure\nClose the muscle layer of the abdominal wall using 5.0 non-absorbable sutures (Figure 2P). Reduce the anesthesia by reducing the isoflurane concentration to 1%. Close the skin using 5.0 non-absorbable sutures (Figure 2Q).Administer 25 mL/kg of warm saline solution via subcutaneous injection.\n4. General Postoperative Care",
    "Stop isoflurane and continue with an O2 flow of 0.8 L/min until the mouse is fully awake. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it regains motor control, indicated by the animal starting to move around the cage and being able to stand and walk without falling.\nPlace the mouse (only one mouse per cage) in an incubator under 30 °C temperature condition for 5 days.\nMaintain iron (0.5 mg/kg/day; subcutaneous injection) and vitamin (800 mg/180 mL in water) supplementations in the RYGB mice until the end of the protocol.\nReturn free access to gel diet food (high-fat gel diet: 10% lard, 10% liquid sugar, 57% water) for 5 days after surgery. Reintroduce a solid diet 3 days after surgery.\nSubcutaneously inject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, twice daily, from day 0 to day 3 after surgery), meloxicam (1 mg/kg, from day 0 to day 3 after surgery), metoclopramide (1 mg/kg, from day 0 to day 5 after surgery), and marbofloxacine (10 mg/kg, from day 0 to day 3 after surgery).\n5. Postoperative Metabolic Parameters Assessment\nFood intake measurement\nAllow the mice to recover for 1 week after surgery. House the mice one per cage. Measure the amount of solid diet placed in the cage. Weight the remaining food 24 h later. Repeat this step as long as required.\nOral glucose tolerance test\nFast the mice for 6 h before the oral bolus. Harvest a blood drop from the tail tip and apply it on a glucose strip inserted in a glucometer to determine the time 0 blood glucose value.\nAdminister an oral bolus of 20% D-glucose solution (2 g/kg). Measure the blood glucose levels at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min post gavage.\nHemoglobin level analysis\nUsing a hematology system, measure 20 µL of fresh blood to sample the hemoglobin level.",
    "6. Euthanasia\nAnesthetize the mice by intraperitoneally injecting a xylazine/ketamine solution (10/80 mg/kg). Perform a cervical dislocation. Verify complete euthanasia by ensuring that the heart is not beating and the eyeball blink reflex is lost.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
