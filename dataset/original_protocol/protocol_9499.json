    "1. Transfection\nSeed HEK293 cells in 100-mm culture plates (2 x 106 cells/dish). Culture the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Incubate the cells in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.\nThe next day, transfect the cells with 10 µg of FLAG-tagged ARIP4 plasmid using 40 µl of transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's directions11.\n2. Protein Extraction\nApproximately 36 hr post-transfection, wash the cells with ice-cold PBS and harvest the cells using a scraper. Transfer the cells into a 1.5 mltube and centrifuge it at 8,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5x the pellet volume of 0.4 M KCl buffer (High salt buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 10 mM β-mercaptethanol, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail). Rotate the mixture for 20 min at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the tube at 17,700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant (whole-cell extract) to a new 2-mL tube and add 3x the initial volume of 0 M KCl buffer (Dilution buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 10 mM β-Mercaptoethanol, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail).\nPerform another centrifugation (17,700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C) and transfer the supernatant (whole-cell extract) to a new 2 ml tube.\n3. Immunoprecipitation",
    "During the centrifugation (2.4), wash 50 µl of anti-FLAG beads with PBS, 0.1 M glycine-hydrochloride, and then 1 M Tris-hydrochloride, followed by washing twice with 0.1M KCl buffer (Low salt buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail). The centrifugation for this washing process is performed at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.\nMix 50 µl of FLAG beads with the whole-cell extracts and gently rotate the mixture for 4 hr at 2-4 °C (1% of the whole-cell extract from step 2.4 should also be kept at -80 °C for future use as an input).\nTransfer the sample to a micro spin column (gravity drop). Keep the flow-through in a 1.5 ml tube, freeze it using liquid nitrogen, and store it at -80 °C (check the protein levels of both the input and flow-through using Western blot analysis).\nAdd 1 ml of 0.1 M KCl buffer (Low salt buffer) to wash the FLAG beads (gravity drop).\nRepeat step 3.4 at least four more times (for a total of five washes).\n4. Elution\nPlace the column into a 1.5 ml tube and centrifuge it at 2,000 x g for 1 min; the beads will dry.\nCap the bottom of the column.\nAdd 50 µl (equal to the volume of FLAG beads) of 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.5).\nGently shake the mixture for 10 min at room temperature.\nPlace the column into a new 1.5 ml tube and centrifuge it at 2,000 x g for 1 min.\nThe eluted solution is neutralized with 10 µl of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); mix well by pipetting or by using a vortex machine.\n5. Alkylation and Trypsinization",
    "Add 50 µl of 100 mM NH4HCO3, 10 µl of CH3CN, and 2 µl of dithiothreitol to the mixture (112 µl total volume).\nIncubate the sample for 30 min at 56 °C.\nPlace the sample at room temperature for 10 min.\nAdd 10 µl of 333 mM iodoacetamide to the sample and incubate it in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 10 µl of trypsin (33 ng/µl) to the mixture and incubate it overnight at 37 °C.\n6. LC-MS/MS Analysis\nFollowing overnight trypsinization, transport the final product to an LC-MS/MS facility or to a third-party mass spectrometry lab for analysis12.\nSubscription Required.
