The glycerol stock serves as a starting point for subsequent steps in the protocol.\nNote: The precise timing is contingent upon the sequencing result that verifies the sequence of iMbody.\nTransforming BL21(DE3) competent E. coli cells with pSANG10-3F-iMbody plasmids prepared in Step 1.\nNote: The iMbody gene is controlled by a T7 promoter within the pSANG10-3F plasmid. BL21(DE3) cells are highly suitable for T7 expression, although other bacterial strains compatible with T7 expression may also be considered. However, optimizing the expression conditions may be necessary for other strains.\nAdd 50 ng of each purified plasmid to 25 μL of competent cells separately, and gently mix by flicking the tubes.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min.\nPerform a heat shock by incubating the tubes at 42°C for 30 s.\nIncubate on ice for 5 min.",
    "Add 250 μL LB broth (without kanamycin) to each tube and incubate at 37°C while shaking at 230 RPM for 1 h.\nSpread each mixture on a prewarmed LB-kanamycin agar plate, let the plates air-dry on the bench and then grow overnight (16–24 h) at 37°C while the plates are upside down to avoid condensation on the culture.\nNote: Perform b-f for 25 μL untransformed competent cells as a control. If colonies are observed on the control plates, then repeat Step 2 using a fresh LB-kanamycin agar plate and make sure the concentration of kanamycin is correct.\nMaking an iMbody overnight culture.\nUsing sterile pipette tips, pick one colony from each transformed BL21 plate (five plates in total) to inoculate five separate 10 mL LB-kanamycin cultures and grow overnight (16–24 h) at 37°C while shaking at 230 RPM.\nMake a glycerol stock for each transformation by adding 250 μL glycerol to 1 mL overnight culture in a cryovial tube. Mix thoroughly and store at −80°C.\nPurify the plasmids from remaining 9 mL overnight culture for each transformation using a miniprep kit and store at −20°C.\nFor each transformation, verify the sequence of iMbody by sequencing utilizing T7 promoter forward and T7 terminal reverse primers.\nProceed to Step 4 if the iMbody sequence is confirmed by the sequencing results; otherwise, discard unverified minipreps and repeat Steps 2 and 3. Refer to problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section if the issue persists.\nProduction of iMbody\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section outlines the process for iMbody expression using a verified glycerol stock, with a focus on a 1-L culture. The protocol can be adapted by adjusting reagent quantities for larger cultures.\niMbody expression.",
    "Use a sterile pipette tip to get some bacteria from a verified iMbody glycerol stock and inoculate 50 mL of LB-kanamycin broth and grow overnight (16–24 h) at 37°C while shaking at 230 RPM.\nInoculate 990 mL of LB-kanamycin broth with 10 mL of the overnight culture in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask.\nGrow at 37°C while shaking at 230 RPM. Measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm) initially after 1 h, and then every 10 min thereafter.\nWhen OD600nm reaches to ∼ 0.4–0.5, induce the expression of iMbody by adding 1 mL of 1 M IPTG (final concentration of IPTG in the culture is 1 mM).\nContinue growing at 30°C while shaking at 230 RPM for 24 h.\nNote: Reducing the temperature from 37°C to 30°C decreases the likelihood of iMbody aggregation in the culture.\nNext day, reinduce the expression of iMbody by adding 0.5 mL of 1 M IPTG.\nContinue growing at 30°C while shaking at 230 RPM for another 24 h.\nDivide the culture over 3 × 500 mL polypropylene bottles and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nFilter the supernatant using a vacuum filter system and a 0.22-μm vacuum filter unit. Discard the pellets.\nNote: The filtered supernatant can be stored at 4°C for up to one week before purification.\nPurification of iMbody\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section provides instructions for the His-tag purification of iMbody and the subsequent concentration of the purified sample.\nCapturing His-tagged iMbody using Ni-NTA agarose resins.\nShake the Ni-NTA agarose resins container to mix it well.\nTransfer 0.5 mL resins to a 15 mL tube.\nWash the resins twice with 10 mL DPBS.\nResuspend the resin pellet in 1 mL of DPBS and add it to the filtered supernatant.",
    "Incubate for 1 h at 4°C on a roller at 40 RPM .\nRunning the sample through a gravity column.\nPrepare a gravity-flow chromatography column by running two column volume (CV) ddH2O and one CV DPBS through the column.\nFlow the supernatant-Ni-NTA resins mixture through the column.\nCollect the flow-through and store it at 4°C until running an SDS-PAGE gel.\nClose the gravity-flow column and incubate the resins with 30 mL of NPI-20 buffer in the column for 10 min.\nOpen the column and collect the NPI-20 and add it to the flow-through.\nElution of iMbody.\nClose the gravity-flow column and incubate the resins with 5 mL of NPI-500 buffer in the column for 5 min.\nCollect the eluted iMbody.\nMeasure the absorbance at 280 nm (A280nm).\nContinue with elution in 5 mL fractions until the A280nm value drops below 0.02. Typically, around five fractions are sufficient to elute all the bound iMbody from 1 L of supernatant.\nCombine all fractions in a 50 mL tube, measure the A280nm and keep the tube on ice.\nRegenerating the Ni-NTA agarose resins.\nClose the gravity-flow column and incubate the resins with 20 mL of NPI-500 buffer in the column for 20 min.\nCollect the NPI-500 buffer and dispose of it according to toxic material handling guidelines.\nIncubate the resins with 30 mL of 0.5 M NaOH for 30 min in the gravity-column.\nFlow-through the NaOH solution and wash the resins with 1 CV ddH2O.\nClose the gravity-flow column and collect the resins using 10 mL of 20% ethanol.\nNote: Regenerated Ni-NTA agarose resins appear bluish. Use regenerated resins only for purifying His-tagged iMbody. The resin can be stored at 4°C for several months.\nRinse the gravity-flow column using ddH2O.\nBuffer exchange and concentration of purified iMbody.",
    "Equilibrate an Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (10 kDa cutoff) using 10 mL of DBPS supplemented with 10% glycerol (DPBS-glycerol).\nAdd 5 mL DPBS-glycerol to the Amicon tube, top it up with 10 mL of eluted iMbody sample, and centrifuge at 3000 × g and 4°C for 7 min.\nCollect the flow-through, top up with more iMbody sample, and repeat the process until no iMbody sample remains.\nTop up the remaining iMbody sample in the Amicon tube with DPBS-glycerol and centrifuge at 3000 × g and 4°C for 7 min.\nRepeat Step 9-d until 50 mL of flow-through is achieved, ensuring the exchange of NPI-500 buffer with DPBS-glycerol.\nContinue the centrifugation until the upper chamber of the Amicon tube contains between 0.5 mL to 1 mL of concentrated sample.\nEquilibrate two Costar Spin-X centrifuge tubes with DPBS-glycerol.\nTransfer the concentrated iMbody sample to Costar Spin-X centrifuge tubes and centrifuge for 1 min at 10000 × g and 4°C.\nMeasure A280nm and determine the concentration of iMbody using physical parameters calculated by ExPASy8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) and the following formulas:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3145_4.csv\nM\no\nl\na\nr\nc\no\nn\nc\ne\nn\nt\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n(\nM\n)\n=\nA\n280\nn\nm\n(\n1\nc\nm\n)\nE\nx\nt\ni\nn\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\nc\no\ne\nf\nf\ni\nc\ni\ne\nn\nt\n(\n1\nM\nc\nm\n)\nM\na\ns\ns\nc\no\nn\nc\ne\nn\nt\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n(\ng\nL\n)\n=\nM\no\nl\na\nr\ni\nt\ny\n(\nm\no\nl\nL\n)\n×\nM\no\nl\ne\nc\nu\nl\na\nr\nw\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\n(\ng\nm\no\nl\n)",

Upon thawing an aliquot, it should be filtered using a Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube, and the concentration should be determined following the instructions in Step 9. Purified samples can be stored in a refrigerator (2°C–8°C) for up to one week. We strongly recommend filtering the sample and assessing the iMbody concentration before each use.\nPerforming ELISA using iMbody",
    "Timing: 2 days\nThis section delineates the ELISA procedure utilizing iMbody for the characterization of a putative iM-forming oligonucleotide. By incorporating the positive and negative controls specified in this protocol, this method can serve as a complement to other techniques, such as circular dichroism spectroscopy, used in the characterization of iM-forming oligonucleotides.\nPreparing DNA oligonucleotides.\nOrder 5′ Biotin-TEG conjugated DNA oligonucleotides as lyophilized samples.\nNote: Oligonucleotides used in this protocol are listed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nBriefly centrifuge the tube before opening it to avoid losing samples that might be attached to the cap.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3145_5.csv\nAll oligonucleotides are 5′-Biotin-TEG conjugated.\nReconstitute the oligonucleotide in nuclease-free water to make a 100 μM stock solution. This solution can then be further diluted using a preferred buffer.\nVortex thoroughly. If it is difficult to resuspend, heat the tube at 55°C for 10 min followed by vortexing and centrifugation.\nMeasure the concentration and purity of the stock solution. A ratio above 1.8 for Abs260nm/Abs280nm and Abs260nm/Abs230nm is generally considered as pure for DNA samples.\nThe stock solution of a DNA oligonucleotide can be stored at −80°C for at least 2 years.\nAnnealing DNA oligonucleotides.\nDilute an iM-forming oligonucleotide in 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 6 to a final concentration of 70 nM. Prepare a 60 μL DNA solution for each well and ensure at least duplicates for each condition.\nAnneal the oligonucleotide by heating at 95°C for 10 min followed by slowly cooling down to room temperature (∼ 22°C), and then keep it at 4°C overnight (16–24 h).\nNote: Control oligonucleotides should be diluted and annealed in appropriate buffers. For example, we dilute and anneal G-quadruplexes in 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2 supplemented with 100 mM KCl and double-stranded DNA in IDT nuclease-free duplex buffer.\nImmobilizing DNA oligonucleotides on a plate.",
    "Coat a 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plate by adding 50 μL per well of 50 μg/mL NeutrAvidin diluted in DPBS.\nShake the plate gently, seal it with a SealPlate film, and incubate overnight (16–24 h) at 4°C.\nAspirate the contents and wash one time with DPBS (250 μL per well).

Using iMbody in ELISA",
    "(A) ELISA represents the binding of 10 nM iMbody to four different iM-forming oligonucleotides and a range of controls.\n(B) ELISA shows the binding of serially diluted iMbody to iM-Myc oligonucleotide, which was annealed in the presence of various concentrations of SWNT-COOH or DMF (used to disperse SWNT-COOH). The plotted values represent the mean ± standard error of two replicates, obtained through a serial dilution of iMbody starting from 10 nM to 19.5 pM. Curve fitting was conducted using the \"One site - Specific binding\" equation in GraphPad Prism. The oligonucleotide sequences are provided in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nNote: To explore potential competition between a small molecule and iMbody, the iM-forming oligonucleotide should be annealed in the presence of the small molecule. For instance, we anneal iM-Myc oligonucleotide with final concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 μg/mL SWNT-COOH (dispersed in DMF), which has been demonstrated to recognize iMs.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19],20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] Additionally, we include a control sample containing only DMF (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). The rest of the protocol remains unchanged as described above.\nPerforming immunostaining using iMbody\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section provides a detailed procedure for visualizing iMs in HeLa cells using iMbody. This includes preparing the coverslips for the cell culture, seeding HeLa cells, and performing fixation and permeabilization to prepare them for immunostaining. The subsequent steps involve adding iMbody and appropriate secondary and tertiary antibodies, followed by mounting the coverslips on slides. Finally, the section outlines the microscopy and image acquisition process and provides guidance on post-imaging processing to visualize iMs within the cells.\nNote: The precise timing varies depending on the cell growth rate. The mentioned timing starts from the seeding day of HeLa cells.\nPreparing coverslips.\nAcid treat glass coverslips (#1.5) by submerging them in 1 M HCl and incubating at room temperature (∼22°C) at least for 3 h.",
