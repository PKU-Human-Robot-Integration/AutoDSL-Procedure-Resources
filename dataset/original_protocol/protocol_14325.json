    "This experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Expert Committee at First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, and was performed at the University experimental laboratory, Department of Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, in accordance with Act No. 246/1992 Coll., on the protection of animals against cruelty. All animals were treated and cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition, published by National Academies Press, 2011. All procedures were performed according to standard veterinary conventions and at the completion of each study, the animal was sacrificed and a necropsy performed. Due to suitable anatomy, five healthy crossbred female swine (Sus scrofa domestica) up to 6 months of age were included in this experiment. Their mean body weight was 66 ± 20 kg at the day of data collection.\n1. General Anesthesia\nAfter 1 day of fasting, initiate anesthesia by intramuscular administration of midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) and ketamine hydrochloride (15 - 20 mg/kg) to the gluteal region.\nInsert peripheral cannula into the marginal ear vein for intravenous drug applications.\nAdminister intravenous boluses of propofol (2 mg/kg) and morphine (0.1 - 0.2 mg/kg).\nProvide animals with oxygen via a facial mask and advance orotracheal intubation with a cuffed endotracheal tube with a diameter of 6.5 - 7.5 mm.\nContinue the total intravenous anesthesia by combination of propofol (6 - 12 mg/kg/h), midazolam (0.1 - 0.2 mg/kg/h), and morphine (0.1 - 0.2 mg/kg/h), adjusting the doses according to individual responses - suppress spontaneous breaths, corneal reflexes, and motoric response. Protect the animal's eyes with ointment to prevent dryness.",
    "Operate the mechanical ventilation by a closed-loop automatic device set to adaptive support ventilation to maintain target end-tidal CO2 of 38 - 42 mmHg and adequate hemoglobin saturation of 95 - 99%. Monitor all vital functions, especially heart rate and body temperature.\nAttach the animal by securing its legs gently to the operation table in the supine position.\nAdminister wide spectrum antibiotics - 1 g of cefazolin intravenously through the ear vein cannula.\n2. Ventricular Lead Implantation\nLocate surgical sites and shave the skin properly using a razor at (1) the jugular region above the sternocleidomastoid muscle and (2) the unilateral paravertebral region on the back side of the animal's neck.\nUsing the ultrasound vascular probe, visualize the external jugular vein and mark its location on the skin. Locate the carotid artery as well to prevent its injury.\nAfter the wide skin disinfection using povidone iodine, cover with a sterile surgical drape with the hole over the marked jugular region.\nPrepare all necessary tools for pacemaker implantation and keep them sterile. It is crucial to maintain a sterile environment throughout the procedure.\nCut the skin parallel above the external jugular vein, form a shallow subcutaneous pocket in soft tissue not more than 10 mm deep. Do not expose any large vessels.\nFrom the bottom of the preformed pocket, insert a sheath into the external jugular vein, using the standard Seldinger technique. First, insert a soft-tip guidewire through a 12G puncture needle, and then over the guidewire introduce a 7-French plastic tear away introducer sheath with a dilator.\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance, introduce a 58 cm pacing lead through this sheath and position its tip to the apex of the right ventricle. Then, remove the sheath and fixate the active tip of the electrode to the myocardium by screwing out its helix.",
    "Test the pacing parameters - the lead sensed signal from ventricular electrocardiogram and impedance must be stable, the pacing threshold should be below an amplitude of 1 V with 0.4 ms of pulse duration.\nPull a rubber sleeve on the pacing lead and fix both together to the bottom of the preformed jugular subcutaneous pocket by two non-absorbable suture braided thread stitches. Importantly, enough length of the pacing lead must be inserted, considering the future possible growth of the animal.\n3. Subcutaneous Lead Tunneling\nTurn the animal over on its side and disinfect the previously shaved skin region lateral to the backbone, then cover with a sterile surgical drape with a hole. Make sure the jugular subcutaneous pocket and the lead remain sterile.\nCut the skin lateral to the backbone and form a deep, spacious, subcutaneous pocket. Use dull preparation and stop any possible bleeding.\nTake a soft rubber extension tube from a sterile infusion set and cut off both its ends. Using a tunneling tool, preform a direct subcutaneous tunnel connecting the jugular and dorsal subcutaneous pockets with this extension tube.\nConnect the tube's free end to the ventricular lead by pulling it onto its IS-1 connector and draw the lead through the preformed tunnel into the dorsal subcutaneous pocket by pulling the tube dorsally. It may be useful to secure the connection with a silk tie.\nRemove both the tunneling tool and the extension tube, exposing the ventricular lead from the dorsal subcutaneous pocket.\n4. Pacemaker Implantation\nSet up the implantable dual-chamber heart pacemaker unit with the \"Y\" connecting part. The \"Y\" connection allows a convergent connection of both pacemaker outputs to be joined and connected together to the single pacing lead (Figure 1 and Figure 2). This setting will later provide a wide range of pacing frequencies.",
    "After connecting the pacing lead, fasten all the IS-1 connection screws in the pacemaker header unit and the \"Y\" lead connection.\nHide the whole pacing system in the deep dorsal pocket. There must be enough space to comfortably accommodate the pacemaker unit and any redundant lead.\nCheck the final pacing parameters. Make sure that cardiac ventricular pacing is possible from both pacemaker outputs.\nFlush with povidone iodine and close both subcutaneous pockets. Use absorbable braided thread to suture fibrous tissue layers and non-absorbable suture for skin adaptation.\n5. Postoperative Care\nObserve the animal carefully until it regains sufficient consciousness.\nContinue in a wide spectrum intravenous antibiotic regimen until the wounds are healed - cefazolin 1 g every 12 h. Administer analgesics in appropriate dosing, e.g., morphine 0.2 mg/kg every 6 - 12 h for 3 days by subcutaneous injection. If necessary, make dose adjustments to adequately prevent pain.\nPlace the animal in a comfortable, calm facility at room temperature. Allow free access to water and suitable alimentation.\nDress the wounds with sterile scrubs regularly to preserve clean healing.\nTo provide rest after the surgical procedure, keep the pacemaker inhibited by native heart rhythm for at least 3 days.\nRemove the non-absorbable skin sutures when fully healed, approximately 10 - 14 days after the procedure.\n6. Pacing Protocol\nStart the pacing protocol after an adequate resting period. Initially, increase the paced ventricular heart rate to 200 beats/min by setting the dual-chamber pacemaker to mode D00, 100 beats/min, and concomitantly adjusting the AV delay to 300 ms (to exactly match the pace to pace interval, see Table 1). Select the unipolar pacing in both outputs.",
    "Increase stepwise the paced heart rate to 220 beats/min after 1 week and to 240 beats/min after 2 weeks (Figure 3). Keep continuous pacing at this frequency unless it is not hemodynamically tolerated. If the HF progresses too quickly, reduce the paced heart rate before increasing it again after another week.\nUse auscultation of heart beat, ECG, and pacemaker interrogation daily to verify the heart rate and constant pacing parameters, including battery life.\n7. Heart Failure Induction and Monitoring\nEnsure regular care by a specialized veterinarian and monitor the animal's general health status. Clinical observations of increasing native heart and respiratory rates, evaluation of peripheral pulse oximetry, and reduction in spontaneous physical activity or appetite provide information about HF progression.\nUse the advantage of wireless transcutaneous pacemaker interrogation and, if possible, continuous ECG recording - frequent non-sustained ventricular tachycardias (VT) are a sign of severe HF progression.\nUse echocardiographic assessments to reveal the structural and functional heart changes. Pay attention to find an optimal image window according to porcine anatomy and heart dilation - for a typical 4 chamber view, place the transducer to the right just below the xiphoid and angle it to point to the neck or left shoulder. For short-axis views, use intercostal windows. Reduction of ventricular ejection fraction in native heart rhythm and atrioventricular regurgitations should be noticeable after a few weeks.\n\tNOTE: Significant interindividual differences of high rate ventricular pacing tolerance exist. Therefore, frequent monitoring and individually adapted adjustment of the pacing protocol are necessary.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57030/57030fig1.jpg",

To allow high rate cardiac pacing with the implanted in-house-modified dual-chamber pacemaker unit, the table shows the desired paced heart rate (HR) and matching pace to pace interval values. The pacemaker must be set to D00 operation mode at a rate of half of the desired HR, and the AV delay set to the corresponding pace to pace interval in milliseconds.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57030/57030fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Pacing protocol. The progressive phase of the TIC induction starts after a resting period of 3 days. Then, the pacemaker is set to D00 mode with a pacing frequency of 50% of the desired paced frequency, and AV delay is set to the matching pace to pace interval (see Table 1). Thanks to the \"Y\" shaped adapter, both pacemaker outputs are conducted to a single pacing lead. bpm = beats/minute.
