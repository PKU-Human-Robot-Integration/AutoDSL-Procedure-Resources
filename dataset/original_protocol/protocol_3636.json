The results are essential for researchers to design proper sgRNA and ssODNs.\nDesign genotyping primers\nThe SNP site centered 600 bp genomic DNA sequence was used to design genotyping primers.\nEnter the DNA sequence into Primer-BLAST tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome])(Ye et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) to design proper primers (amplicon length 200–400 bp, Tm value 60°C±3).\nThree paired primers were synthesized from Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany)\nA PCR reaction mixture as step 3 was setting up for testing primer specificities In brief, PCR reaction was carried out as step 4, and the PCR product was run on a 1.5% agarose gel. The primers that can yield for a single size of PCR fragment will be selected, and the PCR products are confirmed Sanger sequencing.\nCritical: If the PCR cycling condition does not work well for the primers, the gradient PCR should be taken into consideration to find the optimal annealing temperature.\nExtract genomic DNA from 22Rv1 cells using genomic DNA extraction kit, and dilute the DNA concentration to 5 ng/μL.\nSet up 50 μL PCR reaction mix as the following PCR reaction mixture.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_561_1.csv\nCarry out PCR under the following PCR cycling conditions, run the target DNA band in 1.5% agarose gel, purify the PCR fragment from the gel and send for genotyping.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_561_2.csv\nCritical: To keep the high fidelity of PCR product, PCR cycle number should be less than 35 in the conditions.\nInserting sgRNA into the vector pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro\nTiming: ∼7 days\nPrior to insert sgRNA into plasmid pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro, make sure to design and order proper sgRNA from a qualified company (e.g., Eurofins Genomics, (Ebersberg, Germany))\nPreparation of the sgRNA oligos for vector insertion",
    "Design sgRNAs that have cut site near the SNP using the online sgRNA design tool: https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design[href=https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design].\n100 μM top and bottom sgRNA were ordered from Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) and mixed gently in the 0.2 mL tubes according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_561_3.csv\nPut the tubes into the thermocycler for oligo annealing: 37°C for 30 min; 95°C for 5 min; ramp down to 25°C at 5°C per min.\nDilute the annealed oligos 200× using ddH2O.\nDigest plasmid pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro.\nPrepare the mixture in the 1.5 mL tubes according to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], and incubate the tubes at 37°C 12–16 h;\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_561_4.csv\n42 μL of the mixture was transferred to a new tube, 5 μL alkaline phosphatase buffer 10× and 3 μL alkaline phosphatase were added, incubate the tube at 37°C for 15 min; 50°C for 15 min.\nRun the digested product on 1% agarose gel, purify the plasmid by GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit, and dilute the digested plasmid to 25 ng/μL for next step.\nLigate the sgRNA and vector according to Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], incubate at 16°C 12–16 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_561_5.csv\nCritical: 1 μL of ddH2O instead of sgRNA in the ligation system served as a negative control. If there are many colonies on the negative control plate after step 8, the digest efficiency of the plasmids in step 6 should be lower. Thus, all the reagents in step 6 are recommended to be quality-checked. If the numbers of colonies on the experimental plate are rare as the negative control plate, all the reagents from step 7 should be assured in good quality. Alternatively, 2 μL of sgRNA can be added to enhance ligation efficiency.",
    "Transformation. Transfer 10 μL of ligation product into 100 μL of competent Stbl3 strain, incubate the mixture on ice for 1 h, heat-shock at 42°C for 90 s and return it immediately on ice for 3 min. The add 500 μL of LB medium (without antibiotic) and incubate at 37°C for 30 min, centrifuge the tube at 1500 × g 5 min, and remove 500 μL supernatant. Next, resuspend the bacteria in the rest of supernatant and spread it onto an LB plate containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Put the plate into the incubator 14–16 h at 37°C.\nPick single clone and place it in the tube containing 3 mL LB medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, then put the tube in the shaker at 37°C 12–16 h.\nCritical: More clones from one plate can be picked up at the same time to ensure get positive clone.\nPlasmids were purified and verified by using U6-Fwd primer for sequencing.\nCell culture and transfection\nTiming: ∼7 days\n22Rv1 cells were cultured according to the instructions from ATCC. One 10 cm plate of 70%–80% confluency cells was prepared for this experiment. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO2. At the same time, the SNP centered repair templates should be designed and ordered (ssODNs) from Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany).\nPrepare cells for transfection",
    "Remove the old medium and rinse the cells once by DPBS. Add 3 mL of Trypsin to 10 cm plate, put the plate in the cell culture incubator for 5 min at 37°C. 5 mL warm (37°C) RPMI-1640 medium was added in the plate to inactivate trypsin. Pipette the cells gently and transfer cell suspension into 15 mL tubes and spin at 600 × g, 5 min. The supernatant was removed, 4 mL fresh medium was added, and the cells were dissociated by gently and repeatedly pipetting. 0.5 mL of cells was added into 5 mL warm medium, homogenize cells in medium by pipetting, and then 0.5 mL of the mixture was transferred to each well in a 24-well plate. Notably, one more well should be added as control cells, and put in the cell culture incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\n12 h later, the medium was replaced with 0.5 mL fresh warm medium.\nCritical: Low density cells should be used to increase the transfection efficiency. Cells with 40%–50% confluency is ideal for transfection.\nPlasmid transfection\nThe Lipofectamine 2000 and DNA were diluted, respectively, with OptiMEM according to Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]. After 5 min incubation, combine the mixture #2 with mixture #1, incubate at 20°C –25°C- for 20 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_561_6.csv\nAdd the DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes to each well, mix gently by rocking.\n12 h later, the medium was changed with 0.5 mL fresh warm medium. At 24 h post transfection, puromycin selection can be applied at a final concentration of 0.7 μg/ mL. 48 h post transfection, cells should be passaged using medium with 0.7 μg/ mL puromycin.",
    "Optional: The plasmid with the SNP centered DNA fragment can also be used as repair template. The length of the DNA fragment is better less than 1 kb. During the transfection step, 350 ng of the repair vectors instead of ssODN is enough for one well of 24-well plate.\nCritical: 24-well plate is proper for single clone selection. 22Rv1 cells should be passaged every 4 days. The amount of vector pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro should not be more than 0.5 μg, too much amount of plasmid will cause cell death.\nIsolating clonal lines\nTiming: ∼20–30 days\nAfter three days, when the control cells all died in the medium with 0.7 μg/mL puromycin, the experiments are ready for isolating single cell clones.\nSeeding single cells in 10 cm plate.\nRemove the old medium, rinse the cells twice by DPBS, then twice by 0.5 mL trypsin immediately at 20°C–25°C. Aspirate 450 μL trypsin out of the well. Put the plate in the cell incubator at 37°C.\nCheck the cell status under microscope after 6–10 min, until all cells detached from dish, 1 mL warm 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS was added into each well for inactivating trypsin.\nDissociate cells by pipetting and transfer all the cell suspension into 1.5 mL tube.\nDilute the cells 20 × using DPBS, count the cells with hemocytometer.",
    "Take 100 or 200 cells from one tube and seed in 10 cm plate. Rest of the cells were seeded into 6-well plate. Check the density of cells in 10 cm plate in 1 h and observe cells under microscope magnifying 10×. Then randomly select five fields and count the cell numbers, with about 4–8 cells in total representing the best density. Dilute the cells again if the density of the cells is high or add more cells into 10 cm plate when the density of the cells is too low.\nCritical: To increase the efficiency, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is not recommend for seed single cell into 96-well plate, because cells are quite fragile after sorting and easily died during extended period of cultivation.\nPut the plates in the cell incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 18–25 days until the clones grow bigger enough for next step. The old medium was changed, and cells were checked every 5 days.\nOptional: Cells maintained in 6-well plate can be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen in case need them for future use.\nCritical: Lower amount of trypsin is useful to well separate adherent cells. In order to well dissociate adherent cells, do not shake or vibrate the plate before the cells were detached in step 13.\nPick single cell clones for genotyping\nTiming: ∼1–3 h\nWhen the clones are visible to the naked eyes, they are ready to be picked up from the 10 cm plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/561-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow of picking single clone for genotyping\n(A) 5 μL trypsin was aspirated in the pipette tip.\n(B and C) Scrap the clone from the plate by the pipette tips (B), then slowly release the push-button on the pipette to carefully aspirate the clone in the tip (C).",
    "(D) Transfer the single clone into one well of a 96-well plate with 20 μL trypsin and incubate 5 min at 37°C.\n(E and F) Inactivate trypsin and separate the adherent cells by pipetting (E), transfer 10 μL cell suspension from each well into a 96-well PCR plate (F).\nAdd 20 μL trypsin into each well of 96-well plate.\nTake out the 10 cm plate from cell incubator, discard the old medium completely, add 4 mL DPBS into the plate. Be sure that the DPBS will not spill out while rotating the plate.\nSingle clone isolation.\nUse the 10 μL pipette tips to pick clones with moderate size. When pick clones from 10 cm plate, we recommend aspirate 5 μL trypsin first in the pipette tip, and then pipette it out on the clone and hold the push-button.\nScrap the clone from the plate by the pipette tips, then slowly release the push-button on the pipette to carefully aspirate the cell clone in the tip.\nTransfer these single clones quickly into the wells of a 96-well plate.\nCritical: Change the position after selecting one single clone or remember to rotate the plate frequently to prevent the plate dry out.\nOptional: Cloning cylinders is an alternative choice for picking single clones.\n24–36 single clones from each plate with different genotyped (GG or AA repair template) were picked up and incubated at 37°C for 5 min. Then 30 μL medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS was added into each well of 96-well plate to inactivate trypsin. Pipetting the cells to separate the adherent cells.\nAfter that, transfer 10 μL cell suspension from each well into a 96-well PCR plate for step 23.",
    "100 μL fresh medium was added into each well. The 96-well plate was put back to the cell incubator. 24 h later, change the old medium of the 96-well plate with fresh medium to remove the containing trypsin.\nCritical: To avoid the cells exposure in trypsin too long time, we recommend continue step 20 after picked 24 single clones into one 96-well plate. If there are more clones, use a new plate to repeat steps 19 and 20.\nGenotyping cell clones\nTiming: ∼4–5 days\nAfter collecting all the samples from step 21, it is ready for DNA extraction and genotyping.\nAdd 20 μL QuickExtract solution to each well of PCR plate (from step 21) with 10 μL cell suspension. Mix by pipetting gently, then put the plate in PCR machine and run the following PCR program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_561_7.csv\nPause Point: Extracted DNA can be stored at –20°C for 12 months.\nPrepare PCR mix with 4 μL DNA from step 23 as follows .\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_561_8.csv\nCritical: The amount of DNA cannot be accurately measured. A test PCR of 10 μL system is necessary to ensure that you can get target band before using 50 ul PCR reaction system.\nOptional: The amount of DNA can also be measured by the Qubit fluorometer if the results of PCR testing are not good. Moreover, this may help researchers to find reasons why there is no band from PCR.\nRun the PCR cycling conditions of step 4.\nRun the PCR product in 1.5% agarose gel, cut the gel and purify DNA using the GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit.\nOptional: If your genotyping primer is quite specific, the primer dimers can be removed from the PCR product and send directly for sequencing.",
    "Critical: Genotype the clones as soon as possible, before the cell clones become confluence in 96-well plate. The clones in 96-well plate should be checked every day. If genotyping results were not obtained timely, the confluent cells need to be transferred to a 24-well plate for further culture until the genotyping results came out.\nPassage cell clones\nTiming: ∼14–30 days\nThe culture expansion of the cells with successfully converted SNP genotypes should be done after the genotyping step.\nWhen cells reach 50%–70% confluence, remove the old medium, and rinse the cells twice by DPBS. Add 50 μL of Trypsin, incubate at 37°C for 5 min. 100 μL medium was added to inactivate trypsin, dissociate cells by pipetting and transfer all the cell suspension into the wells prefilled with 500 μL fresh medium in 24-well plate.\nCritical: The cells in the 96-well plate usually grow very slowly, and remember to change the medium every three days until the cells are confluent for passaging. Earlier transfer of the cells to bigger plate may cause cell death when the density of the cells is too low."
