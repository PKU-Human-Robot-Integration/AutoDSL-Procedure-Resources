    "The Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Tübingen and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile approved the following rtfMRI protocol.\n1. Hardware set-up\nThe hardware represented in Figure 1 is prepared only once to set up the real-time export of the MRI data.\nPreparation of the MRI room is the same as the traditional fMRI measurement. Prepare the MRI room before arrival of the participant.\nAttach the 32 or 20 channels head coil to the scanner.\nConnect the projector’s VGA/HDMI cable and MR compatible response device (button box) to the stimulus computer.\n\tNOTE: In most of the MR set-up, the response device delivers the TR-trigger to the stimulus computer. This trigger helps to synchronize stimulus presentation and data acquisition.\n2. Participant preparation outside of the scanner\nPrepare the consent form and questionnaires that participants need to fill out before their arrival.\nOnce the participant arrives, explain the experiment and fMRI technique. Also, instruct the participant on how to perform the task (e.g., during the experiment, participants must keep their eyes open and always look at the pictures on display screen, and they should try not to move their heads inside the scanner).\nAsk the participant to sign the consent form and fill in the questionnaires required to assess craving levels.\nAsk participants to fill out the following questionnaires: 1) VAS-C: Visual Analogue Scale, Craving39, 2) QSU-b: Questionnaire of Smoking Urges–Brief Version40, and 3) cigarettes per day.\nAsk the participant to exhale through the carbon monoxide (CO) measuring device.",
    "NOTE: CO measurement41 indicates whether or not the participant refrains from smoking at least 3 h before arrival for the neurofeedback session. CO is measured in ppm (parts per million). Low CO values indicate that the participant did not smoke for at least a couple of hours prior to arrival. Participants should be asked to refrain from smoking so that the craving cues elicit high craving during the experiment. Participants with high CO values will be cautioned prior to the future neurofeedback session to ensure that they refrain from smoking before the rtfMRI session. Participants who do not refrain from smoking twice should be excluded from the study.\n3. Participant positioning\nNOTE: The procedure of participant positioning on the scanner table is similar to the traditional fMRI experiment.\nAsk the participant to remove all metallic objects from his or her pockets before entering the MRI room.\nAsk the participant to insert ear plugs before he or she lies down on the scanner table in a supine position.\nUse pads to fix the head position of the participant inside the head coil. This step helps to reduce head movement during the measurement.\nLock the upper part of the head coil and fix the mirror to the head coil.\nGive the response device to the participant and place the response device according to the comfort of the participant.\nAsk the participant to close his or her eyes and mark the reference head position of the participant in between the eyebrows using laser light.\nMove the scanner table to place the marked position to the center of the MRI bore.",
    "Confirm with the participant that he or she is in comfortable position and that he or she can see the visual stimuli projected on the screen behind the scanner using the mirror. Adjust the mirror, if required.\n4. Data acquisition\nDuring the initial scans, ask the participant to close his or her eyes and try not to move the head.\nStart the measurement with a localizer pulse sequence. This sequence is typically used to determine the slice position of the subsequently run anatomical scan and functional (EPI sequence) scans.\nSelect the field of view (FOV) for the anatomical scan with the following parameters: TR = 11.5 ms, TE = 5 ms, 176 slices without slice gap, FOV = 240 x 240mm2, matrix = 256 x 256, flip angle = 18°, providing 1 mm3 isotropic voxels. The FOV of the sequence will cover the whole head of the participant.\nThe field of view for the functional (EPI sequence) scan is aligned to the anterior commissure/posterior commissure line (AC-PC line). Adjust the position of the slices to cover the target region of interest. The parameters of the sequence are the following: TR = 1.5, FOV = 192 mm, 25 slices, voxel = 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm, flip angle = 70°.\n5. FMRI neurofeedback\nAlert the participant that the neurofeedback run is starting and repeat the instructions provided earlier (e.g., that during the baseline, a block is represented by a “+” sign).",
    "NOTE: The participant must observe the image on the display screen. On the other hand, during the regulation block, represented by an arrow in a downward direction, participants should try to detach themselves from craving urges using some cognitive strategies. The amount of money shown at the end of each regulation block represents their performance. A higher amount of money represents better performance.\nPerform the neurofeedback run in which the baseline and regulation blocks are alternating (30 s each; Figure 2).\nOn the stimulus computer, run the stimulus code written presentation software and press the Enter button after Ready appears on the screen. Presentation code is now waiting for the trigger to start the neurofeedback run.\n\tNOTE: The code is in sync with the TR triggers coming from the scanner. Therefore, it is the first step in preparation of running the neurofeedback run.\nOn the analysis computer, run the in-house MATLAB toolbox and turbo brain voyager (TBV).\nIn the MATLAB toolbox, enter the information specific to the participant, such as patient ID and neurofeedback run number.\nPress Generate protocol files to prepare the protocol file using the information inserted in step 5.5.\n\tNOTE: The protocol file contains information related to the condition timing (e.g., the time at which TR a specific condition should start and which stimulus to be presented). It will be used by both the MATLAB toolbox and TBV.\nPress the button execute on the GUI of the MATLAB toolbox. The code is now waiting to receive data from the TBV.\nIn the TBV, select the protocol file generated in step 5.6. In addition, select the .roi file generated from the previous neurofeedback sessions.",
    "NOTE: Selecting an ROI file is important, as it will avoid crashing of the TBV software during the initial (10 TRs) period of the neurofeedback run.\nPrepare the EPI sequence to be implemented in the MR host computer. Press the start button in the TBV.\nRedraw the target ROIs in the TBV software according to the anatomical landmarks. The shape and size of the ventricles in the brain are used as landmarks to select the anterior insula. In addition, the wavy shape of the insular cortex is used precisely select the voxels related to bilateral anterior insula.\nDraw an ROI on the primary motor area (M1) using the central sulcus as an anatomical landmark. The primary motor area acts as a reference ROI to remove the effect of global BOLD increases and BOLD fluctuations due to head movement.\nAt the end of each neurofeedback session, ask the participant, “What cognitive strategy were you using during the regulation block?”. In addition, ask the participant about his or her comfort level and whether or not she or she wishes to continue with the experiment.\nAfter four neurofeedback runs, select the radio button Yes for the transfer run.\n\tNOTE: A transfer run is similar to the neurofeedback run. However, participants perform self-regulation in absence of feedback. This helps to determine whether the learned self-regulation is transferred to the situation in which the participant will not receive neurofeedback (e.g., outside the scanner).\n6. Control group\nInstruct the participants in the control group in the same manner as those in the experimental group. However, provide Yolked feedback to the participants.",
    "NOTE: In yoked feedback, the average amount of reinforcement (money) in both the experimental and control groups remains the same. The only difference between the two groups is contingency of the feedback provided to participants. For participants in the control group, the total amount of reinforcement (money) is distributed among the randomly assigned 40% of the downregulation trials. However, in the other 60% of trials, participants receive negative feedback (zero Euros). Thus, the participants in the control group do not get contingent feedback.\n7. Offline analysis\nPreprocessing of fMRI data\n\t\nUse a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) toolbox to preprocess the fMRI data (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ext/).\nConvert the fMRI data in DICOM format to NIFTI format using format conversion utility of the SPM batch function.\nRemove the initial 10 scans from each neurofeedback run data to avoid gradient equilibration effects42.\nPerform the realignment process to remove motion artifacts and align all the volumes to the first volume of the session. In addition, perform time slice correction to compensate for the slice acquisition delay43.\nConduct segmentation of the anatomical scan, coregistration of the EPI sequence data and the anatomical data, and normalization to map the subject space data to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard brain template44.\nUsing our in-house MATLAB code, extract the BOLD signals from cube-shaped ROIs created around the MNI coordinates corresponding to the bilateral anterior insula and primary motor cortex.\nCalculation of percentage change in the BOLD signal\n\t\nCalculate the percentage change in the BOLD signal based on the average change in BOLD signal for each ROI during the regulation block compared to the previous baseline block. The equation for percentage change in the BOLD signal is the following:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59441/59441eq1v2.jpg\nAnalysis of explicit smoking behavior of participants",
    "Import the participant responses to questionnaires (i.e., QSU-b, VAS-C, CO measure, and cigarettes per day) to MATLAB.\nTest normality of the data using a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test from MATLAB.\nA one-sample t-test should be used to compare responses of different questionnaires for each participant, and a paired sample t-test to compare scores between the experimental and control groups.\nAnalysis of the implicit attitude towards craving-eliciting cues\n\t\nExtract the reaction time (RT) of affective priming trials for each participant from the log files generated by presentation software.\nRemove the outliers based on the RT (i.e., do not include trials with a RT longer than the 2x the standard deviation of the mean RT of the participant).\nTest normality of the data using a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test from MATLAB.\nCompare downregulation effects on the median reaction times of unique combinations of primes (craving-inducing and neutral images) and targets (positive and negative words) for each participant, and compare between the experimental and control groups using a paired wise t-test.\nSubscription Required.
