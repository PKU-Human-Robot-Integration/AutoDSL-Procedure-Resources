    "Crosslinking and lysis of mammalian cells and fly tissuesMouse Neuro-2a cellsGrow mouse Neuro-2a cells to a level of ~106 cells per 10 cm Petri-dish. For this experiment, use ~106 cells. Aspirate and discard the medium. Wash two times each with 4 ml 1x PBS pre-warmed in a 37 °C water bath. Add 1 ml trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and incubate at 37 °C for 2 min. Quench by adding 3 ml standard cell culture medium. Collect the mixture into a 15 ml centrifuge tube.Add 108 μl of 37% formaldehyde (Sigma, USA) to a final concentration of 1% (weight/volume) for crosslinking. Rotate at room temperature for 10 min.Stop crosslinking with 200 μl of 2.5 M glycine (Sigma, USA) for 5 min at room temperature. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet by adding 1 ml ice-cold 1x PBS with 1x cOmplete proteinase inhibitor (Roche, Germany), and transfer it into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. After removing the supernatant, wash the pellet two times each with 1 ml ice-cold 1x PBS containing 1x cOmplete proteinase inhibitor (Roche, Germany).Add 1 ml of 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma, USA) supplemented with 1x cOmplete proteinase inhibitor (Roche, Germany). Incubate at 4 °C for 30 min.Fly tissuesFor developmental stages, use 1,000 embryos (30 min-1 h after egg-laying), 30 larvae (96 h after egg-laying), and 30 pupae (7 d after egg-laying). For adult stage, use 100 dissected fly muscles and 200 fly heads at each time point.Collect samples into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and immediately freeze samples in liquid nitrogen.Grind tissues into fine powder using mortar and pestle pre-cooled with liquid nitrogen.Resuspend the fine powder in 1.2 ml 1x PBS. Add 32.",
    "4 μl of 37% formaldehyde (Sigma, USA). Incubate at room temperature for 10 min. To quench formaldehyde, add 60 μl of 2.5 M glycine (Sigma, USA). Centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. After removing the supernatant, wash the pellet three times with 1 ml ice-cold 1x PBS containing 1x cOmplete proteinase inhibitor (Roche, Germany).Add 1 ml of 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma, USA) supplemented with 1x cOmplete proteinase inhibitor (Roche, Germany). Homogenize the tissue pellet with a glass Dounce tube, and transfer it into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Rotate at 4 °C for 1 h.SonicationSplit the lysate into 250 μl aliquots for four pre-chilled 1.5 ml Bioruptor microtubes (Diagenode, Belgium).For mouse Neuro-2a cells, sonicate at 4 °C using Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode, Belgium) for 6 cycles with 15 sec on and 15 sec off. For fly tissues, sonicate at 4 °C using Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode, Belgium) for 15 cycles with 30 sec on and 30 sec off.Transfer sonicated samples into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Store sonicated samples at -80 °C.Determination of chromatin size and concentrationUse 30 μl aliquot of chromatin sample from the sonicated lysate, and add 90 μl of 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma, USA).Add 1 μl RNase A (Thermo Scientific, USA), and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min to remove RNA.To reverse crosslinking, add 5.04 μl of 5 M NaCl (Thermo Scientific, USA), and incubate at 65 °C for 4 h.Add 1.5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (Thermo Scientific, USA) and 1.2 μl of 20 mg/μl proteinase K (Sangon Biotech, China) at 55 °C for 2 h.Isolate DNA by PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Germany), and elute DNA in 30 μl of Milli-Q water.",
    "Quantify DNA by Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). A concentration of about 2-3 ng/μl DNA (~30 μl) would be expected from 200 fly heads. Examine the chromatin DNA on a 1.5% agarose gel to visualize average size. The optimal size range is between 100 bps and 300 bps. If the chromatin is not in that range, adjust sonication conditions by adding more pulses and repeat Step C3.Chromatin immunoprecipitationAccording to the DNA mass (the volume of fly sample x the concentration of fly sample measured in Procedure C), add 5% (weight/weight) of the mouse epigenome to the fly sample, and mix well. Save 1% (volume/volume) of the sample to a new tube as ChIP input control, and freeze at -20 °C until the elution step.Add 3 μg antibody, and rotate at 4 °C for 5 h.Place a magnetic stand (Thermo Scientific, USA) on ice. Add 30 μl Dynabeads (Thermo Scientific, USA) to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and wash three times with 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma, USA). Collect beads using magnetic stand (Thermo Scientific, USA), and remove supernatant by aspiration.Add samples (Fly + Mouse Neuro-2a + antibody) to the pre-washed Dynabeads (Thermo Scientific, USA). Gently mix overnight on a rotator at 4 °C.Apply ChIP sample to an ice-cold magnetic stand (Thermo Scientific, USA). Remove supernatant by aspiration.Wash the beads one time with 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma, USA).Wash the beads two times with ChIP Wash Buffer.Wash the beads one time with ChIP Final Wash Buffer.Elution, crosslinking reversal and DNA isolationResuspend the beads in 120 μl of ChIP Elution Buffer.

A concentration of about 0.15-0.3 ng/μl DNA (~50 μl) would be expected from one experiment of immunoprecipitation.Quality control for ChIP experimentPerforming ChIP-qPCR assaysDesign primers to yield PCR product between 100 bps and 200 bps.Dilute input DNA with RIPA buffer to the same concentration with IP DNA.Set up real-time PCRs in triplicate with SYBR selected master mix (Thermo Scientific, USA), and the same volume of diluted input DNA and IP DNA.Mix the samples by vortexing for 2 sec and precipitate samples by brief centrifugation.Perform real-time PCR with the QuantStudio 6 Flex real-time PCR system (Thermo Scientific, USA) using cycling conditions as shown in the flowing table:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180813/20180813025709_0500.jpgCalculate the fold difference between the experimental sample and negative control.Preparing high-throughput sequencing libraryUse 5-10 ng of DNA harvested by ChIP experiment to generate sequencing library using NEB DNA library prep kit (NEB, USA).Check the quality of libraries with Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, USA).Perform quantification by qRT-PCR with a reference to a standard library.Pool the libraries together in equimolar amounts to a final 2 nM concentration.Denature the normalized libraries with 0.1 M NaOH (Sigma, USA).Sequence the pooled libraries on the Miseq/Next-seq platform (Illumina, USA) with single end 100 bps."
