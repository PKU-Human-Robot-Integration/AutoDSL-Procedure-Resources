    "1. Planning a DoE Strategy\nIdentify relevant factors and responses for inclusion in the design.\n\t\nDefine one or several responses for measurement. Here, 2G12 and DsRed expression levels were used (μg/ml), including the minimum detectable difference regarded as relevant (10 and 20 μg /ml, respectively) and an approximate value for the estimated standard deviation of the system (4 and 8 μg/ml, respectively) based on previous experiments.\nUse the available literature, data from previous experiments or specialized screening designs (e.g. a factorial design, see the introduction) to select significant factors whose impact on the responses will be quantified (Table 1) 7,8,19,20.\nAllocate the factor types (numeric or categoric) and select ranges within which the numeric factors will be varied during the DoE investigation (Table 1).\nIdentify numeric factors for which continuous variation is difficult to implement.\n\t\t\nAvoid using continuous variation for factors that cannot be adjusted precisely to a certain level. e.g. Incubation temperature can typically be controlled only within ±2 °C, therefore continuous variation using values such as 27.2 °C, 25.9 °C, and 29.3 °C must be avoided.\nInstead, select a number of discrete levels for these factors (Table 1). The number of levels should match the anticipated base model (step 1.2). This is only important for optimal designs, because central composite designs always have discrete factor levels.\nAssign whether a categoric factor is nominal, i.e. no implied order (e.g. different manufacturers), or ordinal and thus a discrete numeric parameter (e.g. different leaves on a plant).\nSelect the levels for both types of categoric factors.\nSelect a useful base model.",
    "Based on the preliminary experiments and literature, anticipate the relation between each factor and the response as well as factor interactions and the response. For example, linear (the more the better), quadratic (single optimum or nonlinear increase/decrease) or cubic (skewed optimum).\nMake sure that the number of levels for discrete numeric factors is n + 1, with n being the polynomial degree of the relation between factor and response. For example, if temperature is expected to have a quadratic effect on the response, n = 2 and hence at least three temperature levels should be investigated to achieve a fit to the quadratic effect.\nDefine the fraction of design space (FDS) for which the prediction variance should be below a certain threshold (alpha level). The FDS should be >0.95 (cover more than 95% of the design space) to achieve models that yield robust predictions throughout the entire design space 21-23 .\n\tNote: A threshold of 0.05 corresponds to a 5% significance level (type I error) and is a typical value. Increasing this value will reduce the number of experiments required for a DoE strategy but will simultaneously increase the likelihood that significant effects will be missed and that estimates of their impact on the response will be incorrect.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51216/51216table1.jpg\nTable 1. Factors affecting transient protein expression in tobacco including the variation ranges during DoE. Factors in bold were only included in the design for the experiments described under \"A descriptive model for DsRed accumulation during transient expression using different promoter/5'UTRs\" whereas factors in italics were only included in the design for \"Optimizing incubation conditions and harvest schemes for the production of monoclonal antibodies in plants using transient expression\".\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51216/51216fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. DoE planning process. Factors with a significant impact on the response under investigation are selected based on available data. Then factor attributes (e.g. numeric), ranges and levels are assigned. Previous knowledge and experiments are used to define a suitable base model. The predictive power requirements are defined based on the application/purpose of the final model. The compiled data can then be transferred into appropriate DoE software.\n2. Setting up a RSM in DesignExpert\nStart DesignExpert and select \"New Design\". In the \"Response Surface\" window, choose \"Optimal\" and enter the number of numeric and categoric factors selected in section 1.1).\nEnter factor names, units, types, sub-types, number of levels/level borders and values for the levels for all factors in the corresponding fields.\nContinue to the next page and under \"Search\" options select \"Best\" as well as the desired \"Optimality\" criterion, here \"D-optimal\".\nIn the \"Edit model…\" menu, select the model that contains the factors and interactions anticipated in section 1.2). If uncertain, select a full model that covers all factors and interactions for a certain polynomial degree, here \"Quadratic\". Note that selecting a full model (containing all interactions) can increase the number of experiments required for the DoE.\nSelect the number of \"Blocks\". Here, a single block was used because all plants were from the same batch, all bacteria had been cultured simultaneously and all injections were carried out on the same day by the same operator. Use more than one block if more than one batch of plants is used or several operators handle the injections.\nBalance the design\n\t\nEnable \"Force categoric balance\" in order to distribute the runs of the experiment evenly among the categoric factor levels, e.g. different promoters that are tested.",
    "Note: this can reduce the optimality of the design to a degree that DesignExpert will report as a % value depending on the points selected by the optimality algorithm.\nRecalculate the design several times using the implemented random seed algorithm to minimize the reduction in optimality.\n\t\tNote: losses in optimality can range from ~3-40% using the same input data, but changing the number of replicates can be used to maintain categoric balance.\nThe software will suggest a value for the number of \"Model points\" based on the base model, here 70 runs. Adjust the number of runs for \"Replicates\" and \"To estimate the lack of fit\" to ensure it is >5% of the number of \"Model points\" for each, here 10 runs each.\nContinue to the next page, select the number of responses and enter their names and units. Additional responses can also be added at any time during data evaluation without any negative impact on the design.\nContinue to start the algorithm, calculating the factor levels for the runs of the DoE. If the selected base model does not match the number of levels for a certain factor, a notification will be displayed and the calculation will not start. In this case either:\n\t\nIncrease the number of levels for this factor; or\nDeselect the terms in the base model that cannot be calculated based on the current number of levels.\nFor example, if there are two levels for the factor \"Incubation time\" t (i.e. 2 d and 5 d) in the current design and a quadratic base model including the term t2 was selected, either add a third level for t (i.e. 8 d) or remove the factor t2 from the model.\nSave the spreadsheet containing the optimal factor combinations that is displayed once the calculation is complete.",
    "In the \"Design\" node select the \"Evaluation\" sub-node and go to the \"Graphs\" tab.\n\t\nIn the \"Graphs tool\" select \"FDS\" and in the \"FDS Graph\" box choose \"Pred\" as the error type. Then enter the minimum detectable difference as well as the approximate value for the estimated standard deviation of the system defined in section 1.1.1) as values for \"d\" and \"s\" respectively (here 20 and 8 μg/ml for DsRed). Also enter the alpha level (acceptable % missing a significant effect) suitable for the application, typically 0.05 (5%).\nMake sure that the calculated FDS matches the percentage defined in section 1.3) (typically >0.95 for predictive models). A flat curve in the FDS plot is preferable, indicating uniform prediction accuracy throughout the design space.\n\t\t\nIf this is not the case (as found here, FDS was 1% as shown in Figure 3A), go back to the \"Design\" node and in the task bar select \"Design Tools\", then \"Augment Design…\" and choose \"Augment\".\nSelect the same \"Search\" and \"Optimality\" criteria as before. Also chose the same \"Edit model\" and \"Force categoric balance\" settings. If the design augmentation is performed before any experiment (as done here), then change the \"Put runs into block\" setting to \"Block1\".\nIn the \"Runs\" section enter the number of additional \"Model points\", maintaining at least 5% \"Replicates\" and \"To estimate lack of fit\" in the total design. Here, 100 additional runs were added and no \"Replicates\" and \"To estimate lack of fit\" were included.\nOnce the calculation has finished, reexamine the FDS graph as described above. If the FDS is still not satisfactory, repeat the design augmentation as described above. Here the FDS was 100% after augmentation and thus no further augmentation was needed (Figure 3B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51216/51216fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3.  Comparison of FDS plots. A. A DoE consisting of 90 runs produces an insufficient FDS of only 1% for the standard error of prediction, using a quadratic base model in combination with the values for the minimum detectable difference (20 μg/ml) and estimated standard deviation of the system (8 μg/ml). B. Augmentation of the DoE to a total of 210 runs achieved a 100% FDS and a flat curve indicating uniform precision of the model throughout the design space.\n3. Cloning and Analysis of Expression Cassettes\nCultivate Escherichia coli in 5 ml LB medium (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 170 mM NaCl, 50 mg/L ampicillin; for LB-agar plates include 15 g/L agar) at 37 °C for 6-8 hr or overnight on an orbital shaker at 160 rpm. CAUTION: ampicillin is a harmful substance. Inoculate the LB medium with either 50 μl of liquid culture or transfer cells from colonies grown on plates using a pipette tip.\nFor the purification of pSo plasmid DNA, and other derivatives of pPAM (GenBank AY027531), from E. coli K12 strain DH5a, follow the instructions in the DNA purification kit manual 24 . CAUTION: the purification kit contains harmful chemicals (see above manual for details). The plasmid sequence is described in Figure 4 and by Buyer et al. 20 .\nDetermine the DNA concentration in the purified eluate by measuring the absorbance of a 2 μl sample at 260 nm in a NanoDrop device.\nConfirm the identity of the purified plasmid DNA by digestion with restriction endonucleases (REs).",
    "Select the REs according to the plasmid sequence so that unique and distinguishable fragment patterns are generated. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for the digestion conditions such as reaction volume, time, temperature and concentration of the stabilizer bovine serum albumin. Depending on the sensitivity the analysis device, use 50-500 ng of plasmid DNA per digestion.\nPrepare 0.8-2.0% gels for the separation of DNA fragments by boiling agarose in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (90 mM Tris, 90 mM borate, 2 mM EDTA; pH 8.0). The larger the expected fragments, the less agarose should be used in the gel.\nAdd 5 μl of five-fold sample buffer (5x SABU, 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 10% (w/v) glycerol dissolved in TBE) to 50 μl of the RE-treated DNA sample and separate the fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis at 100 V for ~40 min or until clear separation of the fragments is achieved. On each gel, include a lane containing DNA ladder size markers for comparison, e.g. 2-3 μl 1-kb ladder.\nReplace the omega 5'UTR in pSo with one of the other three 5'UTRs.\n\t\nRelease the omega 5'UTR sequence from ~4 μg purified pSo DNA by treatment with 20 units of EcoRI-HF and NcoI-HF REs in NEBuffer 4 at 37 °C for ~60 min. Then separate the fragments as described in sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3.\nIsolate the larger fragment (pS, \"backbone\") from the agarose gel using a gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's manual 25 and determine the concentration of the purified DNA as described in section 3.3). CAUTION: the gel extraction kit contains harmful chemicals, see the manual for details.",
    "Isolate the CHS, CHS-LPH and TL 5'UTRs from suitable donor vectors by treating ~10 μg of each vector with 20 units of EcoRI-HF and NcoI-HF REs in NEBuffer 4 at 37 °C for ~60 min. Then separate the fragments as described in sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 and purify the smaller 5'UTR-containing fragment as described in section 3.5.2.\nLigate the isolated purified 5'UTRs in separate aliquots to the isolated purified linear pS vector at 25 °C for 5 min according to the manufacturer's recommendations 26. Use ~50 ng of vector DNA and a three-fold molar excess of 5'UTR DNA in a total volume of 20 μl.\nTransformation E coli cells with the recombinant plasmids 26,27.\n\t\nAdd ~10 ng (~4-5 μl) of ligation mixture (see section 3.5.4) to 50 μl RbCl competent E. coli and mix gently, and then incubate for 30-60 min on ice. Heat shock for 1.5 min at 42 °C and chill on ice for 5-30 min.\nAdd 950 μl of antibiotic-free LB medium and incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C and 160 rpm. For the selection of transformants, spread 50 and 100 μl of the culture on LB agar plates containing ampicillin and incubate for ~16-20 hr at 37 °C.\nInoculate 5-10 separate colonies representing each promoter-5'UTR ligation described in section 3.1 into 5-ml aliquots of LB medium containing ampicillin. Then purify the plasmid DNA and confirm its identity as described in sections 3.2 to 3.4.\nReplace the 35SS promoter with the nos promoter in each of the four 5'UTR plasmids using AscI and EcoRI REs in NEBuffer 4 at 37 °C for 1 hr as described in sections 3.5 and 3.6.\nIntroduce each of the eight resulting plasmids into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101:pMP90RK by electroporation 28.",
    "Add ~500 ng of purified plasmid DNA to 50 μl competent A. tumefaciens cells on ice. Gently mix and transfer into a prechilled 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette. Make sure that the mixture is at the bottom of the cuvette and does not contain bubbles.\nPulse cells at 2.5 kV for 5 msec and confirm the intensity and duration of the pulse.\nAvoid elevated salt concentrations in the DNA sample or incorrect preparation of the competent A. tumefaciens cells because these can result in high ion currents causing instant vaporization of the cell suspension, greatly reducing transformation efficacy.\nAdd 950 μl of YEB medium without antibiotics (5 g/L beef extract, 1 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L peptone, 5 g/L sucrose, 2 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0), gently mix and transfer immediately into a sterile 1.5-ml reaction tube. Incubate for 2-4 hr at 26-28 °C and 160 rpm.\nSpread 1-2 μl onto YEB agar plates containing antibiotics (50 mg/L carbenicillin, 25 mg/L kanamycin, 25 mg/L rifampicin) for the selection of transformants. CAUTION: rifampicin is a toxic substance.\nInoculate three 5-ml aliquots of YEB medium containing antibiotics with cells from separate colonies representing each promoter-5'UTR ligation and incubate for 48-72 hr at 26-28 °C and 160 rpm.\nConfirm the success of A. tumefaciens transformation.\n\t\nTransfer 2 μl of each aliquot from section 3.8.6 to separate 48 μl aliquots of PCR mastermix (2 μl of each 10 μM primer stock (400 nM final concentration of each primer), 1 μl 10 mM dNTP mix (200 μM final concentration of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate), 5 μl 10-fold Expand High Fidelity buffer with 15 mM MgCl2, 0.75 μl Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix, and 39.25 μl sterile distilled water).",

Here, 94 °C was used for initial denaturation followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 15 sec, 51 °C annealing for 30 sec and 72 °C elongation for 120 sec, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 8 min.\nDetermine the size of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in section 3.4.3.\nPrepare A. tumefaciens glycerol stocks by mixing 500 μl 50% (v/v) sterile glycerol with 500 μl of A. tumefaciens cultures from section 3.8.6 for which transformation has been confirmed (section 3.9.3). Store the glycerol stocks at -80 °C until further use.\nCalculate the folding energies of the different mRNAs using the RNAfold webserver 29 and include the nucleotide sequence from the transcriptional start site through to the first 50 bp of the coding region.\n\t\nIn the \"Fold algorithms and basic options\" section select the \"minimum free energy (MFE) and partition function\" and \"avoid isolated base pairs\" options.\nIn the \"Advanced folding options\" choose \"dangling energies on both sides of a helix in any case\", \"RNA parameters (Turner model, 2004)\" and change \"rescale energy parameters to given temperature (C)\" to 25 °C.\nIn the \"Output options\" section select all options.\nFrom the \"Results for thermodynamic ensemble prediction\" section of the output file, extract the \"free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble\" and the \"frequency of the MFE structure in the ensemble\" values for comparison.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51216/51216fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4.  Promoter and 5'UTR variants. The expression cassettes were generated by the stepwise exchange of the 5'UTR, resulting in four combinations with CaMV 35SS promoter, followed by the replacement of this promoter with the nos sequence yielding four additional variants and a total of eight different promoter/5'UTR combinations.\n4. Plant Cultivation\nPrepare a 0.1% solution of the fertilizer Ferty 2 Mega in de-ionized water at pH 5.9.\nPrepare 10 x 10 x 8 cm rockwool blocks by extensive flushing with deionized water to remove residual chemicals and finally equilibrate with fertilizer.\nSeed tobacco plants by placing 1-2 tobacco seeds on each rockwool block followed by a short flush with fertilizer being careful to avoid washing the seeds away.\nGerminate and cultivate the tobacco plants for 42 days in a greenhouse at 25/22 °C day/night temperature, 70% relative humidity and a 16-hr photoperiod (180 mmol sec-1 m-2; λ = 400-700 nm). During this photoperiod, irrigate with fertilizer for 15 min every hour in hydroponic culture.\n5. Transient Protein Expression\nPrepare A. tumefaciens for injection into leaves.\n\t\nInoculate 5-50 ml of YEB medium containing antibiotics with 1% A. tumefaciens cryo-stock culture and incubate at 27 °C until the OD600nm reaches 5.0 (~48-72 hr depending on the volume and vessel type).\nDilute the A. tumefaciens culture with water and 2-fold infiltration medium (4.3 g/L Murashige and Skoog salts (pH 5.6), 5 g/L sucrose, 1.8 g/L glucose, 100 mM acetosyringone) to match the OD600nm required for injection. Confirm the OD600nm just before injection. Note: An OD600nm of 1.0 corresponds to ~1.43 ± 0.12 x 109 colony forming units per ml.\nInject the A. tumefaciens suspension into leaves.\n\t\nSelect and label the noncotyledon leaves and positions thereon to be treated (e.g. according to a DoE strategy).",
    "Do not inject different A. tumefaciens solutions into the same intercostal field. Instead, use opposing sections on each side of the mid-vein axis. If more than two different solutions need to be injected at the same position use an additional plant.\nThoroughly shake A. tumefaciens solution to resuspend any cells that may have settled since preparing the dilution and aspirate into a 1-ml syringe.\nGently scratch the epidermis at the position intended for injection with a pipette tip or similar to facilitate the influx of the A. tumefaciens solution. Avoid rupturing the leaf blade while doing so.\nHold the syringe perpendicular to the leaf blade touching the barrel against the intercostal field to be treated and gently push the outlet (with no needle attached) onto the bottom side of the leaf. Press the top side of the leaf gently at the same time to prevent the leaf blade from shifting or rupturing.\nGently push down the syringe piston. The A. tumefaciens solution will enter the intercellular spaces within the leaf blade as indicated by the treated areas appearing darker green and moist. Repeat this procedure at several positions until the whole intercostal field is infiltrated with A. tumefaciens. Then continue with the next intercostal field.\nMake sure the syringe remains perpendicular to the leaf. Tilting the syringe will cause the bacterial suspension to spurt out under high pressure.\nIf different A. tumefaciens solutions are used (e.g. to test different promoters), remove any excess solution remaining on the underside of the leaf from the first injection using a paper towel or similar before applying the next solution.\nPost-infiltration incubation of plants and sampling.\n\t\nPrepare a phytotron for the treated plants ~24 hr before injection to allow temperature and humidity equilibration at the levels required for the DoE.",
    "After injection, transfer plants into the phytotron and place them into trays large enough for irrigation with water until the end of the incubation period determined by the DoE.\nEstablish a 16 hr photoperiod using six Osram cool white 36 W fluorescent tubes per 0.7 m2 (75 mmol sec-1 m-2; λ = 400-700 nm). Prevent the plants from shading each other by limiting the number of plants to six per 0.7 m2.\nBefore sampling, make sure the correct intercostal field was selected by comparing the label added in section 5.2.1 and the DoE plan.\nUse a cork borer to remove 4-5 leaf discs from the treated intercostal fields at the positions and times indicated by the DoE. Do not remove the whole leaf from the plant during sampling. Stabilize the leaf with a hand-held paper towel while removing the discs to prevent rupture.\nDetermine the mass of each sample and place it in a 1.5 ml plastic reaction tube labeled with sample name and mass. Store the samples at -20 °C or -80 °C before protein quantitation. The process may be paused at this stage for several months depending on sample stability and the storage temperature.\n6. Protein Quantitation\nExtract proteins from the leaf disc samples.\n\t\nAdd 3 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride; pH 8.0) per mg of sample mass and grind leaf discs in the reaction tube using an electric pestle until no large fragments remain. Avoid overheating of the sample.\nRemove dispersed solids by centrifuging the sample twice at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant into a clean 1.5 ml reaction tube after each step without disturbing the pellet.",
    "After centrifugation, the process may be paused by freezing the plant extracts at -20 °C or -80 °C for several months depending on the sample stability and storage temperature. Confirm that a freeze-thaw cycle does not affect the concentration of the target protein(s).\nMeasure the DsRed fluorescence.\n\t\nPrepare three technical replicates of each sample into black 96-well half-area plates (50 μl extract per well). Avoid the formation of bubbles during pipetting.\nUse a set of six dilutions (0, 25, 75, 125, 175 and 225 μg/ml) of a DsRed standard per 96-well plate to generate a liner reference curve. Prepare the dilutions in PBS and store them at 4 °C for use within 3 months.\nMeasure the fluorescence twice, sequentially, in a 96-well plate reader fitted with 530/25 nm excitation and 590/35 nm emission filters.\nFor each sample, average the fluorescence over the two reads and the three technical replicates and subtract the value recorded for the blank control containing 0 μg/ml DsRed. Also subtract this value from the reads of the standard dilutions and use these blank-corrected values for a linear regression yielding a reference curve (through the origin of ordinates).\nUse the slope of the reference curve to convert the fluorescence measured for the samples into DsRed concentrations. If necessary, dilute the samples so that the readout falls within the concentration interval of the standards and consider this dilution factor in subsequent calculations.\nDetermine the concentration of 2G12.\n\t\nPrepare a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) device for the measurement of antibody concentration by coupling Protein A to the activated surface of one flow cell. Use another flow cell as reference by inactivating the surface without coupling of Protein A 30,31.",
    "Dilute plant extracts 1:20 in SPR running buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 3 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% v/v Tween-20) and measure the response units (RU) of antibody binding to Protein A in three technical replicates of each sample at the end of a 90 μl injection (180 sec at 30 μl/min). Subtract the RU measured at the reference flow cell (no Protein A) from the RU measured in the experimental flow cell (Protein A surface).\nMeasure a 585 ng/ml 2G12 standard after each 10-15 samples and subtract the value measured in the reference flow cells as described above. Use the average RU of these standards to calculate a linear reference curve through the origin of ordinates.\nCalculate the 2G12 concentrations in the samples based on the 1:20 dilution and the slope of the reference curve.\nCheck for strong nonspecific binding to the reference cell, which can corrupt the measurement. Also check whether the 2G12 standards maintain approximately constant values (<5% variation) throughout analysis, as greater variation reflects aging of the Protein A surface.\n7. Data Analysis and Evaluation\nManually analyze the responses observed in the expression experiments for (i) extreme values (high or low) indicating measurement errors; (ii) unusual results, e.g. factor combinations that generate unanticipated responses indicating data interchange; and (iii) missing values.\n\tNote: use these actions to prevent model building based on faulty data.\nTransfer the analyzed response data (here the protein concentrations) into the \"Design\" node of DesignExpert. Make sure that response data are correctly assigned to the corresponding factor settings. There is an extensive help section available in the DesignExpert software that covers the aspects addressed below.\nIn the \"Analysis\" node, choose the response to be analyzed and initially select \"none\" in the transformation tab.",
    "Note: a transformation is recommended for min/max ratios of the response larger than 10. The most useful transformation can be obtained from the Box-Cox-plot in the \"Diagnostics\" tab in the \"Diagnostics\" section of the \"Diagnostics tool\" described below (section 7.8). A Log10 transformation is often appropriate.\nContinue to the \"Fit summary\" tab, which provides general information about factors that are important for the system under investigation (e.g. two-factor interactions, quadratic effects). The software will suggest an initial model based on its significance.\nIn the \"Model\" tab, an initial model is preselected based on the \"Fit summary\" results. Use the automated mode to edit this model:\n\t\nSelect a \"Process order\" that is one order above the suggested model, e.g. if the suggested model is \"2FI\" (two factor interaction) then select \"Quadratic\".\nChoose \"Backward\" in the \"Selection\" field, which will iteratively remove nonsignificant terms from the model after proceeding to the \"ANOVA\" tab based on the \"Alpha out\" value which should initially be 0.100.\nIf asked by the software, always automatically correct the model hierarchy because this is necessary to generate reliable models 32,33.\nIn the \"ANOVA\" tab, investigate the suggested model and the included factors. If necessary, manually remove any factors with p-values above a predefined threshold (here 0.05, corresponding to a 5% significance level) or those that are unlikely based on mechanistic consideration by switching back to the \"Model\" tab, changing \"Selection\" to \"Manual\" and eliminating the appropriate factors from the model.",
    "Back in the \"ANOVA\" tab, evaluate the refreshed model in terms of the p-value of the \"Model\" (a low value is desirable because this indicates significance) and the \"Lack-of-fit\" (a high value is desirable because this indicates lack of significance) as well as the values for \"R-squared\", \"Adjusted R-squared\" and \"Predicted R-squared\" (values > 0.80 are desirable for all three values).\n\t\nCompare these values for different models including/excluding factors at several significance levels.\n\t\tNote: it may be helpful to duplicate the response column in the \"Design\" node and perform each analysis individually, or to export the whole \"ANOVA\" table into another program such as a spreadsheet.\nContinue to the \"Diagnostics\" tab to confirm the quality of the model and detect potential outliers in the dataset that have a strong influence on the model by examining all the tabs in the \"Diagnostics Tool\" (\"Diagnostics\" and \"Influence\" section).\n\t\nIn the \"Diagnostics\" section of the \"Diagnostics tool\", perform the following actions:\n\t\t\nEnsure the points are randomly scattered within the limits in the \"Residuals vs. Predicted\" chart. Here, a chevron-shaped distribution indicates a need for data transformation.\nEnsure the points are randomly scattered within the limits in the \"Residuals vs. Predicted\" chart. Here, a chevron-shaped distribution indicates a need for data transformation.\nInvestigate whether the points in the \"Residuals vs. run\" chart scatter randomly within the limits. A pattern (e.g. \"stairway\") indicates a trend in the data and block building can be used to counteract its influence on the model.\nLook for a straight diagonal line indicating the ideal model in the \"Predicted vs. Actual\" plot. The greater the scattering of data around the diagonal, the less accurate the model.",
    "Check for an overlap of the blue (best) and green (actual) vertical lines in the Box-Cox-plot indicating the data transformation. If the green line does not match the blue one (outside the interval indicated by the red vertical lines) go back to section 7.3 and improve the model building round by selecting the data transformation suggested by the Box-Cox-plot. Again the duplication of the response column can be useful to compare different models.\nMake sure that the points in the \"Residuals vs. Factor\" charts (there is one chart for each model factor) scatter randomly within the limits. Curvature in the data distribution may indicate a factor missing in the model.\nIn the \"Influence\" section of the \"Diagnostics tool\", make sure there is random scattering of the data within the limits in the \"Externally studentized residuals\", \"Leverage\", \"DFFITS\" and \"DFBETAS\" plots and evenly low distribution without extreme values in the \"Cook's Distance\" plot.\nIn the \"Model graphs\" tab, visualize the evaluated model. For a limited number of numeric factors (e.g. 3) the response surface (\"3D surface\") representation is useful to assess optima/characteristics manually.\n\tNote: response surfaces only illustrate the impact of two factors on the response under investigation. The effect of any additional factor on the response is revealed by changing its value (numeric factors) or level (categoric factors) in the \"Factors tool\" window. Alternatively, factors can be assigned to the plot axis by right-clicking them in the \"Factors tool\" window and selecting the desired independent variable axis.\n\t\nManipulate the factor levels and assign them to the graph ordinates using the \"Factors tool\".\nExport graphs using the \"Export graph to file…\" command in the \"File\" tab.",
    "Use the \"Numerical\" sub-node in the \"Optimization\" node to optimize the response numerically (minimize, maximize, in range) depending on the model factors, to which in turn certain constraints can be applied (e.g. limits and weights) via the \"Criteria\" tab.\n\t\nCalculate and examine numerical solutions in the \"Solutions\" tab based on the input provided in the \"Criteria\" tab.\nExport these solutions to other software (e.g. spreadsheets) for further analysis (e.g. histograms) revealing the factor settings associated with high or low response values.\n\t\tNote: this is helpful if more than three numeric factors are investigated and 3D representation is difficult.\nUse the \"Point prediction\" sub-node to predict the response for specific factor settings.\n\t\nUse this prediction for all settings to be evaluated (here, all promoter and 5'UTR combinations as well as all leaves and incubation times or leaf positions and incubation temperatures).\nExport the predicted values and compile them to a data array which can be used to describe transient expression in tobacco plants, e.g. by calculating the expression for a specific promoter-5'UTR combination at a certain time averaged over all leaf positions or across all leaves of a plant.\nNormalize the expression data based on the masses of the different leaves to yield the specific expression level (μg g-1) or specific expression rate (μg g-1 hr-1).\nAlternatively, export the coefficients of the \"Final equation\" from the bottom of the \"ANOVA\" tab into a spreadsheet and multiply them with an array of factor settings to yield the same data array.\n\t\tNote: this array may only contain factor values from within the initial design space, because the fitted model equation is not suited for extrapolation.\nConduct a confirmation experiment for model points that are of major interest.",
    "Perform transient protein expression under conditions selected for \"Point prediction\" (section 7.11). E.g. use the same temperatures and leaves etc.\nDetermine the protein concentrations for this transient expression experiment as describe above (section 6) and compare them with the values predicted by the model.\nCheck whether the average protein concentration in the confirmation experiment falls within the response surface model's prediction interval obtained during point prediction. A match affirms the predictive power of the model. A mismatch indicates a low model quality and additional runs can be required.\nNote: plant batch-to-batch variability broadens the prediction interval and may devaluate confirmation experiments performed with a different batch of plants. However, samples that were not used to generate the model but that originated from the same plant batch as the samples contained in the model may serve as effective controls.\nSubscription Required.
