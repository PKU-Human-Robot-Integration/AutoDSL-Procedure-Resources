    "All methods and procedures described here have been approved by the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60479/60479fig1a.jpg\nFigure 1: Stroop task sample stimuli. The color and noncolor terms as well as the background color used in the current experiment are shown. For Incongruent and Neutral stimuli, sample color-word stimuli are shown. In the experiment, any word could be in any of the six colors. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60479/60479fig1alarge.jpg]\n1. Prepare the stimuli for the bilingual Stroop task\nNOTE: The Stroop task can be programmed in many commercially available software packages designed for the presentation of behavioral experiments (see Table of Materials)\nCreate the Congruent items in Language a (La) by programming six color terms written in capital letters in size 60 Times New Roman font, for which the written word and the font color match. For example, present the word GREEN in green font, and the word RED in red font.\nCreate the Incongruent items in La by programming six color terms written in capital letters in size 60 Times New Roman font, for which the written word and the font color do not match. For example, present the word GREEN in red font, and the word RED in green font.\nCreate the Neutral items in La by programming six noncolor and noncolor-associated terms, written in capital letters in size 60 Times New Roman font. Words are used instead of symbols in order to elicit baseline reading speeds for this reading-based task.\n\t\nPresent each word in each of the colors used in the previous two steps. For example, present the word BOOK in both green and red font.",
    "Repeat the previous three steps to create items in Language b (Lb). Ensure that you do not use color terms that are cognates in the two languages (e.g., the word BLUE and BLEU in English and French, respectively.)\n\tNOTE: In the current experiment, La was English, and the color terms used were RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLACK, SILVER, and WHITE. Lb was French, and the color terms used were ROUGE, JAUNE, VERT, NOIR, ARGENT, and BLANC.\n2. Create two single-language blocks\nCreate an La block which includes 25 Congruent, 25 Incongruent, and 25 Neutral items, for a total of 75 items in the block. Include five Neutral practice items at the beginning of the block.\nProgram the experiment to present all items in randomized intermixed trials as shown in Figure 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60479/60479fig2a.jpg\nFigure 2: Stroop task procedure. An incongruent trial is shown. Trials began with a 250 ms fixation cross and ended when the participant pressesed a response button or 4,000 ms elapsed.

Create one mixed-language block\nCreate a block which includes the 25 Congruent, 25 Incongruent, and 25 Neutral items in La, and the 25 Congruent, 25 Incongruent, and 25 Neutral items in Lb, for a total of 150 items in the block. Include five Neutral practice items at the beginning of the block.\nProgram the experiment to present all items in randomized intermixed trials as shown in Figure 2.\n4. Test participants",
    "Test participants in a sound-attenuated testing room or booth. Participants should be seated comfortably in front of a computer screen with a button box or keyboard in front of them.\nExplain to the participants that they will see words in different colors on the screen in front of them, and that their task is to press the button that matches the color of the text that they see. Emphasize that they should answer as quickly and accurately as possible, but that it is okay if they make a mistake. Allow time for participants to ask questions.\nOnce participants are comfortable with the task, leave the testing room/booth and allow them to begin the experiment. The experiment will take approximately 8 min to complete.\nAt the end of the experiment, thank the participants for their time and debrief them about the task and its purpose.\nSubscription Required.
