    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nProduction of Recombinant HIV-1 Pseudoviruses\nTiming: 1 week\nDay 0: Maintain 293T cells in DMEM medium and monitor their growth rate and morphology. Cells should grow exponentially with a doubling time of approximately 24 h and show healthy morphology without significant cell aggregation. Wash 293T cells once with PBS and add 1–2 mL of StemPro Accutase, which gently detaches the 293T cells while preserving the expression of the receptors on the cell surface. Incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) until cells are completely detached, add 10 mL of DMEM to the flask, collect the detached 293T cells, and mix slowly by pipetting up and down. The cell suspension can be filtered if they tend to aggregate. We usually use 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube with cell-strainer cap to filter the cell suspension.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and add 5 × 105 cells/well to a 6-well plate or 3 × 106 cells/T-25 flask. Incubate the plate/flask overnight (14–20 h) in the tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration.\nDay 1: Effectene transfection.\nReplace the medium with a fresh DMEM medium and follow manufacturer’s instructions. A typical template for preparing the transfection mixture for a 6-well plate transfection is shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Add dropwise the transfection mixture to the cells with gentle swirling.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_204_5.csv\nCells = 5 × 105 cells/well (2 mL).\nGently swirl the plate/flask to ensure uniform distribution of the transfection complex. Incubate plate/flask in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration.\nAlternatives: Ca3(PO4)2 transfection.\nPrepare 293T cells for transfection as described in day 0 but incubate the plate/flask for only 4–5 h in tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration to allow the cells to attach to the surface.",
    "Add chloroquine to a final concentration of 25μM, incubate for 5 min, and prepare the Ca3(PO4)2 transfection mixture. A typical template for preparing the transfection mixture for a T-25 flask transfection is shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. Add dropwise the transfection mixture to the cells with gentle swirling.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_204_6.csv\nCells = 3 × 106 cells/flask (5 mL).\nGently swirl the plate/flask to ensure uniform distribution of the transfection complex. Incubate plate/flask in tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration.\nNote: We found that Ca3(PO4)2 transfection of 293T cells is more efficient 4–5 h after seeding the cells in comparison with 293T cells that were grown overnight (14–20 h) prior to transfection.\nNote: According to our institutional biosafety approved protocol, at this point we transfer the plate/flask to our BSL2+ facility. Work at the BSL2+ facility follows BSL3 practices in a BSL-2 environment. The standard personal protective equipment includes disposable gown, face mask, protective shatterproof eyeglasses or face shield, double gloves, sleeve cover, and protective shoe covers. Liquid waste is decontaminated with 10% bleach and all waste is autoclaved on site.\nDay 2: 14 h post Ca3(PO4)2 transfection replace the medium with a fresh DMEM medium.\nCritical: Chloroquine is toxic to cells; medium must be changed 14–16 h post transfection.\nDay 3: Gently collect the PV-containing supernatant and centrifuge at 600–900 × g for 5 min at 4°C to remove cell debris. Collect the supernatant and aliquot in required volume for single-use experiments in several 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. One tube should be reserved for a p24 measurement (next section).",
    "Alternatively, PV-containing supernatant can be filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. The two alternatives (centrifugation and filtration) may be compared for specific Envs to achieve high infectivity. Some studies have used a centrifugation step followed by 0.45 μm filtration of the PV-containing supernatant.\nStore PV-containing tubes at −80°C for future use. PV infectivity depends on the specific HIV-1 Env used and is typically decreased ∼90% with a freeze-thaw cycle. Thus, viruses pseudotyped with Envs that intrinsically exhibit very low entry activity cannot be frozen and have to be used immediately.\nCritical: PVs should be collected with minimal mixing or minimal use of any mechanical force to preserve virus infectivity.\nAfter collecting the supernatant, lyse the remaining cells in the wells/flask with luciferase lysis buffer. Transfer a few microliters of lysed cells (usually 1:10 or 1:100 of the lysate) to a 96-well white luminometer plate and measure luciferase activity. The readout reflects the efficiency of pHIVec2.luc transfection and should be close to saturation. We typically measure >2 x 109 relative light unit for 2-s measurements for such cell lysates.\nNote: If the transfection efficiency is high, the cell lysate readout may be saturated even at 1:100 dilution. Transfection efficiency determines the relative PV titer and p24 concentration in the sample.",
    "Day 3 (or 4): Each HIV-1 virion (particle) contains approximately 3000 copies of p24 protein. Thus, after viruses are disrupted to release the p24 protein, the HIV-1 p24 concentration in a specific preparation is related to the number of virions in the sample. The concentration of HIV-1 p24 protein can be measured using commercial or in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on HIV-1 p24 antigen capture. An efficient and economical in-house assay has been previously described (Wehrly and Chesebro, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]); commercial p24 ELISA kits (e.g., ABL p24 capture assay) are usually more expensive, are provided in adjustable 8-well strips, and typically detect p24 concentrations at the range between 5 and 100 pg/mL in a test sample. Here we describe the use of the duo ELISA set from R&D, which provides only main components of the p24 ELISA system and represents a method of high performance at an attractive price. Using this set, we reproducibly measure p24 concentrations within a range of 31 to 500 pg/mL.\nDuo p24 ELISA protocol:\nAdd equal volume of PV sample to a tube containing lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS). The lysed sample can be stored at −20°C until use.\nImmobilize a capture antibody (HIV Gag p24 Capture Antibody, Part 844721; Cat# DY7360-05; R&D systems) on high-binding 96-well plate (Greiner bio-one, Cat# 655061) by adding 0.4 μg of antibody in 100 μL PBS (4 μg/mL) to each well. Seal the plate and incubate overnight (14–20 h) at RT (20°C–25°C).\nThe following day wash the wells as follows.",
    "Wash Step: aspirate the solution from each well using a vacuum system and wash three times with 300 μL of wash buffer by adding the buffer, incubating for 30 s, and aspirating the solution. Invert the plate on a paper towel to remove remaining traces of wash buffer.\nAdd 300 μL of blocking buffer to each well and incubate the plate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 1–2 h. Repeat Wash Step.\nAdd 100 μL/well of p24 protein standards (HIV Gag p24 Standard, Part 844723; Cat# DY7360-05; R&D systems) at the following concentrations (serial 1:2 dilutions): 500, 250, 125, 62. 5, 31. 25, 15.625, 7.8125, and 0 (blank) pg/mL in duplicates. The measurements of these wells will be used to generate a standard curve. In addition, add 100 μL/well of test samples to respective wells. We typically test 2–3 dilutions of each sample to ensure that the measurements are within the range of the standard curve. Incubate the plate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 2 h and then repeat the Wash Step.\nAdd 100 μL/well of detection antibody (HIV-1 Gag p24 Detection Antibody, Part 844722; Cat# DY7360-05; R&D systems) at a final concentration of 125 ng/mL and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 1 h. At the end of incubation repeat the Wash Step.\nAdd 100 μL/well of 1:40 dilution of streptavidin-HRP solution (Part 893975; Cat# DY7360-05; R&D systems) and incubate the plate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 20–30 min. At the end of incubation repeat the Wash Step.",
    "Add 100 μL/well of TMB substrate solution and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 15–20 min followed by the addition of 50 μL/well stop solution. Shaking will improve the distribution of color development in the well. Within 5–30 min, measure the optical density in each well at wavelength of 450 nm. Protect the plate from light during this step. We usually cover the plate with an aluminum foil immediately after the addition of the TMB substrate.\nAnalyze the data. Measurements are averaged and the 0 (blank) readout is subtracted from each. Averaged and blank-subtracted p24 measurements are then plotted against each p24 concentration and a standard curve is generated by fitting the measurements to a linear curve using available processing program (e.g., Excel, GraphPad). p24 concentration in a tested sample is calculated using the equation describing the fitted linear curve. R2 values are typically > 0.97.\nCritical: According to our institutional biosafety approved protocol, once the PV is lysed we transfer the plate/flask to a BSL2 laboratory. Liquid waste is decontaminated by 10% bleach for 20 min.\nNote: Another way to compare PVs is to measure the level of Env expression on the surface of each PV, which can be done by analyzing the proteins in PV preparation by western blot.\nVirus Titration\nTiming: 3–4 days",
    "To compare the properties of different Envs or different preparation of the same Envs, equivalent amounts of PVs are used according to (1) number of virions, which is estimated by p24 concentrations of the preparation (as described in the previous section), or (2) viral infectivity levels of Env-displaying PVs. We next describe how to titer PVs on target cells; the infectivity values measured can be used to generate a dose-response curve and to estimate the volume of each PV preparation that is required for desired infectivity level.\nDay 1: Prepare serial 2-fold dilutions of supernatant-containing PVs in DMEM (i.e., 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, …). PVs are very sensitive to mechanical forces and mixing should be gentle and minimal to allow even distribution of PVs in the solution without decreasing viral infectivity.\nAdd 30 μL/well of diluted PVs in duplicates or triplicates to a 96-well plate. We compared several 96-well plates and, in our hands, Greiner bio-one 96-well plates (Cat# 655083) give low background and high signal. We usually use internal wells for viral assay and add 120 μL of DMEM to otherwise empty wells to prevent evaporation of liquid in the assay wells (edge effect). An example of a typical template is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/204-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A Typical Layout of a Plate for PV Titration",
    "Add approximately 0.5 mL of StemPro Accutase to a T75 flask containing Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 target cells and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) until cells are completely detached. Target cells should be grown no more than 2 days prior to the assay to ensure healthy and exponentially growing cells. StemPro Accutase is a gentle detachment agent and preserves the receptor integrity on the cell surface. Add 10 mL DMEM, centrifuge the cells at 50–100 × g and 4°C for 5 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the target cells in DMEM at concentration of 1.2 × 105 cells/mL.\nAdd 60 μL/well of cells (7200 cells/well) to the wells containing PVs from step 12. Control wells should include: target cells with no PVs and PVs with no cells in the same total volume as all other wells (90 μL/well). Incubate the plate in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration.\nAlternatives: Target cells can be added to a 96-well plate (7200 cells/well) one day prior to the viral assay followed by the addition of viruses on the next day.\nCritical: We found that adding target cells immediately after PV addition results in significantly higher assay readout compared with seeding target cells one day prior to assay.",
    "Note: Infection of Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 target cells with PVs typically results in higher assay readout than the readout of infection of TZM-bl target cells. But TZM-bl cells have been extensively used in numerous reported studies. These cells contain a stably integrated copy of the firefly luciferase gene under the control of HIV long terminal repeat promoter in their genome, and exhibits relatively high background. TZM-bl cells are contaminated with ecotropic murine leukemia virus but this contamination does not significantly affect their performance as target cells (Platt et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). The addition of DEAE-Dextran increases the efficiency of viral entry.\nDay 3 (or day 4): PV entry into target cells can be measured after 48 or 72 h. Measurements 72 h post infection usually results in higher readout than the measurements after 48 h, most probably because the firefly luciferase enzyme is accumulating in the target cells during this time. However, 48-h incubation typically results in high signal-to-noise ratio and in many cases is preferred due to time saving.\nPrepare sufficient luciferase assay buffer to measure the luciferase activity in the assay wells (100 μL/well). Thaw the luciferin substrate solution at RT (20°C–25°C); thawing can be accelerated by immersing the tube in a beaker filled with water at RT (20°C–25°C).",
    "Gently aspirate the medium from the wells of the 96-well assay plate using a vacuum system. Add 30 μL/well of luciferase lysis buffer to lyse the cells and measure the activity of luciferase using a luminometer plate reader equipped with two injectors. In our hands, Berthold luminometer provides robust and reproducible readings. After priming the injectors with the assay buffer (injector 1) and the luciferin substrate solution (injector 2), one hundred microliters of assay buffer are injected to each well, followed by a 1-s delay and a 50-μL injection of luciferin substrate solution. Light units are measured and integrated over between 2 and 10 s.\nCritical: Luciferin solution is light sensitive; keep solution protected from light at all times.\nNote: All luciferase reagents and the sample plate should be allowed to equilibrate to RT (20°C–25°C) before measuring luminescence as temperature variations could affect the assay readout.\nEffects of HIV-1 Env Ligands on PV Infectivity\nTiming: 3–4 days\nTo measure the effect of ligands on specific Env function, PVs displaying specific Envs are incubated with increasing concentrations of the tested ligand followed by the addition of target cells to each well to measure infectivity (Herschhorn et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Wells of infected cells without a ligand are used as reference control (100% infection) and wells with cells only are used as background control (0% infection). Additional control wells contain PV without cells. The readout for each concentration of the ligand is normalized to the two control values.",
    "Day 1: Serially dilute the tested ligand in DMEM. Calculate the amount and volume needed for duplicate or triplicate measurements and dilute the ligand in microcentrifuge tubes. For small molecules dissolved in DMSO, dilute the compounds in DMSO and then dilute further to final concentration in DMEM while keeping identical DMSO concentration for all wells. Up to 2% DMSO can be used in the viral assay without any cytotoxic effects to Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 target cells. DMSO must be included in the reference infection. An example of template is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/204-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. A Typical Layout of 96-Well Plate for Testing Ligand Effects on PV Infectivity\nAdd 30 μL of ligand at specific concentration to wells of a 96-well luminometer plate (Greiner bio-one 96-well plate (Cat# 655083)). Each ligand concentration is usually tested in duplicates or triplicates. Use 30 μL of the diluting medium for reference control (no ligands) and background (cells only) wells.\nAdd 30 μL PVs that were prediluted either to a defined amount of HIV-1 p24 or to specific infection level (or titer) to assay and reference control wells. We typically use a specific HIV-1 p24 amount in the range of 1–10 ng or infectivity values equivalent to about 1 million relative light units.\nRepeat step 13 of Virus titration section but resuspend the target cells in DMEM at concentration of 2.4 × 105 cells/mL. Add 30 μL/well of cells to the wells containing PVs, which were preincubated with a ligand, and to reference and background control wells.\nAdd 30 μL of medium to background control wells. Incubate the plate in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration.\nDay 3 (or day 4): Repeat step 15 (a & b) of the previous section (Virus titration).",
    "Note: Normalizing by p24 concentration reflects equivalent number of viral particles in a sample. Normalizing by PV infectivity reflects the number of viral particles that are able to mediate similar levels of entry into target cells.\nNote: Measuring ligands dissolved in DMSO requires the addition of DMSO to the reference cells to account for the DMSO effect\nCold Sensitivity\nTiming: 5–6 days\nWe and others have previously shown that frequent sampling of the open conformation of HIV-1 Env is associated, in many cases, with increased Env sensitivity to exposure to cold. This Env property is studied by exposing PVs to low temperature (ice) at defined intervals followed by measuring the effect on infectivity. Because different PV-containing tubes of the same batch are thawed at different time points and kept on ice for defined time frames, care should be taken to maintain PV infectivity in each tube during virus handling.\nDay 1: Prepare approximately 10 mL of PV displaying specific HIV-1 Envs according to the steps outlined in the first section (Production of recombinant HIV-1 PVs). Aliquot the supernatant-containing PVs into 20 or more microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80°C. Measure HIV-1 p24 in the supernatant and titer the PVs as described in the previous section (Virus titration).\nThaw a single-use aliquot of PV preparation by immersing the tube in a 37°C water bath for exactly 1.5 min and then gently place the tube in an ice bucket. Place the ice bucket in a refrigerator to conserve the ice as much as possible during incubation. Label the tube as day 1.",
    "Repeat step 23 daily for 3 consecutive days (days 2–4) at the same interval (approximately every 24 h). On day 5, repeat step 23 but without placing the tube on ice. PVs from day 5 tube are the reference for measuring 100% infectivity.\nDilute each PV preparation to 4 ng p24/60 μL or to a predefined infectivity level in DMEM. Add 60 μL of each PV in triplicates or quadruplicates to wells of a 96-well plate followed by the addition of 60 μL of 1.2 × 105 Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 target cells/mL (7200 cells/well). Incubate the plate in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration.\nDay 3 (or day 4): Repeat step 15 (a & b) of the previous section (Virus titration).\nCell-Cell Fusion Assay\nTiming: 3–4 days\nCell-cell fusion assay measures the fusion activity of specific HIV-1 Envs that are tested (Herschhorn et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Effector cells are transfected with HIV-1 Tat- and HIV-1 Env-expression plasmids. TZM-bl cells serve as target cells. They express the CD4/CCR5 receptors and contain a stably integrated copy of the firefly luciferase gene under the control of HIV long terminal repeat promoter in their genome. Fusion of effector and target cells during co-culture leads to diffusion of HIV-1 Tat to the target cells and activation of firefly luciferase transcription.\nDay 1: Follow the steps outlined in the first section for Ca3(PO4)2 transfection (step 4) to transfect 293T cells with HIV-1 tat- and HIV-1 Env-expression plasmids at a ratio of 1:6 in a 6-well plate (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). Incubate transfected cells in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_204_7.csv\nCells = 5 × 105 cells/well (2 mL).",
    "Day 2: Detach TZM-bl cells and centrifuge the cells at 50–100 × g and 4°C for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in DMEM, count the cells and adjust the concentration of 1 × 105 cells/mL. Add 100 μL of cells to designated wells of a 96-well plate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nIn addition to assay wells containing co-culture of effector (293T) and target (TZM-bl) cells, wells containing only effector cells or only target cells are used as control. We usually measure fusion after 2, 4, and 6 h; each time point requires a separate plate. See an example layout in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Incubate the plate overnight (16–20 h) in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration.\nDay 3: Detach the transfected 293T cells using 5 mM EDTA in PBS and transfer to a 15-mL centrifuge tube. Add 10 mL DMEM and centrifuge cells at 50–100 × g and 10°C for 5 min. Resuspend the transfected 293T cells in fresh medium at concentration of 2 × 105 cells/mL.\nRemove 50 μL from assay wells that are designated for co-culture and contain TZM-bl target cells, and add 50 μL of transfected 293T cells (10,000 cells/well). Repeat this step for empty wells that contain DMEM medium and are designated as control. Keep wells with TZM-bl cells only as second control (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/204-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. A Typical Layout of a Plate for Cell-Cell Fusion Assay\nIncubate the plates in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration and measure the fusion activity after 2, 4, and 6 h (1 plate for each time point) by following step 15 (a & b) of the Virus titration section."
