    "Spreading spermatocyte nuclei for dSTORM   Notes:   This spreading procedure is based on a previously described protocol (Peters et al., 1997).   This procedure can also be used for spread nuclei preparations on rectangular microscopy slides for other types of microscopy purposes. For details about spreading on these slides, see notes within the procedure.  Make 1% PFA solution as follows: place 1 g of PFA in a 250 mL beaker and cover it with aluminum foil. Add 90 mL dH2O and one drop of 1 M NaOH (Recipe 1). Remove aluminum foil and warm 2 × 10 s in the microwave (900 W) with careful shaking in between. Place the magnetic stirring bar in the solution and cover it with aluminum foil. Warm the solution to 50 °C for 10 min by placing the beaker on a magnetic stirring plate with a heating capacity of ~75 °C (in the fume hood). The solution becomes clear (see Note 1). Cool the solution by placing the glass beaker on ice for 15 min. Adjust the pH to 9.2–9.5 by adding 2 mL of 50 mM borate buffer (Recipe 2). Add more 1 M NaOH if necessary. Adjust the volume with dH2O to 100 mL. Filter the solution with a 0.2 μm syringe filter and a 50 mL syringe into a new beaker (see Note 2). Dissolve 150 μL of Triton X-100 in the solution using magnetic stirring (see Note 3). Note 1: If the solution does not become clear, incubate longer. It could be that the temperature of the solution is too low, but make sure that the NaOH was added in advance.   Note 2: It can be useful to replace the filter once after filtering half of the PFA solution to avoid clogging of the filter.",
    "Note 3: Cut a small part of the plastic tip to pipette Triton X-100 more easily; add this tip to the solution to ensure that the whole volume is transferred into the solution. Remove and discard the tip when the Triton X-100 has dissolved.  Prepare PBS+ as follows: mix 50 mL of DPBS, 50 μL of 1.1 M CaCl2·2H2O (Recipe 3), 50 μL of 0.5 M MgCl2·6H2O (Recipe 4), and 25 μL of sodium DL-lactate to a 50 mL tube. Place the PBS+ on a nutator until use. Note: Cut the tip to facilitate pipetting the sodium DL-lactate solution.  Thaw the following solutions: 0.5 mL of 100 mM sucrose (Recipe 5) and 1 mL of Hypobuffer (Recipe 6).Sacrifice a mouse (at least three weeks old) using CO2 gas followed by cervical dislocation. Note:   Mice can also be younger or older; but take into account that the composition of the testes changes while the mice are going through puberty.   The use of frozen material is discouraged because of the poor quality of the meiotic nuclear spreads obtained. If only frozen material is available, progress as described below but take into account that the yield will be lower [this will be observed during cell counting (step A15)]. Therefore, only a few slides can be made from one frozen testis.  Dissect the testis and place it in a drop of PBS+ in a 10 cm Petri dish (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4780/bioprotoc-13-14-4780-g001.jpg Figure 1. Testis collection.  A. Place the sacrificed mouse on its back, wet the skin of the abdomen with 70% ethanol, and open the skin of the lower part of the abdomen with a small cut using scissors.",
    "Pinch the skin between the fingers of each hand just above and below the small cut and pull up and downward (along the anterior-posterior axes) to tear the skin further and visualize the peritoneum. This helps to avoid hair contamination. B. Use a tweezer to grasp the peritoneum and use a scissor to cut it open and to enlarge the opening laterally. C. The organs in the lower part of the abdominal cavity are visible at this point (intestine and bladder). The testis is descended and located in the scrotum. Most often, they are not yet visible. To retrieve them from the scrotum, use tweezers to grasp adipose tissue on either side of the bladder and softly pull each of them upwards. D. This will expose the testis, visible as an egg-shaped tissue that should be separated from the surrounding tissue such as the epididymis, blood vessels, etc., using tweezers and scissors to carefully isolate it.Remove the tunica albuginea using tweezers and a fine scissor. This is a fibrous tissue covering the testis. Its removal generates an amorphous mass of testis tubules, connected by interstitial tissue.Repeatedly place small parts of this tissue mass between two curved tweezers with fine points and rub these against each other in a drop of PBS+ to obtain a cell suspension (for ~5 min) (Video 1, Figure 2A and 2B).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

Coverslip (the edge is accentuated with a white dotted line) with PFA and cells that is positioned on a microscope slide in the humid chamber. For the first hour of incubation, the lid of the humid chamber will be closed. K. Use pipettes to open the humid chamber for the last hour of fixation and drying. L. After the photo Flo wash step, dry the coverslip completely by placing it against the side of a 6-well plate.Bring the whole cell suspension in a 15 mL tube using a pipette and wash the Petri dish with PBS+ several times to collect all cells. Add PBS+ up to a total volume of 10 mL.Invert the tube twice and wait a few minutes for the larger tissue fragments to settle to the bottom (Figure 2C).Transfer the supernatant to a clean 15 mL tube using a 10 mL pipette.Centrifuge for 5 min at 617×  g  (1,000 rpm).Remove the supernatant.Add 1 mL of PBS+ and gently pipette up and down to carefully resuspend the pellet.Load 10 μL of the cell suspension in the counting chamber (Figure 2D).Using a phase contrast microscope, count the number of spermatocytes (large, round cells) that are visible at 40× magnification in vertical large rectangles (including cells that cross the upper and/or right side) and calculate the average of 10 rectangle counts. This average is multiplied by 106  to obtain the concentration of cells/mL (Figure 2E and 2F).",
    "Note: When the number of spermatocytes per rectangle is low (e.g., many rectangles with a score of zero), count 20 rectangles to arrive at a more trustworthy average.  Add 1 mL of Hypobuffer (always an equal volume of Hypobuffer and cell suspension) to the cell suspension and wait for 8 min.Add PBS+ to a total volume of 10 mL and centrifuge for 5 min at 617×  g  (1,000 rpm).Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in PBS+ in a volume that yields a concentration of 15 × 106  cells/mL. For example: the average cell count at step A15 was 2; this corresponds to a concentration of 2 × 106  cells/mL. To obtain a concentration of 15 × 106  cells/mL, divide 2 × 106  by 15 × 106  to obtain the resuspension volume (in mL) of PBS+. In this example, you add 133 μL of PBS+ to the pellet.Make separate drops of 20 μL of 100 mM sucrose in a 10 cm Petri dish and add 10 μL of the cell suspension to each drop (pipette up and down to create a homogenous solution) (Figure 2G).Hold the coated coverslip (Recipe 7) with a tweezer and  scoop  it through the PFA to end with a drop of PFA on the coverslip (Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Scoopingthe coverslip into the PFA Pipette the 30 μL cell suspension with sucrose in the PFA drop and disperse the solution by slowly moving the coverslip circularly (Figure 2H, Video 3). Note: This is easiest if two people work together, one handling the coverslip and the other adding the cell suspension.  <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Dispersing the solution by circular movements of the coverslip Place the coverslip with the cells upwards on a microscope glass slide in a humid box (Figure 2I and 2J).",
    "Leave the coverslips for 1 h in the humid box with the lid closed.Generate a small opening by placing the lid on two pipettes and allow the coverslips to slowly dry for 1 h (Figure 2K). Notes:   When making spreads on microscope glass slides, this second drying step only takes 30 min.   This is a critical step; it is necessary to always check your coverslip under the microscope to assess if cells have attached to the coverslip before continuing. If they are mostly still floating, incubate for 15 or 30 min longer until the majority of cells appear to have attached.  Always remember which side of the coverslip contains the cells, since this is not visible. Once you grab the coverslip with the tweezers, you have to keep track of which side should remain up. Grab the coverslip with a tweezer and wash in 200 mL of 0.08% photo Flo (Recipe 8) by slowly moving it through the solution for 10 s.Let the coverslips air dry by placing them against the side of a 6-well plate (Figure 2L).When dry, the coverslips are ready for immunocytochemistry (pause point). For long time storage, place the coverslips in a small Petri dish (with cells upwards) closed with small pieces of tape and store at -80 °C, or continue directly with the immunocytochemistry procedure. Note: When making spreads on rectangular microscope glass slides, dried slides can be packaged back-to-back in aluminum foil and also stored at -80 °C.   Immunocytochemistry on nuclear spread preparations  Thaw the coverslip for 10 min at RT.Place the coverslip into a 6-well plate with dH2O between the wells in a box with wet paper (humid chamber for immunocytochemistry). Keep the 6-well plate as much as possible in the box with wet paper during all the next steps.",
    "Wash the coverslip in 2 mL of 1× PBS (Recipe 10) on a shaking plate for 10 min and repeat this two times. Note: When using spreads on microscope glass slides, use a Coplin jar for washing.  Block the chromatin on the coverslip by adding 700 μL of blocking buffer 1 drop by drop on the coverslip (Recipe 11) and incubate for 20 min.To perform the three-color staining of SYCP3, RAD51, and DMC1, add 0.5 μL of SYCP3 antibody, 1 μL of DMC1 antibody (from a 1:10 dilution, which is 1 μL of antibody and 9 μL of 1× PBS), and 1 μL of RAD51 antibody (from a 1:10 dilution, which is 1 μL of antibody and 9 μL of 1× PBS) to 100 μL of primary antibody buffer (Recipe 12).Remove blocking buffer 1 using a pipette. Subsequently, add the primary antibody buffer including antibodies as prepared in step B5.Cover the coverslip with a small circle of Parafilm that has approximately the same size as the coverslip and place the Parafilm circle on the coverslip with buffer using tweezers for equal distribution.Incubate the coverslip with the primary antibody overnight at RT. Note: It is possible to perform incubation also at 4 °C for two nights but, before storing at 4 °C, the coverslip should be incubated for at least 1 h at RT. Before continuing with the protocol on the next day, it should also be incubated at RT for at least 1 h.  Gently remove the Parafilm using tweezers.Wash the coverslip in 2 mL of 1× PBS on a shaking plate for 10 min and repeat this two times.Block the coverslip by adding 700 μL of blocking buffer 2 (Recipe 13) and incubate for 20 min.",
    "To perform the three-color staining of SYCP3 (Alexa 647), RAD51 (CF568), and DMC1 (Atto488), add 2 μL of goat anti-guinea pig Alexa 647 antibody (from a 1:10 dilution, which is 1 μL of antibody and 9 μL of 1× PBS), 2 μL of goat anti-rabbit CF568 antibody (from a 1:10 dilution, which is 1 μL of antibody and 9 μL of 1× PBS), and 0.4 μL of goat anti-mouse Atto488 to 100 μL of blocking buffer 2 (Recipe 13). Protect this mix from light before use.Gently remove the blocking buffer 2 and add the 100 μL of blocking buffer solution including antibodies that was prepared in step B12.Cover the coverslip with Parafilm (see step B7).Incubate the coverslip with the secondary antibody solution for 2 h at RT.Gently remove the Parafilm.Wash the coverslip in 2 mL of 1× PBS for 10 min on a shaking plate, repeat this twice, and protect it from light by wrapping it in aluminum foil.Store the coverslip in 2 mL of 1× PBS in a 6-well plate (add water between the wells) in a dark box with wet paper (or a white box covered in aluminum foil) and store at 4 °C until further use. Notes:   It is recommended to use a fresh immunostained sample for dSTORM. The sample, when stored in a dark box (or a 6-well plate kept in the dark), can last for months, but sample quality can decrease over time.   Two milliliters of PBS is enough for short-time usage but could evaporate when stored longer; please keep in mind to increase this volume when storing the coverslip for longer.   Addition of fiducials to the sample  Sonicate the vial containing the fiducials (TetraSpecksTM) for 20 s.Pipette 0.5 mL of 1× PBS in an Eppendorf tube.",
    "Place the coverslip in the AttofluorTM cell chamber and close the chamber carefully by screwing. Note: Be careful with closing the chamber because closing it too loose will cause leakage and closing it too tight will cause the coverslip to break.  Pipette the fiducials at least 10 times up and down.Add 0.35 μL of the fiducials to the PBS in the Eppendorf tube and mix thoroughly.Add the fiducials with PBS to the sample in the AttofluorTM cell chamber and make sure that the liquid is dispersed equally. If not, softly tap to the side of the chamber. Note: The distribution pattern of fiducials among different fields of view is often very variable, despite the thorough mixing of the solution beforehand. Selection of cells with a suitable number of fiducials before starting the actual dSTORM imaging is therefore essential (see step E2).  Add 0.5 mL of 1× PBS to the chamber.Place the chamber in a 10 cm Petri dish and protect it from light.Store it at 4 °C overnight to allow fiducials to settle.Remove the solution with fiducials the next day and replace it with 1 mL of 1× PBS. Note: The fiducials need to settle down; if this procedure is shortened, not enough fiducials will be visible on the sample, which makes the alignment of the different channels after imaging impossible.   dSTORM microscope setup  Turn on the microscope 1 h before imaging.Start ZEN Software and turn on all lasers.Prepare dSTORM buffer: mix 200 μL of 5× glucose (Recipe 16), 10 μL of dSTORM enzymes (Recipe 17), 25 μL of MEA (Recipe 18), and 765 μL of dH2O. Note: Enzyme and MEA can expire over time, which decreases the blinking capacity during imaging.  Remove PBS from the sample in the AttofluorTM cell chamber and add 1 mL of dSTORM buffer.",
    "Close the chamber with a coverslip. Notes:   To make sure that the chamber is closed off from air, gently tap against the AttofluorTM cell chamber so that air bubbles that are present rise and become visible just below the top coverslip. Having a small air bubble in the chamber is not harmful and shows that the chamber is properly sealed due to capillary action.   The dSTORM buffer works for a maximum of 4–5 h after preparation. Thereafter, the blinking capacity will decrease and a new dSTORM buffer needs to be prepared and added to the sample.  Add a drop of oil to the 100× 1.46 NA objective.Place the chamber in the microscope 30 min before imaging to let the dSTORM buffer establish its equilibrium at a stabilized temperature. dSTORM imaging  Focus on the sample by eye through the oculars using the mercury lamp and appropriate filters.Search for a nucleus. A good nucleus or cell is characterized by a strong signal of all fluorophores, little to no background signal of fluorophores, and an optimal number of fiducials (at least 5–10, maximum 50). Too few fiducials make the alignment difficult/impossible and too many fiducials interfere with your signal to be imaged.Check the infrared signal using the camera (continuous mode) since it is not visible through the ocular lens.Set up the microscope for three channels; in our case, by selecting the laser 488, 561, or 642 (“on” in Figure 3) and the corresponding filter block BP 495-575, BP 570-650, or LP655 (the latter is visibly selected in Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4780/bioprotoc-13-14-4780-g003.jpg Figure 3. Screenshot of ZEN software.  Screenshot of ZEN software during direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) imaging and pre-processing to reconstruct dSTORM image. The yellow numbers indicate the relevant location on the screen corresponding to the steps described in Section E.",
    "The yellow rectangle indicates the relevant location on the screen related to Data analysis “Pre-processing to reconstruct dSTORM image.” i, ii, and iii indicate screen parts that become (completely) visible when sliding down the bar that is on the right side of the acquisition parameters column.Only for the first nucleus: set the TIRF angle by focusing on the sample using the AF647 channel and select EPI as illumination mode. Move the TIRF angle slider to the right until the signal disappears; this setting is just beyond the optimal TIRF angle. Then, move the slider to the left and stop when the penetration depth indicated in the software is between 190 and 200 nm. At this TIRF angle, only a small region just above the coverslip is illuminated, giving high signals and no background from out-of-focus contributions. Repeat this for CF568 and ATTO488. Note: A penetration depth between 190 and 200 nm should illuminate the full sample but not more. This can be achieved by moving from no signal until the brightest signal of the stained protein is visible.  Take a snapshot (z-stack) of the nucleus: select all channels one by one (Figure 3, screen i) and set the following settings: laser power = 2% (indicated with the yellow triangle), exposure time = 100 ms, EMCCD gain = 100 a.u., light path (Figure 3, main screenshot, under  Imaging setup  bar): switch track every = z-stack, Under acquisition mode bar: averaging = 2. Select the option  Z-stack  (Figure 3, main screenshot, top left, and Figure 3, screen ii), ensure that the image is in focus, and use the z-stack  Center  option. Thereafter, press  center  to put the z-stack in the middle of the cell. Select settings to make a z-stack with 35 slices of 0.110 μm.",
    "Notes:   When the signal is saturated, lower the gain.   These settings depend on the specific microscope and camera used. This is a low laser power setting to avoid monitor bleaching.  Press  Start Experiment  .Save the snapshot as a .czi file using file save (Exp1_snap.czi). The use of an experiment name is essential for the data analysis. In this example, we choose to use  Exp1  as our experiment name.Continue with the dSTORM imaging by selecting the following: Online Processing PALM (peak mask size = 9 pixels, peak intensity noise = 6) (Figure 3, main screenshot, under  Online processing Options  ), and under acquisition mode bar: averaging = 1, deselect “Z-Stack” (Figure 3, main screenshot, top left) and instead select  Time series  (12,000 frames).Focus on the observed image with the AF647 track selected.Adjust settings as follows (Figure 3, screen i): laser power = 100%, exposure time = 33 ms, EMCCD gain = 300 a.u., and press  Continuous  (Figure 3, main screenshot, top left). This will directly increase the signal intensity followed by an overall decrease of the signal, and finally in clearly blinking fluorophores on the screen. Press  Stop  when all fluorophores blink well, which can depend on the dSTORM buffer quality or the type of fluorophore. Under normal conditions, this takes a few minutes for Alexa 647. Note: These settings may have to be adapted depending on the microscope and camera. This setting pushes all fluorophores into a dark state, but high laser power can also bleach fluorophores. If too many fluorophores are bleached, lowering the laser power is essential. The camera is most sensitive when the gain is set at maximum (for EMCCD cameras) and when an exposure time is chosen that allows recording of individual separated blinking events.",
    "A longer exposure time will record more photons and thus lead to increased localization precision, but also yields a higher chance of recording multiple overlapping blinking events, which should be prevented.  Set the experiment to time series (Figure 3, screen iii) and define a series of 12,000 frames with 0 ms interval.Press  Start Experiment  .During the ongoing recording of 12,000 frames, make sure that the number of detections per frame (First Frame) stays approximately constant. When detection frequency decreases, this may be due to loss of focus or bleaching of fluorophores. Loss of focus can be assessed in the wide field image, and focus should be adjusted when necessary. If focus is corrected and detection frequency still decreases, bleaching of fluorophores can be slowed down by lowering the laser power to 90%, or an even lower percentage, but not lower than 70%. Notes:   For Alexa 647, most often it is not necessary to adjust the laser power.   Systems with hardware autofocus are highly recommended.  Save the movie as a .czi file (Exp1_Ch1.czi).Repeat steps E8–E15 for the CF568 (Exp1_Ch2.czi). Note: Proper dSTORM imaging of the CF568 fluorophore normally requires a bit longer waiting time before it starts to blink properly, compared with Alexa 647 (5–8 min). Make sure not to start recording too early, to ensure the optimal yield of blinking events.  Repeat steps E8–E15 for ATTO488 (Exp1_Ch3.czi). Notes:   Atto488 bleaches very fast. Therefore, when the high laser power is switched on at step E11, wait a few seconds and then directly start the experiment (steps E12–E13). During imaging, you will rapidly see a drop in the number of localization events per frame, and therefore the laser power should be lowered in steps of 10% to a minimum of 70% already during the first 1,000–1,500 frames.",
    "Green fluorophores are less suitable than longer wavelength fluorophores for dSTORM imaging, and therefore green dyes will give lower resolution images. This should be taken into account when choosing target proteins and their corresponding fluorescent label.   Another option to stimulate the blinking of the green dye is to use the 405 nm laser at very low power to release molecules from their dark state and increase the number of localization events."
