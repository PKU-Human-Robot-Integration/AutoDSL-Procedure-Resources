    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section provides detailed instructions for (a) performing surgeries for exposing the cervical (part 1) and lumbar segments (part 2) of the spinal cord, (b) intraspinal injection of the cervical and lumbar segments (part 3), and (c) reversing anesthesia and post-operative care following surgery (part 4). If performing cervical injections alone, skip part 2 and proceed directly to part 3. If performing lumbar injections alone, skip part 1 and proceed directly to part 2. If performing both cervical and lumbar injections on the same mouse, finish injecting one region, close the wound, and then proceed to perform surgery and injections on the second region.\nPart 1: Operative procedure for cervical spinal injections\nTiming: 10–20 min\nHere we describe how to perform surgery for exposing cervical segments of the spinal cord for intraspinal injections. Upon completion of the following steps, the cervical segments should be readily accessible for intraspinal injections (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and Methods video S6[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/972-Mmc1.pdf]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/972-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Transfer the mouse to the surgical area and place it on the window of the metal plate such that the underside of the mouse is exposed to the heating pad, then prepare the mouse for surgery.\nTape the forelimbs to the metal plate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nCritical: Take care not to tape the whiskers while taping the mouse.\nPlace a 3 mL syringe or a similarly sized wedge under the lower neck/upper back (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nNote: This will help lift the upper back of the mouse, providing easier access to the cervical spinal cord during surgery.\nFinally, tape the hindlegs and the tail at two points as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A such that the mouse remains taut along the rostro-caudal axis throughout the procedure (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: Ensure that the mouse is not pressed against the plate too tightly, which might otherwise lead to death or respiratory distress.\nOnce the mouse has been satisfactorily positioned, apply eye lubricant on both eyes to prevent drying of the eyes during surgery.\nSterilize the surgical site by swabbing the skin with three alternating rubs of povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol.\nUsing a scalpel, make a 2 cm long incision starting at the base of the head and extending through the midline of the back (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Slide a pair of blunt forceps under the rostral margin of the incision and use the retractor at the mouse’s head to retract the skin. Using the other retractors on the sides, retract the skin along the caudal margin on either side to create a triangular surgical window (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).",
    "In the exposed tissue, locate the margin (along the mediolateral axis) between the rostrally located trapezius muscle and the caudally located, lighter coloured adipose tissue. Using micro scissors, gently cut any fascia that might hold these two pieces of tissue along this margin. Adjust the rostrally placed retractor to tuck away the musculature, and similarly, adjust the other two retractors to tuck away the adipose tissue.\nLocate the prominent, long spinous process of the second thoracic vertebra (T2 vertebra), which protrudes dorsally from the spinal cord (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). Using micro scissors, snip the muscles that are attached rostrally to this vertebra. Gently slide the micro scissors underneath the rostrally located musculature and cut it along the midline to detach it from the underlying cervical vertebrae. Use two new retractors, one on either side of the mouse, to retract the midline muscles (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nUse the spinous process of the second thoracic vertebra (T2) as a landmark and count up from T2 to locate the appropriate cervical segments for injection (Harrison et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nNote: The number and identity of segments to be injected depend on the research question. Typically, to target neurons in the lower cervical regions, spinal segments between C5-C6, C6-C7, and C7-C8 vertebrae can be injected (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nUsing an absorption triangle, gently swab the exposed vertebrae and remove any residual tissue so as to obtain a clear view of the spinal cord segments.\nTo facilitate smooth entry of the micropipette into the spinal cord, puncture the meninges using a fine-tipped forceps (preferably Dumont #5SF Forceps) and peel it away (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]) (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7]).\nNote: If both sides of the spinal cord are to be injected, remove the meninges on either side of the midline.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",

Cervical surgery, related to steps 1–8 in part 1\n(Skip to Part 3 if only cervical injections are being performed).\nPart 2: Operative procedure for lumbar surgery\nTiming: 10–20 min\nHere we describe how to perform surgeries for exposing lumbar segments of the spinal cord for intraspinal injections. Upon completion of the following steps, the lumbar segments should be readily accessible for intraspinal injections (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and Methods video S7[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/972-Mmc1.pdf]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/972-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Representative images of a mouse at different stages of lumbar injection\n(A and B) An incision is made on the dorsal hump skin to expose the underlying musculature.\n(C) The musculature is gently separated to expose the vertebrae corresponding to lumbar spinal segments.\n(D) The exposed spinal segments with the corresponding vertebrae labelled.\nScale bar – 1 cm.\nUsing a scalpel, make an incision 2 cm in length, starting ∼1cm rostral to the middle of the hump (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B). Gently cut the musculature along the midline of the hump with micro scissors to expose the underlying vertebrae (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nLocate the T12-T13 vertebral junction, which is usually centered at the peak of the hump. Locate the lumbar segments of interest by counting up or down from the identified vertebra.\nNote: To target neurons in the lumbar cord (L1-L6 spinal segments), we typically inject the spinal segments between T11-12, T12-13, and T13-L1 vertebrae (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).",
    "Alternatives: Since the floating 13th rib (the lowest rib in mice) is attached to rostral end of the T13 vertebra, the latter can be identified by gently palpating the 13th rib and tracing its point of insertion into the spinal cord. To locate the 13th rib, pull down the incised skin along the left margin. This should expose 2–3 roughly parallel floating ribs of which the caudal most one is the 13th rib (Methods video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8]). If required, two magnetic retractors can be used to increase the area exposed under the skin.\nCritical: While palpating make sure not to damage the rib or puncture the pleural space.\nCut away the tissue that hold the vertebrae together to reveal the underlying spinal segments. (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3])\nNote: Unlike cervical surgery, moderate oozing or bleeding is common during lumbar surgeries, and so, periodically soak the excess blood using absorption triangles (Methods video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8]).\nGently swab the exposed vertebrae with absorption triangles to remove any residual tissue and to obtain a clear view of the spinal segments.\nCarefully puncture the meninges and peel it away to facilitate smooth entry of the micropipette into the spinal cord.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S7. Lumbar surgery, related to steps 9–13 in part 2\nPart 3: Procedure for cervical and lumbar injections\nTiming: 15–25 min\nHere we describe how to perform intraspinal injections.\nAfter the relevant spinal cord segments have been exposed, transfer the mouse along with the metal plate to the stereotaxic stage.\nCritical: Take care not to disturb the mouse or the retractors, which may otherwise impede clear view of the cervical segments. While positioning the mouse on the stereotaxic stage, ensure that there is adequate clearance between the mouse and the tip of the micropipette.",
    "Adjust the metal plate containing the mouse and the arms of the stereotaxic manipulator such that the micropipette tip is positioned directly above the surface of the first spinal segment to be injected. The micropipette should be 400–600 μm away from the midline.\nNote: The midline along the rostro-caudal axis can be identified by the blood vessel that runs along the length of the spinal cord.\nSet the total volume and rate of release of viral particles on the syringe pump. Typically, 250 nl of the solution containing viral particles is injected in each of the cervical segments, while 300 nl is injected in each of the lumbar segments at a rate of 75–100 nl per minute.\nCritical: Before performing the injections, run the program till a tiny drop of the viral solution can be seen forming at the tip of the micropipette to ensure that the micropipette is not blocked by any debris that might impede solution flow.\nUse the axis manipulators on the stereotaxic injector to gently lower the micropipette (Methods video S8[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc9]) so that it just about touches the surface of the spinal cord, and then tare the reading for the dorso-ventral coordinate.\nCritical: Taring the dorso-ventral coordinate is crucial since it enables accurate measurement of the depth of the micropipette tip while performing the injections.\nNote: If using an injector that does not digitally display the coordinates, note the start position of the rotating wheel and refer to manufacturer instructions to determine the number of rotations of the wheel that is required to advance the syringe by a millimeter. Typically, one rotation of the wheel should advance the syringe by a millimeter.",
    "To infect neurons in the dorsal laminae of the spinal cord, gently lower the micropipette to a depth of 500 μm and pull back 200 μm, so that micropipette tip settles at ∼ 300 μm from the dorsal surface. To infect neurons in the ventral laminae of the spinal cord, gently lower the micropipette to a depth of 800–1000 μm and withdraw 200 μm, so that the micropipette tip settles at a depth of ∼600–800 μm from the dorsal surface (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: After a segment has been injected, wait one minute before pulling the micropipette out to ensure that the viral solution is efficiently absorbed by the tissue and does not leak out. Additionally, before proceeding to inject the next segment, run the program till a small drop of virus solution can be seen pooling at the tip (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nRepeat the preceding two steps to inject the remaining segments.\nOnce the mouse is injected, move the metal plate containing the mouse to a flat surface. Wait for bleeding, if any, to stop. Gently remove the retractors holding the muscles and then suture the midline muscles using a 6-0 absorbable suture (Methods video S9[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S8. Spinal injection, related to steps 14–21 in part 3\nNext, remove the retractors holding the skin and use wound clips or 6-0 sutures to close the skin wound (Methods video S9[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S9. Suturing, related to step 21 in part 3\nPart 4: Post-operative care\nTiming: 10–30 min\nReverse the anesthesia by intraperitoneally injecting an appropriate volume of the reversal drug cocktail.\nReturn the mouse to its home cage.\nThe mouse should awaken within 2–4 min and ambulate within 15–20 min of administering the reverse cocktail.",
    "To counteract any loss in body temperature, place a hot pack or hand warmer on the cage floor overnight.\nAlternatives: The cage containing the mouse can be placed in a temperature-controlled incubator for a few hours before being returned to the holding cage rack. In this case, remove the top lid or the air filter so that the cage is adequately vented during the time in the incubator. Follow manufacturer’s instructions to ensure that the ambient temperature in the incubator is around 25°C–27°C.\nPlace a few food pellets on the floor of the cage for a day, so that the mice can easily access the food.\nAdminister analgesics (Meloxicam) for two days following surgery using a 1mL syringe with a 26-gauge needle (please refer to Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/972-Mmc1.pdf] for calculating the concentration and volume of meloxicam). While handling mice for injecting analgesics, avoid scruffing the mouse as this may not only be painful for the mouse, but also irritate the wound and disturb the staples or sutures. Instead, gently place the mouse on the steel food rack and lift the base of the mouse away from the rack floor by lifting the tail to gain access to the intraperitoneal space and then swiftly inject the mouse (Methods video S10[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc11]).\nThe day after the surgery, monitor mice for any signs of spinal damage, including partial or complete paralysis in one or more limbs after surgery. While relatively uncommon (∼ < 5% of mice injected), varying degrees of paralysis might result from damage to the spinal cord during surgery depending on the extent and location of the injury on the spinal cord. Euthanize mice displaying paralysis to prevent further distress to the mice.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
