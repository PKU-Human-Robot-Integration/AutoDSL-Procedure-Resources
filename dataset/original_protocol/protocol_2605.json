    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing the ovary cooler (Day -1)\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step helps the user identify and collect materials necessary to clean abattoir-derived ovaries before transporting them back to the laboratory.\nFill two, 2 L PYREX glass bottles with 0.9% sodium chloride.\nSupplement the 0.9% sodium chloride solution with 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (ABAM) and mix.\nTo the insulated cooler, add 1) the two, 2 L PYREX glass bottles containing 0.9% sodium chloride with ABAM, 2) a strainer, 3) latex or nitrile gloves.\nNote: Our laboratory uses an Igloo 28-Quart Quantum Wheeled Cooler with dimensions of 18.45 × 13.35 × 16.52 inches (length × width × height). We would recommend using any plastic, collapsible strainer that fits within your specific cooler dimensions.\nNote: We recommend storing the packed cooler at 15°C–25°C within the main compartment of the vehicle when transporting ovaries as to not expose them to extreme temperatures (hot or cold). Although, we also recommend that each individual laboratory should assess if 15°C–25°C is the best ovary storage condition for them and their needs.\nDrive to an abattoir to collect heifer or cow ovaries.",
    "Note: Depending on the situation, it may be best to prepare oocyte collection and maturation media before departing for the abattoir. However, if someone else is driving to the abattoir for the person needing ovaries, they would have the luxury to prepare media dishes anytime in this process as long as it is before the 2-hour minimum mark (see below for more information on media equilibration times). Conversely, if the user is responsible for both going to the abattoir and media equilibration, it would be most beneficial if media equilibration started before their departure to the abattoir. This way the user can get started immediately upon arriving with ovaries to the laboratory and not have to wait 2-hours for media equilibration before starting work.\nPreparing oocyte collection and maturation media (Day -1)\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step helps the user ensure their medium needed for oocyte collection and maturation are properly warmed and equilibrated for use upon ovary arrival for cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) collections. All media preparation needs to be done with aseptic technique within a laminar flow hood.\nTwo hours before use, warm pre-made oocyte collection media in a water bath set to 38.5°C.\nMinimally two hours before use, oocyte maturation media needs to be plated and equilibrated. Two options exist (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Maturation plate and dish options\n(A) The 4-well Nunc™ plate maturation option. Each well of the 4-well Nunc™ plate is filled with 500 μL of oocyte-maturation media (OMM) and covered in oil. Next to it is a 35 mm petri dish filled halfway with OMM and covered in oil, which will serve as the ‘wash’ dish.",
    "(B) The 60 mm petri dish maturation option. Each micro-drop of the 60 mm petri dish is 50 μL of oocyte-maturation media (OMM) and covered in oil. Next to it is a 35 mm petri dish filled halfway with OMM and covered in oil, which will serve as the ‘wash’ dish.\nOption 1:\nUsing 4-well Nunc™ plates, sterilely add 500 μL oocyte maturation media (OMM) into the desired number of wells.\nCompletely cover each well with mineral oil using a transfer pipette.\nTransfer OMM Nunc™ plate(s) to a humidified incubator set at 38.5°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: In option 1, each well can hold and mature 20-35 COCs; although 25-30 is preferred.\nOption 2:\nUsing a 60 mm petri dish, sterilely add 50 μL drops of OMM for desired number of times.\nAdd mineral oil using a transfer pipette to the petri dish until each drop is fully covered.\nTransfer OMM petri dish(es) to a humidified incubator set at 38.5°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: In option 2, each micro-drop can hold and mature 10 COCs.\nMinimally two hours before use, plate and equilibrate wash dishes containing OMM.\nUsing 35 mm petri dish(es), sterilely add ∼3 mL of OMM using a transfer pipette.\nCompletely cover each dish with mineral oil using a transfer pipette.\nTransfer OMM wash dish(es) to a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator set at 38.5°C.\nNote: It is recommended to use one wash dish per 400 or fewer COCs.\nNote: Media can be equilibrated 12–16 h without apparent issues; however, we would not recommend extending the equilibration time too far as to conserve the antimicrobial activities of the antibiotic within these media.\nProcessing abattoir-derived ovaries (Day -1)\nTiming: 10 min",
    "This step helps rid the ovaries of any blood and contaminants that could interfere with the in vitro embryo production process. This should be done at the abattoir immediately after ovary collection and before transportation back to the laboratory.\nOnce the desired number of ovaries have been collected from an abattoir, they need to be rinsed and strained using one of the 2 L PYREX glass bottles containing 0.9% sodium chloride with 1× ABAM.\nTo do this, place unwashed ovaries into a strainer and pour an entire 2 L of 0.9% sodium chloride with 1× ABAM over them.\nNote: If there are too many ovaries that are unable to fit in the strainer at one time, the process of straining and rinsing may be done in multiple groups separately.\nNote: Since the dirty rinsed material will be discarded, it does not matter where the user decides to strain their ovaries (over grass, into a separate bucket, etc.).\nNote: To determine the desired number of ovaries that need collected depends on several factors. The ovaries received are of unknown quality as they are collected and distributed at random off of the kill-floor; however, we have estimated that around a third of ovaries received are of ‘good’ quality, a third are of ‘medium’ quality, and the last third are ‘low’ quality. While this provides a good estimate, quality and numbers of ovaries per quality category can vary from collection to collection.",
    "Our laboratory generally considers ovaries with ≥ 10 antral follicles, 6–10 antral follicles, and ≤ 5 antral follicles as high, medium, and low quality, respectively. Other quality factors such as ovary color and size of follicles are also assessed with off-colored ovaries (brown or yellow) and small follicles ≤ 2 mm considered as low quality. We expect each ‘good’ ovary to yield ∼10 COCs, sometimes more. We are unaware of any data to suggest that number of antral follicles per ovary corresponds to greater quality of COCs. However, by selecting ovaries with the most follicles, and therefore most COCs, users can spend less total time ‘slashing’ ovaries. This is not only more efficient, but getting COCs into an incubator faster can only be positive to their maturation and development.\nPlace rinsed ovaries directly into the bottom of the insulated cooler.\nPour the remaining 2 L PYREX glass bottle containing 0.9% sodium chloride with ABAM on top of the ovaries to submerge and prevent them from drying out.\nTransport the insulated cooler containing rinsed and submerged ovaries back to the laboratory.\nNote: Reminder, we recommend storing the cooler at 15°C–25°C within the main compartment of the vehicle when transporting ovaries as to not expose them to extreme temperatures (cold or hot). Although, we would recommend that each individual lab should assess if 15°C–25°C is the best ovary storage condition for them and their needs.\nOvary arrival and sorting (Day -1)\nTiming: 15–30 min\nThis step helps to select ovaries of the highest quality, which are anticipated to yield greater numbers of COCs. The time of 15-30 min given for this step is an estimate; the exact timing will depend on the total number of ovaries being sorted and how many people are helping.",
    "Set out three reusable polypropylene low-form graduated beakers to sort ovaries into three main categories based on quality: high, medium, or low.\nSort the ovaries into their respective quality beakers (high, medium, or low; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cow ovaries of various quality\nOvaries are of high, medium, and low quality from left to right, respectively.\nNote: See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for examples of ovary quality.\nNote: Reminder, ovaries with ≥ 10 antral follicles, 6–10 antral follicles, and ≤ 5 antral follicles are considered high, medium, and low quality, respectively.\nNote: Reminder, ‘good’ ovaries are expected to yield ∼10 COCs, sometimes more.\nAfter the highest quality ovaries are sorted, count individual ovaries until desired amount is reached and placed into individual reusable polypropylene low-form graduated beakers for each user.\nPour new 0.9% sodium chloride with 1× ABAM on top of ovaries until they are submerged.\nOnce submerged, gently massage the ovaries and drain the liquid down the sink to further rid them of blood and contaminants.\nRepeat this step until the saline and antibiotic solution remains clear after massaging.\nNote: In general, our laboratory finds 3–4 rounds of massage and rinses to be sufficient.\nOnce finished rinsing, add enough saline and antibiotic solution to each user(s) polypropylene low-form graduated beaker to fully submerge ovaries to prevent them from drying out.\nCumulus-oocyte complex (COC) collection and maturation (Day -1)\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThis step accomplishes selecting the highest quality of immature oocytes that will be matured in order to create embryos later on in this protocol. The exact time will depend on total number of COCs needing to be matured and the number of people assisting.\nPrepare a slashing station: 1 absorbent underpad, scissors, scalpel handle and blades, a 250 mL beaker, and a hemostat.",
    "Immediately before slashing, add 75 mL oocyte collection media (OCM) to each beaker and place one at each slashing station (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A slashing station\nA slashing station is complete with one absorbent underpad, scissors, scalpel handle and blades, a 250 mL beaker filled with 75 mL of OCM, and a hemostat.\nNote: Our laboratory generally follows the guidelines of 10–15 ovaries per 75 mL OCM.\nCarefully attach a scalpel blade onto the scalpel handle.\nUsing a hemostat, clamp the utero-ovarian ligament so that the ovary is held tightly.\nTrim away excess utero-ovarian ligament with scissors (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Removing excess tissue and slashing a cow ovary\n(A) Excess tissue and ligament removal from an ovary. Once an ovary is firmly grasped by the hemostat, a user will use scissors to trim away and discard excess tissue from the ovary.\n(B) An ‘x’ incision over a single follicle. A user uses a scalpel handle with blade to make an ‘X’ incision over a follicle on the ovary.\n(C) Ovary with all follicles ‘slashed’.\nIf there are any large follicles (≥ 8 mm), rupture them off to the side over the absorbent underpad making sure to avoid getting the follicular fluid in the OCM beaker as larger follicles are more prone to cause clotting in the OCM media.\nBegin ‘slashing’ any visible (antral) follicles ˂8 mm over top of the OCM filled beaker by scalpel with a scalpel blade attached (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: This can be done by making an ‘X’ incision over each follicle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Note: If the user prefers, they can make several horizontal slashes into the ovary and then come back and do several vertical slashes like a ‘checkerboard’. The ‘checkerboard’ slashing technique can be useful by saving time if there are a large number of follicles present on the ovary instead of paying individual attention to each follicle by the single ‘X’ method.\nCritical: Avoid slashing highly vascularized parts of the ovary or slash shallower to prevent bleeding as it can cause media clotting.\nOnce each follicle has been slashed, submerge the slashed ovary still attached to the hemostat into the OCM beaker and swirl intensely.\nOnce swirled, scrape all sides of the ovary up against the inside of the beaker.\nRepeat this process for each ovary making sure to switch out scalpel blades whenever too much resistance is felt due to a dulling blade.\nAfter slashing, transport the beaker containing COCs to a filtering station: 1 absorbent underpad, a tube rack capable of holding (2) 50 mL conical tubes, transfer pipette, search plate, and 100 μM strainer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Filtering for COCs\nSolution from a 250 mL beaker containing OCM, debris, follicular fluid, and blood is filtered through a 100 μm cell strainer.\nAttach a 100 μm strainer on top of an empty 50 mL conical tube.\nBegin pouring the liquid from the beaker slowly through the strainer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nWhen the flow through the strainer begins to slow, remove the strainer off of the 50 mL conical tube and invert it over an opened search plate.\nUsing a transfer pipette, pipette up fresh, warmed OCM media, and dispense this media over the inverted cell strainer to displace COCs and tissue debris into the search plate.",
    "Repeat the process until there is no more media left in the beaker.\nNote: If the search plate becomes too cloudy from blood and follicular fluid, users are able to split their beaker containing COCs and media into extra search plates, which will be diluted using more OCM in turn making COCs easier to see under the microscope.\nOnce the beaker is empty, use a transfer pipette to pipette up fresh OCM and rinse the beaker and go through the strainer one final time.\nFill the search plate with additional fresh OCM until it fills half of the search plate.\nMove the search plate onto a plate warmer if more slashing is required or onto a glass microscope warmer attached to a stereomicroscope if ready to begin searching.\nWhen ready to begin searching, fill a 35 mm petri dish halfway with fresh OCM (∼3 mL) using a transfer pipette, and assemble a Drummond™ Captrol (or other similar devices: Drummond™ Wiretrol™, The STRIPPER® or mouth pipette) by attaching a hand-pulled, captrol glass tip onto the Captrol (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. An assembled Captrol device\nA Captrol device with a hand-pulled glass tip attached.\nLocate individual COCs and collect them, paying special attention to avoid debris, up in the captrol tip and periodically release them into the 35 mm OCM petri dish.\nRepeat this step until the entire search plate has been searched.\nNote: We use a Nikon SMZ800N stereomicroscope for visualizing and collecting COCs from the search plate.\nNote: See Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] for a representative view of a COC in a search plate with debris.\nNote: It is recommended to gently agitate the search plate to redistribute any potential leftover COCs, and then re-search the entire plate to ensure all COCs have been found.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig7.jpg",
    "Figure 7. Representative image of a search plate after slashing and filtering\nA microscopic view on a search plate containing various tissue debris and a singular COC. A red arrow is pointing to the single COC.\nThe scale bar represents 670 μm.\nAfter all searching is complete and COCs have been all gathered in the 35 mm petri dish, remove an OMM wash dish from the incubator and place it on the plate warmer.\nUsing a P200 pipette set to 200 μL with a gel-loading tip attached, transfer all COCs from the 35 mm OCM dish into the OMM wash dish.\nGently move the OMM dish containing COCs in a circular motion to wash COCs and to gather them in the middle of the dish.\nCritical: Once the COCs are in the OMM wash, they should be transferred into their final maturation plates and returned to the incubator as soon as possible to limit media pH change due to exposure of atmospheric conditions.\nWhen ready to transfer COCs into their final maturation 4-well Nunc™ or 60 mm petri dish, remove them from the incubator and place on the plate warmer.\nUsing a Captrol (or other similar devices: Drummond™ Wiretrol™, The STRIPPER® or mouth pipette), collect 20–30 good quality COCs (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) and transfer them into 1 well of a 4-well Nunc™ plate (if using) containing 500 μL of OMM/well covered in oil.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. COC quality\n(A) Representative image of ‘bad’ quality COCs. These COCs contain 1) very few cumulus cells, 2) deteriorating cumulus cells, 3) very pale ooplasm, or 4) heterogenous ooplasm (i.e., salt and pepper appearance of the oocyte).",
    "(B) Representative image of ‘good’ quality COCs. These COCs contain 1) multiple layers of cumulus cells, a 2) healthy (non-deteriorating) appearance of cumulus cells, and 3) homogenous ooplasm (no speckled appearance).\nThe scale bar represents 670 μm.\nNote: See Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8] for images of bad versus good quality COCs.\nCritical: Ensure COCs selected for maturation are of good quality: homogenous ooplasm, free of granulation, several layers of homogenous cumulus cells, appear representative to the majority in regard to size (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nAlternatively, collect 10 good quality COCs and transfer them into 1, 50 μL drop of OMM in a 60 mm petri dish covered in oil, if using.\nRepeat until all COCs are plated, and then place maturation plates back into a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set to 38.5°C and incubate for 21–24 h for maturation.\nPreparing sperm gradient, fertilization plates or dishes, fertilization wash, and sperm pellet and HEPES-SOF washes (Day 0)\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nThis step helps the user ensure their medium needed for the IVF process are properly warmed and equilibrated for use.\nMinimally two hours before use, prepare the sperm gradient, fertilization plates or dishes, fertilization wash, and SOF-FERT and HEPES-SOF washes in a laminar flow hood.\nFor the sperm gradient: In (2) 15 mL conical tubes, add 4 mL BoviPure and 1 mL BoviDilute to make an 80% solution. In(1) 15 mL conical tube, add 4 mL BoviPure and 6 mL BoviDilute to make a 40% solution. We use serological pipettes for this task.\nWrap each cap in parafilm and set in a 38.5°C water bath.\nFor the fertilization plates or dishes, two options exist:",
    "Option 1: fertilize COCs in a 35 mm petri dish filled with 2.8 mL SOF-FERT covered in oil. One may fertilize 120–200 COCs per 2.8 mL SOF-FERT dish. Once made, place dishes in a humidified 38.5°C 5% CO2 incubator.\nOption 2: fertilize COCs in a 4-well Nunc™ plate with 500 μL SOF-FERT covered in oil for each well in use. One may fertilize 20–50 COCs per 500 μL SOF-FERT well. Once made, place plates in a humidified 38.5°C 5% CO2 incubator.\nFor COC fertilization washes: Two SOF-FERT wash dishes should be made for each ‘set’ (400 COCs or fewer) of COCs that the user is working with.\nTo make, fill (2) 35 mm petri dishes halfway with SOF-FERT media using a transfer pipette.\nDo not cover these in oil.\nOnce made, place dishes in a humidified 38.5°C 5% CO2 incubator.\nFor the sperm pellet wash: In(1) 15 mL conical tube, add 8–10 mL of SOF-FERT using a serological pipette.\nOnce prepared, place the conical tube in its stand and place into a humidified 38.5°C 5% CO2 incubator with its cap off for gas exchange to equilibrate.\nFor the HEPES-SOF wash: In(1) 15 mL conical tube, add 12 mL HEPES-SOF per one set of COCs (≤400) using a serological pipette.\nWrap the cap(s) in parafilm and set in a 38.5°C water bath.\nNote: While not required, our lab likes to use parafilm here as a protective barrier between water bath and media should the water bath contain contaminants such as bacteria.\nNote: If processing more COCs (>400), simply prepare more fertilization washes and/or plates and another 15 mL conical tube filled with 12 mL HEPES-SOF.\nPreparing for IVF (Day 0)\nTiming: 15 min",
    "This step helps the user ensure they have all materials ready for use during the IVF process. It is pivotal to adhere to the time constraints detailed in this section; therefore, setting up for the entirety of the IVF process prior to beginning is instrumental to its success.\nTurn on microscope warmers.\nNote: Our lab uses the Nikon SMZ800N stereomicroscope for COC processing and an entry level research grade inverted microscope (FisherBrand, catalog number 03-000-013) for sperm counting. The inverted microscope does not need warmed since sperm on hemocytometer are dead and discarded after counting.\nFill Citothaw with water and plug-in to warm.\nCritical: The Citothaw must warm to and remain at 95°–98°F for proper semen thawing.\nTurn on centrifuge and preheat it to 37°C.\nNote: In addition to being heated, the centrifuge needs the capacity to hold 15 mL conical tubes.\nWipe down all countertops, tables, microscopes, and plate warmers with 70% ethanol.\nOn the countertop, set out: P1000 pipette with corresponding filtered tips, P200 pipette with corresponding filtered tips, P20 pipette with corresponding filtered tips, several transfer pipettes, (1) 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, hemocytometer, scissors, (1) 50 mL conical tube, (1) 15 mL conical tube, and two conical tube stands (one for the 40/80% sperm gradient tubes, and one for holding the empty 50 and 15 mL conical tubes needed to collect semen and pelleted sperm, respectively).\nSet (3) empty 35 mm petri dishes on the plate warmer.\nRemove (1) 15 mL conical tube of HEPES-SOF from the water bath and wipe down with 70% ethanol.\nUsing a transfer pipette, fill each 35 mm petri dish halfway with HEPES-SOF from this conical tube.\nPlace (1) 70 μm cell strainer in the first HEPES-SOF 35 mm petri dish.\nProceed directly to the next major step, IVF (Day 0).",
    "IVF (Day 0)\nTiming: 1 h and 15 min\nThis step accomplishes fertilizing COCs in order to produce zygotes.\nNote: The IVF process begins by handling the semen. During its first centrifugation is when the user will have time to process the COCs.\nRemove the (2) 80% and (1) 40% BoviPure/BoviDilute tubes from the water bath and wipe down with 70% ethanol.\nCritical: Carefully handle the tubes containing the layered gradient to prevent mixing of the layers to maintain their integrity.\nAfter they are wiped down, they can be placed in a conical tube stand.\nTo create the 40/80% gradient, very slowly layer 5 mL of the 40% solution on top of the first 80% tube using a transfer pipette.\nCritical: It is very important to layer the gradient slowly or else the user risks mixing the gradients which can impair its function of separating normal purified sperm from dead or abnormal sperm.\nRepeat the same process for the remaining 80% tube.\nNote: The end result is (2) 15 mL conical tubes each filled with 10 mL of media: the top 5 mL are of 40% solution and the bottom 5 mL are of 80% solution.\nNote: If using less than 4 straws of semen, it is recommended to put all semen into(1) 40/80% tube to increase visibility of the resulting sperm pellet since it will be small in size.\nWhen gradients have been prepared, set them back into the water bath to remain warm.\nProceed to the liquid nitrogen tank with a warmed Citothaw (set to 37°C) to thaw straw(s) of semen.\nQuickly remove the desired amount of semen straws needed to fertilize COCs and immediately place into the Citothaw to thaw for 45 s.",
    "Note: The desired number of straws will depend on number of COCs needing fertilized and how many spermatozoa are loaded into individual straws. The latter number is bull dependent determined and set by the semen company.\nRemove the thawed straws of semen and wipe down with 70% ethanol.\nCritical: Make sure the semen straws and the user’s gloves are completely dry as water and ethanol will kill sperm.\nOnce everything is dry, cut the tip end of the straw(s) with scissors and move straw(s) over the top of an opened 50 mL conical tube.\nNext, cut the other end of the straw(s) under the cotton plug to expel their contents into the 50 mL conical tube.\nGently flick the straws against the sides of the 50 mL conical tube to ensure all contents are expelled.\nNow, hold the conical tube containing semen and extender in the user’s hand to keep it warm and decrease the likelihood of cold shock.\nQuickly, but gently, remove the (2) 40/80% gradient tubes out of the water bath, wipe down with 70% ethanol, and set them in a conical tube rack.\nUsing a transfer pipette, slowly aspirate up the semen and extender and slowly deposit it equally across the tops of both gradient tubes (or one gradient tube is using less semen) (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Before and after centrifuging semen\n(A) Semen on top of a gradient. The right 15 mL conical tube contains the warmed 40/80% gradient where bull semen (5 straws worth) has been thawed at appropriate temperature and carefully layered on top of the gradient. The left 15 mL conical tube contains water that will be used as the balance for the other tube. At this point, these tubes are ready to begin the first centrifugation.",
    "(B) A visible sperm pellet after the first centrifuge spin. Live sperm has migrated down the 15 mL conical tube to form a pellet after the 25-min centrifugation.\nNote: Ensure that the final volume in each tube is identical before centrifugation for balancing purposes.\nGently place each gradient with semen and extender across from each other in the centrifuge for balancing.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 25 min at 37°C.\nOptional: Set a timer for 24 min and ensure completion of COC processing before centrifugation finishes.\nAs the semen is centrifuging, remove matured COCs from the incubator.\nNote: We recommend that the user takes note of how their COCs visually appear post-maturation at this exact point. If maturation was successful, the cumulus cells should have grown and expanded to where they appear much larger and ‘fluffy’ than before maturation (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). If the COCs have poor cumulus expansion, it is recommended to take note of this but continue processing them regardless as some will still develop into a blastocyst. This visual assessment and recording will be useful when trying to explain or troubleshoot any reasons for poor blastocyst rates if improper expansion was to occur.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

The cumulus cells have expanded in size and acquire a ‘fluffy’ appearance.\nThe scale bar represents 670 μm.\nUsing a P200 set to 200 μL, move COCs using gel-loading tips from their maturation plates into the center of a 70 μm cell strainer within the first HEPES-SOF wash.\nNote: The outside of the gel-loading tip needs to be wiped with a Kimwipe to remove oil before depositing COCs into the cell strainer.",
    "After the COCs are dispensed into the cell strainer in the first HEPES-SOF wash, gently swirl them around to wash.\nOnce swirled, move the filter into the second HEPES-SOF wash and swirl again.\nRepeat this for third and final HEPES-SOF wash.\nWhen the filter with COCs is in the last HEPES-SOF wash, remove the (2) 35 mm SOF-FERT wash dishes out of the incubator and place onto the plate warmer.\nMove the filter from HEPES-SOF into the first SOF-FERT wash, swirl, and repeat for the second and final SOF-FERT wash.\nOnce the filter with COCs is in the last SOF-FERT wash, remove the final IVF plate(s) or dish(es) (4-well Nunc™ or 35 mm dish, respectively) from the incubator.\nUsing a P200 set to 200 μL with gel-loading tip, pipette up desired number of COCs and transfer into 35 mm petri dish(es) for IVF, if using.\nNote: The final volume in this dish will now be 3 mL.\nAlternatively, if using a 4-well Nunc™ for IVF, it is recommended to transfer COCs into each 500 μL in as little volume as possible to keep the final volume as close to 500 μL/well.\nWhen finished plating, return IVF plate(s) or dish(es) into the humidified 38.5°C 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: When sperm is ready, it will be directly added into these plates at a final concentration of 1 million sperm/ 1 mL of fertilization media.\nNote: At this point, sperm centrifugation should be close to being complete. If time allows, the user can clean up their microscope plates and dispose of used plates, dishes, tips, and strainer(s). It is important to remove tubes from the centrifuge as soon as it finishes or else there is risk of sperm migrating up from the pellet.",
    "Gently remove the (2) 15 mL conical tubes containing sperm to a conical tube rack.\nCritical: A visible sperm pellet at the bottom of the conical tubes must be observed (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). The user must aspirate the sperm pellet and transfer into a new 15 mL conical tube. If a sperm pellet is not observed, the user likely needs to start the entire process again as there likely will not be enough viable sperm to perform fertilization.\nTo aspirate the sperm pellet, use a transfer pipette to pick up the sperm pellet from the bottom, collecting as little excess of BoviPure/BoviDilute as possible, and release it into a new 15 mL conical tube.\nRepeat for the remaining tube (if using) containing the other sperm pellet and combine into the same 15 mL conical tube used in the previous step.\nOnce the sperm pellet(s) have been isolated into a new 15 mL conical, wash it by adding 7–9 mL of SOF-FERT from the SOF-FERT tube that has been equilibrated in the incubator to the 15 mL conical tube containing the isolated sperm pellet(s).\nMix the SOF-FERT and sperm pellet gently by doing a soft inversion twice to combine.\nCritical: Leave at least 1 mL of SOF-FERT behind and return to the incubator because SOF-FERT is used to dilute sperm if the concentration determined by the hemocytometer is excessive.\nCentrifuge the washed sperm pellet for 5 min at 300 × g at 37°C.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully remove the tube containing the sperm pellet.\nTo isolate the sperm pellet, use a transfer pipette to slowly aspirate off the supernatant down to the 2 mL mark.\nOnce at 2 mL, switch to a P1000 set to 1,000 μL for better hand control to decrease the likelihood of disrupting the pellet.",
    "Note: If the sperm pellet moves or is no longer visible, re-centrifuge at the same parameters above.\nPipette off excess liquid off the top using the P1000 pipette until you have about 100 μL of SOF-FERT remaining on top of the sperm pellet.\nAgitate the tube to mix.\nDetermine sperm concentration using a hemocytometer.\nNote: Our lab reads the hemocytometer with sperm on an entry level research grade inverted microscope (FisherBrand, catalog number 03-000-013).\nNote: A 1:10 dilution of sperm to water may be helpful prior to loading the hemocytometer. Using water as the diluent is important to kill sperm in order to immobilize them to provide an accurate cell count. Other dilutions may be used; the exact dilution will depend on sperm per straw (bull and semen company dependent). Regardless, any dilution used will need factored into the calculation for determining sperm concentration.\nOnce the concentration has been determined, add sperm to the plate or dish containing fertilization media and COCs at a final concentration of 1 million sperm/1 mL fertilization media.\nNote: As an example, if a user has a fertilization dish with 2.8 mL of fertilization media, the user would use a P200 pipette set to 200 μL and collect all COCs that will be fertilized in that dish within that volume. Therefore, the final volume of the dish would now be 3 mL. Therefore, it would require 3 million sperm in order to achieve the final concentration of 1 million sperm/1 mL fertilization media.\nOnce sperm is added into IVF dishes, it is recommended to zoom in on the microscope to visualize sperm motility to get an idea of technical success.\nNote: Our lab uses the Nikon SMZ800N stereomicroscope for COC work and visualizing sperm motility.",
    "After adding sperm into the dishes containing COCs, move all IVF dishes into a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set at 38.5°C and incubate for 16–22 h.\nPreparing culture plates, HEPES-SOF, and hypoxia chamber (Day 0 or 1)\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step helps the user ensure their medium needed for embryo culture are properly warmed and equilibrated for use.\nNote: If using a hypoxia chamber, it needs prepared the evening prior (Day 0) to IVC (Day 1). A hypoxia chamber should be used and prepared the evening prior if the lab does not have access to an incubator flowing with tri-gas (5% CO2 and O2 and 90% N2). However, if entire incubator(s) exist with tri-gas, users do not need to use a hypoxia chamber since its function is to serve as a tri-gas containment vessel.\nTo clean a hypoxia chamber, thoroughly spray it with 70% ethanol, and let air dry overnight in a clean space.\nNote: If using an incubator filled with tri-gas (5% CO2 and O2 and 90% N2), you can bypass the above step.\nAt least two hours before culturing, prepare culture washes, final culture plates, and HEPES-SOF wash.\nFor culture plates:\nUsing 4-well Nunc™ plates, sterilely add a 50 μL drop of SOF-BE1 into the center of each well.\nCompletely cover each drop with mineral oil using a transfer pipette.\nTransfer the 4-well Nunc™ culture plate(s) to a humidified incubator or chamber set at 38.5°C filled with 5% CO2.",
    "Note: Each 50 µL culture drop can hold and culture 20–30 embryos; preferably 25 per drop. We have noticed that development can be decreased when culturing less than 20 embryos in a 50 µL drop of SOF-BE1. In theory, a user may be able to culture 15–19 embryos in a drop if drop size is changed accordingly. We would not suggest testing fewer numbers like individual culture since embryos thrive growing in groups for exchanging beneficial factors to one another. However, we have not tested this enough to suggest it as a viable option. Each lab should do a few replicates of testing out lower group sizes if they want to adopt that option.\nNote: Our laboratory likes to use 4-well Nunc™ plates for embryo culture because each well will contain a single culture drop. Therefore, if contamination were to occur, it may just affect a single drop contained within a single well rather than the entire plate. For example, if culturing in a 35 mm petri dish containing multiple culture drops, contamination may be more likely to affect the entire plate since there is no separation boundary of individual wells.\nFor culture washes:\nUsing two 35 mm petri dishes, sterilely add ∼3 mL of SOF-BE1 using a transfer pipette to create two SOF-BE1 wash plates, which are recommended per 400 or fewer presumptive zygotes being cultured.\nCompletely cover one of the two SOF-BE1 wash dishes with mineral oil using a transfer pipette.\nRepeat making additional sets of wash dishes if needed.\nTransfer culture washes of SOF-BE1 to a humidified incubator or chamber set at 38.5°C filled with5% CO2.\nFor HEPES-SOF washes:\nUsing a serological pipette, sterilely add 12 mL of HEPES-SOF to a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Wrap each conical tube cap with parafilm and place in a 38.5°C water bath until use at IVC.\nNote: While not required, our lab likes to use parafilm here as a protective barrier between water bath and media should the water bath contain contaminants such as bacteria.\nNote: It is recommended to use 12 mL HEPES-SOF per 400 or fewer presumptive zygotes.\nIVC (Day 1)\nTiming: 30 min–1 h and 30 min\nThis step accomplishes denuding presumptive zygotes, and transferring them into culture media. The exact time will depend on how many presumptive zygotes the user is handling, and how experienced they are as more experienced users will be faster at this process.\nNote: At time of IVC, the user will 1) remove a 15 mL HEPES-SOF conical tube from the water bath and disinfect it using 70% ethanol, 2) use a transfer pipette to add ∼3 mL pre-warmed HEPES-SOF into three, new 35 mm petri dishes placed on a plate warmer, and 3) add a 70 μM strainer into the second HEPES-SOF wash.\nRemove fertilization plates containing presumptive zygotes from the incubator onto the warmer of the microscope or nearby plate warmer.\nNote: If using 35 mm fertilization dishes, gently swirl the dish to try to group the presumptive zygotes close together in the middle of the dish for easier collection and pipetting.\nUsing a P200 set to 200 μL with gel-loading pipette tips, aspirate up all presumptive zygotes.\nUse a Kimwipe to wipe the outside of the pipette tip to remove oil that originated from the fertilization plate or dish.\nOnce wiped, release presumptive zygotes into the first 35 mm dish containing HEPES-SOF and no strainer.",
    "Note: If the user was unable to gather all presumptive zygotes in the first aspiration, this process may be repeated; although, it is best to minimize the addition of extra SOF-FERT into the HEPES-SOF dish for pH stability of the media.\nAfter the presumptive zygotes are dispensed into the first HEPES-SOF wash, gently swirl them around to wash and to collect them tightly into the center of the dish for easier pipetting.\nNext, denude (remove cumulus cells; see note) presumptive zygotes from the first HEPES-SOF wash dish.\nTo denude, set a P200 pipette to 180 μL with a gel-loading tip attached.\nAspirate up all presumptive zygotes in 180 μL of volume and dispense into a sterile, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nIf repeat pipetting: reset the P200 pipette to 150 μL. Set a timer for 4 min and proceed to repeatedly pipette up and down continuously.\nIf vortexing: close the tube lid and vortex the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing presumptive zygotes for 5 min.",
    "Note: Two mechanical options exist for denuding which is dependent upon personal preference: repeat pipetting or vortexing. Both denuding methods have positives and negatives. Some users opt to use the vortex method for denuding because it takes less technical skill. For instance, to repeatedly pipette up and down, the user has to determine 1) the speed at which to pipette up and down continuously, and 2) the force of each pipette motion. Too slow or soft will result in minimal cumulus cell removal whereas too fast and hard can result in breaking the zona pellucida, which effectively compromises the zygote making it unusable. Those two main factors are issues that the user will have to perfect by trial and error in order to get the correct feel for timing and force required to completely denude but still keep the zona pellucida intact. Furthermore, repeatedly pipetting requires that the user pay close attention to prevent the pipette tip from hitting the bottom of the tube and crushing zygotes. However, negatives of denuding by the vortex method exist. These include 1) displacement of the HEPES-SOF containing the presumptive zygotes up higher above the undisturbed media level, so there is greater chance of losing zygotes that were displaced above this level, and 2) little ability for optimization.\nCritical: Failure to denude in a hepes-buffered media with a surfactant such as BSA can cause 1) clotting and 2) pH destabilization of media which can negatively affect the presumptive zygote.\nCritical: Care must be taken to not create bubbles nor crush the presumptive zygotes during denuding and recovery.\nTo recover denuded presumptive zygotes from the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, reset the P200 pipette to 180 μL with a gel-loading tip attached.\nAspirate up all media containing presumptive zygotes.",
    "Critical: Caution should be taken to prevent the tip from hitting the bottom of the tube to prevent crushing of presumptive zygotes.\nNote: The 1.5 mL centrifuge tube used for denuding can be rinsed a couple times with additional HEPES-SOF in effort to recover more presumptive zygotes that may not have been collected from the first aspiration.\nRelease the denuded, presumptive zygotes into the center of a 70 μm cell strainer in the second 35 mm petri dish containing HEPES-SOF and swirl to wash.\nOnce swirled, move the strainer into the third and final HEPES-SOF wash and swirl again to wash.\nOnce the strainer with denuded presumptive zygotes is in the final HEPES-SOF wash, remove the (2) 35 mm SOF-BEI petri dishes (one has oil overlayed on top and one has no oil) out of the incubator and onto the plate warmer.\nMove the strainer from HEPES-SOF into the first SOF-BEI dish that does not contain oil and swirl to wash.\nOnce washed, using a P200 pipette set to 200 μL with gel-loading tip attached, aspirate up all denuded, presumptive zygotes and dispense underneath the oil of the second 35 mm dish containing SOF-BE1.\nNow, switch to using a Captrol (or other similar devices: Drummond™ Wiretrol™, The STRIPPER® or mouth pipette) with a hand-pulled Captrol tip attached.\nFrom the last SOF-BE1 petri dish containing oil, aspirate up 20–30 presumptive zygotes and dispense into 50 μL culture drops of a 4-well Nunc™ plate.\nRepeat until all adequate quality (i.e., homogenous ooplasm, symmetrical, and dark in color) presumptive zygotes have been plated into culture drops.\nOnce a 4-well Nunc™ plate has been filled, place it into a humidified incubator or hypoxia chamber containing tri-gas at 38.5°C.",
    "Critical: Our protocol requires that cow zygotes and embryos must be cultured in tri-gas (5% CO2 and O2 and 90% N2) in a humidified environment at 38.5°C.\nIncubate embryos until desired endpoint or at specific stages to evaluate development (i.e., day 2 post-IVF for cleavage, day 7 post-IVF for day 7 blastocysts, and day 8 post-IVF for day 8 blastocysts).\nNote: Bovine embryos are generally not cultured past day 8 post-IVF.\nCleavage assessment (Day 2)\nTiming: 15–30 min\nThis step accomplishes determining the success rate of fertilization. Embryos will only cleave (not including parthenogenic embryos) if they were fertilized. Cleavage is mandatory for progression of embryonic development to the blastocyst stage and beyond.\nTurn on microscope warmers.\nNote: Either the stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ800N) or inverted microscope (FisherBrand 03-000-013) that we mentioned will work for assessing cleavage; however, the inverted microscope can zoom in more if desired.\nWipe down all tables, microscopes, and plate warmers with 70% ethanol.\nIn a lab notebook, record 1) how many presumptive zygotes were cultured, 2) how many did not cleave and remained as a 1-cell (unfertilized), and 3) how many cleaved at least to the 2-cell stage.\nNote: See Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11] for representative development and cleavage of bovine embryos at day 2 post IVF.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11.

A red arrow is pointing to an unfertilized oocyte (UFO).\nThe scale bar represents 270 μm.\nTo determine the cleavage rate, divide number of embryos that cleaved over the total number of presumptive zygotes cultured.",

Blastulation is a mandatory event in the progression of embryonic development and eventual live birth.\nTurn on microscope warmers.\nNote: Either the stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ800N) or inverted microscope (FisherBrand 03-000-013) that we mentioned will work for assessing blastulation; however, the inverted microscope can zoom in more if desired.\nWipe down all tables, microscopes, and plate warmers with 70% ethanol.\nIn a lab notebook, record how many cleaved embryos progressed into a blastocyst.\nNote: A key feature of a blastocyst is the presence of the blastocoel cavity. This can be further broken down by staging the blastocyst (i.e., regular blastocyst, expanded blastocyst, hatching or hatched blastocyst). See Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12] for examples of different blastocyst stages.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12.
