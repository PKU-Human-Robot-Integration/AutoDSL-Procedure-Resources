    "Although theoretically any organism can be used for cell-free protein synthesis, the preparation of the lysate needs to be optimized for the organism being used. There are many considerations to ensure that lysis is effective and that the cellular machinery is kept as active as possible, most commonly by ensuring that the lysate is kept cold throughout the entire protocol. This basic protocol involves growing cells to an optimum growth phase before they are harvested and washed. The cells are then lysed using a high-pressure cell disrupter before being dialyzed and flash frozen (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-fig-0001]). High yields of cellular protein from lysates are necessary for the production of proteins in vitro, and therefore it is important that the protein concentration of the lysate is checked at the end (Fujiwara & Doi, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0016]). Successfullysis will result in 15-25 mg/ml of protein (Aw & Polizzi, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0004]). Although the strain we use is a modified ribosome-overexpressing strain, FHL1 (Aw & Polizzi, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0004]), we have also successfully used wild-type X33 for CFPS. Theoretically any P. pastoris strain should be compatible with our protocols, but it is important to note that when using a strain with different growth characteristics, this may require further optimization of harvest time.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/13b87d30-4738-4b41-8e16-619caefdafdb/cpps115-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nOverview of cell lysate preparation (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-prot-0001]).\nMaterials\nFresh single colonies from a YPD agar plate at 30°C\nYPD liquid medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-rec-0004])\nYPD agar (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-rec-0005])\nBuffer A (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-rec-0001]), ice cold\nDry ice (optional)\nMethanol (optional)\nLysis buffer A (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-rec-0002]), ice cold\nBradford assay kit (or other commercial protein quantification kit)\n1-liter baffled glass flask\nOrbital shaking incubator, 30°C\nUV/visible spectrophotometer\n1.5-ml cuvettes\n50-ml centrifuge tubes\nHigh-speed refrigerated centrifuge\nHigh-pressure cell disruptor (e.g., CF1 model, Constant Systems Ltd., Daventry, England), precooled in a 4°C refrigerator if possible\n10-ml Stripette disposable pipets",

Select a single colony from a fresh YPD agar plate (grown at 30°C, static) and culture in 5 ml YPD medium in a 50-ml centrifuge tube overnight at 30°C, shaking at 250 rpm. Antibiotic may be included in both the plate and the liquid culture if selecting for a specific strain.\nIt is recommended that a fresh YPD agar plate be made for each lysate preparation; however, a plate may be reused for ∼2 weeks if it has been stored at 4°C after the initial overnight growth.\n2. Dilute the overnight culture into 200 ml YPD medium in a 1-liter baffled glass flask to OD600 0.1.\nTypically, this culture is set up at ∼6 p.m., to ensure cultures grow adequately so that the lysis steps can be begun at ∼8 or 9 a.m. the next day.\nIf desired, the culture volume can be scaled up to exceed 200 ml, but subsequent steps would need to be scaled as well. We recommend dividing larger cultures into 200-ml batches that are processed simultaneously but separately. The remainder of the protocol details the handling of a single 200-ml batch.\n3. Regularly check the OD600 of the culture, and harvest when cells have reached OD600 of 18.0-20.0.\n4. Weigh a single blank 50-ml centrifuge tube and record the weight of the tube. Store this tube and three additional 50-ml centrifuge tubes on ice until ready.\n5. Once the cells reach the correct OD600, pour the cultures into four 50-ml centrifuge tubes, and keep cells and reagents on ice as much as possible.\n6. Centrifuge 10 min at 3000 × g, 4°C.\n7. Pour off the supernatant and resuspend in 50 ml ice-cold buffer A.",
    "At this step, the cultures should be condensed into the centrifuge tube that has been weighed out.\n8. Centrifuge 10 min at 3000 × g, 4°C.\n9. Wash the cells in 20 ml ice-cold buffer A.\n10. Centrifuge 10 min at 3000 × g, 4°C.\n11. Wash the cells a second time in 20 ml ice-cold buffer A.\n12. Centrifuge 10 min at 3000 × g, 4°C.\n13. Blot on a towel to remove extra buffer.\n14. Weigh the 50-ml centrifuge tube containing the cell pellet, and calculate wet cell weight by subtracting the original weight of the centrifuge tube (from step 4).\nAt this stage it is possible to either flash freeze the pellet or continue with lysis.\n15. To flash freeze, use a dry ice and methanol bath. Hold the tube in the dry ice and methanol bath until the color has changed throughout the whole pellet. The pellet should be stored at −80°C.\n16. To continue with lysis, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer A per 1 g wet cell weight\nIf continuing from this point using a flash-frozen pellet, make sure the pellet has fully defrosted before continuing with lysis.\n17. Perform two passes using a high-pressure homogenizer at 30,000 psi. The homogenizer should be precooled in advance by refrigeration, if possible. All samples should be kept cold as much as possible and collected on ice.\nIf possible, a one-shot adapter should be used to process small volumes (≤10 ml). If this is not available, it would be possible to scale up the volumes (using multiple flasks) to ensure adequate lysis.\nWe use 10-ml Stripettes to transfer the lysate to the high-pressure homogenizer and remove it, before re-adding it for the second pass. This will depend on the machine available and the setup.",
    "Efficiency of lysis is usually determined by the protein concentration at the end of the lysis procedure. When optimizing the efficiency of homogenizer, it is possible to perform serial dilutions (to 105) onto YPD plates (containing no antibiotic) to determine the optimum conditions for the specific machine being utilized. Plates should be left to grow for 3-5 days at 30°C and then a colony count performed.\n18. Collect lysed sample into a 50-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge 30 min at 18,000 × g, 4°C.\n19. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 50-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge again 30 min at 18,000 × g, 4°C.\nDialysis\n20. Load the supernatant from the lysis into a 3.5 K MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer™ G2 dialysis cassette using a syringe.\nAn 18-G needle is required for the Slide-A-Lyzer G2 cassettes. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on rehydrating the cassette before use.\n21. Buffer exchange the sample four times for 30 min with at least 50 vol lysis buffer A at 4°C.\nBuffer exchanging in larger volumes to ensure that the cassette is fully submerged is possible; this will depend on the equipment that is available.\nThe PMSF present in the buffer inhibits a large number of serine proteases, but this could be substituted for other protease inhibitors if desired.\n22. After four buffer exchanges, remove the sample from the dialysis cassette using a syringe and an 18-gauge needle, and transfer to a 50-ml centrifuge tube.\n23. Centrifuge 1 hr at 18,000 × g, 4°C.\n24. Remove the supernatant and immediately divide into aliquots in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. These frozen aliquots are single use, and the volume should be determined accordingly.",
    "The 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes should be precooled for at least 30 min in a −80°C freezer. Based on six standard runs, aliquots are often made in 175 µl volume.\n25. Immediately flash freeze the samples in a dry ice and methanol bath (as described previously) and transfer to a −80°C freezer.\n26. Keep one aliquot to test for lysate protein concentration using a Bradford assay kit (or other protein determination assay of choice) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nHigh yields of protein lysate concentration are essential for successful in vitro transcription/ translation. We would expect yields of 15-25 mg/ml (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-tbl-0001]).\nTable 1.\n                Example Protein Yields of Lysate After Extract Preparation\ntable:\n﻿Lysate,Protein content (mg/ml)\nLysate 1,22.72 ± 1.91\nLysate 2,17.91 ± 0.106",
    "The second critical aspect of cell-free protein synthesis is the reaction mix. This is where the components required for protein synthesis are added to the cell lysate. The reaction mix outlined below has been improved using Design of Experiments (DOE) to result in increased protein synthesis (Spice et al., 2020a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0032]). Alternatively, a standard reaction mix more closely aligned to that used for CFPS with S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris in other published papers (Aw & Polizzi, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0004]; Hodgman & Jewett, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0018]; Zhang, Liu, & Li, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0039]) can be used. This protocol requires precise pipetting, and the order in which components are added is essential for the function of the CFPS reaction (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-fig-0002]). When establishing a CFPS system, it is recommended that the luciferase protein be used as a reporter assay.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0ba9c68d-f1b4-4fd9-ab15-68c73752bf97/cpps115-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nOverview of coupled in vitro transcription and translation (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-prot-0002], left) which can be monitored via luciferase production (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-prot-0003], right).\nMaterials\n40 nM DNA plasmid prepared by extraction with Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit, resuspended in TE buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-rec-0003])\n1 M HEPES•KOH, pH 7.4\n2 M potassium glutamate (if following alternate reaction mix recipe in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-tbl-0002])\n1 M magnesium glutamate\n0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT)\nRTS Amino Acid Mix (biotechrabbit GmbH, Hennisdorf, Germany)\nNTP solution set, 100 mM each (ThermoFisher Scientific)\n500 mM creatine phosphate\n4 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma-Aldrich) in 25 mM glycylglycine (pH 7.5)\n40 U/µl murine RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs)\nT7 polymerase, HC (200 U/µl, ThermoFisher Scientific)\nNuclease-free H2O (Life Technologies)\nCell lysate (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-prot-0001])\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nMicrocentrifuge\nWater bath or heat block, 60°C\nWater bath or incubator, 21°C\nTable 2.\n                Comparative Protocol for Improved or Standard Reaction Mix\ntable:\n﻿Component,Improved reaction mix (µl),Standard reaction mix (µl)\n\"1 M HEPES•KOH, pH 7.4\",3,1.25\n2 M potassium glutamate,0,2",

We have optimized our system for this concentration of DNA; therefore, if using a different concentration of DNA, changes to the reaction mix may be required. Furthermore, using a Maxiprep Kit results in higher CFPS yields than using a miniprep kit and is preferred. The plasmid is used without linearization.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d7e027f0-b00b-40e9-9def-7c806d32457b/cpps115-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nCircular (plasmid) DNA template design and DNA sequences.

    "The RTS amino acid solution must be fully dissolved before use. Heat it for 5 min at 60°C and allow it to cool to room temperature again before use (it must not go on ice or it will precipitate).\n4.

Add 25 µl cell lysate to the mix.\n7. Flick the tube and centrifuge briefly to ensure all the components are well mixed.\n8. Place the tubes in either a water bath or a static incubator at 21°C.\nDepending on the protein of interest, the reaction will take between 2 and 8 hr. For more complex proteins, such as those with post-translational modifications including disulfide bonds or particularly large proteins, it is possible to leave the reaction running overnight. Initial optimization may be required to determine the length of reaction time. Excessive incubation of reactions may lead to a decrease in yield of active recombinant protein.",
    "9. The completed reaction can be analyzed directly using the chosen methodology (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-prot-0003] or Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-prot-0005]). Alternatively, it may be possible to freeze the reaction for further analysis, depending on the stability of the protein produced.\nThe protocol above uses an improved reaction mix that was developed using a Design of Experiments approach (Spice et al., 2020a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0032]). Alternatively, it is possible to use the alternative recipe, which was used for the initial development of the system.

    "Depending on the protein of interest, yields of protein can be observed via fluorescence, luminescence, or a protein-specific assay.

    "It is possible to perform cell-free protein synthesis as separate reactions—first performing the in vitro transcription using a commercial kit and then adding RNA directly to the in vitro translation reaction. This method can be used for troubleshooting if the coupled reaction is not functioning well and will allow the user to determine whether the issue lies with the plasmid or gene design (transcription) or is a problem with the protein production itself. The in vitro translation reaction is similar to that of the coupled reaction, except that no T7 polymerase is used in the reaction mix.

Because of the complexity of this product, the CFPS reactions are run overnight to allow the disulfide bonds to form, before being quantified using an Albumin Blue Fluorescence Kit.\nMaterials\nAlbumin Blue Fluorescence Assay Kit (Active Motif, Belgium)\nCFPS reaction product\n96-well, flat-bottom black microtiter plates\nPlate reader for fluorescence\n1. Remove all contents of the kit and allow to equilibrate to room temperature.\n2. Set up a standard curve as described in the manufacturer's instructions\n3. Pipet 25 µl CFPS reaction product to each sample well.\n4. Add 150 µl Dye Reagent working solution and mix by pipetting.\n5. Incubate 5 min with gentle shaking at room temperature.\n6. Measure the fluorescence (excitation 560 nm, emission 620 nm). Example yields are shown in Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-tbl-0003].\nSamples must be read within 30 min, but are most accurate when read within the first 5 min.\nTable 3.\n                Example Protein Yields of HSA Using the Albumin Blue Fluorescence Kit\ntable:\n﻿Strain/plasmid/mix,Yield (μg/ml)\nFHL1/CrPV HSA/improved,96.8 ± 10.4\nFHL1/CrPV HSA/standard,48.1 ± 7.89\nX33/CrPV HSA/standard,20.1 ± 11",
    "This protocol describes the preparation of mRNA by in vitro transcription. For eukaryotic CFPS, it is essential that the mRNA is both capped and tailed, unless an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is used instead to allow cap-independent translation. Therefore, in this procedure the T7 ARCA mRNA kit (with tailing) from NEB is used in order to ensure that the mRNA is stable and cap-dependent translation can occur without the need for an additional IRES. The kit incorporates Anti-Reverse Cap Analog (ARCA) using a T7 polymerase.\nMaterials\nDNA template containing the protein sequence\nAppropriate restriction enzyme to linearize the gene of interest\nGel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research) or other commercial gel extraction kit\nHiScribe™ T7 ARCA mRNA Kit (with tailing; NEB) containing:\n               \n2× ARCA/NTP Mix\nT7 RNA Polymerase Mix\nDNase I\n10× Poly(A) Polymerase Reaction Buffer\nPoly(A) Polymerase\nRNA Clean & Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research) or other commercial mRNA cleanup kit\nNuclease-free H2O (Fisher Scientific)\nBleach\nAgarose\n10× Orange-G Buffer (40% sucrose, 0.2% Orange G)\nPCR machine\n0.2-ml PCR tubes\nMicrocentrifuge\nRNase-free 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nNanodrop spectrophotometer\nAgarose gel electrophoresis apparatus\n1. Linearize the DNA containing the gene of interest and the T7 promoter upstream of the T7 promoter using an appropriate restriction enzyme.\n2. Gel extract the linearized DNA and quantify using a Nanodrop instrument or equivalent\n3. Assemble the in vitro transcription reaction in PCR tubes on ice in 20-µl reactions as described in the HiScribe T7 ARCA mRNA Kit manufacturer's protocols as follows:\n         \n10 µl 2× ARCA/NTP mix (supplied with the kit)\n1 µg linearized DNA\n2 µl T7 RNA polymerase mix (supplied with the kit)\nNuclease-free water to 20 µl.\n4. Mix thoroughly and briefly centrifuge. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.",
    "The reaction time will be dependent on the amount of template and the quality and length of the RNA transcript. The reaction is stable up to 16 hr overnight. For transcripts >500 bp, incubation for 30 min results in the optimum yield; however, for transcripts <500 bp the reaction should be left for 1 hr.\nA PCR machine, water bath, or heat block can be used. If reactions are left for >1 hr, a PCR machine should always be used to ensure that the reaction is not affected by evaporation.\n5. Remove the DNA by add 2 µl DNase I from the kit. Mix the reaction, centrifuge briefly, and incubate 15 min at 37°C.\n6. Poly(A) tail the reaction in a fresh PCR tube by setting up a 50-µl reaction on ice:\n         \n20 µl reaction from step 5\n5 µl 10× Poly(A) Polymerase reaction buffer (supplied with the kit)\n5 µl 10× Poly(A) Polymerase (supplied with the kit)\n20 µl with nuclease-free water.\n7. Mix thoroughly and briefly centrifuge. Incubate the reaction at 37°C for 30 min.\n8. Purify the RNA using the RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\n9. Quantify the RNA using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.\n10. Analyze the quality of the RNA by gel electrophoresis using either a 1% bleach gel (Aranda, LaJoie, & Jorcyk, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-bib-0003]) or TBE/urea gel.\n11. Store the RNA at −80°C. An example of luciferase data from a linked CFPS assay is shown in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.115#cpps115-fig-0006]."
