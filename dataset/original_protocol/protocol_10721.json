    "1. Functionalization of Electrochemical Sensors\nPrepare the thiolated capture probe at a concentration of 0.05 μM in 300 μM 1,6-hexanedithiol (HDT), 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. Incubation of the thiolated capture probe with HDT ensures that the thiol group on the capture probe is reduced, resulting in more consistent results.\nApply a stream of nitrogen to bare gold 16 sensor array chip(s) for 5 sec to remove moisture and/or particulates.\nApply 6 μl of the HDT-thiolated capture probe mix to the working electrode of all 16 sensors of the sensor array and store the sensor chip(s) in a covered Petri dish at 4 °C overnight. Thiolated capture probes bind directly to the bare gold electrode and the HDT acts to prevent overpacking of the capture probes and keep them in an extended conformation that promotes hybridization with the target.\nThe following day, wash the sensor chip with deionized H2O for 2-3 sec and dry under a stream of nitrogen for 5 sec.\nApply 6 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) to the working electrode of all 16 sensors and incubate for 50 min. This and all subsequent sensor chip incubations are performed in a covered Petri dish at room temperature. MCH acts as a blocking agent, filling in any gaps where the thiolated capture probe or HDT is not present on the electrode surface.\n2. Sample Preparation",
    "Transfer 1 ml of bacterial culture in the log phase of growth (OD600 ≈ 0.1) to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 5 min. Remove the culture supernatant. The bacterial pellet can be processed immediately or stored at -80 °C for later use.\nThoroughly resuspend the bacterial pellet in 10 μl of 1 M NaOH by applying the pipette tip to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube and pipetting up and down several times. Incubate the suspension at room temperature for 5 min.\nNeutralize the bacterial lysate by adding 50 μl of 1 M Phosphate Buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.25 mM of a fluorescein-modified detector probe. Incubate the neutralized lysate for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorescein-modified detector probes hybridize with bacterial rRNA target molecules.\n3. Electrochemical Sensor Assay\nWash the MCH from the sensor chip with deionized H2O for 2-3 sec and dry under a stream of nitrogen for 5 sec.\nApply 4 μl of neutralized bacterial lysate to the working electrode of each of 14 sensors and incubate for 15 min. Target-detector probe complexes hybridize to immobilized thiolated capture probes.\nApply 4 μl of 1 nM bridging oligonucleotide in 1 M Phosphate Buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2.5% BSA and 0.25 μM fluorescein-modified detector probe to 2 positive control sensors (used for signal normalization) and incubate for 15 min.\nWash the sensor chip with deionized H2O for 2-3 sec and dry under a stream of nitrogen for 5 sec.\nApply 4 μl of 0.5 U/ml anti-Fluorescein-HRP in 1 M Phosphate Buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5% casein to the working electrode of all 16 sensors and incubate for 15 min. The anti-Fluorescein-HRP binds to the immobilized fluorescein-modified detector probes.",
    "Wash the sensor chip with deionized H2O for 2-3 sec and dry under a stream of nitrogen for 5 sec.\nApply a film well sticker to the surface of the sensor chip and load into the sensor chip mount. Pipette 50 μl of TMB substrate onto all 16 sensors and close the sensor chip mount.\nObtain amperometry and cyclic voltammetry measurements for all 16 sensors using the Helios Chip Reader. Amperometric current is proportional to the rate of TMB reduction on the sensor surface (see Figure 1).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
