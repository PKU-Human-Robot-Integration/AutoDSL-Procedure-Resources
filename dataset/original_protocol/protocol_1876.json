    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConstruction of adiposomes\nTiming: ∼6–8 h\nThe adiposome is a lipid nanoparticle with a neutral lipid core covered by a phospholipid monolayer membrane, which serves as a fundamental unit of the artificial LD. Successful construction of this nanoparticle is essential for constructing the artificial LD. The adiposome is isolated from a lipid emulsion prepared using phospholipids and neutral lipids (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Differential centrifugation removes the lipid particles that are randomly formed with multi-layer membranes or aggregates from adiposomes. It is necessary to purify the adiposomes since the membrane debris or lipid aggregates may disturb the binding of the protein of interest on artificial LDs (Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1469-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Adiposome production\n(A) Neutral lipids and phospholipids are emulsified to produce adiposomes. Procedure to produce adiposomes: (a) phospholipids are dried on the wall of microcentrifuge tube using a stream of N2; (b) neutral lipids and Buffer B are added to the tube; (c) lipid mixture is vortexed to prepare the lipid emulsion; (d) centrifugation at 1,000×g is conducted to remove the top fraction; (e) centrifugation at 20,000×g is conducted to remove the bottom pellet; (f) the remaining emulsion contains adiposomes.\n(B) The preparation of emulsion and adiposomes: (a) the top layer after 1,000×g centrifugation; (b) the top layer after collection of the infranatant; (c) the pellet after 20,000×g centrifugation. (d) the lipid mixture before emulsification; (e) the emulsion after vortexing; (f) the adiposome product.",
    "Prepare phospholipid stock at the concentration described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Transfer 80 μL phospholipid stock to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and dry the lipids as a thin layer on the wall of tube using a gentle N2 stream for 2 min at 20°C–25°C. Hydrate the lipids in 100 μL Buffer B for 15 min at 37°C. Transfer neutral lipids to the buffer at a phospholipid:neutral lipid molar ratio of 1:2, roughly 5 μL triolein per 100 μL aqueous system.\nNote: It is recommended to prepare the dry layer of phospholipid freshly. However, it can also be stored at −20°C in a sealed tube filled with nitrogen for a short period, e.g., one day. 37°C is a general temperature for hydrating phospholipids, and for those lipids with high phase transition temperatures, the hydrating temperature can be modified 10°C higher than the phase transition temperature. However, the yield of adiposomes is usually low when using phospholipids with a high transition temperature, e.g., 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nPreparation of lipid emulsion and isolation of adiposomes from lipid emulsion.\nThe detailed vortex procedure is modified from the reported methods (Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Set the vortex rotation rate to 3,000–4,000 rpm. Emulsify the lipid-buffer mixture by vortexing for 24 cycles (10 s on and 10 s off), to acquire a crude emulsion.\nNote: We use an Oxford BenchMate VM-D vortex to conduct this procedure, but the vortex machine is not restricted to a specific brand.",
    "Centrifuge the emulsion at 1,000×g for 5 min at 4°C to force the large lipid particles to float to the surface, leaving smaller particles dispersing in the underlying buffer (infranatant). Use a gel-loading pipette tip to collect the infranatant containing small, dispersed lipid particles (roughly 60–70 μL) and transfer to a new microcentrifuge tube, leaving the top layer in the original tube (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Ba and 1Bb).\nNote: If there are precipitates on the bottom of the tube, do not collect them with the infranatant. Large lipid particles and aggregates on the top are unstable and always contaminated by membrane debris. Very small droplets are difficult to be separated from membrane debris due to their similarity in size and density. Therefore, the lipid particles remained in the infranatant are chosen as adiposomes for use.\nCentrifuge the new tube containing dispersed lipid particles at 20,000×g for 5 min at 4°C to precipitate residual phospholipid membrane debris. Use a gel-loading pipette tip to collect the precipitates at the bottom of the tube carefully, while leaving the dispersed emulsion in the tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bc). The dispersed lipid particles are the adiposome product.\nNote: This procedure is modified from the method in (Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). In this protocol, 1,000×g centrifugation is conducted before 20,000×g centrifugation, while in the original method, 20,000×g centrifugation is conducted first. Compared to the old method, 1,000×g centrifugation followed by 20,000×g centrifugation will reduce the possibility of forming lipid aggregates in the first-round centrifugation and thus enhance the yield of adiposomes.\nAdd Buffer B to the original tube to achieve a 100 μL volume.",
    "Vortex to emulsify the mixture for 10 cycles of 10 s on and 10 s off. Repeat the 1,000×g and 20,000×g centrifugation steps to isolate adiposome product. Pool the adiposomes from the two emulsification/purification cycles and roughly 100–120 μL of adiposomes can be obtained. The picture of lipid mixture, crude emulsion and adiposome are listed in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B d, e, and f, respectively.\nCharacterization of adiposomes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1469-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Adiposome characterization\n(A) The morphological characterization of adiposomes. (a) Adiposomes are stained by LipidTOX Red (1/1000, v/v) and observed using fluorescence microscopy, scale bar = 2 μm. (b) The ultrastructure of adiposomes as observed using TEM after ultrathin sectioning, scale bar = 500 nm. (c) The morphology of adiposomes observed using TEM after positive staining, scale bar = 500 nm.\n(B) The lipid fractions produced from preparation of adiposomes are subjected to thin layer chromatography and stained by iodine vapor (TLC). The markers are triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), and DOPC.\n(C) The diameter distribution of adiposomes determined using dynamic light scattering. Parts of the figure are reprinted with permission from (Ma et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and (Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nUse fluorescence microscopy to observe the shape of adiposomes. Dilute the original adiposomes 50-fold (or other appropriate dilution) in Buffer B and stain them using LipidTOX Red or LipidTOX Green for 30 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark, at a volumetric ratio of 1:1,000 (v/v).\nUse a laser scanning confocal microscope or other available fluorescence microscope to observe the shape of adiposomes, with excitation and emission conditions appropriate for the dye used (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Aa).",
    "Note: Naturally, the adiposomes are likely to form a spherical shape but not a perfect sphere, due to the interfacial tension. However, if the morphology of adiposome sample is irregular, the adiposome product is considered to be contaminated. The contaminations are mainly lipid aggregates stuck to the gel-loading pipette tip, or membrane precipitates that are not thoroughly removed, which are produced during centrifugation, and transferred to the adiposome product. The way to reduce such contaminations is to conduct one more round of 1,000×g and 20,000×g centrifugation and purify the product again till the most of the contaminations are removed.\nUse transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe the adiposome ultrastructure after ultrathin sectioning (Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Fix the 50 μL adiposomes with an equal volume of 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer for 30 min at 20°C–25°C. Subsequently fix the adiposomes further with 100 μL of 2% osmium tetroxide for 30 min at 20°C–25°C. Collect fixed adiposomes by centrifugation at 1,000×g for 5 min, and then dehydrate the adiposomes using an ascending concentration gradient of ethanol of 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 95%, then thrice at 100% for 10 min in each series (1 mL). Infiltrate the specimen with Embed 812 and then polymerize. Prepare 70 nm sections using a Leica EM UC6 Ultramicrotome (or similar). Stain the sections with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Capture the images of specimen with Tecnai Spirit Electron Microscope (or similar) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Ab).\nNote: After ultrathin sectioning, adiposomes under TEM are nanoparticles with a thin layer. If there exist multilayers in the preparation, extra centrifugation is recommended to remove these membrane contaminations. It may take one to two weeks to prepare ultrathin sections of specimen for TEM since infiltration and polymerization would take around 5 days.",
    "Use TEM to observe the morphology of adiposomes after positive staining. Load 8 μL of isolated adiposomes onto glow-discarded, carbon film coated grids for 1 min, and then remove excess sample by blotting with filter paper. Fix the samples with 10 μL of 1% osmium tetroxide for 10 min and wash the samples by placing the grid sample-side down on three drops of deionized water (around 500 μL) sequentially. Stain with 10 μL of 0.1% tannic acid for 5 min and then 10 μL of 2% uranyl acetate for 5 min. Wash the sample similarly after each staining step. Capture images using a CM120-FEG (FEI) microscope (or similar) operating at 100 kV (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Ac).\nNote: Under TEM after positive staining, the adiposomes are black nanosphere. The neutral lipid core should be stained to be black and if the core fails to be stained, the structure is considered to have insufficient neutral lipids or too many phospholipids are incorporated.",
    "Use thin layer chromatography (TLC) to analyze the composition of adiposomes, following the instruction in (Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Extract the total adiposome lipids twice using a mixture of chloroform:methanol:Buffer B (1:1:1, v/v/v). Mix 100 μL adiposome suspension with 200 μL Buffer B, 300 μL methanol, and then 300 μL chloroform. Vortex for three times and incubate at 25°C for 10 min. Centrifuge the mixture at 20,000×g for 5 min at 4°C. Transfer the underneath organic phase in a clean vial and repeat the extraction by adding 300 μL chloroform into the original tube. Combine the two organic phases and dry the organic phase using a gentle stream of N2. Dissolve the dry lipids in 100 μL chloroform and apply to a silica gel plate (30–200 μm thickness and 60 Å pore size) by loading 10–20 μL sample. For neutral lipids, the developing solution is a mixture of hexane: diethyl ether: acetic acid = 80:20:1 (v/v/v), the total volume of which is roughly 101 mL and the plate is developed for approximately 30 min. Dry the silica gel plate in a fume hood for 10 min. For polar lipids, the developing solution is a mixture of chloroform: methanol: acetic acid: H2O = 75:13:9:3 (v/v/v/v), the volume of which is roughly 100 mL. Develop the same plate in developing solution for polar lipids for approximately 20 min. Dry the silica gel plate in a fume hood for 10 min. Then, both the neutral and polar lipids can be visualized on the same plate. Observe the separated lipids using either saturated iodine vapor staining or acid staining. The unsaturated lipids can be stained using iodine vapor.",
    "Put the developed plate in a sealed box filled with saturated iodine vapor for at least 15 min and observe or scan the plate immediately (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Alternatively, stain the lipids to black spots by spraying the plate with a mixture of 8% phosphoric acid (m/m), 10% CuSO4 (m/m) in water, followed by heating the plate in a 110°C oven for 15 min.",
    "Use dynamic light scattering (DLS) to analyze the diameter of the adiposomes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Dilute roughly 10–20 μL adiposome sample into 1 mL Buffer B. Set the measuring temperature as 25°C and 70 cycles for each test. Apply the physical parameters of water at 25°C to the system, which indicates the refractive index as 1.33, viscosity as 0.89 cP, and dielectric constant as 78.50.\nNote: The size distribution of the adiposomes ranges from tens to hundreds of nanometres, and the peak varies between 100 and 180 nm.\nStore adiposomes at 2°C–8°C up to two weeks.\nNote: The lipids may suffer gradual oxidation from air if the container is not well sealed, and possible digestion from bacteria if the producing or storing procedure exposes to bacteria. To reduce those underlying risks, immediate use of adiposomes is recommended if possible.\nCAUTION: The lipids should be dried in a fume hood to avoid exposure to chloroform and methanol vapor. Note that hexane and diethyl ether are acutely toxic and are highly flammable. They should be handled in a fume hood and away from flames. Osmium tetroxide is corrosive and has a high acute toxicity. Uranyl acetate is acutely toxic and poses a radiological hazard if internalized. All of these reagents should be handled in a fume hood. Safety goggles and gloves should be worn when handling them. Disposal should be conducted in accordance with local regulations.\nCritical: The quality of vortex step directly influences the outcome of adiposome production. Thorough vortex will force the oil phase and aqueous phase to form an emulsion. Insufficient energetic vortex will result in separation of the oil and aqueous phases, resulting in failed production.

    "Purify the recombinant LD-associated proteins as one of the building blocks of artificial LDs.\nTransform the plasmid into Transetta (DE3) competent cells following the step described in preparation of plasmids[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] 4-d.\nSelect 5 clones and inoculate each in 11 mL of LB medium containing 50 μg mL-1 kanamycin.\nCulture the clones at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm until the OD600 value of bacterial cultures reaches 0.6.\nTransfer 1 mL bacterial cells of each clone to 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.

Culture them under the same condition without IPTG.\nStore the rest 9 mL bacterial cells at 4°C temporarily for steps preparation of recombinant lipid droplet-associated proteins[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] 4 and 5.\nCollect the cultured bacterial cells by centrifugation at 20,000×g for 5 min and remove the culture medium. Resuspend the bacterial cells with 500 μL Tris-NaCl buffer and centrifuge again to discard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL 2 × Sample buffer into the bacteria cells and sonicate the mixture on ice for 1 min (6 s on, 6 s off) at 210 W.\nBoil the samples at 95°C for 5 min followed by short centrifugation, gentle vortex and short centrifugation again.\nPrepare 10-well polyacrylamide gels, and load the samples of each clone, including uninduced and IPTG-induced samples. Run electrophoresis.\nDetect protein expression by Coomassie Brilliant Blue Staining. Compare the bands of induced sample with those of uninduced sample and select clones with strong induction. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nPreserve the positive clones in 30% glycerol at −80°C.",
    "Inoculate 800 mL of 2 × YT medium containing 50 μg mL-1 antibiotic kanamycin with 8 mL of the protein expressing bacteria (at least 1.6–3.2 L in total).\nShake the bacteria at 37°C, 200 rpm for 4 h till the OD600 of bacteria reaches roughly 0.6.\nAdd 0.4 mM IPTG to induce the recombinant protein production.

Discard the supernatant. Repeat this step to thoroughly remove the residual medium.\nHarvest the bacterial cells by resuspending them in pre-cooled Tris-NaCl buffer with 0.5 mM PMSF protease inhibitor, and break them using a high pressure cell crusher. Set the parameter of cell crusher as 1,500 Pa and 4°C to break the bacterial cells three times. Collect 20 μL bacterial lysate as whole cell lysate (WCL) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis in step 30 and 31.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 29,761×g (average RCF), 4°C for 50 min by using Type 45 Ti tubes and collect the supernatant. Collect 20 μL supernatant sample (S) and pellet (P) for SDS-PAGE analysis in step 30 and 31.\nPause point: The supernatant of cell lysate can be stored at −80°C temporarily for 12 h after mixed with 0.5 mM PMSF protease inhibitor.",
    "Recover the supernatant and purify the proteins using Ni SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow (Cytiva), following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://cdn.cytivalifesciences.com/dmm3bwsv3/AssetStream.aspx?mediaformatid=10061&destinationid=10016&assetid=13253]. Apply the supernatant to the resins for three times at low flow rate and with several pauses to ensure thorough binding. The color of resins turns from blue to green. Take 20 μL liquid as flow through sample (FT). See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nWash off nonspecifically bound proteins with 2 column volumes of washing buffer. Collect the effluent temporarily and take 50 μL effluent labeled as 40-elution. Refill the column as soon as the buffer flows to the top interface of the resins. After washing, the color of resins restores to light green. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9] and troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].\nAdd 4 mL elution buffer. Label the effluent as 500-elution-1 and collect 50 μL of the effluent for SDS-PAGE analysis in step 30 and 31.\nContinue applying elution buffer. When the elution buffer flows to a half of the column, reserve 4–5 mL effluent as 500-elution-2, which is yellow and with large bubbles and obvious concave surface. Collect 50 μL for SDS-PAGE analysis in step 30 and 31.\nRinse the centrifugal filter devices with 4 mL distilled water followed by another spin of 4 mL Tris-NaCl buffer. Add 4 mL 500-elution-2 into the ultra-centrifugal filter units (Millipore). Concentrate 500-elution-2 by centrifuging at 2,500×g for 10 min. Then add Tris-NaCl buffer to reconstitute 500-elution-2 to the original volume. Repeat the centrifuge step.\nTransfer 500-elution-2 samples to PCR tubes (100 μL per tube). Flash-freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.\nClean and regenerate the resins following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://cdn.cytivalifesciences.com/dmm3bwsv3/AssetStream.aspx?mediaformatid=10061&destinationid=10016&assetid=13253].",
    "Add 2 × sample buffer into each sample (final concentration: 1 ×). Boil the samples at 95°C for 5 min. Then the samples are centrifuged shortly, vortexed gently several times and centrifuged shortly again to precipitate the insoluble matters.\nLoad the samples into two 10-well polyacrylamide gels in the order of WCL, S, P, FT, 40-elution, 500-elution-1, 500-elution-2. Run electrophoresis. One gel is stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the other is used for Western blot to identify PLIN2 (Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nNote: It is recommended to use ultra-centrifugal filter units with an appropriate molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) to concentrate the protein solution and replace the elution buffer with Tris-NaCl buffer. The condition of centrifugation is recommended to be 2,500×g at 4°C for 10 min. Repeat the centrifugation procedure if 10 min is not enough to concentrate the proteins. Choose the ultra-centrifugal filter unit with a MWCO no more than one third of the molecular weight of target recombinant protein to concentrate those proteins, e.g., filter unit with a MWCO of 10 kDa–30 kDa for concentrating SMT3-PLIN2-GFP. Since some of LD-associated proteins are easy to aggregate, the final concentration of target recombinant proteins is recommended to be 1–5 mg mL-1. Observe the protein solution carefully each time finishing the centrifugation, and if there are precipitates or the solution are non-transparent, stop further concentration immediately.\nNote: The target proteins also can be purified by size exclusion chromatography using, for example, a SuperdexTM 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva), if required. Use appropriate ultra-centrifugal filter units to concentrate the protein solution.",
    "Critical: Many LD-associated proteins are prone to aggregation due to their hydrophobicity. See troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13]. The order of Construction of adiposomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] step and Preparation of recombinant LD-associated proteins[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] step can be switched for the purpose of shortening gap time, when the technique of constructing adiposomes is fully mastered.\nConstruction of artificial lipid droplets\nTiming: 2 days\nThis method avoids the use of mechanical force, such as sonication, to incorporate proteins into the adiposomes. The artificial LDs are prepared using adiposomes to recruit recombinant LD-associated proteins onto their phospholipid monolayers (Ma et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Wang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Zhang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). It allows LD-associated proteins to bind on the surface of adiposomes spontaneously and allows the binding to reach equilibrium, which is close to the natural pattern. This protein binding system is based on the association between adiposomes and free proteins, therefore it only mimics the mechanism of aqueous proteins binding to LDs.\nDilute the stock recombinant protein solution to 1–5 mg mL-1. Transfer 0.1–10 μL of protein solution into 30–200 μL of diluted adiposome suspension (OD600 = 20) in a microcentrifuge tube. Incubate the suspension at 37°C in a water bath for 5 min.\nIsolate the artificial LDs by centrifuging the suspension at 20,000×g, 4°C for 5 min. Remove the infranatant using gel-loading pipette tip. Add buffer to restore the initial volume and gently shake the tube to resuspend the artificial LDs.\nRepeat step 33 twice to further remove excess proteins (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1469-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) The procedure to prepare artificial LDs. (a) Adiposomes, recombinant protein and buffer are mixed; (b) the mixture is incubated in a water bath to recruit proteins to the surface of adiposomes; (c) artificial LDs are isolated by centrifugation at 20,000×g followed by three wash steps; (d) artificial LDs ready for use.\n(B) The fluorescence images of natural LDs in PLIN2-GFP KI cells (a) PLIN2-GFP; (b) LipidTOX Red; (c) merged signal, and artificial LDs (d) SMT3-PLIN2-GFP; (e) LipidTOX Red; (f) merged signal. The figure is reprinted with permission from (Ma et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nStore the artificial LDs at 2°C–8°C until needed.\nUse a laser scanning confocal microscope or other available fluorescence microscopes to observe the shape of artificial LDs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). The artificial LD should be a round shape with a peripheral circle of proteins. For example, the artificial LD with SMT3-PLIN2-GFP will be a sphere with green circle and red core when the droplets are stained by LipidTOX Red.\nPause point: The adiposomes can be stored at 2°C–8°C temporarily.\nNote: If artificial LDs are constructed for calculating the number density of a specific protein on adiposomes, procedures 32–36 are inapplicable since a more precise binding measurement is required for calculation. Move on to procedures 37–38 and the procedures in “Protein binding affinity analysis on artificial LD” section. Use the maximum amount of binding protein as total protein on the surface of adiposomes. When proteins are bound to adiposomes, the average diameter of adiposomes may increase slightly but the adiposomes will still be spherical. If there are irregular structures, they are considered to be protein aggregates or disrupted droplets.",
    "Determine the number density of adiposomes using an asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation with multi-angle light scattering system (AF4-MALS). This procedure is mainly conducted for the quantification of the amount of protein binding to adiposomes. If the construction of artificial LDs is used for qualitative experiments, this measurement can be omitted. AF4-MALS is applied to determine the number density of adiposomes which provides the exact number of adiposomes per mL. The adiposome number density is measured using an Eclipse 3 system that contains an in-line vacuum degasser, a HPLC isocratic pump, a manual injection valve and a 100 μL stainless steel sample loop, a UV detector at a wavelength of 280 nm and a MALS detector with 18 scattering angles from 14.4° to 163.3º at 658 nm. The flow passes through a channel consisting of a 350-μm-thick trapezoidal-shaped Mylar spacer and a regenerated cellulose membrane (10 kDa). The length from tip to tip of the channel is 152 mm. The channel breadth decreases from an initial 21.5 mm to a final 3 mm.\nUse PBS as the flow phase and set the AF4-MALS conditions as Table 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl12].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1469_25.csv\nDilute the adiposome suspension by 20-50-fold using PBS buffer.\nInject 30–50 μL of the diluted adiposome suspension into the AF4-MALS and use the particle number density template to determine the number density of artificial LDs.\nDetermine the average diameter of artificial LDs by DLS. Assuming the shape of an artificial LD is a perfect sphere, it will be applicable to calculate the total surface area of droplets per mL.\nUse the same procedure to determine the number density of natural LDs to allow for normalization with artificial LDs.",
    "Note: If the AF4-MALS is not accessible, DLS technique and neutral lipids determination technique can an alternative approach. Determine the average diameter of natural LDs/adiposomes using DLS, and measure the total neutral lipid mass of natural LDs/adiposomes per mL, using triacylglycerol assay kit or cholesterol assay kit, or both kits, depending on which neutral lipids are rich in the droplets. By calculating the total volume of droplets per mL using total mass and average density of neutral lipids, the number density of droplets can be estimated by using the volume of single droplet to divide the total volume of droplets.\nMatch the number density of specific protein on the surface of natural LDs and artificial LDs using gel electrophoresis. This procedure is used for compare the protein content between natural LDs and artificial LDs, to check if the number density of proteins on both droplets stays close in same order of magnitude. The number density of protein on LDs represents the molecular number of proteins per μm2 on LD, since the proteins only locate on the outer surface of LD monolayer. Determining the protein number density will be helpful for evaluating how artificial LD mimics natural LD, i.e., whether the recombinant proteins oversaturate on artificial LDs.\nIsolate natural LDs expressing the specific LD protein to be studied (e.g., PLIN2-GFP).\nPrecipitate the proteins and delipidate the lipids of LD sample by mixing 40 μL of the isolated LD sample with 700 μL acetone and 300 μL chloroform. Vortex vigorously and then centrifuge at 20,000×g for 10 min to drive the precipitated proteins into a pellet. Remove the liquid phase carefully and expose the protein precipitates to air until dry. Mix the proteins with sample loading buffer for gel electrophoresis.",
    "Determine the amount of purified recombinant protein using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Load the extracted sample on the same gel together with a dilution series of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Analyze the protein bands using ImageJ and quantify the amount of recombinant protein using BSA as a reference.\nUse Western blotting to normalize the specific protein on natural LD using a quantified recombinant protein dilution series as a reference.\nNote: Using BSA as the reference, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining should be applied since both BSA and target recombinant proteins can be stained together. Western blot only recognizes a specific protein so that it is used in “d”, to avoid the interference from various intracellular proteins. However, if a commercial target protein is used as a reference, the Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining can be replaced by Western blot. Once the purity of recombinant proteins is confirmed, BCA protein assay kit is also applicable to determine the concentration of recombinant proteins, as an alternative method of Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.\nNote: Procedure for Day 2 is mainly used for quantitative experiments of artificial LDs. If the artificial LDs are only used for qualitative experiments, Day 2 procedure can be omitted.\nCritical: Due to their hydrophobicity, LD-associated proteins are prone to aggregate on the surface of artificial LDs. When present, aggregation appears as spots on the artificial LD surface instead of homogenous ring structures. High protein concentration can also result in artificial LD clustering. See troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.15].\nProtein binding affinity analysis on artificial lipid droplet\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Binding of LD-associated proteins to adiposomes can be saturated and thus follows receptor-ligand binding kinetics. The concentration binding plot is transformed into a linear function using Scatchard analysis. An overview of this workflow is provided in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. The theoretical background of applying Scatchard analysis is presented in quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1469-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Binding analysis procedure\nDiagram of this experimental procedure.\n(A) A series of SMT3-PLIN2-GFP dilutions were incubated with adiposomes (OD600 =20) for 12 h at 4°C. The concentration of original proteins was determined using BCA protein assay kit. The fluorescence intensity of proteins represents the concentration of proteins and the intensity was measured using EnSpire multimode plate reader. Both the concentration of protein dilutions and bound proteins were calculated to generate the saturation curve. The Eppendorf tube holder represents the total proteins for binding experiment with calculated concentrations. The black color 96-well plate represents the measurement for bound proteins, and the blue color 96-well plate represents the measurement for standard proteins.\n(B) Scatchard analysis of protein binding was conducted using the concentration ratio of bound proteins to free proteins against the concentration of bound proteins. The concentration of free proteins was calculated using corresponded concentration of protein dilutions to subtract the concentration of bound proteins. Parts of the figure are reprinted with permission from (Ma et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nMix the adiposome samples in each tube by gentle vortex and normalize the concentration of adiposomes to OD600 = 20. Distribute equal 30 μL aliquots in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.",
    "Note: The OD600 value of adiposomes is determined using an Eppendorf BioPhotometer. Dilute 10 μL of the adiposome sample into 190 μL of Buffer B and transfer the 200 μL sample to the cuvette of BioPhotometer to determine the absorbance at 600 nm. Alternatively, this value can also be determined using a microplate spectrophotometer at 600 nm wavelength, by diluting 10 μL of the adiposome sample into a well of 96-well plate containing 190 μL Buffer B. The value of absorbance equals to 0.15 which corresponds to 20 of OD600 value measured by BioPhotometer.\nThaw frozen proteins on ice. Determine the protein concentration using BCA protein assay kit. See troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.17].\nAdd a range of volumes of the protein solution to the tubes containing 30 μL adiposomes. Then, add Tris-NaCl buffer to bring the final volumes to 60 μL and thus develop a gradient concentration of proteins for binding experiment.\nVortex gently to mix the aliquots three times and centrifuge the tubes at 1,000×g for 10 s to drive the aliquots stay together in each tube.\nIncubate all specimens at 4°C for 12 h in the dark.\nNote: Incubating the reaction for 12 h at 4°C allows the binding to come to equilibrium while minimizing protein degradation. For the qualitative experiments, incubating at 37°C will be close to the physiological temperature for proteins. However, the saturation binding experiments require the reaction starts with low protein concentration and enough time to reach equilibrium. Therefore, 4°C is recommended for the saturation binding experiment.\nIsolate the artificial LDs by centrifugation at 20,000×g, 4°C for 5 min. Remove the infranatant using a gel-loading pipette tip and resuspend the artificial LDs in 30 μL of Buffer B.",
    "Note: Remove the infranatant with care to avoid disturbing the artificial LD layer. Take care to prevent the artificial LDs from adhering to the pipette tip.\nRepeat step 44 twice to remove nonspecifically associated proteins.\nResuspend the isolated artificial LDs in 800 μL of Tris-NaCl buffer per tube and vortex for 15 s. The volume ratio between 800 μL and the volume of original incubation mixture (60 μL) are defined as the dilution factor.\nPrepare recombinant protein standard curve.\nDilute Triton X-100 into 800 μL of Tris-NaCl buffer to a final Triton X-100 concentration of 1% (v/v).\nNote: Triton X-100 is used to prevent the aggregation of proteins.\nPrepare a dilution series by diluting protein stock solution with Tris-NaCl buffer containing Triton X-100.\nUse the dilution series to determine the protein concentration of artificial LDs using an EnSpire multimode plate reader.\nPrepare two-fold serial dilutions of adiposome by diluting original adiposomes (OD600 = 20) with Buffer B till the concentrations of which are one-half, one-quarter, one-eighth and one-sixteenth of the stock.\nDetermine the fluorescence intensity of the samples.\nDistribute the protein dilution series in a 96-well plate, with 200 μL per well and three replicates. Prior to the measurement, the plate is centrifuged at 3,000×g for 1 min to remove bubbles.\nDistribute the artificial LD suspension into same plate, with 200 μL per well and three replicates.\nDetermine the absorbance at 600 nm of the artificial LD aliquots and adiposome aliquots, using an EnSpire multimode plate reader in order and then the number of droplets can be corrected.",
    "Determine the fluorescence intensity of all specimens using the same plate reader with proper excitation and emission wavelengths for the fluorescence protein fused to the protein under study. For example, PLIN2-GFP, the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths are 488 nm and 530 nm, respectively. The machine provides the fluorescence intensity value as relative fluorescence unit (RFU).\nConstruct the binding curve of proteins to adiposomes.\nCorrect the background absorbance of buffer from standards by scanning the blank buffer.\nCreate a calibration curve by using RFU against the concentration of protein standards and generate a linear regression No.1.\nCreate a calibration curve by using RFU against the absorbance at 600 nm of diluted serial suspension of adiposomes and generate a linear regression No.2.\nCorrect the background of adiposomes from samples using linear regression No.2.\nCalculate the concentration of proteins bound to adiposomes using linear regression No.1.\nCorrect the concentrations of bound proteins by multiplying the dilution factor (roughly 13.3 in this study).\nNote: The artificial LDs can be lost by the centrifuging/washing procedure, which drives the actual fluorescence intensity of droplets to deviate from the theoretical value randomly. To avoid this issue, the number of droplets is corrected using OD600 measurement. Use the ratio of OD600Measured to OD600Theoretical of adiposomes (OD600 = 20) to correct the loss when calculating the concentration of bound proteins. OD600Theoretical of adiposomes (OD600 = 20) diluted for 13.3 times is about 0.135.\nGenerate the saturation curve of bound protein concentration versus total protein concentration.",
    "Use GraphPad Prism 7.0 software to render the Scatchard plot. The ordinate is the concentration of bound protein/the concentration of free protein (Bound/Free) and the abscissa is the concentration of bound protein (Bound). The concentration of free protein is calculated by using total concentration to subtract the bound concentration of proteins. Linear regression of Bound/Free versus Bound yielded a slope = -KD-1, where KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The abscissa intercept is Bmax, the maximum saturation concentration of ligand binding sites.\nCritical: High protein concentrations will result in the supersaturation of protein binding.
