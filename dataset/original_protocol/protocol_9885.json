    "1. Breast Epithelial Cell Growth and Assay Media\nMCF10A breast epithelial cells\n\tNOTE: The non-tumorigenic immortalized breast epithelial cell line is derived from a patient with fibrocystic disease43. Cells do not express estrogen receptor.\n\t\nTo prepare 20 μg/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), dissolve 100 μg of lyophilized EGF in 500 µL of sterile dH2O to make 200 μg/mL EGF. Add 500 μL of 200 μg/mL EGF into 4.5 mL of sterile 0.1% BSA in dH2O to make a 20 μg/mL EGF stock solution. Store prepared 20 μg/mL EGF aliquots at -20 °C for up to 12 months.\nTo prepare 500 μg/mL hydrocortisone, dilute 1 mg of hydrocortisone in 1 mL of absolute ethanol (200 proof). Add 1 mL of sterile DMEM F:12 to this mixture to make a 500 μg/mL hydrocortisone stock solution. Store hydrocortisone stock aliquots at -80 °C for up to 12 months.\nTo prepare 10 μg/mL cholera toxin, dissolve 1 mg of cholera toxin lyophilized powder in 1 mL of sterile dH2O to make a 1 mg/mL cholera toxin stock solution. Store cholera toxin stock aliquots at -80 °C for up to 12 months.\nTo prepare Growth Medium, add 500 µL of EGF (20 μg/mL), 500 µL of hydrocortisone (500 μg/mL), 5 μL of cholera toxin (1 mg/mL), 500 μL of bovine insulin (10 mg/mL), 10 mL of penicillin and streptomycin, and 25 mL of horse serum to 500 mL of DMEM F:12 for a final concentration of 20 ng/mL EGF, 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone, 10 ng/mL cholera toxin, 10 ng/mL bovine insulin, 2% v/v penicillin and streptomycin, and 5% v/v horse serum. Antibiotic concentration was increased to 2% to account for decreased sterility in the bioprinting process; however, the antibiotic concentration can be lowered to 1%.",
    "To prepare Assay Medium, add 500 µL of hydrocortisone (500 μg/mL), 5 μL of cholera toxin (1 mg/mL), 500 μL of bovine insulin (10 mg/mL), 10 mL of penicillin and streptomycin, and 25 mL of horse serum to 500 mL of DMEM F:12 for a final concentration of 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone, 10 ng/mL cholera toxin, 10 ng/mL bovine insulin, 2% v/v penicillin and streptomycin, and 5% v/v horse serum.\nMDA-MB-231\n\tNOTE: The triple-negative (lacking estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2) breast cancer epithelial cell line is created from pleural effusion of a female patient with metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma44. Cells represent an aggressive, invasive, and poorly differentiated breast cancer.\n\t\nTo prepare Growth and Assay Medium, add 50 mL of fetal bovine serum, 10 mL of penicillin and streptomycin, and 25 mL of horse serum to 500 mL of DMEM for a final concentration 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 2% v/v penicillin and streptomycin, and 5% v/v horse serum.\n2. Breast Epithelial Cell Culture\nSeed 500,000 MCF10A or MDA-MB-231 cells in a 10 cm (P100) tissue culture dish with 10 mL of MCF10A or MDA-MB-231 growth media. MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells reach >90% confluence in 48 hours.\nTo passage breast epithelial cells, first wash cells with 10 mL of warm PBS.\nDetach breast epithelial cells by adding 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the dish. Place the dish in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 20-25 minutes.\nAdd 5 mL of MCF10A or MDA-MB-231 Growth Medium to the trypsinized cells to neutralize the trypsin. Pipette the cell-media mixture up and down to resuspend cells and break up cell clusters.",
    "Add the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1,200 x g for 3 minutes. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of MCF10A or MDA-MB-231 Growth Medium.\nPlate 1 mL of cell suspension in 5 new 10 cm tissue culture dishes along with MCF10A or MDA-MB-231 Growth Medium. Place the dishes in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells will be ready to be passaged again in 2-3 days. MCF10A cells can be maintained to passage number 35, after which they show morphological changes. MDA-MB-231 cells can be maintained to passage number 24, after which they show morphological changes.\n3. Breast Epithelial Spheroid Formation\nFreeze 200 μL pipette tips for 30 minutes prior to starting the assay. Keep growth-factor reduced matrix solution (e.g., Matrigel) (10 mg/mL) on ice for the entire process.\nSlowly pipette 30 μL of ice-cold matrix solution using ice-cold 200 μL pipette tips into each well of an 8-well chamber slide. Start from the sides and drag the pipette tip along the corners, adding a final drop to the center of the well to ensure even coating of each well. Avoid air bubbles during this step to ensure a uniform matrix solution layer. Use new pipette tips for each well.\nIncubate chamber slides in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 15-20 minutes to polymerize the matrix solution.\nResuspend trypsinized MCF10A cells in MCF10A Assay Medium at 200,000 cells/mL or resuspend trypsinized MDA-MB-231 cells in MDA-MB-231 Growth Medium at 200,000 cells/mL.\nIf using MCF10A cells, prepare fresh MCF10A Spheroid Growth Medium by adding 5 μL of EGF (20 μg/mL) and 100 μL of matrix solution to 5 mL of Assay Medium for a final concentration of 2% matrix solution.",
    "Remove the chamber slide precoated with matrix solution from the incubator. Add 50 μL of MCF10A or MDA-MB-231 cell suspension (10,000 cells) to each well. If using MCF10A cells, add 450 μL of MCF10A Spheroid Growth Medium. If using MDA-MB-231 cells, add 450 μL of MDA-MB-231 Growth Medium premixed with 2% matrix solution (9 μL). Immediate place the chamber slide in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nReplace the medium every 4 four days. Carefully pipette 200 μL of old media out from one corner of each well using a 200 μL pipette tip. During this process, tilt the chamber slide at 45° to ensure that the spheroids are not disturbed. Add 200 μL of freshly prepared MCF10A Spheroid Growth Medium or MDA-MB-231 Growth Medium previously mixed with 2% matrix solution to each well at the corner in drops to ensure that spheroids remain attached to the matrix layer. Only ~50% of the media is replaced so that all the cytokines produced by the spheroids are not completely depleted.\n\tNOTE: MCF10A breast epithelial spheroids take up to 8 days to polarize and form hollow centers. MDA-MB-231 breast epithelial spheroids take up to 5 days to form and have no hollow centers.\n4. Endothelial Cell Network Formation\nHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell (HUVEC) Culture\n\t\nAdd the contents of a single Endothelial Growth Medium-2 kit containing insulin growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, ascorbic acid, epidermal growth factor, heparin and gentamicin-amphotericin B, along with 50 mL of fetal bovine serum, 5 mL penicillin-streptomycin and 5 mL of 200 mM glutamine to 500 mL of Endothelial Basal Medium-2 (EBM-2) to create complete Endothelial Growth Medium (EGM-2).",
    "Seed 500,000 endothelial cells in a 10 cm tissue culture dish in 10 mL of EGM-2. Place cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until they reach >80% confluency (around 48 hours).\nTo passage cells, wash endothelial cells with 10 mL of warm PBS. Detach HUVEC by adding 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the 10 cm tissue culture dish. Closely monitor the cells by phase contrast microscopy. Cells are ready when they are balled up but remain attached to the dish.\nCarefully aspirate the trypsin out of the dish. Add 8 mL of EGM-2 to the dish. Wash cells off the dish by pipetting the EGM-2 up and down over the entire dish surface.\nAlternatively, add 5 mL of EGM-2 to the trypsinized cells to neutralize the trypsin. Pipette the cell-media mixture up and down to resuspend cells and break up cell clusters. Add the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1,200 x g for 3 minutes. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of EGM-2.\nAdd 1 mL of cell suspension to 9 mL of EGM-2 in a 10 cm tissue culture dish. Place the dishes in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Exchange 2/3 of the medium with fresh EGM-2 every 2 days. Cells will be ready to passage in 3-5 days. HUVEC can be maintained up to passage 8 after which they fail to form networks.\nEndothelial Cell (HUVEC) Network Formation\nFreeze 200 μL pipette tips for 30 minutes prior to starting the assay. Keep growth-factor reduced matrix solution (10 mg/mL) on ice for the entire process.",
    "Slowly pipette 30 μL of ice-cold matrix solution using ice-cold 200 μL pipette tips into each well of an 8-well chamber slide. Start from the sides and drag the pipette tip along the corners, adding a final drop to the center of the well to ensure even coating of each well. Avoid air bubbles during this step to ensure a uniform matrix solution layer. Use new pipette tips for each well.\nIncubate chamber slides in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 15-20 minutes to polymerize Matrigel.\n\t\nPre-stain a 10 cm dish of HUVEC with 10 μL of red cell tracker (1:1000) for 30 minutes in 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nWash endothelial cells with 10 mL of warm PBS. Detach HUVEC by adding 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the 10 cm tissue culture dish. Place the dish in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 5 minutes to fully detach the cells.\nAdd 5 mL of EGM-2 to the dish to neutralize the trypsin. Transfer the cell suspension to a 25 mL conical tube. Centrifuge HUVEC at 1,200 x g for 5 minutes. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of serum-free EBM-2.\nCount cells using Trypan blue to determine viable cells. Create a 1 x 106 cell/mL solution.\nAdd 100,000 HUVEC to each well with 200 μL of serum free EBM-2. If more cells are added, they will create a surface monolayer rather than a tube network.\nIncubate HUVEC in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. After 6 hours, image HUVEC networks by phase contrast microscopy. Networks are now ready for coculture with breast spheroids.\n5. Bioprinting Breast epithelial spheroids on pre-formed HUVEC Networks",
    "NOTE: A dual nozzle bio-deposition system should be used for the biofabrication process. In this case, the system had three motion arms to allow micron-scale spatial control of material deposition as well as two screw driven motors to deposit bioink from 10 mL syringes. The system should be functionalized with a high efficiency particulate air filtration system as well as UV-sterilization capabilities to maintain a sterile environment during bioprinting. The bioprinter is UV sterilized for an hour before the printing process.\nCreate breast epithelial spheroids and HUVEC networks as previously described. Estimate the number of breast epithelial spheroids in each well by counting spheroids in representative phase contrast microscopy images.\nCut 0.5 cm off the end of a 1000 µL pipette tip. Use the cut pipette tip to carefully pipette all spheroids out of the 8-well chamber slide and into a 50 mL tube. Resuspend spheroids in the selected bioink at 100 spheroids/100 µL.\n\tNOTE: Higher spheroid concentrations may result in spheroid clustering and prevent visualization of interactions between the spheroids and the endothelial networks.\nPass the spheroid mixture through a 70 µm cell strainer to remove any large or clustered spheroids.\nLoad the pooled spheroids into a 10 mL sterile syringe and cap it with a 25-gauge sterile needle. Attach the syringe to the bio-deposition system.\nAspirate the medium off the HUVEC networks in the 8-well chamber slide.\nExtrude 100 µL of breast epithelial spheroids onto 6 wells of HUVEC networks at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Maintain 2 wells of HUVEC networks as controls.",
    "Add 400 µL of MCF10A Spheroid Growth Medium if using MCF10A spheroids printed on HUVEC networks or add 400 µL MDA-MB-231 Growth Medium previously mixed with 2% matrix solution if using MDA-MB-231 spheroids printed on HUVEC networks. The respective spheroid growth medium should be used in HUVEC control wells.\nIncubate co-cultures in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 24 – 96 hours without a media change. Co-cultures will remain viable in the original medium for up to four days.\n6. Confocal Microscopy\nImmunofluorescence and PBS-Glycine Wash Buffer Preparation\n\t\nPrepare Immunofluorescence (IF) buffer 10x stock solution by adding 2.5 g of sodium azide, 5 g of bovine serum albumin, 10 mL of Triton X-100, and 2.05 mL of Tween-20 in 500 mL of 10x PBS. Adjust pH to 7.4. Store the stock solution for up to a year at 4 °C to avoid sedimentation.\nCreate a working IF buffer by diluting 50 mL of 10x IF buffer in 450 mL of sterile deionized water. Store the working solution at room temperature for up to one week.\nPrepare 10x PBS-Glycine buffer stock solution by adding 37.5 g of glycine to 500 mL of 10x PBS. Adjust pH to 7.4. Store the stock solution for up to 6 months at 4 °C to avoid sedimentation.\nCreate a working PBS-Glycine solution by diluting 50 mL of 10x PBS-Glycine buffer in 450 mL of sterile deionized water. Store the working solution at 4 °C for up to one week.\nLabel Bioprinted Samples and Image by Confocal Microscopy\n\t\nAspirate medium from bioprinted 3D co-cultures and rinse 3 times with warm PBS. Fix bioprinted 3D co-cultures with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Rinse samples 3 times for 20 minutes with 1x PBS-Glycine.",
    "Block samples with IF buffer mixed with 10% goat serum for 90 minutes (primary block), followed by 40 minutes with IF buffer plus 10% goat serum and Afﬁnipure Fab fragment (1:100, secondary block).\nIf using MCF10A spheroids, label samples with a primary antibody for integrin α6 (1:100) in secondary blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C, followed by an Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (1:200) and Hoescht 33342 (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature protected from light. MCF10A cell lines express high levels of integrin α6, which is essential for showing spheroid polarization and morphology.\nIf using MDA-MB-231 spheroids, which express low levels of integrin α6, label samples with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (1:100) and Hoescht 33342 (1:1000) in secondary blocking buffer for 4 hours at room temperature protected from light. Phalloidin enables actin ﬁlament visualization so spheroid amorphous and invasive morphology can be assessed.\nWash samples with 1X PBS-glycine 3 times for 20 minutes.\nPrepare samples for mounting by removing the chamber slide using the manufacturer’s tool. Add a small drop of antifade solution to each well. Place a 22 mm x 60 mm coverslip on each chamber slide and carefully seal the edges with clear nail polish.\nImage samples using a confocal microscope as Z stacks of ~10 slices in 5 μm steps. If desired, compress Z planes into a single plane using the Extended Focus command in cell imaging software.\nQuantify spheroid adhesion to endothelial networks using Image J. The number of adhered spheroids can be quantified using the analyze plugin with the appropriate particle size and circularity. Normalize the number of attached spheroids to the image area.",
    "To ensure reproducibility, quantify the number of adhered spheroids in 4 x 4 tiled images of co-cultures. If the spheroid number is statistically significantly lower than other experiments, the experiment should be repeated.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
