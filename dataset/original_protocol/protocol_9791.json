    "NOTE: See Table 1 and Table 2 for recipes for GYM medium and agar plate and S30A and S30B wash buffers.\n1. Preparation of solutions and general guidance\nKeep all solutions, cells (post-growth), and cell extracts on ice after preparation, unless an exception is stated.\nStore stocks for 1 M Mg-glutamate, 4 M K-glutamate, 40% (w/v) PEG 6000, 1 g/mL polyvinylsulfonic acid at room temperature, and all other stocks at -80 °C. Minimize the number of freeze-thaw cycles to avoid chemical degradation.\nFor the preparation of energy solution stocks (see Table 3) such as 3-PGA (requires pH adjustment), follow the guidance provided in the E. coli TX-TL protocol41.\n\tNOTE: All components are fully soluble in ddH2O and stored as aliquots in the -80 °C freezer.\nDefrost individual stocks or energy solutions (described later) on ice. Heat the amino acids stock at 42 °C with vortexing for ~15-30 min to solubilize all amino acids.\nAs some amino acids (L-Cys, L-Tyr, L-Leu) precipitate on ice, while minimizing rest time, leave this solution at room temperature and use a vortex to dissolve.\nAdd the calculated volumes (Table 3) of stock solutions and water and mix well using a vortex.\nAliquot the energy solution as 20-100 µL aliquots per tube, or as desired, on ice and store at -80 °C until further use.\n2. Preparation of S. venezuelae ATCC 10712 cells\nDay 1-Media/buffer preparation and overnight pre-culture\n\t\nPrepare 1 L of sterile GYM liquid medium in a 2 L baffled flask, as described in Table 1. See the Table of Materials for equipment/chemical/reagent sources.\nPrepare 1 x 50 mL of sterile GYM liquid medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, as described in Table 1.",
    "Prepare 100 mL of 1 M HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mL of 1 M MgCl2, and 500 mL of 4 M NH4Cl solutions to make 1 L of S30A and 1 L of S30B wash buffers. See Table 2 for the recipes.\nPrepare the overnight pre-culture. Pre-warm the sterile 50 mL of GYM liquid medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask to 28 °C for 30 min.\nInoculate a single colony of S. venezuelae ATCC 10712 (or related strain) from a GYM agar plate into prewarmed 50 mL of GYM liquid medium and incubate at 28 °C, 200 rpm for 16 h (overnight pre-culture).\nDay 2-Prepare daytime pre-culture and main growth culture.\n\t\nPre-warm 50 mL of sterile GYM liquid medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask at 28 °C for 30 min.\nTransfer 1 mL of overnight pre-culture into pre-warmed 50 mL of GYM liquid medium and incubate at 28 °C, 200 rpm for 8 h (daytime pre-culture).\nAfter this growth period, check the OD600 in a spectrophotometer using a 1:10 dilution with sterile GYM medium in a 1 mL (1 cm path length) plastic cuvette.\n\t\tNOTE: The OD600 should have reached at least 3-4. If there is poor growth, it is advisable to repeat steps 2.2.1-2.2.2.\nSub-culture 0.25 mL of daytime pre-culture into 1 L of liquid GYM medium in 2 L baffled flasks.\nShake overnight at 28 °C, 200 rpm for 14 h.\nDay 3-Harvest cells\n\t\nAfter the previous incubation period (14 h), record the OD600 of the main culture. Dilute the overnight culture 1:10 with fresh GYM medium for OD600 measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: The OD600 should have reached 3.0-4.0 at this stage.",
    "If OD600<3.0, increase the shaking speed to 250-300 rpm and grow until an OD600 of 3.0 is reached. Grow for no longer than an additional 2 h (16 h in total).\nIf OD600>3.0, transfer the cultures to centrifugation containers and rapidly cool on wet ice for 30 min.\nWhile waiting for the cell culture to cool on ice, prepare 4 mL of fresh 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), S30A and S30B buffers, as described in Table 1, and keep them on ice. See the Table of Materials for chemical/reagent source.\nPre-weigh an empty 50 mL centrifuge tube and pre-chill at -20 °C.\nAdd 2 mL of 1 M DTT to 1 L of S30A buffer on ice and mix well.\n\t\tNOTE: Add DTT to the S30A and S30B wash buffers only before using them.\nCentrifuge cells at 6,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min, and carefully discard the supernatant in a quick and single motion.\n\t\tNOTE: If the pellet is disturbed, maximize cell retention with residual GYM medium and continue the protocol.\nAdd 500 mL of S30A buffer and resuspend the cells by shaking the centrifugation bottles vigorously until the cell clumps are homogeneously dispersed.\nCentrifuge the cells at 6,000 × g, 4 °C, 6 min, and carefully discard the supernatant.\n\t\tNOTE: Although the cell pellet will be firmer at this point, some cells will remain in suspension (see Figure 1). Treat as described in 2.3.7 and retain as many cells as possible.\nRepeat steps 2.3.8-2.3.9.\nAdd 2 mL of 1 M DTT to 1 L of S30B buffer on ice and mix well. Add 500 mL of S30B buffer to the cells. Repeat step 2.3.9.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of S30B buffer and transfer to the pre-weighed, pre-chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube. If required, transfer the residual cells with an additional 5-10 mL of S30B buffer. Fill to 50 mL with S30B.\nCentrifuge cells at 6,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min, and carefully discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 2.3.13.\nCarefully aspirate the remaining S30B supernatant with a 100-200 µL pipette.\nWeigh the wet cell pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical wet cell pellet weight for 1 L of overnight GYM culture (OD600 = 3.0) is ~4.5 g.\nFor every 1 g of wet cells, add 0.9 mL of S30B buffer. Resuspend the cells using either a Pasteur pipette or vortex.\nCentrifuge briefly (~10 s) up to 500 × g to sediment the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused at this point, and cells can be frozen on either liquid nitrogen or dry ice and stored at -80°C. For safety, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling liquid nitrogen, including face shields and gloves.\n3. Cell lysis by sonication to obtain the crude cell extract\nNOTE: At this stage, the user can choose to disrupt the cells by sonication either in 1 mL fractions (option 1) or as a larger cell suspension (5 mL) in a 50 mL tube (option 2). Both options have been detailed below to ensure reproducibility, as the final volume of the cell suspension can change due to the loss of cells during previous harvesting and wash steps. A new user should attempt option 2.1 first to establish the protocol.\nCell Lysis by sonicating in 1 mL fractions\n\t\nUsing a 1 mL pipette tip (cut off the end of the tip to increase the bore size), transfer 1 mL of the cell suspension into 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "NOTE: If the cells are frozen, rapidly thaw the 50 mL tube containing the pellet in lukewarm water prior to cell lysis. Transfer the tube to wet ice as soon as the pellet has begun to defrost, and chill for 10 min.\nPlace each microcentrifuge tube in a beaker of ice water, using a plastic tube rack to hold the tube for sonication.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the sensitivity of the cell extract to overheating, it is critical to ensure that the tubes do not warm up to prevent protein precipitation and reduced enzymatic activity.\nUse a sonicator probe with a 3 mm diameter tip and clean it with 70% (v/v) ethanol and double-distilled water (ddH2O). Lower the sonicator tip into the cell suspension until it is ~1 cm below the liquid surface.\nInput the following settings into the sonicator: 20 kHz frequency, 65% amplitude, 10 s pulse ON time, 10 s pulses OFF time, 1 min total sonication time.\nRun the sonication protocol. Move the tube up/down and sideways during the first two resting cycles to ensure the cells are evenly sonicated. Record the energy input.\n\t\tNOTE: For safety, wear appropriate hearing protection during sonication. The viscosity will decrease as cells are disrupted, and the pale cream wet cell pellet should turn into a homogenous brown fluid. The recommended energy input is 240 J per mL of wet cells. If the cells are only partially lysed, the suspension will still appear cream-colored with viscous clumps of cells, particularly on the sides of the tube.\nInvert the tube 2-3 times and repeat the sonication for an additional one or two 10 s cycles, mixing frequently until the cells are fully disrupted.\nCell Lysis by sonicating a 5 mL cell suspension",
    "If the cells are frozen, rapidly thaw the 50 mL tube containing the pellet in lukewarm water with shaking before cell lysis. Transfer the tube to wet ice as soon as the pellet has begun to defrost, and chill for 10 min.\nBriefly spin the tube at 500 x g to sediment the cells.\nPlace the 50 mL tube in a beaker of ice water for sonication.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the sensitivity of the cell extract to overheating, it is critical to ensure that the tubes do not warm up to prevent protein precipitation and reduced enzymatic activity.\nUse a sonicator probe with a 6 mm diameter tip and clean it with 70% (v/v) ethanol and ddH2O (see the visual schematic of 6 mm probe in Figure 1). Lower the sonicator tip into the cell suspension (~5 mL) until it is ~1 cm below the liquid surface.\nInput the following settings into the sonicator: 20 kHz frequency, 65% amplitude, 10 s pulse ON time, 10 s pulses OFF time, 1 min total sonication time per mL of wet cells (5 min in total).\nRun the sonication protocol. Move the tube up/down and sideways during the first two resting cycles to ensure the cells are evenly sonicated.\n\t\tNOTE: For safety, wear appropriate hearing protection during sonication. The viscosity will decrease as the cells are disrupted, and the pale cream wet cell pellet should turn into a homogenous brown fluid. Record the energy input. An optimal energy input of 240 J per mL of wet cells (~1200 J in total from 5 min sonication) is recommended.\nIf some cells remain intact, follow the guidance from step 3.1.5.\nTransfer the cell extracts into 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n4. Cell extract clarification and run-off reaction",
    "Centrifuge the lysed cells at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the cell debris. Transfer the supernatant into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes as 1 mL aliquots.\nPerform the run-off reaction for the cell extracts. Incubate the 1.5 mL tubes containing the cell extracts at 30 °C for 60 min on a heat block or incubator without shaking.\nCentrifuge the cell extracts at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pool the supernatants into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Mix the supernatant by inverting the tube five times until homogenous, then keep it on ice. Invert gently to avoid the formation of air bubbles.\nDilute 10 µL of the cell extract 100-fold with S30B buffer and measure the total protein concentration using a Bradford assay with three technical repeats (see Supplemental Material S2 for Bradford assay guidance).\nIf the protein concentration is 20-25 mg/mL, transfer the cell extracts as 100 µL aliquots into new 1.5 mL tubes, flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: For safety, wear appropriate PPE when handling liquid nitrogen, including face shields and gloves.\nIf the protein concentration is <20 mg/mL, repeat the crude extract preparation steps to ensure high-quality cell extract and TX-TL yields are comparable to the previously published work5.\n5. Preparation of plasmid DNA template\nPurify the pTU1-A-SP44-mScarlet-I plasmid (pUC19 origin) from a freshly transformed E. coli plasmid strain (DH10β, JM109) grown in 50 mL of LB culture (with 100 mg/mL carbenicillin) using an appropriate plasmid DNA purification kit as per manufacturer's instructions.\nElute the plasmid in 2 x 300 µL of nuclease-free water and combine the fractions.\nAdd 0.1 volumes (66 μL) of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2).\nAdd 0.7 volumes (462 μL) of isopropanol.",
    "Incubate the DNA at -20 °C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol to the DNA pellet.\nInvert the tube 3-4 times to resuspend the plasmid DNA pellet.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 5.7-5.9 and remove all visible liquid.\nAir-dry the DNA pellet for 10-30 min or dry for 5 min with a vacuum centrifuge.\nResuspend the dried pellet with 600 µL of nuclease-free ddH2O.\nMeasure the DNA concentration and purity using a spectrophotometer.\nPrepare 50-100 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C.\n\t​NOTE: A high DNA concentration in the range of 500-1000 ng/µL is recommended due to the tight volume constraints of cell-free reactions. Dilute the plasmid DNA stock to 80 nM; 168 ng/µL pTU1-A-SP44-mScarlet-I plasmid is equivalent to 80 nM.\n6. Preparation of the Streptomyces Master Mix (SMM) solution\nAmino acid solution\n\t\nUse the amino acid sampler kit to avoid manual errors and reduce preparation time, following the manufacturer's instructions provided online.\nDilute the 20x amino acid stock solution using ddH2O to a final concentration of 6 mM (5 mM L-Leu).\nFurther dilute to 2.4 mM (2 mM L-Leu) within the 2.4x SMM solution (see Table 3).\n\t\t​NOTE: The final concentration in the TX-TL reaction is 1 mM 19x amino acids and 0.83 mM L-Leu.\nEnergy solution and additives\n\t\nPrepare the other components in the 2.4x SMM solution by following the recipe described in Table 3.\nAlternatively, prepare a 2.4x Minimal Energy Solution (MES), following the recipe described in Table 3.\n7. Setting up a standard S. venezuelae TX-TL reaction",
    "Thaw the cell extract, SMM (or MES) solution, and plasmid DNA on ice. Pre-chill a 384-well plate at -20 °C.\nSet up TX-TL reactions where 25% of the volume is plasmid DNA, 33.33% is cell extract, and 41.67% is SMM solution; keep them on ice to avoid start time bias.\n\tNOTE: A standard TX-TL template has been provided (Table 4) to calculate the volume of reagents needed based on the number of reactions. The standard volume for a 33 µL reaction is as follows: 11 µL of cell extract, 13.75 µL of SMM, and 8.25 µL of plasmid DNA.\nGently vortex the mixture for ~5 s at a low-speed setting to ensure the solution is homogenous. Avoid foaming/bubble formation.\nTransfer 10 µL aliquots into three wells of a 384-well plate as a technical triplicate without introducing air bubbles. Seal the plate with a transparent cover and spin at 400 × g for 5 s.\nIncubate the reaction at 28 °C either in an incubator (for end-point readings) or a plate-reader without shaking.\n\tNOTE: Reactions typically require 3-4 h to reach completion. See Supplemental Material S2 for guidance on a plate reader and mScarlet-I standard measurements.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
