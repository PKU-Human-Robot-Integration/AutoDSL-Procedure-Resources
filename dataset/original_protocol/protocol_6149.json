    "Note: The full protocol is described in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617030033_8633.jpgFigure 3. Schematic step-by-step protocol for in vivo cysteine cross-linking using maleimide homo-bifunctional cross-linkers Growth of E. coli cross-linking strainsNote: The crystal structure of the inward-open state and the in-silico homology model predicting the outward-open state of the target protein guided us in the selection of residues to be replaced with cysteine using site-directed mutagenesis. We selected pairs of residues so that the distance between their Cα positions would be within the arm-length of homo-bifunctional cross-linking reagents when the target protein adopted only one of the two conformational states. Based on this strategy, we built E. coli cross-linking strains, each harboring a plasmid encoding a double-cysteine variant of the target protein. The detailed experimental rationale for the selection of residues for cysteine substitution and homo-bifunctional cross-linking reagents, and the construction of double cysteine variants can be found in our recent study (Kumar et al., 2019). Streak frozen stocks stored at -80 °C of E. coli cross-linking strains, each harboring a plasmid encoding a double-cysteine variant of the target protein (pET23/42FLAGMurJ∆cysThrombin derivatives were used in this protocol) (Kumar et al., 2019), on LB agar plates supplemented with 125 μg/ml of ampicillin.Note: The antibiotic ampicillin selects for plasmid maintenance, so replace it according to the plasmid system used. Incubate plates overnight at 37 °C.Use an individual colony to inoculate 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 125 μg/ml of ampicillin and incubate overnight at 37 °C in a roller drum spinning at the top speed of 56 rpm.Inoculate 50 ml of LB medium (in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask) with 1 ml of culture from Step A2 and grow the culture at 37 °C shaking at 200 rpm until it reaches an OD600 of 1.",
    "Note: Appropriate antibiotics can be used while growing this secondary culture to maintain the plasmid but they are not necessary because of the short incubation.Preparation of samples for cross-linking with homo-bifunctional cross-linkersTransfer the required volume of E. coli culture from Step A4 into a 50-ml centrifuge tube.Note: The required volume of E. coli culture (in ml) should equal to 10 multiplied by the number of treatments, where the number of treatments represents the number of different cross-linkers used plus one to be used without any cross-linker treatment (negative control). Centrifuge culture samples for 5 min at 2,057 x g in a centrifuge at room temperature.Discard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet with a volume of LB broth corresponding to 500 μl multiplied by the number of treatments (i.e., number of cross-linkers plus one).Vortex samples to ensure proper mixing and transfer 500 μl of each resuspended cell pellet into a new 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube.Crosslinking with homo-bifunctional cross-linkersNote: Prior to the experiment, remove stocks of all the cross-linkers from -20 °C and let them warm up to room temperature. In our experiments, we used 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane (BMH; which has a flexible 16-Å spacer arm length), 1,2-bis(maleimido)ethane (BMOE; which has a flexible 8-Å spacer arm length), and N,N′-(o-phenylene)dimaleimide (o-PDM; which has a rigid 6-Å spacer arm length). We used maleimide cross-linkers because they are reactive in aqueous environments such as the periplasm and cytoplasm, and form thioether bonds with sulfhydryl groups of cysteines that are resistant to reversal by reducing agents (Figure 4) (Mulligan et al., 2017). Perform all steps at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Add 10 μl of DMSO to the microcentrifuge tube containing resuspended cells that is labeled “negative control”.Note: DMSO is used in this case because DMSO is the solvent used to dissolve the cross-linkers.",
    "To each of the remaining microcentrifuge tubes containing resuspended cells, add 10 μl of the 50 mM stock of a cross-linker (BMH, BMOE, o-PDM) for a final concentration of 1 mM.Note: The final concentration of cross-linkers should be optimized as it may vary depending on the target protein. Vortex all samples.Place sample tubes on a nutator placed at room temperature and cover them with aluminium foil.Note: Samples are covered with foil because some cross-linkers are light sensitive. Incubate samples in the dark for 5 min rocking on the nutator at room temperature.Note: The incubation time with the cross-linkers should be optimized as it may vary depending on the target protein. Add 50 μl of 0.1 M L-cysteine (10 mM final concentration) to each sample.Note: Providing cysteine in excess titrates any unused cross-linker. The L-cysteine stock solution stored at -20 °C should be thawed to room temperature within an hour prior to addition.  Vortex all samples.Incubate for 5 min rocking on a nutator at room temperature.Add 1 ml of 1x PBS to each sample.Centrifuge for 1 min at 15,777 x g in a tabletop microcentrifuge.Discard the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 500 μl of 50 mM Tris (pH 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617030104_8506.jpgFigure 4. Reaction between a maleimide cross-linker and the sulfhydryl group of a cysteine on a target protein. The maleimide moiety of the cross-linker reacts with the sulfhydryl group (-SH) present on cysteine residues to form a stable thioether bond that cannot be reversed by reducing agents. The R group, which varies among cross-linking agents, includes a spacer arm and another maleimide group.Isolation of cytoplasmic membranes containing the target proteinFor spheroplast formation, transfer each sample from Step C11 to a new 15-ml centrifuge tube.Note: During spheroplast formation, the outer membrane and peptidoglycan cell wall of E.",
    "coli cells are destroyed, but their cytoplasmic membrane remains intact. Add 500 μl of spheroplast buffer.Add 2.5 μl of 100 mg/ml lysozyme stock.Add 1 ml of dH2O.Incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Gently vortex at low setting a couple of times for uniform mixing during the 15-min incubation.Add 50 μl of 1 M MgCl2.Transfer 3 μl of each sample to microscope glass slides and view sample under 40x objective to confirm spheroplast formation.Note: Spheroplasts appear as large bright round cells. Uniform spheroplast formation is necessary. If not, the incubation time at room temperature should be optimized. Collect spheroplasts by centrifugation at 2,057 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and resuspend spheroplasts in 500 μl of ice-cold 50 mM Tris (pH 8).Transfer each of the resuspended spheroplast samples into separate pre-chilled ultracentrifuge tubes.Note: This step should be performed on ice to minimized degradation of the target protein. Add 1 μl of 25 U/μl Benzonase stock.Mix well by carefully pipetting up and down.Centrifuge at 434, 902 x g for 1 h at 4 °C in an Optima-MAX-TL ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) using a TLA120.2 rotor to pellet membranes.Discard the supernatant and resuspend membrane pellets in 150 μl of thrombin reaction buffer. Add 15 μl of 10% DDM stock (final concentration 1%).Note: 1% DDM is used for solubilization of our target protein. However, choice of detergent can vary depending on the target protein. Transfer resuspended membrane preparations to a pre-chilled 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 15,777 x g for 10 min at 4 °C in a tabletop microcentrifuge to remove unsolubilized or aggregated proteins.For each sample, transfer supernatant to a separate microcentrifuge tube.Thrombin treatmentFor each sample in Step D18, transfer 50 μl into two separate microcentrifuge tubes.Add 4 μl of 0.1 U/μl thrombin stock (final concentration 0.",
    "4 U) to one of the microcentrifuge tubes of each treatment and leave the other one untreated.Note: Lyophilized thrombin powder should be first reconstituted as 0.1 U/μl in thrombin reconstitution buffer before using. Store the stock at -20 °C.  Incubate all samples for 20 h at room temperature.Note: Incubation time and temperature should be optimized to ensure cleavage of all target proteins. Add 50 μl of 2x AB buffer to all samples.Note: This step stops the proteolytic reaction and prepares samples for electrophoresis. We used 2x AB buffer for our protein samples; however, other types of SDS-PAGE loading buffers could be used depending on the target protein. Briefly centrifuge at 15,777 x g for 10 s at room temperature in a tabletop centrifuge to collect samples at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube.SDS-PAGE and immunoblottingAssemble a 10% SDS-PAGE gel in a Mini-PROTEAN® Tetra system.Note: The % of SDS-PAGE gel should be decided based on the molecular weight of the target protein and its thrombin proteolytic cleave pattern. Load 25 μl of each sample from Step E5 on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. When doing so, load each thrombin treated/untreated pair adjacent to each other for each treatment with or without a particular cross-linker.Note: Equivalent amounts of samples should be loaded on the gel because equal numbers of cells were collected at Step B4 after using equal volumes of cultures that had reached the same OD600. However, methods to measure protein concentration could also be used for normalization before loading the samples on a gel. Start electrophoresis at 120 V using 1x SDS-PAGE running buffer and stop after the visible molecular weight markers have migrated the desired distance.Transfer proteins from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 10 V for 2.5 h using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad).",
    "Note: Transfer time and voltage should be optimized according to the target protein and % SDS PAGE gel. Block the PVDF membrane in TBST with 5% milk for 30 min at room temperature on a platform shaker.Probe the PVDF membrane with the primary antibody.Note: For our target protein, we probed with anti-FLAG M2 (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich) in TBST with 5% milk by incubation at 4 °C on a shaker overnight. Wash three times with 1x TBST with 5 min incubation on a shaker at room temperature.Probe the PVDF membrane with a secondary antibody.Note: For our target protein, we probed with anti-mouse horseradish-peroxidase conjugated antibodies (1:10,000; GE Healthcare) in 1x TBST with 5% milk by incubating for 1 h on a shaker at room temperature. Wash three times with 1x TBST with 5 min incubation on a shaker at room temperature.Develop the signal using the Clarity Western ECL substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad) and detected using Image Lab program in a ChemiDoc XRS+ system (Bio-Rad)."
