    "Root cleaningTo extract the roots from the plant (Figure 1A), rinse the roots with water to loosen and remove substrate. Maintain foliage until the identity of the fungal host plant and its root system has been verified. Gently separate the fungal host plant from intertwining root systems and avoid severing the roots (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201012/20201012233314_9820.jpgFigure 1. Images showing wild-collected Lycopodiella inundata to root staining. A. Mature field collected L. inundata plant (inset) shown with its soil substrate in sieve before cleaning. B. Entire L. inundata plant rhizome (average 4 cm long) with intact roots separated from soil substrate and 75% clean. C. Microcentrifuge tubes (2 ml) set in racks for water bath (inset: tubes in metal heat-resistant rack). D. Examples of a staining plate and glass staining blocks with individual wells (inset). E. Covered staining plates using pipette container lids.Place individual plant or root system into a small plastic dish and moisten with dH2O; keep moist at all times.Gently brush substrate off the root surfaces with a paintbrush, using a stereomicroscope and blunt forceps to hold the plant in place; avoid coarse bristles and harsh scrubbing to preserve root hair and epidermal cells.Refresh water in the dish, as needed, and rinse the roots with dH2O using the wash bottle nozzle to alleviate the substrate until no debris remains (Figure 1B).Once cleaned, store roots in an airtight vessel submerged in 70% ethanol for up to 1 year at room temperature, or for short-term storage in dH2O at 3 °C.Preparation for stainingPre-heat the water bath to 100 °C, with the lid closed to accelerate heating and to avoid evaporation.Cut cleaned root samples into pieces of approximately 1 cm in length (for ease of slide preparation later) using a sharp scalpel blade. Handle roots with blunt forceps to avoid damaging tissue.",
    "For roots stored in dH2O, proceed to ‘Clearing’ (Procedure C). For roots stored in ethanol, place 2-3 root segments into each well of the washing plate or block (Figure 1D).Rinse the roots 3 x in dH2O, ensuring the roots are fully submerged.Root clearingTransfer the roots to (sample) labelled microcentrifuge tubes (2-3 roots per tube) in a microcentrifuge tube rack to commence clearing (Figure 1C).Pipette 10% KOH into the microcentrifuge tubes, submerging the roots (approximately 1 ml).Transfer these tubes to a heat-proof microcentrifuge rack and place inside the water bath (see Figure 1C inset). Place a plastic tray on top to ensure tube lids do not open during boiling.Boil for 15-25 min according to root thickness (see notes 5, 6 and 7).Reduce the temperature to 60 °C (this should take around 15-20 min with lid off) and leave the tubes incubating (a further 15 min for S. nigra and 30 min for L. inundata).Carefully transfer the tubes from the water bath to the bench-top microcentrifuge tube rack.Remove the KOH solution from root samples using a pipette, and rinse 3 x with H2O.StainingAdd staining solution to the staining samples, ensuring they are fully submerged and not sticking together.L. inundata: Place the staining samples in the water bath at 100 °C for 3 min.S. nigra: Leave the tubes at room temperature for 1 min 30 s (see notes 5, 6 and 7).De-stainingTransfer the roots to the washing tray (Figure 1D) using blunt forceps and add approximately 1 ml de-staining solution 1 (see below, 1% acetic acid) to each well to remove excess dye. Continue administering the 1% acetic acid until the blue dye trail disappears (see notes 5, 6 and 7).On the final acetic acid wash, ensure all roots are submerged and separated from each other.",
    "To prevent evaporation, place a cover over the washing tray (Figure 1E).Leave to de-stain overnight.Replace the 1% acetic acid with de-staining solution 2 (50% glycerol)–enough volume to cover the roots.Slide preparationTo prepare a semi-permanent slide, add a drop of 50% glycerol centrally to the slide.Each cover slip should contain only one to two root segments.Transfer one to two root segments to the glycerol pools using blunt forceps.Position the roots as flat as possible on the slide then use a needle and stereomicroscope to centre the root and fan out the finer tips (see note 4).Gently place a glass cover slip over the root segment, avoiding the creation of air bubbles.Add a drop of clear nail polish to each corner of the cover slip (to prevent root samples from drying out), and wait for this to dry before sealing around the edges.ImagingSee Figure 2 for light microscopy images using this technique.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201012/20201012233344_1372.jpgFigure 2.

Micrographs were prepared using Leica Application Suite (LAS) imaging software version 4.13 (Leica) using a light microscope coupled to a camera. Objectives required: 40x and 63x (required for FRE only)."
