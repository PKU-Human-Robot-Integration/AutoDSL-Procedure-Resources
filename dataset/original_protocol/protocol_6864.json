    "CryoinjurySterilize the surgical instruments and metal rod prior to the surgeries.Anaesthetize mice using isoflurane.Remove hair from the whole leg using a clipper and sterilize the skin anterior to the muscle of interest with chlorhexidine and alcohol swabs (Figure 1 Step 3).Using aseptic techniques, make an incision in the skin and muscle fascia and expose the underlying muscle using surgical scissors or a scalpel (Figure 1 Step 4a and 4b).Note: The size of the skin incision should be adjusted according to the size of the muscle and metal rod used (see Figure 1 Step 4a); it must allow the skin to be retracted wide enough so that the edges of the incised skin do not touch the metal rod. This usually requires an incision that spans over 80% of the muscle in the longitudinal direction, with the center of the incision aligning with that of the underlying muscle. Cool a metal rod in dry ice for 5 min, wipe the rod with the chlorhexidine and alcohol swabs, and apply the flat end of the metal rod to the center of the muscle for a given amount of time (see Figure 1 Step 5).Note: Standardize the size of the injury by maintaining the duration of the contact with the rod constant. Adjust the duration to achieve the desired extent of injury. A duration of 5 s is recommended for histological evaluation of injuries up to 10 d post-injury; 10 s are recommended for evaluation 14-21d postinjury. A pilot study may be required to establish the optimal duration of the cold injury for your animal model and study design. Suture the skin and muscle fascia to close the incision using 3-0 PROLENE® polyprorylene suture (Figure 1 Steps 6a and 6b).",
    "Provide the appropriate post-operative analgesia to the animal, according to the relevant guideline, and carefully and regularly observe them for at least 48 h after surgery.Example: 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneous injection every 12 h for 48 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4036/bioprotoc-11-11-4036-g001.jpgFigure 1. Induction of cryoinjury using a cooled stainless-steel metal rod. After the induction with sufficient anesthesia in the animal, cryoinjury can be inflicted in the following steps: removal of the hair and sterilization of the skin over the whole leg (3), exposure of the muscle (4a and 4b), application of the cooled metal rod over the muscle (5), and closure of the skin incision (6a and 6b).Muscle harvestingEuthanize mice according to institutional guidelines.Note: Cervical dislocation is a preferred method of euthanizing adult mice to minimize the time between the completion of euthanasia and muscle harvesting.Open the previous incision on the skin and remove the whole length of the injured muscle from the tendon attachments.Place the muscle in a 10% formalin solution in a glass shell vial.Replace formalin with 70% ethyl alcohol after 48 h for future sectioning and store the sample at room temperature (RT), avoiding direct sun and heat exposure.Create five 6-8 μm thick paraffinized transverse sections of the injury site on glass slides using a microtome.Perform hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining according to standard procedures.Histological evaluationUnder a light microscope, identify regenerating myofibers recognizable by their centrally located nuclei. Avoid counting multi-nucleated myofibers (green arrows) and inflammatory cells (red arrow) (Figure 2).Take high-power field images (the use of 20× or 40× objectives is recommended) spanning the entire injury site.Using ImageJ or an equivalent software, measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of a total of at least 1,000 distinct regenerating fibers per sample.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4036/bioprotoc-11-11-4036-g002.jpgFigure 2. Identification of regenerating myofibers in HE-stained transverse muscle sections. A.",
    "Regenerating myofibers (yellow circles) are distinguishable from the surrounding mature myofibers by their centrally located nuclei (black arrows). On day 5 post-injury (DPI 5), regenerating myofibers with centrally located nuclei are in the inflammatory foci (red arrows) (A). B. By day 10 post-injury (DPI 10), regenerating myofibers have formed an organized structure with substantially less inflammatory infiltration. Both images are of tibialis anterior muscle of 8-week-old C57BL/B male mice, with cryoinjury inflicted for 5 s. Scale bars = 100 μm."
