    "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) advisory board at California State University, Chico, approved all methods described below.\n1. Bleach 48 hpf Zebrafish Embryos\nWith 15 cm (w) x 15 cm (l) x 7 cm (h) plastic containers create 3 wash stations: 1) with 1 mL of 5% bleach in 1000 mL embryo medium (E3; see Table 1), 2) with sterile E3, and 3) with sterile E3. Ensure that each container has 500 mL of solution to submerge the embryos in.\n\tNOTE: For each condition tested, at least 10 embryos will be needed. This washing procedure can accommodate up to 200 embryos.\nWith a transfer pipette, place embryos into a tea strainer and submerge eggs in wash station #1 for 5 min. Remove the tea strainer (with embryos inside) and place into wash station #2 for 5 min; repeat for wash station #3 for a final 5 min.\nAfter the last wash, rinse embryos from tea strainer by turning it upside down over a clean 10 cm Petri dish and gently rinsing embryos off the tea strainer with sterile E3 and a transfer pipette.\n2. Dechorionate Embryos\nWith a transfer pipette, remove and discard as much E3 as possible from the Petri dish and add 500 μL of dechorionation protease (10 mg/mL) to embryos. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Gently tap the side of the Petri dish to completely remove chorions.\nWith a serological pipette, add 20 mL of sterile E3 to dilute protease. Allow embryos to settle, and remove the E3 with a transfer pipette. Repeat this wash step 3 times to remove all traces of the dechorionation protease.\n3. Preparing Embryo Samples\nUsing a P1000 pipette, place 10 embryos into a single sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nRemove E3 with a pipette and discard.",
    "Caution: Pipette with care as embryos can easily be displaced and discarded during the following wash steps.\n4. Preparing Embryos for Dissociation\nTransfer samples to laminar flow hood, and wash embryos by adding 1 mL sterile E3. Allow embryos to settle to bottom of tube and remove supernatant with a P1000 pipette. Repeat for a total of 3 washes.\nAfter last wash, remove E3 and discard. Add 1 mL of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in E3 to remove the mucus coating (and any spores, yeast, or bacteria that may be trapped in it) surrounding the embryonic zebrafish. Lay microcentrifuge tube horizontally, and incubate at room temperature in laminar flow hood for 25 min.\n5. Embryo Dissociation\nWash sample 3 times with 1 mL of sterile DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+). After last wash add 500 μL of DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and add 5 μL of 5 mg/mL (26 U/mL) dissociation protease.\n\tCaution: This enzyme needs Ca2+ and Mg2+, so ensure that the DPBS contains these ions.\nIncubate samples at 37 °C on a horizontal orbital shaker at 180 rpm for 60 min. Place samples in the laminar flow hood and triturate embryos with a P1000 until samples are fully dissociated.\n\tCaution: Check embryos periodically to determine when they become dissociated. The embryo solution should have some amount of tissue present; it should not be completely homogenous. It is possible to over-digest, which will destroy the HSPCs (see Supplemental Figure 1).\n6. Preparation of Dissociated Embryos\nPipette the 10 dissociated embryos onto the top reservoir of a 5 mL polystyrene round bottom tube with a 35 μm cell strainer cap.",
    "With a pipette, rinse the Petri tube with sterile PBS (with no Ca2+ or Mg2+) and transfer solution to 5 mL polystyrene tube containing filtered cells from step 6.1. Repeat until 4 mL of liquid is present in the 5 mL polystyrene tube.\n\tNOTE: PBS, DPBS, or other isotonic buffered solutions may be used at this stage, as long as they do not contain Ca2+ or Mg2+\nCentrifuge tubes at 4 °C and 300 x g for 5 min to pellet the homogenized cell sample. With a pipette, remove and discard supernatant from the round bottom tube. Take care to not disrupt the cells pelleted at the bottom of the tube. Resuspend the cells in 100 μL of PBS.\n7. Preparation of Methylcellulose\nGenerate 1x complete methylcellulose (Table 1) stock solution and add 2.5 mL to sterile round-bottom 14 mL tubes with 3 mL syringes and 16 G needles. Use one tube for each condition tested.\nAdd cytokines, small molecules, or other agents to be investigated to each sample.\nFor myeloid differentiation, add 1% Carp serum and 0.3 mg/mL recombinant zebrafish granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Gcsf)34 to methylcellulose medium. See Svoboda et al.37 for full description on how to generate carp serum and recombinant cytokines.\nFor erythroid differentiation, add 1% Carp serum and 0.1 mg/mL recombinant zebrafish erythropoietin (Epo)38 to methylcellulose medium.\nTo examine multilineage progenitors, add Epo and Gcsf.\n\t\tCaution: Cytokines and additives should not total more than 10% of the total volume, as the medium will not be viscous enough to discern individual colonies.\n8. Addition of Dissociated Embryos to Methylcellulose",
    "Using a pipette, add 100 μL of the dissociated 10 embryos to the surface of the prepared methylcellulose with recombinant cytokines and carp serum. Cap lid and vortex gently to fully homogenize sample. Each tube should now contain the dissociated tissue of 10 embryos.\nUsing 3 mL syringes and 16 G needles, aliquot 1 mL of sample into 2 separate 35 mm Petri dishes. Make sure that the sample is fully dispersed throughout the Petri dish. Repeat for each sample.\nPlace 35 mm Petri dishes with cells in methylcellulose into a 15 cm Petri dish. To each 15 cm dish, add one 35 mm Petri plate with 5 mL of sterile water to humidify the samples. Incubate at 32 °C and 5% CO2 for 7 - 10 days.\n9. Visualization of HSPC-derived Colony Forming Units (CFUs)\nAfter incubating 7 days, place samples onto an inverted microscope at 40 - 100X for visualization and enumeration. At this point, individual colonies can be isolated with a pipette and subjected to staining and/or gene analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
