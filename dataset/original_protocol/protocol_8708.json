    "Ethics Statement: Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animal Experiment Committee at the University of Tsukuba.\n1. Preparation of Electrodes and Cables for EEG/EMG Recordings\nPrepare EEG/EMG recording electrode according to the following procedure.\n\tNote: The electrode is disposable and can be used only for 1 animal. Plan carefully the wiring configuration for all connectors. Place marks on the connectors for the correct orientation.\n\t\nSolder each pin of a 4-pin header to a 2-cm stainless steel wire. In brief, hold one end of the wire to the pin, place a hot soldering iron onto the wire-pin joint, and melt some solder to ensure that just enough solder runs smoothly into the joint. Be careful not to apply too much heat to the pin; otherwise, the plastic around the pins will melt.\nSolder the free end of each of 2 wires attached to the pin header to the head of a 1.0-mm-diameter stainless steel screw. In brief, hold the free end of the wire to the thread below the screw head, place a hot soldering iron onto the wire-screw joint, and melt some solder to ensure that just enough solder runs smoothly into the joint. The 2 wires with screws serve as EEG recording electrodes, whereas the 2 wires without screws serve as EMG recording electrodes.\nUse scissors to strip off 1 mm of the insulation at the end of the EMG electrodes to increase the quality of the EMG signal.\nCompletely cover all soldered pins with epoxy adhesive by using a thin wooden stick or tooth pick to reduce the electrical noise during EEG/EMG recordings.\nPrepare a cable for connecting the electrode with the slip ring as described below. This cable can be reused.",
    "Solder each pin of a 4-pin FFC/FPC connector with a wire of a 30-cm flat cable. In brief, hold the stripped end of the wire to the pin, place a hot soldering iron onto the wire-pin joint, and melt some solder to ensure that just enough solder runs smoothly into the joint.\n\t\tNote: Choose the length of the flat cable which is appropriate for the height of the experimental animal cage used for EEG/EMG recordings.\nSolder crimp sockets to a tip of the wires on the other end of the flat cable. In brief, hold a crimp socket to the stripped free end of the wire, place a hot soldering iron onto the wire-socket joint, and melt some solder to ensure that just enough solder runs smoothly into the joint.\nInsert each crimp socket into a 4-position crimp housing.\nCompletely cover the crimp sockets with epoxy adhesive by using a thin wooden stick or tooth pick.\n2. Implantation of Electrodes in the Mouse Head (Duration: Approx. 20 min)\nSterilize all surgical tools in a hot bead sterilizer before the surgery. Anesthetize a male mouse (10 - 20 weeks old, 20 - 30 g) with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). After checking that the mouse is deeply anesthetized by pinching a toe, shave the hair on the head and neck with clippers.\nMove the mouse to the stereotaxic frame, and fix the head between the 2 ear bars. Apply petroleum jelly on the eyes to prevent dryness. Cleanse the shaved-skin with alcohol and cut it along the midline with a scalpel to expose the skull. Clip the skin to keep the surgical area open.",
    "By using a carbide cutter (drill size: 0.8-mm diameter), drill 2 holes into the skull, one over the frontal cortical area (1 mm anterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to the midline) and the other over the parietal area (1 mm anterior to lambda, 1.5 mm lateral to midline) of the right hemisphere, according to stereotaxic coordinates of Paxinos and Franklin.23\nBy using a jeweler's screw driver, place stainless steel EEG recording screws in the holes and make 2 - 2.5 turns for each screw for epidural positioning over the cortex.\n\tNote: Do not insert screws too deep to prevent damage to the brain tissue. Check that the screws are tightly fixed on the skull. This is important to have stable EEG signals during a long period of multiple recordings (typically, more than 1 month). Wiggly screws produce EEG artifacts and may come off before the end of the experimental schedule.\nFix the electrode assembly (cf. Section 1.1, pins turned upward) with instant glue to the skull and cover with dental cement. Make bilaterally small holes with forceps in the trapezius (neck) muscles and insert the stainless steel wires that serve as EMG electrodes into the holes. Suture the skin with a silk thread (0.1 mm diameter) to avoid exposure of the muscle.\nRemove the mouse from the stereotaxic frame. Administer ampicillin (100 mg/kg) and meloxicam (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to the mouse to avoid bacterial infection and to reduce post-surgical pain, respectively. Keep the mouse on a heat pad and monitor it until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. House the mouse individually during recovery to avoid removal of electrodes by other animals, and administer meloxicam (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally on the first day after the surgery.\n3. Recording and Acquiring EEG/EMG Data",
    "After a 1-week recovery period, house each mouse individually in an experimental cage placed in a soundproof recording chamber. Maintain an ambient temperature of 23 ± 1 °C and automatically control cycles of 12-hr light/12-hr dark (lights on at 08:00, illumination intensity ~ 100 lux).\nConnect the EEG/EMG electrode assembly on the mouse head to a recording cable. Ensure that the recording cable is connected to a slip ring (which is designed so that movements of the mouse are not restricted by twisting of the cable) and an EEG/EMG signal amplifier. Filter EEG/EMG signals (EEG, 0.5-64 Hz; EMG, 16-64 Hz), digitize at a sampling rate of 128 Hz by an analog-to-digital converter (A/D) and finally record on a computer running EEG/EMG recording software (Table 'Materials', 4th entry from bottom).\nHabituate the mouse for 2 - 3 days in the recording chamber. If the EEG/EMG recording includes intraperitoneal drug administrations, gently handle the mouse on each habituation day at the time of the drug administration.\nSubsequently, start EEG/EMG recording software (Table 'Materials', 4th entry from bottom).\n\t\nSelect the 'Data file information' tab and click the box next to the file name. Enter a file name and click 'Save'.\nSelect the 'Recording condition' tab and select all EEG/EMG channels which will be recorded.\nSelect the sampling frequency (128 Hz) in the 'Recording condition' tab.\nCheck if the selected channels are displayed properly in the 'Channel information' tab.\nSelect the 'Timer setting' tab and click 'Monitor' to display EEG and EMG.\nCheck if EEG/EMG signals are displayed correctly.\nSelect the 'Timer setting' tab and set the clock time for the beginning and end of the recording in the 'Main Timer' area.\nClick 'Monitor' in the 'Timer setting' tab to start the recording.",
    "Record EEG/EMG signals under baseline (i.e., sleep/wake behavior of a freely behaving mouse) and different treatment conditions (e.g., caffeine administration or sham treatment) over several days. Euthanize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) after the last experimental day.\n4. Scoring of Behavioral State Based on EEG/EMG Data\nStart the software for EEG/EMG analysis (Table 'Materials', 4th entry from bottom). Open the EEG/EMG raw data (.kcd file) produced under the step 3. Click the 'Sleep' tab and select Epoch time. Select 10 sec.\nClick the 'Sleep' tab and select 'Multi-screening' to automatically score all 10-sec epochs into 3 stages (i.e., NREM and REM sleep, and wakefulness) on the basis of the amplitudes of EEG and EMG and power spectral analysis of the EEG.3\nClick 'FFT condition for EEG'.\nSet the parameters for the power spectral analysis [256 datum points (corresponding to 2 sec of the EEG), Hanning window function, and the average of 5 spectra per epoch].3 Click 'OK'.\nClick 'Start Screening' to begin the automatic screening. Open the scored data (.raf file).\nCheck the results of the automatic screening and, if necessary, correct them manually based on the standard criteria (see the Representative Results, Figure 1B and Table 1).2, 3 Briefly, click and hold left mouse button on an incorrectly scored epoch and drag the cursor across the string of incorrectly scored epochs. Release the left mouse button and select the correct behavioral state in the pop-up window.\n\tNote: Occasionally, epochs at the transition between two vigilant states are difficult to score unambiguously to one state. In such cases, the epoch should be scored to the ostensible state and the same criteria should be applied to similar epochs throughout the experiment to ensure data reproducibility.\nSubscription Required.
