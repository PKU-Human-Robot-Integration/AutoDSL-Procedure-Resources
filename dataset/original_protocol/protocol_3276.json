This method is used to induce a sensory dependent motor bias on larval zebrafish for behavior testing at 7 dpf.\nCollect embryos and house at a density of 40-60 individuals per 10 cm Petri dish or 10–20 per 6 cm dish. Embryos should be collected immediately after fertilization and kept in E3 embryo media (see steps 1–3).\nEmbryo media (E3) should be exchanged daily, and all developmentally delayed, dead, or deformed individuals removed.\nAt 48 h post fertilization (hpf) manually dechorionate individuals with dissecting forceps (Fine Science Tools: 11251-10) under a dissecting microscope (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A). All larvae that are damaged in dechorionating should be removed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3046-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

    "(F) Lethality of mounting for unmounted control (N = 175) and mounted (N = 198) larvae. Controls were anesthetized for the same duration as mounted individuals, but not embedded in LMP agarose following. Lethality counts were collected at 7 dpf.\n(G) Same experiment as in (F) examining swim bladder inflation rates. Overinflated represents individuals who float at the surface of the water, underinflated represents individuals who cannot maintain buoyancy, and normal inflation consists of individuals who can freely swim throughout the water column.\nAnaesthetize individuals in 0.1% tricane (Millipore: E10521) dissolved in E3 media for 1–2 min.\nCritical: Only anaesthetize the individuals which are about to be mounted.\nTransfer 5–10 individuals to a new dish in a small drop of embryo media using a Pasteur pipette.\nImmediately apply a thin layer (0.5–1.0 mL) of 1% LMP agarose dissolved in E3 media over the larvae using a 3 mL Pasteur pipette.\nAgar drop should take up about 25% of the dish if immobilizing in a 6 cm dish. Larvae will be submerged in the agar which will provide oxygenation for a short time in the absence of E3 media.\nCritical: Larvae should be returned to E3 media no later than 20 min after being mounted. The agar will begin to dry out and increase lethality.\nUsing microdissection forceps or a p10 micropipette tip, arrange individuals to either have the left, right, or both eyes facing up (towards the lid of the dish) (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nNote: Note: As larval zebrafish conduct ion and oxygen exchange primarily through diffusion at this developmental stage, embedding is not detrimental.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nIndividuals should be arranged with adequate spacing. A minimum of 3–4 mm between individuals is sufficient which will help prevent fish losses.",
    "Agarose should be a thin layer (∼2–4 mm deep) as the individuals are arranged. This requires the LMP agarose to be used to embed individuals kept at ∼50–55 C. If the agar is too cool before embedding, it will solidify before individuals can be positioned.\nAfter agarose completely solidifies (∼3 min at room temperature(20°C–22°C)) refill the dish with E3 and move to incubator prepped for visual experience exposure (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C) (See steps 8–12).\nNote: Note: E3 volume added should be enough to completely submerge the agar drops.\nMounted individuals should be placed on the dark surface in the prepped incubator beneath the light for 48 h with E3 media exchanged daily.\nNote: Note: The agar used will be attached to the surface of the dish so E3 can be exchanged by decanting all media from the dish into a liquid waste container and completely refilling with fresh media. Dead individuals should be removed immediately using a pipette to remove the entire surrounding section of agar and dead larva.\nIndividuals should be removed from agar between 96-100 hpf. Using p10 micropipette tip or dissecting forceps, cut an outline along the individual until enough agar is removed for the larva to escape (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]D).\nCritical: Make sure to avoid contact with the pectoral fins, jaw, and eyes to prevent damage.\nAfter removal from LMP agarose, individuals should be kept at low density (∼20 larvae per 6 cm dish) and in shallow E3 (15–20 mL for a 6 cm dish) to promote swim bladder inflation. Mounted individuals should be allowed a minimum of 48 h recovery before moving on to behavior testing.\nMounting zebrafish in low melting temperature agarose from 4-6 dpf\nTiming: 4 days for collecting and raising larvae, 1–2 h for mounting (dependent on number of individuals mounted)",
    "This section describes the protocol to embed larvae at a later developmental point compared to the previous major step. Larvae exposed to asymmetric visual stimulus during this period will not have an imposed sensory dependent motor bias as the critical period for this behavior has closed.\nComplete steps 2 and 3 (See section: mounting zebrafish in low melting temperature agarose from 2-4 dpf[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]).\nRemove any individuals without normally inflated swim bladders.\nBy 4 dpf larvae should have naturally broken out of their chorion. The media should be thoroughly cleaned to prevent debris from occluding the mouth during mounting. Larvae can proceed to the next step at 96–100 hpf.\nAnaesthetize individuals in 0.1% tricaine dissolved in E3 media for 1–2 min.\nCritical: Only individuals about to be mounted should be anaesthetized.\nTransfer 1–5 individuals to a new dish in a small drop of E3 media.\nComplete steps 6 and 7 (See section mounting zebrafish in low melting temperature agarose from 2-4 dpf[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]).\nNote: Note: Larvae with swim bladders will float towards the surface of the agar. Ensure that the larvae are flat against the dish when the agar solidifies by gently pushing them back down with a p10 micropipette tip or microdissection forceps in the agar drop as it cools.\nAfter agar solidifies, use a p10 micropipette tip or microdissection forceps to remove agar surrounding the mouth and head making sure not to damage the eyes or pectoral fins (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]E).\nNote: Note: This is to allow for adequate oxygenation and ion exchange.\nAfter agar solidifies, move mounted individuals to incubator as in step 10.\nExchange E3 media daily and remove dead individuals from agar as in step 10.",
    "Individuals should be removed from agar at 140–144 hpf. These should be left to recover for at least 48 h following removal from agar before moving to behavior testing.\nFollowing 7 dpf, larvae expend the nutrients in their yolk. Larvae should be fed with dry food in their petri dish at 7 and 8 dpf by using a micro spatula (Grainer: 21RL37) once a day.\nScoop up a small amount of food (∼1/32 tbsp) and dip just beneath the surface of E3 media. The dry food will disperse across the surface of the media and be adequate for feeding.\nLarvae should be allowed to feed for ∼1 h and then food should be cleaned from the dish using a Pasteur pipette.\nLarvae can proceed to behavior testing at 8 dpf.\nBehavior testing\nTiming: 30 min for set-up, 15 min per tracking series\nThis section outlines the behavior protocol to observe zebrafish in an open environment where external illumination is taken away. The behavior rig and software described previously (See “software setup[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.7]” section) will be used to track zebrafish at 7 dpf throughout this stimulus series.\nOn the day of behavior testing, all individuals with over/under -inflated swim bladders should be removed along with any larvae that are dead or deformed (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3G; Lethality, Control, n = 182, alive = 96.2%; Mounted n = 77 alive = 97.4%; Swim bladder inflation, Control n = 168 Normal inflation = 84.5%, Overinflated = 1.2%, Underinflated = 14.3%. Mounted n = 196 Normal inflation = 72.4%, Overinflated = 3.6%, Underinflated = 24.0%).",
    "Note: Note: Prior to behavior testing, larvae should be acclimated to the room where behavior testing will take place (∼15 min). If behavior testing is taking place in a dark room, larvae should be placed on a light box with an intensity similar to standard housing conditions.\nThe behavior rig needs to be turned on and IR needs at least 15 min to warm up to ensure consistent results.\nPetri dishes should be filled about halfway with 40 μm filtered E3 media. Filtering media can be completed with a cell strainer (Corning: 352340).\nNote: Note: Filtering removes particulate that could create noise artefacts during tracking.\nOpen up software ‘EventTimer.sav’ and load the following scripts (can be renamed) into separate tabs. These scripts are located at “C:/Daqtimer/scripts/”.\n173_explore_setparams_multiplex: Used to orient dishes and visualize contrast of behavior arena.\nMp4x_t4: Used for light stimulus and tracking using a four-dish multiplexed setup.\nLight Test: Used to test if light turns on and off.\nNote: Note: For complete documentation on eventtimer and each program see supplemental folder (https://doi.org/10.17632/gmknc9wvwt.1) “instructions and powerpoints”.\nAlign dishes to even quadrants for multiplex tracking using the grid provided in 173_explore_setparams_multiplex script. Dishes should be clear of the guidelines that separate quadrants in the camera view and edges of the camera view (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A and 10B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3046-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

    "(A) This is the window that appears when you open Cplot. Areas highlighted in red must use the value depicted in the figure. Image size set to 980 because the camera is opened to view a 980 × 980 pixel window when tracking larvae. Expected points per file is set to 290 because tracking 10 points per second for 29 s produces 290 points. Minimum points per file is set to 100 because tracking files where less than 100 points were acquired should be excluded. Trace size is set to 10 as this is an interpolation distance used to calculate metrics obtained later in the protocol (See step 35). Cyan inlay depicts the “Location inside” values needed to input for specific quadrants when analyzing data (See step 38).\nNote: Note: The camera will need to be adjusted to align with the dishes properly. The command that opens the camera (WATCH) needs to be adjusted to do this. The standard input for the watch function is found in the “Help” menu at the top of Eventtimer. WATCH: x position, x width, y position, y width, exposure, gain\nIn the example script, the watch function opens up a window that is 980 × 980 pixels and shifted 250 pixels in the x direction with exposure and gain set to 25.00 ms and 15 a.u., respectively.\nPlace 1 larva in each dish.\nAdjust aperture and f-stop on lens to focus on fish and create a clear equally contrasted viewing plane. See step 22.\nEnsure light works by using the “Light Test” script. The light will turn on for 1 s, off for a second, and back on.\nOpen up “Mp4x_t4” (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C).\nChange TRACKDIR to the path where you would like tracking files to go.",
    "Click run and wait for console dialog to disappear.\nNote: Note: The tracking file size is ∼10kb per fish (i.e., 4 fish being tracked = 40 kb).\nNote: Note: The default location for this is C:/Data/. As the tracking begins you will see the guidelines appear on the white screen denoting the four quadrants being tracked. As each individual periodically moves, a black line will be drawn to indicate their path every second. When the guidelines disappear the tracking period has ended.\nRemove fish from dishes and repeat.\nNote: Note: For multiple runs the tracking file names will need to be changed. Each run will take 14 min to complete.\nData output\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the general process of collecting numerical output on the trajectory metrics obtained from behavior testing. For this section IDL is required where we will use the programs cplot, and batchan to compute various trajectory metrics from tracking files obtained from behavior testing.\nOpen “Cplot” (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]) and load in tracking directory using File >> Select Input\nSet Trace Size to 10.\nNote: Note: This is an interpolation distance for the path taken during the tracking period. Lower numbers will include more data points but be noisier while higher values will include less data points and become inaccurate.\nSet Min pts/file to 100.\nNote: Note: Our tracking program gathers data points for 29 s at a framerate of 10 Hz totaling 290 points. We typically exclude any tracking files with less than 100 acquired points.\nSet image size to 980.\nNote: Note: The “WATCH” command in the Mp4x_t4 script opens up a 980 × 980 window for tracking so this becomes the image size.",
    "For each dish you will need to run a separate analysis for each quadrant, representing a single dish. Use the following parameters for the “Location inside” box for each quadrant (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A).\nTop left (A): 0,490,490,980.\nTop right (B): 490,980,490,980.\nBottom left (C): 10,490,10,490.\nBottom right (D): 490,980,0,490.\nNote: Note: This is inverse to the view for tracking.
