    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1\nTissue harvesting\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section details the collection of mammary tumors for individual downstream analysis.\nSterilize surfaces, forceps, scalpels, and surgical scissors with 70% ethanol.\nEuthanize the mouse using CO2\nDissect mammary tumors:\nPlace mouse on its back, stretch-out and pin-down on all four limbs.\nSpray the abdomen with 70% ethanol and wipe-off excess liquid.\nUse forceps and a surgical scissor to make an incision extending from the bottom of the abdomen to the thorax. Extend the incision along the limbs to create an x-shape.\nNote: Avoid piercing the peritoneum as the mammary tumors are located between the skin and the peritoneum.\nSeparate the skin from the peritoneum to expose the tumors. Using two forceps, gently pull the skin to the sides and use a scalpel to separate it from the abdomen if necessary. Pin down the stretched-out skin.\nUsing a scalpel, dissect all individual mammary tumors and the surrounding mammary fat pad.\nCritical: Early-stage nodules may be peeled off the skin by gentle pulling. If tumors have grown into the skin, do not forcefully detach them, but collect a wider range of tissue to contain disseminated cancer cells.\nNote: A tail or ear biopsy may be collected from the animal to verify the genotyping results.\nContinue with downstream processing:\nPrepare paraffin and/or OCT frozen tissue blocks with 1–2 pieces (3–5 mm in diameter) of tumors from individual mammary tumors as described in the study by Lüönd and Sugiyama et al. (Luond et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). These blocks can be stored at room temperature (around 25°C) and at −80°C, respectively, and used for staining later.\nFor the tumor slice culture and/or single-cell isolation, follow the protocols described below in part 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] and part 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3], respectively.",
    "Note: MMTV-PyMT mice develop multiple tumors in all mammary fat pads. Early and late-stage lesions will be present at harvest. To account for tumor heterogeneity, collect tumors from multiple locations (e.g., center and periphery as well as solid and soft areas) for sliced tissue culture and for 5 cell RNAseq.\nPart 2\nTumor slicing\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the preparation of mammary tumor slices for live-cell imaging using a vibrating blade microtome instrument such as the Leica VT 1200S vibratome (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1710-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of agarose blocks for tissue slicing using a vibratome\n(A) Schematic illustration of the preparation of fresh tissue-embedded agarose blocks for tumor slicing. Mammary tumors are collected from transgenic EMT lineage tracing mouse models. 3–5 tumor pieces (around 5 × 5 × 5 mm in size) are collected from individual tumors and kept on ice. Using a 10 mL syringe, 3% agarose solution is poured into a Peel-A-Way histology mold to make a thin layer of agarose (agarose bed). Once agarose has solidified, a piece of tumor is placed on the agarose bed and agarose solution is added over the top of tumor piece in the mold until the tissue is entirely covered (fully embedded).\n(B) Schematic illustration of the relative positions of the sample on specimen disc and a blade as well as approaching direction of the blade for tissue slicing using a vibratome. Of note, the location of the tumor piece embedded in the agarose gels should be in close proximity to the blade to increase the stability during slicing.\nUsing a scalpel, collect 3 to 5 small pieces of tumors (3–5 mm diameter) from individual mammary tumors. Gently remove excess adipose tissue from the tumor pieces and keep them in DMEM/F12 medium placed on ice.",
    "Embed tumors in 3% low-melting agarose (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A):\nUsing a 10 mL syringe, put warm (≈ 37°C) 3% low-melting agarose solution (in sterile PBS, ≈ 1–2 mL) in a Peel-A-Way histology mold to make a thin layer of agarose.\nPlace the mold on ice. Agarose will solidify in 5 min.\nOnce agarose has solidified, place one piece of tumor on top of agarose. The mold should be kept on ice.\nAdd agarose solution (≈ 5–6 mL) over the top of tumor piece in the mold until the tissue is entirely covered.\nCover with aluminum foil and keep on ice until slicing.\nSet up the Leica VT 1200S vibrating blade microtome:\nPut a blade into blade holder with an Allen wrench.\nUsing an Allen wrench, rotate the blade to the clearance angle −18°.\nOptimize the position of the blade using the VibroCheck.\nAfter the optimization, secure the blade into the blade holder.\nPop the embedded tissue out of the mold.\nSpray the specimen disc and buffer tray of the Leica VT 1200S vibratome with 70% ethanol and wipe-off excess liquid.\nGlue the face of the upper side of the agarose block directly to the specimen disc. The embedded tumor that was at the bottom of the mold will now be on top (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The glue dries in 3–5 min.\nPlace the buffer tray into the ice holder of the Leica VT 1200S vibratome. Add ice into the ice holder and fill the buffer tray with ice-cold sterile PBS.\nOnce the sample embedded in agarose has completely adhered to the specimen disc, place the disc into the buffer tray.\nSet the ice tray onto the vibratome stand and lock the tray in place by moving the lever to the right.",
    "Using an Allen wrench, rotate the blade into cutting position with the clearance angle −18°.\nUsing the control pad, raise the stage up until the blade touches the surface of the agarose gel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nSet the cutting conditions using the control pad:\nSet cutting window.\nSet section thickness (auto feed, 250–350 μm), amplitude (1–2 mm) and speed (0.1–1.0 mm/s).\nUntil the blade reaches the tissue, run the vibratome at 1.0 mm/s speed.\nAdjust settings on the vibratome depending on the consistency and integrity of the tissue. In most cases, cut the tumors at amplitude 2 mm, speed 0.1 mm/s.\nOnce uniform slices are obtained, gently scoop them out of the bath using spatulas or forceps. Clean spatulas and forceps with 70% ethanol prior to use.\nTransfer them into a 6-well plate containing 2–3 mL of ice-cold DMEM/F12 medium and place the plate on ice. Slices from one piece of tumor can be collected into the same well.\nNote: Sliced tumors can be stored for up to 3 h on ice. However, it is recommended to keep them on ice for as short as possible.\nStaining of the slices\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the staining of mammary tumor slices with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for live-cell imaging.\nScoop up one slice from each piece of tumor using a sterile spatula. Place each one slice into one well of a 24-well plate.\nAdd 300 μL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 medium for breast tumor slice tissue containing Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibody (for example, Alexa Fluor 647 anti-mouse CD31, 1:50) and incubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: Tissues can be incubated with a combination of fluor-conjugated antibodies based on your needs. We have not tested indirect immunofluorescence staining so far.",
    "During the incubation time, prepare a plate for imaging the slice tissue culture. Place one Millicell Cell Culture insert into each well of a 24-well imaging plate using sterile forceps.\nPipette 300 μL of DMEM/F12 medium for breast tumor slice tissue into the well and 50 μL into the insert.\nAfter staining, wash the tissue slices by transferring them twice through separate wells containing 500 μL of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 medium for breast tumor slice tissue using forceps.\nUsing forceps, gently transfer one slice onto one cell culture insert. Once transferred, use a spatula to gently spread the slice to ensure it lays completely flat on the cell insert membrane.\nIf necessary, remove excess media from the insert to the outer well to avoid floating and folding of the slice in the insert. Media will eventually equilibrate on its own. The tissue slices are kept at an interface of air and culture media.\nCritical: To avoid evaporation during imaging, use the middle rows in the plate for the slice tissue cultures and add sterile water or PBS to one row of wells on each of the four surrounding sides. If more than 8 wells are needed for culture, fill the spaces between wells with sterile water or PBS.\nLive-cell imaging\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis section describes live-cell imaging of mammary tumor slices using a spinning disc confocal microscope (Visitron Systems) to track morphological and behavioral dynamics of partial and full EMT cells within the tumor microenvironment.\nSwitch on all components of the spinning disc confocal microscope and turn on the computer.\nSet up the incubation chamber (Okolab) at 37°C with 5% CO2, 90 ± 5% humidity at least 30 min prior to imaging.\nSwitch on the individual lasers by turning on the keys.\nStart VisiView Premier Image acquisition Software.",
    "Place the imaging plate containing the tissue culture inserts on the microscope stage.\nSet up the live-cell imaging using a spinning disc confocal microscope with a CFI Plan Apo 20×, 0.75 NA objective, a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 V2 CMOS camera, a Yokogawa Spinning Disk.\nOpen “Acquisition” panel, set up the exposure time for every channel and pixel binning as “2”.\nGo to “Wavelength” tab and tick “Wavelength series” box. Select the number of channels and lasers that should be active during acquisition.\nGo to “Time-lapse” tab and tick “time-lapse series” box. Set up the time interval and the duration of the acquisition. For tissue slices, we set up 1–2.5 h interval for up to 3 days.\nTurn on the Perfect Focus System (PFS) controller.\nTo maintain the focus, tick “Autofocus always on” box and select “Autofocus on during waiting” option.\nNote: PFS automatically maintains microscope focus on the region of interest during live-cell imaging. However, it can interfere with the acquisition of Z-stacks as it will start racing after the piezo stage if it is active during Z-stack acquisition. Therefore, PFS should be active before scanning each setting point and off during Z-stack acquisition.\nGo to “Z-series” tab and tick the “Z-plane series” box. Manually define a plane of interest to set “Home position” and then set “Top Offset” and “Bottom Offset” for region of interest.\nGo to “Stage” tab and set multiple XYZ points. We recommend to set 2–4 positions per slice to obtain images of different regions of the tumor.\nSave the setting for multidimensional live-cell imaging. These can be re-loaded for use at a later time.\nClick “sequence” to start live-cell imaging of the slices.",
    "Critical: During long-term imaging of the tissue, pause the image acquisition at every 24 h and carefully replace the medium in the wells with fresh pre-warmed medium using a 200 μL pipette with long tips. Do not touch the slices in the cell culture inserts.\nNote: Examples of live cell imaging of early and late EMT mammary tumor cells are shown in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] (Representative time lapse movie of mammary tumor slice tissue culture with migrating GFP+ partial EMT tumor cells) and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] (Representative time lapse movie of mammary tumor slice tissue culture with migrating GFP+ full EMT tumor cells).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

Timings of the protocols in part 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] are adjusted for processing the pooled tissue of all mammary tumors and the adjacent mammary fat pad from one mouse (1–2 mg wet weight). If processing samples from multiple mice, the timing will increase accordingly.\nNote: We suggest selecting tumor pieces from multiple individual tumors with different morphology to account for tumor heterogeneity for sliced tissue culture and frozen tissue/paraffin embedding. The remaining tumor tissue and surrounding mammary fat pad is then pooled for digestion and single cell isolation for RNA sequencing. Hence several tumor samples are being used per mouse to generate sufficient single cells for RNA sequencing.\nNote: The maximum number of mice to handle at the same time is 2 for an experienced researcher to avoid compromising the quality and viability of the cells.\nCritical: For negative controls and single stain control samples required for compensation, collect the mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT, MMTV-PyMT/RC::FrePe/Tnc-CreERT2 or MMTV-PyMT/RC::FrePe/Cdh2-CreERT2 mice and prepare single-cell suspensions. In these mice, none of the cells express mCherry or GFP. Negative control cells can be frozen in FBS containing 10% DMSO as cryomedium and stored in liquid nitrogen.\nPrepare 10 mL collagenase/trypsin solution and DNase solution per mouse and store it on ice.",
    "Note: Once tumor pieces were selected for sliced tissue culture and OCT/paraffin block preparation, pool all remaining mammary tumors from an individual mouse.

In our partial and full EMT lineage tracing mouse models, mCherry labels breast cancer cells and GFP labels breast cancer cells that have ever undergone either partial or full EMT. Cells expressing both mCherry and GFP are cells just undergoing an EMT (transitioning cells). In this protocol, based on the expression of GFP or mCherry in combination with the epithelial marker EpCAM expression, we focus on the sorting of breast cancer cells in different stages of the EMT spectrum for further RNA sequencing.\nNote: All the steps from this section should be performed at 4°C.\nCritical: The time from tissue harvesting to 5-cell sorting should be kept as short as possible.

Gating strategy for the sorting of GFP+ partial and full EMT cells derived from mammary tumors by flow cytometry\nSchematic representation of the gating strategy for flow cytometry used to sort GFP+ tumor cells from Tnc-CreERT2 and Cdh2-CreERT2 mice treated with Tamoxifen. Tumor cells are separated from debris by Forward Scatter Area (FSC-A)/Side Scatter Area (SSC-A), and doublets and aggregates are excluded by FSC-A and FSC-height (FSC-H) dot plots. Living Lin- cells are selected by gates on the negative fractions for Draq7 and BV650 Streptavidin (biotinylated-CD31, CD45, and Ter119).

    "Note: The sorted cells are further applied to 5-cell sorting. We assume that more than 50% of the sorted cells will be lost during this 2nd sorting step. In addition, the number of cells returned from the sorter could differ from the actual number of sorted cells. We recommend to set up the number of events for sorting 5–10 times bigger than of what is aimed at for collection of 5-cell pools, if possible.\nNote: In the mammary tumors, we estimate only 0.13% and 0.002% of cancer cells to be partial and full EMT cells, respectively, that are marked as GFP+ cells.

Inspect the plate lid to see where a drop was deposited.\nWipe the lid dry and place it back onto the stage.\nAdjust the Home location if the drop did not hit the center of the well.\nRepeat e to g until the drop is centered appropriately.\nClick arrow buttons to move the tray.",
    "Set up new Home position and check the location of drop deposition as above. We recommend to check one row of wells on each of the four sides of the plate.\nNote: Large arrows move the tray by five steps. Small arrows move the tray by one step.\nClean a tissue culture hood with RNaseZap and DNA decontamination reagent before preparing a MicroAmp® Fast 96-Well Reaction Plate for 5-cell sorting. Clean pipettes with RNaseZap. Wipe-off excess liquid.\nPipette 2.3 μL of 0.2% TX-100 in PBS containing 2 U/μL RNase inhibitor into each well of a 96-well plate and store it on ice. Cover plate with RNAse free plate seal.\nNote: Choose a type of 96-well plate that is compatible with robot for RNA sequencing library preparation.\nClean the stage in the sorting chamber of FACSAria IIIc with RNaseZap.\nInstall the plate with well A1 toward the front of the stage.\nNote: Sorting starts on the front left corner of the device (A1), and proceeds from front to back, and then from left to right, sorting in a serpentine motion. Thus, for a plate, sorting proceeds from well A1–A12, B12–B1, C1–C12, and so on.\nInsert the sample tube in the sample injection chamber of the sorter. In this protocol, 3 tubes for mCherry+, 4 tubes for GFP+ and 1 tube for double-positive populations will be sorted consecutively.\nSelect target wells for 5-cell sorting.\nStart acquisition and sort 5 cells per well of the MicroAmp® Fast 96-Well Reaction Plate.\nRepeat for every pre-sorted cell population.\nAfter sorting, seal the plate with an adhesive plate seal and spin down.\nPlace the plate in a box containing dry ice. Store the plate at −80°C as soon as possible until preparing libraries for RNA sequencing.",
    "Note: One sorting droplet for one cell is ranging from 0.001 μL to 0.005 μL. Therefore, total volume in one well would remain around 2.3 μL after sorting.\n5-Cell RNA sequencing\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis section describes the major steps for the preparation of RNA sequencing libraries according to the Smart-seq2 method (Picelli et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) using the low-volume liquid-handling robot Mosquito HV system (SPT Labtech).\nSpray the 96-well plate containing 5-cell pools and a cooling rack with RNaseZap and remove the seal. Place the plate on the rack on ice.\nPrepare the annealing mixture by combining (per 96-well plate) 90 μL H2O, 10 μL oligo-dT primer (10 μM) and 100 μL dNTP mix (10 mM each). Add 2 μL annealing mix to the 5-cell pool in lysis buffer per well using the Mosquito HV liquid-handling robot.\nCover the plate with an adhesive seal, vortex briefly and spin down.\nIncubate the plate at 72°C for 3 min. Centrifuge at 700 × g for 1 min. Transfer the plate back on ice immediately afterward.\nPrepare reverse transcription (RT) reaction mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1710_10.csv\nAdd 5.7 μL of RT mix to the samples. The final reaction volume per well is 10 μL.\nCover the plate with an adhesive seal, vortex briefly and spin down.\nRun the RT reaction following the program below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1710_11.csv\nPrepare PCR mix for cDNA amplification.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1710_12.csv\nAdd 15 μL of PCR mix to each well.\nCover the plate with an adhesive seal, vortex briefly and spin down.\nRun PCR to amplify the cDNA.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1710_13.csv\nPause point: The cDNA can be stored at −20°C for 6 months or longer.\nBefore starting the purification of cDNA, equilibrate Ampure XP beads at room temperature for 15 min, and then vortex thoroughly to ensure that the beads are properly suspended in the buffer.",
    "Add 16.25 μL of Ampure XP beads (0.65× ratio) to each well of the 96-well plate.\nCover the plate with an adhesive seal, vortex briefly and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nPlace the 96-well plate on the magnetic stand for 5 min.\nWash the beads with 200 μL of 80% (vol/vol) ethanol solution twice.\nAfter removing the washing solution, leave the plate at room temperature for approximately 5 min until the beads have dried completely.\nAdd 22 μL of EB solution to each well and mix 10 times with the pipet to resuspend the beads.\nIncubate the plate off the magnet for 2 min at room temperature.\nPlace the plate back on the magnet for 2 min or longer.\nTransfer 20 μL of supernatant containing clean cDNA into a new 96-well plate.\nPause point: The clean cDNA can be stored at −20°C for 6 months or longer.\nEvaluate the quality of the cDNA. Following the manufacturer’s instruction[href=http://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/quick-guide-dnf-474-hs-ngs-fragment-kit-SD-AT000134.pdf], analyze the size distribution of the cDNA using a HS NGS Fragment Kit on an Agilent Fragment Analyzer Instrument.\nNote: A good quality cDNA preparation should be almost free of small fragments (<500 bp) and should peak at ∼1.5–2 kb.\nMeasure the concentration of cDNA generated from each sample using PicoGreen.\nNormalize cDNA to a concentration of 0.1–0.15 ng/μL in nuclease-free water.\nPrepare DNA libraries using Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). 0.75 μL of normalized cDNA is used in a miniaturized 15% volume (3 μL total) Nextera tagmentation reaction. Miniaturized reactions are set up in a 384-well plate. Volumes of the following steps are adjusted accordingly. For the detailed information on the Nextera XT kit, refer to the manufacturer’s manual[href=http://genome.med.harvard.edu/documents/libraryPrep/IlluminaNexteraXTProtocol.pdf]. A Mosquito HV liquid-handling robot is used for pipetting.\nPause point: The final libraries can be stored at −20°C.",
