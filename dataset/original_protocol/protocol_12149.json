    "All the procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee CEEA Val de Loire Number 19 and were performed in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Oocyte Collection and In Vitro Maturation\nOvum pick-up\nDaily assess by ultrasound the diameter of ovarian follicles in a cohort of adult mares. At the emergence of a follicle ≥33 mm (dominant follicle), inject the mare with 1,500 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in the upper part of the jugular vein (i.v.).\n\t\t\nBefore performing the injection, swab the area with alcohol, locate the jugular furrow, and place the thumb 2-3 cm under the site of injection to induce the vein to rise. Insert the needle almost parallel to the neck and aspirate to make sure that the needle is in the vein (the blood will enter the syringe). At this point, inject; hCG will induce the maturation of the oocyte in the dominant follicle.\n35 h after the hCG injection, sedate the mare with detomidine (15 µg/kg, i.v.), butorphanol tartrate (10 µg/kg, i.v.) and butylscopolamine bromure (0.2-0.3 mg/kg, 15 mL/mare, i.v.).\nConnect the needle to the ultrasound probe. Insert the ultrasound probe vaginally and hold the ovary transrectally to face the ultrasound probe. Instruct one operator to maneuver the needle and the other to hold the ovary in place, with the follicle facing the ultrasound probe. Start from the ovary with the dominant follicle.\nPuncture the vaginal wall and the wall of the dominant follicle with the needle (ultrasound probes for OPU are equipped with a channel for the needle connected to a suction system); theneedle will be visible in the echographic image.",
    "Aspirate the follicular fluid in a 50-mL conical tube connected to the suction system. Pour the content of the conical tube into a large petri dish and search for the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) using a stereomicroscope.\nSince the COC is not always retrieved with the follicular fluid, flush the follicle with Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing 5 IU/mL heparinat 37 °C. Examine DPBS for COC presence, as previously described for the follicular fluid in step 1.1.5. Flush several times until the COC is retrieved.\nOnce the COC from the dominant follicle is retrieved, puncture and flush the follicles ≥5 and ≤25 mm, as described for the dominant follicle in steps 1.1.3-1.1.4; follicles ≥5 and ≤25 do not express luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR), and therefore, their oocytes will not mature in response to hCG and will be collected at GV stage (immature). Only keep COCs with several complete layers of cumulus cells and brown, finely-granulated ooplasm. Discard the others.\nAt the end of the OPU, inject the mare with benzyl-penicillin 15,000 IU/animal to prevent infection.\nHouse the mare in a quiet, clean stable for at least 2 h. Check signs of awareness by determining the position of the ears, reaction to stimuli (e.g., noise), and gait before returning the mare to the company of other animals.\nIn vitro maturation\nWarm HEPES-buffered TCM199 (20 mM Hepes) supplemented with 1,790 IU/L heparin, 0.4% bovine serum albumin (BSA), penicillin, and streptomycin to 37 °C. Prepare this medium in advance. Filter-sterilize and keep it at 4 °C for up to 6 months.",
    "Prepare the IVM medium by supplementing NaHCO3-buffered TCM199 (25 mM NaHCO3) with 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 20% calf serum7. Use NaHCO3-buffered TCM199 within 3 weeks of opening a new bottle. Prepare the EGF in advance as 100x stocks, freeze it at -20 °C, and use it within 6 months. Dispense 500 µL in the wells of a 4-well dish and incubate in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 38.5 °C for at least 2 h.\nAfter the retrieval of the COCs from the ≥5 and ≤25 mm follicles, put them in a petri dish (3.5-cm diameter) filled with 2 mL of HEPES-TCM199. Move the COCs to different areas of the dish in order to wash away the cellular debris.\nTransfer the COCs to the IVM medium and incubate for 28 h in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 38.5 °C.\n2. Immunofluorescence and Image Analysis\nChromosome count\nAfter collection from the dominant follicle or at the end of IVM, incubate the COCs with 100 µM monastrol for 1 h in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 38.5 °C. Prepare monastrol in advance as 100x stocks and store it at -20 °C for up to 1 year.\nRemove the cumulus cells by treating them with 0.5% hyaluronidase or by gently pipetting; remove the zona pellucida by treating it in 0.2% pronase. Prepare hyaluronidase and pronase in advance as 10x stocks and store them at -20 °C for up to 1 year.\nFix the oocytes in 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 15 min at 38.5 °C followed by a further 45 min at 4 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION! Wear personal protective equipment when handling paraformaldehyde, and dispose of contaminated materials in accordance with hazardous waste disposal guidelines.",
    "Wash the oocytes by sequentially transferring in 3 wells filled with 500 µL of DPBS supplemented with 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Permeabilize in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\nBlock non-specific bindingby incubation in DPBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (DPBS-1%BSA) and 10% normal donkey serum for at least 30 min at RT. Samples can be kept in blocking solution at 4 °C for 3-4 days.\nFor primary staining, incubate the oocytes in rabbit anti-Aurora B phospho-Thr232 in DPBS supplemented with 1% BSA (dilution 1:50) at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the oocytes as described in step 2.1.4. Incubate the oocytes in a solution of tetra-methylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 in DPBS-1% BSA) for 1 h at RT in the dark.\nWash the oocytes as described in step 2.1.4, and then place 3-4 oocytes in a drop of non-hardening, anti-fade mounting medium supplemented with 20 µM YOPRO1 on a glass slide. Repeat the procedure until all the oocytes are mounted (3-4 oocytes per slide).\nAllow the oocytes to settle for about 10 min in the mounting medium, and then cover them with a coverslip. To avoid crushing the oocytes, apply two strips of double-sided tape before laying the coverslip on the glass slide.\n\t\tNOTE: This precaution will also ensure that all the samples are equally compressed between the glass slide and the coverslip. Glass slides can be frozen at -20 °C and imaged during the following 2-3 days.\nImage the samples on a confocal laser scanning microscope with a 60X objective using the red (centromeres) and green (chromosomes) channels7,13,14,20,21. Scan the samples spanning the whole metaphasic plate on the z-axis, with steps every 0.35 µm. Save the digitalized images of every single plan.",
    "Count the centromeres in serial confocal sections using the cell count function of the NIH ImageJ software (available at: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html).\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid a repeated count of centromeres that appear on adjacent sections by identifying the centromeres that appear, stay, and disappear in sequential sections with a numeric code.\nRepeat the chromosomal counting in step 2.1.11 with an independent operator.\n\t\tNOTE: Classify the oocytes as euploid (32 chromosomes), hyperploid (>32), or hypoploid (<32).\nSpindle morphology and histone acetylation\nAfter collection from the dominant follicle or at the end of the IVM, remove the cumulus cells by treatment in 0.5% hyaluronidase or by gentle pipetting, as described in step 2.1.2.\nWash the oocytes in DPBS-PVA, as in step 2.1.4, and fix them in 2.5% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 38 °C. Extensively wash, as described in step 2.1.4, and permeabilize in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: Wear personal protective equipment when handling paraformaldehyde and dispose of contaminated materials in accordance with hazardous waste disposal guidelines.\nBlock non-specific bindingby incubation in DPBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin (DPBS - 2%BSA), 0.05% saponin, and 10% normal donkey serum for 2 h at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples can be kept in blocking solution at 4 °C for 3 - 4 days.\nFor primary staining, incubate the oocytes in mouse anti-alpha-tubulin (1:150) and rabbit anti-acH4K16 (1:250) in DPBS-2% BSA with 0.05% saponin at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the oocytes as in step 2.1.4. Incubate the oocytes in a solution of green fluorescent dye-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500) and TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) in DPBS-2% BSA with 0.05% saponin for 1 h at RT in the dark.",
    "Wash the oocytes as in step 2.1.4, and then place 3-4 oocytes in a drop of the non-hardening, anti-fade mounting medium supplemented with 1 µg/mL 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) on a glass slide.\nMount the oocytes on glass slides as described in step 2.1.8.\nImage the samples on a confocal laser scanning microscope with a 60x objective using the red (acH4K16), green (alpha-tubulin), and blue (DNA) channels.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the laser settings for the red and blue channels constant throughout the acquisition of all the samples. Scan the samples spanning the whole meiotic spindle and metaphasic plate on the z-axis, with steps every 0.35 µm. Save the digitalized images (single plans and projected 3D image).\nMeasure the pole-to-pole spindle length and the spindle diameter at the maximum width on the projected image using the measurement function of the NIH ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html). Repeat each 3 times and calculate the mean.\nQuantify the relative fluorescence of acH4K16 using the integrated density function of the NIH ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html). Normalize it for the integrated density of the DAPI staining.\n3. Analysis of mRNA Expression\nAfter the COCs have been retrieved from the 5 to 25 mm follicles, collect the granulosa cell suspension that remained in the Petri dish and wash it twice in cold DPBS by centrifuging at 10,600 x g for 2 min. Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store the samples at -80 °C for up to 6 months; the cells will serve for the standard curve.\nCarefully remove all the cumulus cells, as described in step 2.1.2, from immature (GV), in vitro matured, and in vivo matured oocytes.",
    "Wash the oocytes, as described in 2.1.4, in DPBS-PVA, collect them singly in 1 µL volumes, and lay 2 µL RNALater on top. Snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store the samples at -80 °C for up to 6 months.\nAdd 2 pg of Luciferase RNA to each sample as a spike-in. Pool the oocytes 2 x 2 and extract the total RNA using a silica membrane filter-based kit suitable to recover RNA from small samples.\nReverse-transcribe the RNA in 10 µL with 0.25 µg random hexamers and mouse Moloney leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 37 °C. Store the samples at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\nDilute the cDNA from the granulosa cells in RNAse-free water to 50 ng/µL. Serially dilute this solution 1:10 to obtain 5 ng/µL, 0.5 ng/µL, 0.05 ng/µL, and 0.005 ng/µL solutions.\nAssemble reactions in triplicate in a total volume of 20 µL per reaction using cDNA equivalent to 0.05 oocytes as the substrate, or 5 µL of the serial dilutions of granulosa cell cDNA, 10 µL of SYBR green supermix, and 0.3 µM of each specific primer (Table 1).\nRun the reaction in a thermal cycler using a 3-step protocol: 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, repeated 40 times. Finally, acquire the melting curve, starting from 60 °C, and increase the temperature by 0.5 °C every 20 s up to 95 °C.\nAssess the starting quantity (SQ) of the specific mRNA in the oocyte samples using the standard curve15 calculated based on the granulosa cell sample. Express the data as the ratio between the SQ of the gene of interest and the SQ of the housekeeping genes.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
