Previously amplified and purified pCMV-VCP plasmids are transfected into H1299 cells using PEI, and allow VCP to express for 48–72 h. Then, cells are collected for anti-FLAG based affinity chromatography purification.\npCMV-VCP transfection into H1299 cells.\nAdd 50 μg pCMV-VCP plasmids into 3.7 mL Opti-MEM and mix gently by vortexing at low speed for 5 s at 25°C.\nAdd 50 μL of 1 mg/mL PEI to the plasmids/Opti-MEM and mix gently by vortexing at low speed for 5 s at 25°C.\nLeave the mixture for 5–10 min at 25°C.\nAdd the PEI/plasmids/Opti-MEM mixture to H1299 cells in the 15 cm culture dishes and mix gently by moving the dishes from front to back and side to side for at least 5 times to ensure even distribution.\nCell collection and FLAG-VCP purification.\nAfter 48–72 h post transfection, discard the cell culture medium in the 15 cm culture dishes and wash cells with 10 mL PBS buffer two times by gently swirling the dishes by hand.\nAdd 1 mL buffer A into each 15 cm culture dish and incubate on ice for 30 min for cell lysis.\nCollect the suspension and centrifuge at 17,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant and add 50 μL Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel per mL.\nIncubate the supernatant-resin mixture at 4°C for 2 h by gently rotating with a Labquake rotator (Barnstead|Thermolyne).\nPellet at 800 g for 1 min and wash the resin with 1 mL buffer A three times at 4°C.",
    "Add 500 μL FLAG-VCP elution buffer, incubate at 4°C for 1 h by gently rotating with a Labquake rotator (Barnstead|Thermolyne), and collect the elution supernatant carefully after pelleting the resin.\nRepeat step g one more time.\nPause point: Add 1 mL FLAG-VCP elution buffer (with protease inhibitor) and elute after incubation with shaking for 16–24 h at 4°C.\nConcentrate the 1 mL elution to 50–100 μL with Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifuge Filter Unit with 30 KDa cutoff (Millipore, UFC503008) at 17,000 g for 10 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1601-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Separation of VCP dodecamers and hexamers using gel filtration\n(Bottom left) Gel filtration with Superose 6 10/300 GL column profile. Arrow bars indicate the fractions used for BN-PAGE analysis. (Bottom right) BN-PAGE analysis of elution fractions 16–18. “∗” and “∗∗” mark the positions of hexamers and dodecamers, respectively. (Top) Negative staining TEM examination of elution at 12 mL (VCP dodecamer, left panel) and elution at 13 mL (VCP hexamer, right panel) elution fractions.\nCritical: Centrifuge filters with correct molecular weight cutoff is critical to concentrate VCP protein and get rid of 3×FLAG peptides.\nNote: For two 15 cm culture dishes, typical sample concentration is around 1–2 mg/mL. The dodecamer and hexamer ratio could be evaluated by the blue native-PAGE (NativePAGE™ 3%–12%) (Yu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) and gel filtration (Superose 6 10/300 GL column) could be performed to improve the population of dodecamers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). See below steps 3 and 4 for detailed protocols.\nBlue native-PAGE to examine dodecamer and hexamer ratio.\nAssemble the blue native-PAGE gel electrophoresis unit according to the manufacturer’s manual[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fnativepage_man.pdf] (Thermo Fisher).\n7.5 μL VCP sample mixed with 2.5 μL 4× blue native-PAGE sample buffer (Thermo Fisher) was loaded.\nPerform the gel electrophoresis at 150 V for 90 min at 25°C.",
    "Fix the gel by microwaving in fix solution (40% methanol and 10% acetic acid) on high (950–1,100 watts) for 45 s.\nShake the gel on an orbital shaker for 15 min at 25°C, and then decant the fix solution.\nStain the gel with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Thermo Fisher) by shaking the gel on an orbital shaker for 1 h.\nPause point: The gel can be left in the GelCode Blue Stain Reagent for longer time until the desired background is obtained.\nImage the gel using Azure C500 imaging system (Azure Biosystems).\nGel filtration to improve the population of dodecamers.\nEquilibrate the Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Millipore Sigma) using buffer C. A flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was used.\nLoad 100 μL VCP sample of about 1–2 mg/mL to the column. All the elution fractions starting at 4 mL were collected.\nExamine the elution fractions using SDS-PAGE and blue native-PAGE.\nPurification of recombinant His-VCP from E.coli and generation of dodecamers\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section describes detailed procedure for bacterially expressed human His-VCP purification and dodecamer generation with apyrase treatment, which removes the prebound nucleotides. Since apyrase eliminates nucleotides in all AAA domains, the resultant VCP dodecamers contains both empty D1 and D2 AAA domains, which controls the N-terminal and C-terminal conformations, respectively (Banerjee et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Xia et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nTransformation of pET28a-VCP to BL21(DE3) cells using the 42 °C heat shock method.\nMix 1 μL of prepared pET28a-VCP plasmid (20 ng/μL) with 50 μL freshly thawed (on ice) chemically competent BL21(DE3) cells and incubate on ice for 30–45 min.\nNote: Mix by gently tapping the tube instead of pipetting.\nTransfer the tube to a 42°C water or metal bath for 45 s and then quickly cool down by putting on ice for 3 min.",
    "Add 200 μL LB medium to the tube and shake at 200 rpm (New Brunswick Innova 44R), 37°C for 1 h.\nSpread 50 μL above culture on a LB agar plate containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin.\nIncubate for 16–24 h at 37°C.\nGrow the transformed cells and induce His-VCP expression.\nPick a single colony, inoculate 5 mL LB supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and culture for 16–24 h at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm (New Brunswick Innova 44R).\nTransfer the above culture to 400 mL LB (50 μg/mL kanamycin) and culture at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm (New Brunswick Innova 44R) till OD600 of 0.4–0.6.\nAdjust the shaker incubator temperature to 20°C and add 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce protein expression for 18 h.\nHarvest cells by centrifuge (1,000 g, 10 min).\nHis-VCP purification.\nResuspend cells (∼2–3 g) in 20 mL His-VCP lysis buffer in the presence of protease inhibitor (1 mM PMSF).\nLyse cells by sonication (35% power, 1 s/3 s on/off, for a total on time of 3 min) on ice.\nPellet the cell debris by centrifuge at 4°C, 17,000 g for 30 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a 50 mL tube and add 1 mL 50% Ni-NTA agarose (prewashed with the His-VCP lysis buffer).\nIncubate and mix gently by rotating with a Labquake rotator (Barnstead|Thermolyne) for 1 h at 4°C.\nTransfer the mixture to a 15 mL chromatography gravity column.\nWash the resin with 30 mL His-VCP lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mM Imidazole at 4°C.\nRepeat washing with 20 mL His-VCP lysis buffer supplemented with 40 mM Imidazole at 4°C.\nElute bound His-VCP using 5 mL His-VCP elution buffer (containing 500 mM Imidazole).\nRepeat the elution step one more time.",
    "Optional: After a few elution drops, pause, and incubate with the His-VCP elution buffer for 5 min to improve the elution if necessary.\nConcentrate the elution using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifuge Filter Unit with 30 KDa cutoff (Millipore, UFC903024) to about 1 mL at 1,860 g at 4°C.\nCritical: Centrifuge filters with correct molecular weight cutoff is critical to concentrate VCP protein.\nNote: Mix the elution by gently pipetting up and down to prevent protein precipitation between centrifuge rounds.\nAdd 5 mL buffer C and repeat step k.\nRepeat step k and l for 3 more times.\nConcentrate the sample to 500 μL, measure the protein concentration using nanodrop (Thermo Scientific).\nNote: Typical concentration is about 20–40 mg/mL.\nPrepare 50 μL aliquots and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Store at −80°C till use.\nGeneration of His-VCP dodecamers.\nDilute His-VCP to 1–2 mg/mL using buffer C.\nAdd 0.5 U/mg apyrase (NEB) to treat His-VCP at 25°C for 12–18 h.\nCritical: Removing nucleotides from D2 AAA domain of VCP by apyrase is required to generate His-VCP dodecamers.\nNote: Usually obvious formation of dodecamers can be observed within 1 h. 12–18 h treatment can be performed to ensure complete elimination of ADP. The treatment time can be shortened by increasing apyrase concentration (e.g., double the concentration to 1 U/mg).\nOptional: The turnover of ADP to AMP by apyrase can be monitored using an ADP assay kit (Sigma Aldrich) (Yu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nDodecamer formation can be examined with blue native-PAGE (NativePAGE™ 3%–12%), negative staining TEM and cryo-EM (Yu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nTo remove apyrase post treatment, repurify the sample using the Ni-NTA resin following the steps (7e–7n) described above.\nTEM grid preparation and sample freezing\nTiming: 3–6 h\nGlow discharge 300-mesh lacey TEM grid (Ted Pella), 15 mA for 1 min.",
    "Alternatives: Grids from other brands could also be used.\nDilute graphene oxide (GO, stock solution 2 mg/mL, Sigma) to 0.2 mg/mL with ddH2O. Centrifuge at 300 g for 30 s to remove large precipitates.\nDilute pyrene stock solution (∼ 1 mg/mL in methanol) to 1 μg/mL with ddH2O.\nApply 5 μL diluted pyrene to the Ted Pella grid, incubate for 5 min at about 25°C and blot dry.\nApply 3 μL 0.2 mg/mL GO to the same side, incubate for 1 min, and remove the excess liquid from the side using a filter paper.\nWash with 5 μL ddH2O for two times and dry the grids on a filter paper in a clean Petri dish for >2 h (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1601-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Coating TEM grids with GO\n(A) Overall scheme of GO coating.\n(B) Grids coated with GO after one step of GO application and blotting.\n(C and D) Lacey and holey grids coated with 2–4 times of GO application and filter paper blotting from different orientations.\n3.5 μL purified FLAG-VCP dodecamers from the H1299 cells or apo bacterial recombinant His-VCP at a concentration of about 0.5 mg/mL in buffer C was applied to the GO-coated grid, blotted for 6–9 s at 20°C with a humidity of about 70%–80% and plunge-frozen in liquid ethene using a Cp3 cryo plunger (Gatan).\nCritical: When handling the grid, be sure not to damage the grid surface with the pipet tip or bend the grids.\nNote: Multiple grids (e.g., 6 grids) with variations in freezing condition (usually the blotting time) are typically prepared for one sample.\nAlternatives: Other cryo-EM sample freezing units such as Mark IV vitrobot (Thermo fisher scientific), can also be used, but the freezing condition need to be explored for individual instruments.",
    "Pause point: The frozen grids should be maintained in liquid nitrogen all the time and stored till ready to proceed.\nCryo-EM screening, data collection, and image processing\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nExamine the frozen grids using a lower-level cryo-EM microscope such as 200 KV Talos F200C electron microscope (the low-dose mode was used for the screening). The optimal grid with good ice and uniformly distributed particles is the target (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1601-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cryo-EM sample freezing conditions screening\nThe green boxes make areas with ice of optimal thickness and uniformly distributed particles. The light green box indicates an area with too thin ice. The red boxes mark areas with warmed up ice.\nPrepare two more frozen grids using the optimal condition for each sample.\nLoad the grids into a high-end cryo-EM microscope such as a 300 KV FEI Titan Krios TEM for data collection.\nRecord projection images with a direct electron detector (e.g., Gatan K2 Summit). A frame rate of 5 frames per second, a total dose of about 40 e/Å2 and a defocus range of −0.8 to −2 μm are usually used. About 600 and 800 movies were collected for FLAG-VCP and His-VCP, respectively.\nAlternatives: Gatan K3 direct electron detector or Falcon 4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Other 200 KV or 300 KV microscopes from JEOL could also be used for screening and data collection.\nAlign the frames using MotionCor2 (Dose per frame: 0.96, B factor of -150 and 5 × 5 patches) (Zheng et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). A 64-core Linux computing station with 4 NVIDIA GPUs was used for all the computation in steps 20–28.\nDetermine the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters with Gctf (Zhang, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) using the summed micrographs without dose-weighting (binning 2). Micrographs with overall resolutions worse than 6 Å were discarded (∼50 discarded).",
    "Randomly select about 10% of the micrographs and perform particle picking using Gautomatch (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/[href=http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/]) without a template using a particle diameter of 200 Å.\nPerform 2D class average using RELION or cryoSPARC with about 10,000 particles from step 22 (k=30) and select multiple representative classes (e.g., including both the top/bottom and side views of the particles as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) for a second round of template-based particle picking with Gautomatch.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1601-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The map was radially colored based on distance from the central axis.\n(F) The local resolution analysis of the map.\nNote: Due to the elongated shape of VCP dodecamers, top and bottom views could be less captured. Include more classes similar to top/bottom views in the template-based particle picking step.\nImport the picked particles into cryoSPARC v2 (Punjani et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) for further image processing.\nAlternatives: We processed the data using an earlier version of cryoSPARC (v2) but image processing can also be performed using newer cryoSPARC versions such as v3 or other packages such as RELION (Zivanov et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nFor FLAG-VCP, about 40,000 particles (initial particles of about 60,000) remained after cleaning via 2D classification. For the apo His-VCP, about 71,600 particles remained after 2D classification cleaning (initial particles of about 100,000).\nBuild 3 initial models using the ab initio model module in cryoSPARC with default settings.",
    "Perform hetero-refinements using the 3 models. An initial low pass filtering of 60 Å was used. For FLAG-VCP, a best class of 27,500 dodecamer particles and two other classes of dodecamer or hexamer particles with reduced quality (8,800 and 3,800 particles, respectively) were revealed. For apyrase-treated His-VCP, a hexamer class of about 38, 300 particles and a dodecamer class of about 33,300 particles were identified (Yu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: This step could be done repeatedly to improve the homogeneity of individual classes when necessary.\nPerform homo-refinements for the best classes using default settings of cryoSPARC and by imposing D7 symmetry. A dodecamer structure with a resolution of 3.9 Å was obtained for FLAG-VCP (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). A 4.2 Å apo hexamer structure and a dodecamer structure of 3.7 Å were resolved for His-VCP (Yu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nModel building and refinement\nTiming: 1 week\nSharpen the maps using phenix.autosharpen (Adams et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) according to the resolutions of the maps.\nFit the ATPγS-bound VCP structure (PDB: 5FTN) into the density map as a rigid body using the ‘fit in map’ function in Chimera, and density for a single subunit was segmented using the “color zone” routine in Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCarry out manual adjustment and real-space refinement of the atomic model against the subunit density in COOT (Emsley et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nPerform real space refinement in PHENIX using phenix.real_space_refine (Adams et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Afonine et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The minimization_global, local_grid_search, morphing, simulated_annealing, and adp refinement strategies were used.\nNote: Due to the poor density quality of the N-terminal domain, residues 22-206 were refined as a rigid body.\nRepeat steps 31 and 32 till good fitting of the atomic model with the density, referring to the modeling validation report post phenix refinement (Yu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).",
    "Generate the oligomer (hexamer or dodecamer) models using the phenix.map_symmetry (input: density map, map resolution) and phenix.apply_ncs using the refined single subunit model in the previous step (Adams et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nRefinement of the oligomer model against the whole density map using Coot and phenix.real_space_refine with settings used in steps 31–33.\nAnalyze the quality of the final models with MolProbity in Phenix and generate the refinement statistics (Williams et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).
