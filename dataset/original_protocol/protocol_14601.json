    "The local ethics committee approved this study and informed consented was obtained from the participants as detailed below in section 1.\n1. Participant Consent\nProvide participants with an information sheet that explains in detail what the testing session will include.\nAfter the participants have the opportunity to read and discuss any questions, concerns or other matters related to their taking part in the study, go through the consent form with them, explaining each point on the consent form and giving them the opportunity to ask any questions they might have. Ask the participant to complete the form.\n2. Setting up the Saccadometer\nPlace the device on the patient's head, secured by an adjustable elastic strap and resting on the bridge of the nose. Because the stimuli move exactly with the head, no head-restraint is necessary and the device is comfortable to wear.\nAsk the patient to sit at 1.5 m from a flat matte screen.\nEnsure that the ambient lighting is dim so that the stimuli (red light spots) are clearly seen.\n3. Recording a Saccadic Session\nNote: As an example a standard protocol that tests both prosaccades and antisaccades 8 is described here. This protocol consists of five blocks: 60 prosaccades, 40 antisaccades x 3, and 60 prosaccades with a break of 1 min between blocks. The session lasts about 40 min.\nSet up the saccadometer so that for each trial the central fixation target is displayed for a random fore-period of 1.0 - 2.0 sec, after which it is extinguished and one of the peripheral targets appears, randomly to right or left 9.",
    "Note: The three targets are spots of red light projected onto the screen in front of the participant (see 2.2) by low powered lasers built into the saccadometer. The saccadometer automatically switches the lasers on and off to display/extinguish the targets in the necessary sequence.\nInstruct the participant that the testing consists of five blocks with a one minute break between blocks.\nPrior to the first block instruct the participant to move their eyes as quickly and accurately as possible to follow the red dot jumping from the middle to one side or the other and instruct them to do this 60 times.\nSet the saccadometer to generate a sequence of 60 trials. Press the button on the saccadometer to start the first block of trials (prosaccades).\nAfter completion of the first block, leave a one minute gap before the second block. Reset the saccadometer to generate a sequence of 40 trials, and towards the end of the one minute gap, instruct the participant for the next block to move their eyes as quickly as possible in the opposite direction to the red dot, and explain that they will be required to do this 40 times. Start the second block of trials (antisaccades).\nAfter completion of the second block, leave a further 1 min gap, repeat the instruction in step 3.5 and start the third block of trials (antisaccades).\nAfter completion of the third block, leave a further 1 min gap, repeat the instruction in step 3.5 and start the fourth block of trials (antisaccades).",
    "After completion of the fourth block, leave a further 1 min gap, and explain that for the final block of tests ask the participants to move their eyes as quickly and accurately as possible to follow the red dot jumping from the middle to one side or the other, exactly as they did in the first block.\nReset the saccadometer to generate a sequence of 60 trials, and start the final block of trials (prosaccades).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53640/53640fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Eye Movement Tasks. Schematic illustration showing two examples of saccadic tasks. The solid blue spot represents the target and the dotted blue circle represents the area of fixation. LEFT shows a prosaccadic task where the subject is prompted to look towards the target. RIGHT shows an antisaccade where the subject is asked to look away from the visual stimulus. This requires inhibition of the more natural prosaccade response and generation of a saccade in the opposite direction.

Deep Brain Stimulator Settings\nNote: For participants with deep brain stimulators conduct the testing so far with stimulator system running as normal, i.e., an 'on stimulation' dataset has been obtained. Testing now needs to be repeated with the stimulator system turned off (for healthy control participants without DBS systems this section will not apply).\nSwitch the DBS system off. Do this by a trained clinical staff. Allow 30 min before testing.\nRepeat the saccadic testing (steps 3.2 - 3.9) to obtain a complete 'off stimulation' dataset.\nSwitch the DBS system back on (again this should be done by appropriately trained clinical staff).\n5. Data Analysis",
    "Note: For participants with deep brain stimulators conduct the testing so far with stimulator system running as normal, i.e., an 'on stimulation' dataset has been obtained. Testing now needs to be repeated with the stimulator system turned off (for healthy control participants without DBS systems this section will not apply).\nDownload the raw data from the saccadometer to a computer for analysis.\nUse the saccadometer's software program to exclude saccades distorted by blinks and head movements, and to calculate variables including saccadic latencies, peak velocities, and amplitudes.\n\tNote: Records contaminated by excessive head movements or blinks are automatically removed by the software.\n\t\nRemove saccades with latency less than 80 msec or greater than 1,000 msec.\n\t\tNote: Saccadic latency is computed automatically using a saccade-detection algorithm based on velocity and acceleration. The onset of a saccade is identified as the point when the eye velocity exceeds a threshold of 5 degrees/sec.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
