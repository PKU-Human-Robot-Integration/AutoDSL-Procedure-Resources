The absence of a cell wall will allow the DNA and ribonucleoprotein complex to penetrate the plasma membrane.\nPre-germination of incubation of R. microsporus spores.\nTake an aliquot of the spore stock containing the total spores needed for the transformation experiment depending on the number of treatments. Each treatment requires 6.25 × 107 spores. A typical transformation experiment comprises four treatments (electrophoretic cuvettes), and therefore, this protocol uses amounts for four treatments, but it could be easily scaled up. For four treatments, a total of 2.5 × 108 spores are required.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 440 × g at RT (20°C–25°C). Resuspend the spore pellet in YPG pH 4.5 to a final concentration of 1 × 107 spores/mL (25 mL for four treatments).\nNote: If an uracil auxotrophic strain is going to be transformed, YPG media must be supplemented with 200 mg/L of uridine.\nTransfer the spore solution to an Erlenmeyer flask covered with foil to prevent light with a 10:1 flask/culture volume ratio (e.g., 25 mL for four treatments in a 250 mL flask) and incubate 12–16 h (typically overnight) at 4°C without shaking.\nGermination of R. microsporus spores.\nIncubate the spores at 33°C with shaking (250 rpm) in the same foil covered flask.\nCheck the germination progression placing a 10 µL drop from the culture in a glass slide with cover slip and visualizing with a light microscope every hour until the optimal germination stage is reached (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1495-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Germination stages of R. microsporus spores",
    "Spores swell and emit hyphae as germination progresses. An example of early (left), optimal for digestion (middle) and late (right) germination stages are shown. Scale bar = 20 μm.\nNote: Typically, the optimal germination stage is reached after 4–5 h. It may vary in different laboratory settings; therefore, frequent observation of the germination progress is necessary.\nCell wall digestion.\nTransfer the culture with the germinated spores to a sterile 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 110 × g at RT (20°C–25°C).\nWash the pellet twice with 20 mL of PS Buffer. Centrifuge for 5 min at 110 × g at RT (20°C–25°C). Resuspend in 5 mL of PS Buffer for a four cuvettes experiment.\nDissolve 3 mg of lysing enzymes and 0.0008 units of chitosanase per 1 × 107 spores in 1.5 mL of PS Buffer and add the enzyme mix to the germinated spores. Incubate at 30°C with gently shaking (50–60 rpm) for 90 min. At this point, it is not necessary to prevent protoplast from light.\nCritical: Performing the cell wall digestion in the optimal germination stage is critical for sufficient digestion and protoplasts viability. Frequent checking of the culture is necessary to avoid too early or too late germination stages (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCRISPR-Cas9 RNP complex assembly\nTiming: 30 min\nAssemble the CRISPR-Cas9 RNP complex before the cell wall digestion is completed. Firstly, the crRNA and tracrRNA are coupled to form the gRNA. Then, this gRNA binds to the Cas9 enzyme to form the RNP complex targeting the region of interest.\ncrRNA and tracrRNA assembly.\nCombine the crRNA and the tracrRNA in an RNAse-Free microcentrifuge tube as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1495_11.csv",
    "Note: Lyophilized Alt-RTM CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA and Alt-RTM CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA are resuspended to 100 µM with Nuclease-Free Duplex buffer according manufacturer specifications. The Nuclease-Free Duplex Buffer is provided by IDT together with crRNA and tracrRNA.\nIncubate the reaction for 5 min at 95°C.\nCooldown to at RT (20°C–25°C) on the benchtop.\nRNP complex assembly.\nCombine the gRNA and the Cas9 following as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1495_12.csv\nNote: The total amount of Cas9 required (Alt-R™ S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3. See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) is diluted in PBS 1×.\nIncubate the reaction for 5 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nCritical: To avoid RNA degradation, sterile RNAse free pipette tips and tubes should be used in this step. Perform this step in a clean room or biosafety hood.\nProtoplast electroporation\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step is to get repair DNA templates and CRISPR-Cas9 RNP complexes into the protoplasts (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1495-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic workflow of protoplasts electroporation\n(A) Protoplasts are combined with the DNA template and the assembled RNP complex.\n(B) This mix is transferred to electroporation cuvettes and a time constant pulse is applied.\n(C) The recovery of the protoplasts is initiated immediately after the electroporation by adding 1 mL of ice-cold YPGS.\nTransformation mix set up.\nAdd 1 volume (≈5 mL in a four cuvettes experiment) of ice-cold 0.5 M sorbitol to the protoplast digestion solution. Centrifuge 2 min at 80 × g at RT (20°C–25°C).\nResuspend the pellet extremely gently in 200 µL of 0.5 M sorbitol per treatment: 800 µL for four treatments + 100 µL for negative control (only protoplast, without DNA or RNP complex).\nNote: Keep protoplasts on ice for all the subsequent steps.",
    "For each treatment, place 200 µL of protoplast solution in a sterile tube, then add 13.25 µL of RNP complex and up to 20 µL of template DNA (2–3 µg of total DNA).\nNote: A treatment without DNA has to be done to check for contamination. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTransfer each transformation mix to an electroporation cuvette (0.2 cm gap) on ice.\nElectroporation of the protoplast. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlace a cuvette in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporator (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and apply an electrical pulse with the following conditions: Pulse-type: Time constant Time: 5 s Field strength: 950 V (4.5 kV/cm)\nImmediately after the pulse, add 1 mL of ice-cold YPGS to the cuvette and keep it on ice until the electrical pulse has been applied to all cuvettes.\nProtoplast recovery and plating\nTiming: 2 h\nThe protoplasts are now grown under favorable conditions to allow them to recover from the electric pulse and to start regenerating their cell wall. After this, they are plated on selective media.\nRecovery and preparation of protoplast for plating.\nTransfer the electroporated protoplasts to sterile 2 mL tubes.\nIncubate the tubes for 1 h at 30°C with gently shaking (80–90 rpm).\nNote: This step allows protoplasts to recover from the electric pulse and start regenerating their cell wall.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 3 min at 70 × g at RT (20°C–25°C).\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend them in a final volume of 400 µL YNBS.\nPlating\nThe content of each tube (including the negative control) is plated on 2 plates of selective MMCS media (200 µL per plate). Spread protoplasts very gently and without applying too much strength using sterile L-shape spreaders.\nCover the plates with aluminum foil to protect them from the light and incubate them at 30°C for 5–6 days.",
    "Note: Transformants typically start to appear 48–72 h after plating.\nCritical: Protoplasts are very sensitive to any mechanical and temperature stress. In all the steps described, gentle manipulation of protoplasts (slow pipetting, careful resuspension of the pellet, plating, etc.) is extremely important. Also, keeping the protoplasts on ice is key to ensuring protoplasts viability.\nValidation of targeted template integration and isolation of homokaryons\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis step describes the procedures to confirm the template integration in the target locus and the subsequent steps to obtain homokaryons with all their nuclei with the integration (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1495-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Targeted integration analysis of the transformants\n(A) A small piece of mycelium of the initial transformants is subcultivated in minimal media (MMC).\n(B) Genomic DNA is extracted, and an integration-specific PCR is performed with primers that hybridize in the targeted locus and the pyrF marker.\nA PCR product should be obtained with the mutant DNA (M1 and M2) and no amplification in the wild-type (WT) (C) A PCR reaction with the primers flanking the targeted locus is carried out for homokaryosis validation. A bigger PCR product result of the marker integration should be visible in the mutant (M1 and M2) compared to the wild-type (WT).\nTransformant isolation and DNA purification. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTransfer a small piece of mycelium from independent colonies on the transformation plates to individual MMCS plates by using sterilized forceps.\nNote: In this step, MMCS media can be replaced with MMC media (without sorbitol).\nGrow them for 3 days at 30°C. At this point, colonies can be growth either under light or dark conditions.\nExtract DNA from each transformant using the QIAGEN DNeasy kit.\nIntegration-specific PCR amplification.",
    "Perform independent PCR reactions for each transformant as well as for DNA for the wild-type R. microsporus as a control using the TL_F_primer and pyrF_RC_primer following the below cycling program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1495_13.csv\naThe annealing temperature depends on the primer Tm of your specific primers. The extension time is set depending on the expected length of the amplified fragment.\nVisualize the PCR amplification in an 0.7% agarose gel (100 V–45 min). A band of the expected size should be visible if the template DNA is integrated into the targeted locus (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nIsolation of homokaryons.\nTransformants that produce a positive result in the PCR are grown for 5–10 vegetative cycles in selective media MMC to select homokaryons.\nNote: Initial transformants are heterokaryons because spores are multinucleated, and probably just one or a few nuclei are transformed.\nIsolate DNA from the transformants as described in step 10 and carry out a PCR amplification using the TL_F_primer and the TL_R_primer that amplify both the locus with and without the integration. Only a band of bigger size than the WT locus band should be visible in homokaryons a result of the marker integration (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) while heterokaryons would show both the band corresponding to the WT (smaller) and the mutant (bigger) bands. Follow the below cycling program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1495_14.csv\naThe annealing temperature depends on the primer Tm of your specific primers. The extension time is set depending on the expected length of the amplified fragment.\nOptional: Genomic DNA extraction can be performed using any other kit that yields good results from filamentous fungi or phenol/chloroform purification."
