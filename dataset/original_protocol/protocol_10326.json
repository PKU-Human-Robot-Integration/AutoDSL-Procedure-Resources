    "1. Preparation of DiO-LCNP and DiO-LCNP-PEG-Chol\nDissolve liquid crystalline diacrylate cross-linking agent (DACTP11, 45 mg), 3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO, 2 mg), and a free radical initiator (azobisisobutyronitrile, 1 mg) for polymerization in 2 ml of chloroform. Add this to an aqueous solution of acrylate-functionalized surfactant (AC10COONa, 13 mg in 7 ml).\nStir the mixture for 1 hr and sonicate at 80% amplitude for 5 min to produce a miniemulsion consisting of small droplets of the organic material surrounded by polymerizable surfactant in water.\nHeat the mixture to 64 °C in an oil bath to initiate the polymerization of both the cross-linking agent and surfactant as the chloroform slowly evaporates, leaving a DiO-containing NP suspension that is stabilized by the surfactant.\nFilter the NP suspension (3 times) through a 0.2 µm syringe filter to remove any aggregation. Store the filtered NP solution at 4 °C until further use.\nConjugation of PEG-Chol to DiO-LCNP via EDC coupling.\nDissolve Chol-PEG-NH2·HCl (PEG-Chol, 0.9 mM) in 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0).\nPrepare a working solution containing N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide sodium salt (NHSS, 40 mM) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)-propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, 400 mM) in HEPES buffer from concentrated stock solutions.\nImmediately add 20 µl of the freshly prepared working solution of NHSS/EDC to 1.0 ml of DiO-LCNP in HEPES buffer and stir for 5 min.\nAdd 20 µl of stock solution of Chol-PEG-NH2·HCl to this mixture and stir for 2 hr.\nBriefly centrifuge the reaction mixture at maximum speed (~2,000 x g) for 30 sec using a tabletop mini centrifuge and pass the supernatant through a PD-10 size exclusion chromatography column13 equilibrated with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, 0.1x).\n2.  Characterization of DiO-LCNP and DiO-LCNP-PEG-Chol\nConfirm the successful covalent conjugation of PEG-Chol to the DiO-LCNP surface by gel electrophoresis.",
    "Dissolve 0.5 g of agarose in 50 ml (1x) of tris-borate electrophoresis (TBE; 89 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA) buffer. Heat the solution in a microwave oven to dissolve the agarose. Allow the solution to cool slightly and pour the contents into a gel plate in the electrophoresis box. Insert a gel comb to create sample wells.\nOnce the gel has solidified, add the required amount (enough to submerge the gel in the chamber) of TBE running buffer to the chamber.\nAdd 35 µl of DiO-LCNP sample (amended with glycerol, 5% v/v) to the wells of the gel and run for 20 min at a voltage of 110 V.\nImage the gel using a gel imaging system with excitation and emission filters at 488 nm and 500-550 nm, respectively.\nAssess particle size and distribution by dynamic light scattering (DLS) by diluting the DiO-LCNP solution (~200-fold dilution) in PBS (pH ~8, 0.1x) and measuring on a DLS instrument14. Measure the zeta-potential of the DiO-LCNPs using an appropriate zeta potential measurement instrument.\n3. Preparation of Cell Culture Dishes for Delivery Experiments and Imaging\nNOTE: DiO-LCNP labeling is performed on HEK 293T/17 human embryonic kidney cells (between passages 5 and 15) that are cultured as described previously4. Perform the delivery experiments and the subsequent cell imaging as described below.\nPrepare 35 mm diameter tissue culture dishes (fitted with 14 mm No. 1 coverglass inserts) by coating them with bovine fibronectin (~100 µl at a concentration of 20 µg/ml) in DPBS for 2 hr at 37 °C.\nRemove the fibronectin coating solution from the culture dish. Harvest HEK 293 T1/7 cells from the T-25 flask by first washing the cell monolayer with 3 ml of DPBS and then by adding 2 ml of trypsin-EDTA (0.5% trypsin-0.25% EDTA).",
    "Incubate the flask at 37 °C for ~3 min. Remove the trypsin-EDTA and return the flask to the incubator. Once cells are detached from the flask, neutralize the trypsin by adding 4 ml of complete medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; DMEM; amended to contain 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% sodium pyruvate, and 5% antibiotic/antimycotic) to the flask. Determine the cell concentration in the suspension by counting them in a cell counter.\nAdjust the cell concentration to ~8 x 104 cells/ml with growth medium. Add 3 ml of the cell suspension to the dish and culture in the incubator overnight; the next day, the cells should be at ~70% confluency and should be ready for use. Adequate cell density is critical for robust and efficient labeling of a high percentage of cells.\n4. Cellular Delivery of DiO and DiO-LCNPs and Imaging of Fixed Cells\nPrepare 1 ml solutions of DiO, DiO-LCNP, and DiO-LCNP-PEG-Chol in delivery medium (HEPES-DMEM; DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES) by diluting stock solutions of DiOfree and DiO-LCNPs; appropriate DiO concentrations for incubation on cells will be ~1-10 µM (expressed as either the concentration of DiOfree or DiO in the form of DiO-LCNP).\nRemove the growth medium from the culture dishes using a serological pipette and wash the cell monolayers (see step 3) two times with HEPES-DMEM (2 ml each wash). Perform the washes by gently adding and removing HEPES-DMEM using a pipette to/from the edge of the dishes.\nAdd 0.2 ml of the prepared DiOfree or DiO-LCNP delivery solutions to the center of the culture dishes and return the dishes to the incubator for an appropriate period of time (typically 15 or 30 min, depending on the needs of the experiment). Longer incubation times add to more nonspecific cellular labeling of non-membranous areas (e.g., cytosol).",
    "After the incubation period, remove the delivery solutions using a serological pipette. Wash the cell monolayers two times with DPBS (2 ml each wash). Perform the washes by gently adding and removing DPBS to/from the edge of the dish.\nFix the cell monolayers using 4% paraformaldehyde (prepared in DPBS) for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is flammable, a respiratory irritant, and a suspected carcinogen.\nRemove the paraformaldehyde solution using a pipette and gently wash the cells 1 time with DPBS (2 ml) by adding and removing DPBS using pipette to/from the edge of the dishes.\nThe fixed cells are ready to be imaged for the presence of a membranous fluorescence signal using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Perform the imaging immediately or, alternatively, replace the medium with DPBS containing 0.05% NaN3and store the dishes at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: NaN3is toxic; exercise extreme caution when using NaN3.\n\tNOTE: Fixed samples stored in this manner should be imaged within 48 hr for optimum results.\n5. Cellular Delivery of DiO and DiO-LCNPs and FRET Imaging in Live Cells\nNOTE: In this method, cells are colabeled with 6 µM each DiO-LCNP-PEG-Chol (where DiO is a FRET donor) and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiIfree, where DiI is a FRET acceptor). The release of DiO from DiO-LCNP-PEG-Chol and its incorporation into the plasma membrane is confirmed by an observed increase in energy transfer from the DiO donor to the DiI acceptor.\nLabel cells sequentially with DiO-LCNP-PEG-Chol and DiIfree using the method described in step 4.\nAfter staining, wash the cells 1 time with DPBS (2 ml) using a serological pipette and replace the wash buffer with 2 ml of live cell imaging solution (LCIS).",
    "On a microscope stage equipped with a heated incubation chamber, image the live cell sample using a confocal microscope (60X objective) with a FRET imaging configuration at 30 min intervals over a 4 hr period by exciting the DiO donor at 488 nm and collecting full emission spectra of both the DiO donor and the DiI acceptor from 490-700 nm with a 32-channel spectral detector.\nNOTE: For more information on FRET imaging, please see reference15.\nDetermine the time-resolved emission intensity of both the DiO donor and the DiI acceptor from cells stained with DiO-LCNP-PEG-Chol and DiI. Calculate the time-resolved acceptor/donor FRET ratio (DiIemi/DiOemi) for the images, which will steadily increase and eventually plateau once the amount of DiO donor partitioned into the membrane has reached a maximum16.\n6. Cytotoxicity Assay of DiO and DiO-LCNPs to the HEK 293T/17 Cells\nNOTE: The cytotoxicity of the DiO-LCNP materials is assessed using a tetrazolium dye-based proliferation assay17. Cells are cultured in a multiwell plate in the presence of varying concentrations of the materials under conditions that emulate delivery/labeling. The cells are then cultured for 72 hr to allow for proliferation. A dye (MTS, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) is then added to the wells, and metabolically active cells convert the dye into a blue formazan product. The amount of color formation is directly proportional to the number of viable cells.\nHarvest HEK 293 T1/7 cells from the T-25 flask by following the procedure described in step 3.2.Seed HEK 293T/17 cells (5,000 cells/100 µl/well) to the wells of a 96-well tissue culture-treated plate and culture for 24 hr.\nCompletely remove the culture media from the wells using a micropipette and add 50 µl of HEPES-DMEM containing DiOfree, DiO-LCNPs, or DiO-LCNP-PEG-Chol at increasing concentrations to replicate wells. Incubate on the cells at 37 °C for 30 min.",
    "NOTE: Typically, replicates done in triplicate or quadruplicate are sufficient to yield statistically reliable data.\n\t\nAfter incubation, remove the delivery medium containing the materials using a micropipette and replace it with 100 µl of growth medium. Culture the cells for 72 hr.\nAdd 20 µl of the tetrazolium substrate to each well, return the plate to the incubator, and allow color formation to proceed at 37 °C for 4 hr. Read the absorbance (abs) of the formazan product at 570 nm (absorption minima for the DiO-LCNPs used in this study) and 650 nm (for subtraction of nonspecific background absorbance) using a microtiter plate reader.\nPlot the differential absorbance value (abs570 - abs650) versus material concentration and report the results as percent of control cell proliferation (degree of proliferation of cells in cell culture medium only).\n7. Data Analysis\nStatistically analyze the data with a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). For multiple comparisons, apply the Bonferroni's post hoc test. Provide all average values as ± standard error of mean (SEM) unless otherwise mentioned.\n\tNOTE: The acceptable probability for significance was p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required.
