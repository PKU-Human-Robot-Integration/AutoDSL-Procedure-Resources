    "Construction of the donor strain Isolation of DNA from bacterial strainsGrow bacterial cells in 5 mL of LB medium at 37 °C overnight with shaking.Collect bacterial cells of 1.5 mL of culture in a test tube by centrifugation at 8,152 × g for 3 min at room temperature.Suspend the cells in 500 µL of TKE buffer containing 1 mg of freshly added lysozyme.Incubate the tube for 30 min at 37 °C.Add 50 µL of 10% SDS and mix thoroughly.Add 500 µL of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and mix vigorously.Centrifuge the tube at 20,380 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then transfer 200 µL of supernatant to a new tube; avoid transferring the white interface.Add 500 µL of 99.5% ethanol to the tube, mix and stand on ice for 10 min, and centrifuge at 20,380 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.Wash the DNA pellet carefully with 0.7 mL of 70% ethanol and place the sample 10 min at 37 °C to evaporate remains of ethanol.Add 100 µL of distilled water and place 10 min at 37 °C to dissolve the DNA gently.Measure the concentration of DNA using a spectrophotometer such as NanoVue Plus.Setting up recombinant PCR reaction to generate the “gene cassette”The schematic organization of the ΔiolQGK::kan cassette, replacing the iolQGK coding region of G. kaustophilus with a thermostable kanamycin-resistance gene, is used in this protocol as an example (Figure 1). This gene cassette was generated by recombinant PCR, ligating the five PCR fragments as follows.Amplify the five fragments individually (A1, A2, B1, B2, and C1) by PCR using KOD -Plus- neo polymerase. The specific primer pairs used to amplify each of the fragments are listed above in the Materials and Reagents section.",
    "It is strongly recommended to check the correct amplification of each PCR fragment by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR reactions are composed and carried out as follows:PCR reaction:table:",

Five fragments are amplified by PCR using the primer pairs mentioned in A.14. Two fragments correspond to “upstream” and “downstream” regions of the B. subtilis aprE locus and are named A1 and A2, respectively. Two other fragments corresponding to sequences located upstream and downstream of G. kaustophilus MK244 iolQGK are named B1 and B2, respectively; the DNA fragment containing the kanamycin-resistance gene of pUCG18T is named C1. Fragments A1 and A2 are designed to be approximately 1 kb long, and fragments B1 and B2 are approximately 3 kb. The specific primers, indicated as arrows, are listed in the Materials and Reagents section. Colored regions of bent arrows correspond to 5′ extensions designed to create overlap with a flanking region in the final recombinant product. Overlapping sequences are indicated using different colors. The five individual PCR fragments are linked together by PCR to form one long “gene cassette” fragment.TransformationThe presence of pLS20 lowers competence levels (Singh et al., 2012). Therefore, it is recommended to generate the final B. subtilis donor YNB213 in two steps. First, the five-fragment recombinant product generated by PCR is used to transform competent B. subtilis 168 cells. Second, chromosomal DNA isolated from a kanamycin-resistant transformant of this transformation is then used to transform competent B. subtilis YNB211 cells harboring pLS20catΔoriT and containing both the oriTpLS20 and the IPTG-inducible rappLS20 present on the chromosome at the yhfK and amyE loci, respectively (Miyano et al., 2018; Mori et al., 2022). Transformation of B. subtilis is performed as follows:Grow a strain of B. subtilis to be transformed overnight (~16 h) on an LB 2% agar plate at 30 °C to form colonies.",
    "Pick up a fresh colony and use it to inoculate 5 mL of C-1 medium in a test tube to allow the cells to grow at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (at least 200 rpm) for 2.5 h.Collect the cells by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm at room temperature for 3 min.Suspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of C-2 medium in a new test tube and incubate the tube with shaking at 37 °C for 40 min.Transfer 1 mL of the C-2 medium culture into a new tube containing less than 100 µL of DNA solution (1–10 µg/mL).Incubate the tube with shaking at 37 °C for 2 h.Spread the culture onto plates containing appropriate antibiotics to select transformants.Conjugation and selection of transconjugant (Figure 2) Based on the previous findings that the addition of sorbitol (Kananavičiūtė et al., 2015), MgCl2, and maleic acid-NaOH buffer (Wyrick and Rogers, 1973) was effective in increasing the efficiency of transformation by electroporation and stabilizing L-form cells, we developed a modified medium, named LBMSM, suitable for elevating the efficiency of this transformation of G. kaustophilus mediated by conjugation.Preparation of donor cultureGrow B. subtilis YNB213 overnight on an LB 2% agar plate containing 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol at 37 °C to form colonies.Pick up a fresh colony and use it to inoculate 5 mL of LB liquid medium containing 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol, pre-warmed at 37 °C in a test tube.Grow overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm.In a 300 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flask pre-warmed at 37 °C, dilute the culture in 10 mL of LBMSM medium containing 1.0 mM IPTG to reach an OD600 of 0.05 (check using a spectrophotometer).Grow the cells at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until OD600 reaches 0.6–0.8, and use this as the donor culture.Preparation of recipient cultureGrow G.",

    "A schematic presentation of the conjugation procedure. Donor strain B. subtilis YNB213 and recipient strain G. kaustophilus MK244 were grown independently. Mating was performed by mixing two cultures in a 1 to 4 ratio of donor and recipient cells, followed by further incubation to enhance colony formation.Southern blot analysis Southern blot analysis allows us to detect a specific DNA sequence in chromosomal DNA samples, which usually involves four successive steps, including (i) Fragmentation of chromosomal DNA with restriction enzymes, (ii) Separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis, (iii) Transfer of the DNA onto the membrane, and (iv) Detection of DNA on the membrane using the probe. It is important to choose appropriate restriction enzymes for the fragmentation of chromosomal DNA. In the case of this protocol, we decided on Cla I and Sac II (Figure 3). For the detection of DNA on the membrane, a fluorescence-based nonradioactive technology with a DIG-labeled RNA probe is used for the detection of target DNA.Preparation of DIG-labeled RNARun PCR to amplify the stretch corresponding to the kanamycin-resistance gene using KOD -Plus- neo polymerase and the primer pairs Km-probe-f and Km-probe-r.
