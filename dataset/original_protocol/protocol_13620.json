    "All subjects were enrolled with written informed consent with full Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of Rush University Medical Center under protocol ORA 20101207 with all institutional guidelines for ethical research conduct observed. Blood was collected via conventional phlebotomy into lavender vacutainers (K2EDTA) and processed with recommended protocols. The resulting plasma was archived at -80 °C until assessments were performed.\n1. Preparation of antigen-conjugated microspheres\nSelect three different vials of magnetic microspheres with unique bead regions, recording bead ID and lot information for each vial used.\n\tNOTE: The following steps will be followed for each distinct microsphere region. Microspheres are light sensitive and should be protected from prolonged exposure to light. During wash steps, be careful not to disturb the microspheres. If disturbed, allow a second 60 s separation.\nVortex the microsphere stock for 60 s and sonicate for 5 min prior to use to dissociate aggregated beads.\nTransfer 1.0 x 106 beads to a 1.5 mL low-protein binding microcentrifuge tubes.\nInsert the tube into a magnetic separator and allow separation to occur for 60 s. With the tube still in the magnetic separator, carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the bead pellet.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic separator, resuspend the beads with 100 µL of HPLC-grade water, and vortex for 30 s. Place the tube back into the magnetic separator for 60 s, and subsequently remove the supernatant. Repeat this wash protocol twice.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic separator and resuspend the washed microspheres in 90 µL of 100 mM Monobasic Sodium Phosphate, pH 6.2 (Activation Buffer) by vortex for 30 s.",
    "Add 10 µL of 50 mg/mL Sulfo-NHS (diluted with Activation Buffer) to the microspheres and vortex gently for 10 s. Add 10 µL of 50 mg/mL EDC solution (diluted with Activation Buffer) and vortex gently for 10 s. Incubate microspheres for 20 min at room temperature (RT) with a gentle vortex every 10 min.\nRepeat wash steps 1.4-1.5 with 50 mM MES, pH 5.0 (Coupling Buffer) in lieu of LC/MS-grade water for a total of two washes.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic separator and resuspend the beads with 100 µL of Coupling Buffer by vortex for 30 s followed immediately by the addition of the desired quantity of protein.\nBring the total volume to 150 µL with Coupling Buffer. Mix coupling reaction by vortex for 30 s and incubate for 2 h by rotation at RT.\n\tNOTE: For assays defined herein, conjugations were performed with the following protein concentrations: Spike S1: 5 µg; Nucleocapsid: 5 µg; Membrane: 12.5 µg.\nRepeat wash step 1.4 with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)-1% Goat Serum Albumin, 0.01% Polysorbate-20 (Quench Buffer) in lieu of LC/MS-grade water for a total of two washes. Resuspend the washed microspheres in 100 µL of Quench Buffer containing 0.05% sodium azide by vortex for 30 s.\n\t​NOTE: Permit the beads to quench fully for at least 6 h prior to proceeding to any other procedure.\nCount the number of recovered microspheres using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer. Record the observed bead concentration.\nRefrigerate the coupled microspheres at 4 °C in the dark.\n2. Procedures\nAssay performance (Base protocol)\n\t\nResuspend the coupled microspheres by vortex for 30 s and sonicate for ~60-90 s.\nRemove the required quantity of each bead colloid from the respective tube and combine the bead colloids in a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Insert the tube into a magnetic separator and allow separation to occur for 60 sec. With the tube still in the magnetic separator, carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the bead pellet.\nRemove the beads from the separator, resuspend the beads with 100 µL of PBS-1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Polysorbate-20 (Assay Buffer), and vortex for 30 s. Place the tube into a magnetic separator and allow separation to occur for 60 s. Repeat this washing protocol (i.e., steps 2.1.3-2.1.4) twice\nAdjust the concentration of the 3-plex working microsphere mixture by adding an appropriate volume of Assay Buffer to generate a final concentration of 100 microspheres per 1 µL for each target.\nAliquot 12.5 µL of the microsphere mixture prepared in step 2.1.5 into each well of a 384-well plate or 25 µL into each well of a 96-well plate.\nDilute the plasma/serum specimens 500-fold in Assay Buffer. Prepare standard specimens according to titration desired.\nAdd 12.5 µL of Assay Buffer as the blank sample and add each of the diluted specimen or standard into each designated well of a 384-well specimen plate or 25 µL of the blank, diluted specimen or standard into each well of a 96-well specimen plate.\nCover the plate with an aluminum seal or foil and incubate for 1 h at RT on a plate shaker set to 700 rpm.\n\t\tNOTE: Schematic for the dilution curves is provided in Table 1.\nPrepare a solution of anti-human detection antibodies (secondary antibody solutions) at 4 µg/mL with Assay Buffer as specified in step 2.1.11.\nPrepare Goat-anti-human IgM, conjugated with Super Bright 436 (SB)/Goat-anti-human IgA, Phycoerythrin (PE) Conjugate detections antibodies at 4 µg/mL; or Goat-anti-human IgM, SB Conjugate/Goat-anti-human IgG, PE Conjugate detections antibodies at 4 µg/mL.",
    "NOTE: For a 384-well plate format, 12.5 µL/well of the prepared secondary antibody solution is required, and for a 96-well plate format, 25 µL/well is required.\nPlace the plate on a magnetic separator, wash rapidly, and forcefully invert over a biohazard container to remove liquid from the wells.
