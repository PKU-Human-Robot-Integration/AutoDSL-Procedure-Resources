    "1. Fixing the Head on Collars and Embedding in Paraffin\nNote: All of the steps in the fixation process should be done in a fume hood. Methylbenzoate, while not posing a health risk, has a highly distinct odor, which can be overwhelming if not handled in a fume hood.\nBefore anesthetizing the flies, make up 50 mL of Carnoy solution by adding 15 mL of chloroform and 5 mL of glacial acetic acid to 30 mL of 99% ethanol (do not mix the chloroform and acetic acid). Pour it in a glass container with a flat bottom, such as a crystalizing dish, to ensure that the collars can lay flat and are completely covered by the solution.\nAnesthetize the flies with CO2 or ether.\nThread flies (up to 20 with most collars) by their necks into the collars using forceps. Remember to align all of the heads in the same orientation, as seen in Figure 1A, and be gentle to ensure that no damage occurs to the head or eyes.\nInclude sine oculis flies (arrows, Figure 1A) at random positions so that the order of the flies can be easily identified in the sections. In addition, if the experimental flies have a light or white eye color, thread some red-eyed flies, such as wild type, between them to ensure that sufficient pigment is present to stain the slide. Record the order of the flies on a protocol sheet together with the collar number if using more than one collar.\nOnce a collar has been finished, place it in the prepared Carnoy solution for 3.5 - 4 h.\nDump out the Carnoy solution into the appropriate disposal canister and begin the ethanol washes. Make sure to pour slowly so as not to disturb the placement of the collars in the container.",
    "Wash the collars for 30 min in 99% ethanol twice.\nWash the collars in 100% ethanol for 1 h. Be sure to change the washes on time to prevent overdehydration.\nPut the collars in methylbenzoate O/N at RT. Seal the container with parafilm to prevent the evaporation of the methylbenzoate.\nPour the methylbenozate into the proper disposable container in the fume hood. Add a previously-prepared mixture of 1:1 low melting point (56 - 57 °C) paraffin wax and methylbenzoate for 1h. From this point on, the collars need to be kept in an incubator at 65 °C to make sure that the paraffin does not harden.\nPour out the methylbenozate and paraffin mixture into the proper disposable container, and pour molten pure paraffin wax, kept at 65 °C, onto the collars.\nChange the paraffin after 30 min and repeat this at least 5 times. At least 6 - 8 washes should be performed.\nOnce the washes are complete, place the collars into a rubber ice cube tray with slots approximately the size of the collars. Pour molten paraffin over them until completely covered and allow it to harden O/N (try to avoid air bubbles).\nRemove the paraffin blocks containing the collars from the ice cube tray. Separate the paraffin block from the collar using a razor blade, gently breaking off the collar. The heads will be in the paraffin block while the bodies will stay in the collar. The blocks can be kept at room temperature.\nTo clean the collars, soak them in a deparafinization agent at 65 °C to remove the paraffin, clean with light scrubbing, and wash in ethanol before reusing.\n2. Sectioning and Mounting",
    "Warm a heating plate to 50 °C. Place the object holders (or metal mounting blocks) and razor blades on the plate and let them warm up.\nDepending on the desired orientation for sectioning, attach the paraffin block either with the heads towards the side (for horizontal sections) or facing upwards (for frontal sections) to a heated mounting block (briefly melting the block at the contact side). Remove the block from the heating plate and allow it to cool for at least 10 min to ensure that the paraffin is hardened enough for a proper seal onto the mounting block. Keep the row of heads aligned in parallel with the surface of the block as much as possible to prevent uneven sections.\nTake a razor blade and trim the excess paraffin away from the fly heads so that only a small row with the embedded heads remains (the razor blade can be warmed up for easier trimming). Make sure not to trim too much so that the paraffin does not break during sectioning (more trimming can be done during sectioning).\nPlace the mounting block into the object holder of the microtome and ensure that the alignment of the row of heads is as parallel as possible to the edge of the blade.\nPrepare microscope slides by covering them with a thin layer of poly-L-Lysine (PLL) solution and let them dry for 5 min. Cover them with water shortly before use.\nCut 7 µm sections and transfer the ribbon of sections to the slide floating on the water.",
    "NOTE: To obtain the entire brain for horizontal sections, we collect the ribbon from when starting to cut into the eye until the head has been completely cut (cutting from the proboscis into the brain). More than one slide may be needed for the entire head.\nPlace the slide on a heat plate at 37 °C and allow the ribbon to expand for about 1 min.\nRemove excess water (by pouring it off or using a tissue) and dry the slides O/N.\nRemove the paraffin wax from the slide by placing the slides in a tall, vertical slide-staining jar filled with a deparafinization agent (completely covering the sections). Perform 3 washes of 30 min - 60 min each.\nRemove the slide from the final wash. Place 2 drops of embedding media onto the slide and cover it with a large coverslip.\n3. Photographing and Analyzing the Sections\nAllow the prepared slides to dry for 1 - 2 d. Then, examine them on a fluorescence microscope under blue light.\nUse a lower magnification to determine the orientation of the flies and to find the region of interest if focusing on a specific region.\n\tNOTE: For the sws flies (see Figure 2), we find the section that contains the great commissure and take an image (usually at 40X magnification). When analyzing the entire brain (as in Figure 3), we scroll through all the sections from a head and either photograph the section with the most severe phenotype or all sections that show vacuoles.\nFor a double-blind analysis, take and number images without knowing the genotype and record the collar number and position of the head in the row to identify them later.\nOnce the images have been taken, analyze them using an imaging software.",
    "Count the number of vacuoles per section or per head. To measure the vacuole size, open the images in a software program and select the vacuoles with a selection tool. Determine the amount of pixels in the selected vacuoles.\nFor conversion to µm2, take a photo of a stage micrometer calibration slide at the magnification used for acquiring photos. Determine the amount of pixels in 100 µm2 to calculate a conversion factor.\nConvert the total pixel number into µm2 by dividing the number of pixels by the conversion factor calculated in the above step.\nSubscription Required.
