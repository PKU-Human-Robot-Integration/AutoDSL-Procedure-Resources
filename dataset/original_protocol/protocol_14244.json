    "1. Extraction of miRNA from Plasma/Serum\nNote: In order to quantify miRNAs appropriately, the correct microRNA isolation from the plasma/serum is a crucial step. A key thing to keep in mind, especially because different protocols exist, is to adhere to the same workflow while processing the samples. In this protocol, miRNA is extracted from 50 µL of serum. Do not use more than 200 µL as this limit the correct extraction process.\nPrepare serum or thaw frozen samples.\nAdd 250 µL (5 volumes) commercial lysis reagent to 50 µL of serum. Support the lysis by vortexing. Place the tube with the lysate on the bench at room temperature for 5 min.\nSpike the lysate with 3.5 µL of spike-in control (1.6 x 107 copies/µL) and mix them by vortexing.\nAdd 50 µL of chloroform (i.e., an equal amount as to the starting serum sample) for the phase separation. Shake the tube vigorously for 15 s. Place the tube on the bench at room temperature for 2 - 3 min.\nFor the phase separation, centrifuge the tube at 12,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min.\n\tNote: The samples are now separated into an upper aqueous phase containing the RNA, a white interphase, and a lower, pink organic phase.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase (100 µL) containing the RNA into a new tube. Do not transfer any white interphase material as this falsifies the correct RNA count.\nAdd 150 µL (i.e., 1.5x the volume of the transferred sample) of 100% ethanol. Mix the materials by pipetting them up and down. Do not centrifuge them, and quickly move on to the next step.",
    "Pipette 250 µL of the sample onto a commercial spin column in a 2 mL collection tube. Close the lid. Centrifuge the column at >8,000 x g at room temperature for 15 s. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 700 µL of commercial washing buffer number 1 to the spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge the column at >8,000 x g at room temperature for 15 s. Discard the run-through washing buffer.\nAdd 500 µL of commercial washing buffer number 2 to the spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge the column at >8, 000 x g at room temperature for 15 s. Discard the run-through washing buffer.\nPipette 500 µL of 80% ethanol to the spin column. Close the lid, centrifuge the column at >8, 000 x g at room temperature for 2 min. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.\nTransfer the spin column to a new 2 mL collection tube. Centrifuge the column at full speed with an opened lid to dry the membrane. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.\nTransfer the spin column into a new 1.5 mL collection tube. Elute the RNA by applying 30 µL of RNase-free water directly to the center of the membrane. Close the lid. Centrifuge the column at full speed for 1 min.\nStore the RNA at -70 °C.\n\tNote: The storage of purified RNA in RNase-free water between -70 °C to -20 °C ensures no degradation of the RNA for 1 year. Following the manufacturer’s protocol, the minimum amount of RNase-free water to dilute the RNA is 10 µL. Using less than 10 µL may insufficiently hydrate the membrane and reduce the total RNA yield.\n2. Reverse Transcription\nNote: Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the following 15 µL reverse transcription (RT) protocol (total reaction volume).",
    "Thaw the RT kit on ice. Keep the enzymes in the freezer as long as possible to prevent them from degrading and spin them down before use. Thaw RT primers on ice and spin them down before use.\nPrepare the master mix as described in Table 1.\nCombine 10 µL of master mix and 5 µL of extracted RNA per well in a 96 well-plate.\nCentrifuge the well plate at 2,000 x g at 4 °C for 2 min.\nUse the thermal cycle protocol described in Table 2 for the reverse transcription.\n\tNote: As described below, cDNA may directly be processed in the digital PCR machine (see Table of Materials); alternatively, it may be stored at -20 °C.\n3. Droplet Generation and Digital PCR\nNote: Digital PCR was performed using the following 40 µL protocol.\nThaw the commercial dPCR mix, the prepared cDNA, and the PCR primers on ice. Centrifuge them shortly before use.\nPrepare the master mix as described in Table 3.\nAdd 1.33 μL/well of the RT product and centrifuge it briefly.\nPipette 20 μL of the sample into each well of the 8-well cassette (medium row).\n\tNote: If the 8-well cassette is not completely filled, fill up the remaining wells with non-template controls (NTCs) that omit cDNA (i.e., the RT product produced with water instead of extracted RNA) or dPCR commercial buffer. The NTC serves as a contamination control. Water must not be used in the remaining wells, because that will impair the quality of the droplet formation.\nPipette 70 μL of the droplet generation oil for the probes into the oil wells (bottom row) of the 8-well cassette.",
    "Place a gasket on top of the 8-well cassette and place the cassette in the droplet generator. Close the droplet generator. Wait until the 3 indicator lights are solid green.\n\tNote: Droplets are now being generated.\nCarefully and slowly transfer 40 μL of the droplet-formed sample (top row) into separate wells of a 96-well plate by pipetting.\nAfter completing the droplet formation on the samples, seal the PCR plate with a pierceable dPCR foil at 180 °C for 4 s.\nPlace the foil-sealed PCR-plate in the cycler and cycle it as described in Table 4, at a ramp rate of 2.5 °C/s.\n4. Droplet Reading and Analyzing\nTransfer the plate from the thermal cycler to the base of the plate holder. Tighten the PCR plate by placing the top of the plate holder onto the PCR plate.\nStart the commercial dPCR software.\nEnter the sample name, the name of the experiment, and the target in the setup. Select the absolute quantification.\nStart the droplet reading by clicking RUN. Select FAM/HEX or FAM/VIC as detection chemistry when working with hydrolysis probes.\n\tNote: The commercial dPCR software will then auto-analyze the data.\nCheck the droplet numbers in the results table to ensure a correct droplet generation.\nSelect all wells with the same quantified miRNA and click ANALYZE. Use the 2D blot to mark positive droplets and manually correct the auto-analyzed data (Figure 1).\n5. Correct Calculations on the Sample\nNormalize the sample by multiplying the sample by the normalization factor (NF).\n\tNF = Median [C. elegans miR-39 measurements]all samples/[C. elegans miR-39]given sample\nCalculate the final miRNA serum concentration, adjusting for dilution factors (DF).\n\t[miRNA]final = [miRNA]raw value x DFRT x DFdPCR x DFEx\n\tWhere:\n\t[miRNA]raw value = the miRNA quantified by commercial dPCR software;",
    "DFRT = the dilution factor of the template in reverse transcription;\n\tDFdPCR = the dilution factor of the template in dPCR;\n\tDFEx = the dilution factor in the extraction.\n6. Synthetic Oligonucleotide Dilution Series\nThaw lyophilized synthetic oligonucleotide on ice. Briefly centrifuge it.\nDilute the lyophilized synthetic oligonucleotide in nuclease-free water to a final concentration of 10 pmol/µL. Briefly centrifuge it.\nDilute it in nuclease-free water as described in Table 5. Centrifuge the dilution briefly between each dilution step at 8,000 x g for 10 s.\nContinue with the reverse transcription as described in step 2 and analyze the samples with digital PCR as described in step 3 and step 4.\nSubscription Required.
