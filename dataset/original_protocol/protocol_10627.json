  "procedures": [
    "All methods described here were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Minnesota and complied with guidelines for research with human subjects. Written informed consent was obtained from a parent or guardian of the child participants, and verbal assent was obtained from children given they were too young to provide written consent.\n1. Procedure\nRandomly assign 4-6-year-old children to one of three experimental conditions: self-immersed, third-person, or exemplar.\n\tNOTE: It is optional to include a control group that receives no special modifications to the standard task instructions.\nObtain written informed consent from a parent or guardian of the child participant.\nBuild rapport with and obtain verbal assent from child participants. See Supplementary File 1: Appendix A for an example of an assent script that can be used by the experimenter.\nIntroduce the target task to the child.\n\tNOTE: The target task will vary depending on the study's focus.\n\t\nIntroduce the distracting task. Show a tablet computer (e.g., iPad) to the child and say, \"Okay, I am going to show you a game on this before we start our work.\"\nAsk the child, \"Have you ever played on an iPad before?\" to get a sense of the child's experience with iPads or touchscreens.\nOpen up the \"Where's My Water\" app on the device to the second level and let the introduction play.\n\t\tNOTE: \"Where's My Water\" is only one example of an app that could be used for the perseverance task described. The app used should be simple enough for children in the study's age range to understand and be a game they would be tempted to play.",
    "Say, \"This is the game. Have you ever played Where's My Water before?\" Wait for child's response and then say, \"In this game, you want to get the water into the pipes so the alligator can take his shower. To get the water to him, you have to move the dirt out of the way. See how moving my finger on the screen digs through the dirt?\" Drag finger through dirt but only a little (not enough to complete the level).\nSay, \"Sometimes there will be rocks in the way, like this\" and point to the rock on the screen. Then say, \"Then you have to move the dirt around the rock, like this\" and demonstrate how to move dirt around the rock.\nSay, \"After the dirt is out of the way, the water can flow to the pipes. I want the water to go to this pipe, so I am going to move my finger like this\" and drag finger the rest of the way so that the water flows to the pipe. Watch the animation then restart the level by pressing the circle arrow.\nSay, \"Did you see how I got the water to the pipe? Now you try.\" Let the child try the level.\n\t\t\nIf the child completes the level, say, \"Good job! You got the water to the alligator.\"\nIf the child does not complete the level, say, \"Good job, let's try again. Try moving the dirt out of the way so that it gets to the pipe. Demonstrate the game again and let the child try again. Continue this process until the child is able to complete the level or they have tried 6 times.",
    "Say, \"Good. Once you finish, you'll see these buttons\" and show buttons on the screen (if the child completed level) or on the script page (if the child did not complete the level). Then say, \"If you want to play this level again, you can press the left button\" and point to the left button that says \"Replay.\"\n\t\t\nThen say, \"If you want to play the next level, press this button (point to the right button that says \"Next\") and you'll get a new screen.\" Finally, say, \"If you accidently press this button (press the middle button that says \"Levels\" so the game goes to the \"box screen\"), just pick a new box to play.\"\nAsk the child, \"Do you have any questions about this game?\" Wait for the child to respond and then answer any questions that he or she has about the game.\nSay, \"Great! That's the game you will get to play later.\"\nOpen the \"Where's My Water\" app to the first level on the device so that it is ready to play when the child chooses to. Place the device next to the computer so that it is easily accessible to the child while they are sitting at the computer.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure screen saver is set to 'never'.\nIntroduce the work task to the child. Say, \"Now, I'm going to show you the work that we're going to do today. It would be helpful if you worked hard on this. This is a very important activity and it would be helpful if you worked hard on this for as long as you could. The reason I want you to do this activity is because you would be a good helper.\"",
    "Ask the child a rule check question to make sure the child understands why the experimenter wants them to play the game. Say, \"Can you tell me why I want you to do this activity?\n\t\t\nIf the child responds incorrectly (i.e., does not say \"to be a good helper\" or something similar) or does not respond, say, \"Oops! Remember, I want you to do this activity because you would be a good helper. So, why do I want you to do this activity?\" Move on to the next step after the second try and correction.\nSay, \"Now, I'll show you how this activity works.\" Start the computer program, select the child's condition using the arrow keys, and then press the space bar twice to continue.\nPlace a cardboard overlay on the keyboard to cover all non-relevant keys for the task (i.e., all keys but the space bar and the enter key).\nSay, \"The goal of this activity is for you to feed pieces of cheese to a mouse. Whenever you see a picture of cheese on the computer screen you can feed the mouse by pressing the space bar\" and then point to the space bar.\nSay, \"But, sometimes there won't be cheese, and instead a cat may appear! Whenever you see a picture of a cat, make sure you do NOT press the space bar.\"\nPress the space bar twice to start the rule check phase.\n\t\t\nAsk the child, \"What will you do when you see a picture of a piece of cheese on the computer screen?\"",
    "If the child responds incorrectly (i.e., doesn't say \"press the button\" or something similar), say, \"Oops! Remember, when you see the cheese you press this button\" and point to the space bar. Then say, \"So, if you see the cheese, what do you do?\" Move on to the next step after the second try and correction.\nSay, \"What will you do if you see a picture of a cat?\"\nIf the child responds incorrectly (i.e., does not say \"nothing\" or something similar), say \"Oops, remember when you see the cat you do nothing. So, when you see the cat what do you do?\" Move on to the next step after the second try and correction.\nSay, \"Great job! Let's practice\" and then press the space bar twice to begin the practice trials (4 trials with feedback). Then say, \"When you see the cross on the screen, just look at it.\"\n\t\t\nAfter the first practice trial runs, read the feedback on the screen, and press the space bar twice to continue. Continue running the rest of the practice trials and reading the feedback on the screen.\nSay \"Good job! You are ready to start the real activity!\" and press the space bar twice to start the activity. Allow the child to work on the work task for 1 min.\nSay, \"Great.You did a good job! Remember, it would be helpful if you worked hard on this for as long as you could. But, this activity can get pretty boring. So, when you want, if you want, you can take a break by pressing this button. It's your choice.\" Then place the break button overlay (sticker with picture of the game) on the keyboard.",
    "Demonstrate how children can take a break. Say, \"And then you can switch and play this game (motion to the tablet computer [e.g., iPad]) like this.\" Then demonstrate moving over to the tablet and starting the game.\nSay, \"Then, when you're done taking a break you can come back to the activity and press this button again like this.\" Point to the break button on the keyboard before pressing the break button.\nAsk the child a rule check question to make sure they know how to take a break. Say, \"Now, what do you do when you want to take a break?\"\n\t\t\nIf the child responds incorrectly (i.e., does not say \"press the break key\" or something similar), say, \"Remember, you press this button when you want to take a break\" and point to the break key. Then say, \"So, what do you do if you want to take a break?\" Move on to the next step after the second try and correction.\nAsk the child a rule check question to make sure they understand what to do when they want to end a break. Say, \"And what do you do when you're done taking a break?\"\n\t\t\nIf the child responds incorrectly (i.e., does not say \"press the break key\" or something similar), say, \"Remember, you press this button when you're done taking a break\" and point to the break key. Then say, \"So, what do you do if you're done taking a break?\" Move on to the next step after the second try and correction.\nIntroduce a self-distancing strategy based on the condition that children were randomly assigned to (self-immersed, third-person, or exemplar condition) by saying, \"Before we get started, I'd like to tell you about something that you can do during this activity.\"",
    "NOTE: The following example is for a child randomly assigned to the exemplar condition. Follow the scripts in Supplementary File 1: Appendix B based on the child's assigned self-distancing condition.\n\t\nSay, \"It would be helpful if you worked hard on this. This is a very important activity and it would be helpful if you worked hard on this for as long as you could. You would be a good helper if you worked on this activity for as long as you can, but it can be boring sometimes. Some kids like to pretend that they're somebody else who would be a really hard worker on this activity, when it gets boring. That's what I'd like you to do today.\"\nShow the child a laminated sheet of paper with pictures of four characters that are familiar and popular in the participating children's culture and age range and say, \"Which one of these characters would you like to [pretend to] be for this activity?\"\n\t\tNOTE: In past studies with 4-6-year-olds from the United States, Batman, Superman, Bob the Builder, Rapunzel, Elsa (Frozen), and Dora the Explorer have been used.\nAfter the child chooses a character, say, \"Okay, to help you pretend you get to wear this.\" Then give the child the prop associated with their chosen character, so they can wear it.\n\t\tNOTE: Some examples of props used in past studies include a cape for Batman, a tool belt for Bob the Builder, a tiara for Rapunzel, and a backpack for Dora the Explorer.\nSay, \"So, if you get bored at any point during this task, ask yourself, \"Is [character's name] working hard?\"",
    "NOTE: The phrase \"Is [character's name] working hard\" can be modified based on the nature of the target task. For example, in an emotion regulation task, \"How is [character's name] feeling?\" could be used.\nTell the child about reminders to help them remember their self-distancing condition. Say, \"You're going to hear reminders to help you remember. The computer will say, \"Is [character's name] working hard?\" to help you remember to ask yourself, \"Is [character's name] working hard?\" This sticker will help you remember too.\" Place a sticker of the child's chosen character on the computer used for the work task. Then say, \"When you see the sticker, remember to ask, \"Is [character's name] working hard?\"\"\nMake sure the child can repeat their self-distancing prompt. Say, \"Now you try it. Say, \"Is [character's name] working hard?\"\"Continue to ask the child to say this prompt until they are successfully able to do so.\nSay, \"So remember, while you are working on this activity, I just want you to think whether [character's name] is working hard.\"\nAfter the child's assigned self-distancing strategy has been explained, say,\" Okay, I'm going to be in the corner doing some work. Do you have any questions now, before we start?\" Wait for child to respond and answer any questions.\nSay, \"It would be helpful if you worked hard on this for as long as you could. Remember, if you see the cheese, you press this button (point to space bar) and if you see the cat you don't press any button. If you want to take a break press this button (point to break button). Make sure you stay in your seat while you're on the computer or playing the game.\" Then say, \"Okay, go ahead and start the activity\" and point to the computer.",
    "Sit in the corner of the room with back turned to the child and look busy doing work. Let the child work on the task for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the child starts with the computer activity.\nAfter the task is over, ask the children questions about the task and their use of their assigned self-distancing strategy (See Supplementary File 1: Appendix C).\n\tNOTE: The questions included in Appendix C are specific to the perseverance task example described in this protocol. The questions asked after the target task should be modified to be relevant to the target task being used and can serve as a manipulation check to make sure that the children remembered their distancing strategy, to determine whether they were using that strategy, and to get information about their motivation and thoughts about the target task itself.\nSubscription Required.
