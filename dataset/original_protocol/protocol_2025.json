    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nTransfection of Cells\nTiming: 18–24 h\nPrior to immunoprecipitation, your cells need to be transfected with the FLAG-tagged plasmid of choice. It is recommended to perform initial confirmation assays of the plasmid before scaling up for this immunoprecipitation experiment. This protocol is optimized for purification of diverse protein complexes as well as ribonucleoprotein complexes(Gokhale et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), so it is a good approach when the protein of interest is known or hypothesized to be involved in translational or other processes of mRNA regulation.\nDepending on the scale of your experiment, plan and plate the number of 10 cm dishes you will need. The amount of protein in the lysate is also dependent of the abundance of the protein of interest and the respective interactors in cells. Each immunoprecipitation reaction requires 500 μg of total protein lysate. Example: 1 × 10 cm plate of Neuro2A cells at 80% confluency will give a yield of over 2 mg of total protein lysate, so sufficient for protein concentration quantification, loading the input material on the gels, and 4 immunoprecipitation reactions.\nHave 10 cm plates of your cell line at 50% confluency.\nFor Neuro2A cells, we seeded 2 million cells on a 10 cm dish. 16 h after seeding, the cells were at 50% confluence.\nFor each 10 cm plate, prepare a microcentrifuge tube with 800 μL of Opti-MEM.\nWithin each microcentrifuge tube, mix 8 μg of FLAG-tagged plasmid with 8 μL of Polymag (OZ Biosciences).\nIf multiple plates are receiving same plasmid, can scale up volumes accordingly.\nLet tube(s) sit for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd DNA-Polymag complexes to cells and place 10 cm plate(s) on magnetic plate (OZ Biosciences) in incubator and let sit for 20 min.",
    "Remove cells from magnetic plate and leave in incubator until ready for lysis (∼18–24 h).\nNote: In our experience, magnetofection allows for a high transfection efficiency of ∼80% of Neuro2A cells. While we suggest a magnetofection approach for transfection, you may utilize an equivalent approach (i.e. lipofection) if it achieves high-efficiency transfection (70%–90%).\nNote: Use manufacturer instructions for transection reagent if need troubleshooting.\nNote: If your plasmid is fluorescently tagged, confirm successful transfection after 12–24 h with fluorescent microscopy.\nPrepare Immunomagnetic Beads\nTiming: 2 h or 16–18 h\nIn certain protocols, antibodies are initially incubated with the protein extract before applying them to beads. However, we found that adding the antibody in excess (1 μg of antibody per 30 μL of Dynabeads) directly to the beads blocks the nonspecific sites on the beads. This step is done either on the day of or day before experiment (details are below). The antibody preincubation with beads also prevents excess antibody in solution that could keep antibody-antigen complexes from binding to already saturated beads.\nPrepare IP Buffer + FLAG antibody (Sigma F1804) master mix in a 15 mL conical.\nFor each immunoprecipitation tube, will need 500 μL of IP Buffer + 1 μg FLAG antibody.\nThe amount of antibody needed is proportional to the amount of protein lysate used during the immunoprecipitation. As will be detailed below, this protocol uses a fixed amount of 500 μg of protein lysate in each immunoprecipitation tube.\nScale up accordingly to experiment.\n(i.e. for 10 immunoprecipitation tubes, mix 5 mL IP Buffer with 10 μg of FLAG antibody).\nFor each IP reaction, add 30 μL Sheep Anti-Mouse Dynabeads (Invitrogen 11031) to a microcentrifuge tube. Alternately, protein G Dynabeads can also be used (Invitrogen 10007D).\nAdd 500 μL of IP Buffer/FLAG antibody master mix into each microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Put on end-over-end rotator either at 4°C overnight (16–18 h) or 2 h at room temperature (20°–25°C).\nNote: For the immunoprecipitation tubes, it is recommended to use screw cap microcentrifuge tubes with O-rings to prevent loss of antibody solution. An end-over-end rotator ensures optimal incubation of beads with the antibody. Rotation should be gentle to prevent bead fragmentation. Avoid bead vortexing in between steps.\nNote: Depending on the requirement, additional controls can be set up including: a no-antibody control (500 μL of IP Buffer with 30 μL of Dynabeads) or a control antibody against a protein that is not expressed in the lysate (such as a recombinant tag other than FLAG)(500 μL of IP Buffer, 30 μL of Dynabeads and 1 μg of nonspecific antibody).",
    "Note: In order to obtain enough material to run a SDS-PAGE and silver stain from the same sample that will be analyzed by mass spectrometry, we suggest to obtain ∼1 μg of eluted protein. This amount considers that the detection limit of silver stained protein bands is in the 5–10 ng range (Walker, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Keep in mind that there may be between 20 to hundreds of proteins in the FLAG peptide eluate (Comstra et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Gokhale et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Moreover, the intensity of the band will be determined by the protein molecular weight and whether the protein has membrane domains or it is glycosylated. Thus, if you suspect abundant low molecular weight proteins it is better to load more material in the gel for silver stain. We can obtain 1 μg of material for silver stain analysis and mass spectrometry by having a minimum of 4–6 immunoprecipitation tubes for each experimental condition and negative control. We do not use silver stained material for band identification as depending of the silver stain protocol stained proteins do not perform well in the steps required for mass spectrometry analysis.\nCell Lysis: Preparation of Soluble Cellular Lysate\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nPreviously transfected cells will be lysed and protein concentration will be measured.\n18–24 h after cell transfection, move plates directly from the incubator onto ice.\nIdeally, cells will be ∼80% confluency at time of lysis. Seeding confluency and/or number of plates initially seeded should be adjusted depending on doubling time of cells, expression and abundance of target proteins, and the goal of the experiment.\nWash plates 2× with 10 mL of PBS/Mg/Ca Buffer.",
    "For last wash, tilt plate to gather excess PBS/Mg/Ca and aspirate carefully to ensure no liquid is left on plate. This prevents dilution of the Lysis Buffer in the next step.\nFor each plate, lyse in 300 μL Lysis Buffer.\nUse cell scraper to lift cells off plate.\nMove lysate into a microcentrifuge tube and sonicate for 3 × 5 s. This has been previously performed on a Fisher Scientific Sonc Dismembrator Model 100 on a power setting of 2. Ensure tube in on ice during sonication and prevent incorporation of air bubbles. Both steps will help prevent protein degradation.\nKeep lysates on ice for 30 min.\nSpin lysate at 16,100 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nMove supernatant into new microcentrifuge tube.\nIf multiple plates were transfected with same plasmid, can pool supernatant together.\nMeasure protein concentration using BCA, Bradford assay, or other suitable methods.\nDetermine the total volume of lysate and add additional Lysis Buffer to bring final concentration to 1 mg/mL.\nKeep 50 μL of each lysate for input and keep on ice.\nPause Point: For step 13, Lysate may be left on ice for longer than 30 min. Additionally, while not ideal, lysate can be flash-frozen after step 15 and can be kept at −80°C until needed for immunoprecipitation.\nCritical: Ensure adequate amount of Complete protease inhibitor is added to the final lysate. Insufficient amount of protease inhibitor will result in protein degradation. Additionally, all buffers and centrifugation steps should be at 4°C to prevent protein degradation.\nImmunoprecipitation of FLAG-Tagged Ribonucleoprotein Complexes and Associated Proteins\nTiming: 3–5 h\nImmunoprecipitation with the previously prepared immunomagnetic beads will be used to isolate your FLAG-tagged protein and its interactome.\nCentrifuge the previously prepared tubes of Dynabeads + FLAG antibody for 1 min 16,100 × g at 4°C.",
    "Place tubes on magnetic rack and aspirate off liquid (preferably with a gel loading tip).\nAdd 1 mL IP Buffer to each tube and rotate on end-over-end rotator for 5 min at 4°C.\nRepeat steps 20 + 21.\nCentrifuge tubes for 1 min at 16,100 × g and aspirate off liquid.\nAdd in lysates to each prepared IP tube:\nFor out-competition controls, add in 490 μL of lysate in 10 μL of 3× FLAG Peptide (final concentration 340 μM, Sigma) per tube.\nFor experimental conditions, add in 500 μL (at 1 mg/mL) of lysate per tube.\nIt is recommended to have an equal amount of control and experimental tubes per experiment.\nLet tubes of lysate + beads rotate at 4°C for 2–4 h on end-over-end rotator.\nPlace tubes on magnetic rack, and aspirate off liquid (preferably with gel loading tip).\nThe unbound fraction may be collected and kept to check IP efficiency.\nDo one quick wash by adding 1 mL of IP Buffer.\nTurn tubes up and down 10–15 times.\nCentrifuge tubes for 1 min at 16,100 × g at 4°C and aspirate on magnetic rack.\nAdd 1 mL IP Buffer to each tube and put on end-over-end rotator at 4°C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge tubes 1 min at 16,100 × g at 4°C and aspirate on magnetic rack.\nRepeat steps 29+30 four times.\nAdd 1 mL IP Buffer into each tube and put on end-over-end rotator at 4°C for 10 min.\nCentrifuge tubes for 1 min at maximum speed at 4°C and aspirate on magnetic rack.\nNote: 500 μL at 1 mg/mL of lysate solution is optimal for incubation with the beads. This volume and amount ensures adequate mixing of the lysate on the end to end rotor and prevents drying of beads.\nImmunoaffinity Purification of FLAG-Tagged Ribonucleoprotein Complexes",
    "Timing: 2–2.5 h\nElution of FLAG-tagged proteins and associated complexes can be performed either with 4× Laemmli buffer or the FLAG-antigenic peptide followed by heating at 75°C. We have systematically tested different concentrations of the FLAG peptide to elute FLAG-tagged proteins and their associated interactors from the Dynabeads. We found that the minimum final concentration of the peptide required for efficient elution was 340 μM (Comstra et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Gokhale et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Elution with Laemmli buffer after heating at 75°C is harsher whereas using the antigenic peptide prevents the elution of immunoglobulins (IgG)(Gokhale et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). IgGs appear as prominent bands at 50 kDa and 25 kDa, potentially obscuring identification of proteins of similar molecular weights by MS/MS.\nPrepare master mix of elution solution.\nFor each microcentrifuge tube, need 16 μL of Lysis Buffer mixed with 4 μL of 3× FLAG peptide (340 μM final concentration). This forms the elution buffer.\nScale up based on the number of total tubes. Prepare enough for 1–2 extra tubes to ensure that there is enough elution solution.\nFollowing aspiration of the last wash (Step 33), add 20 μL of elution solution to each microcentrifuge tube and put on ice for 2 h.\nTap the tubes to mix approximately every 15 min.\nCentrifuge tubes at maximum speed at 4°C for 1 min.\nPlace tubes on magnetic rack and move elution solution/protein mixture into a new labeled tube.\nIf have multiple tubes for the same condition, pool elutants into one microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1:1 μL of 4× Laemmli buffer to input tube(s) and heat for 5 min at 75°C or 95°C. Denaturation at 75°C prevents aggregation of membrane proteins, if these are suspected in the sample.",
    "Flash freeze elutants and heated input on dry ice and store at −80°C. It is important to flash freeze the proteins since proteins can continue to be modified/oxidized after denaturation and freezing at −20°C.\nNote: The next step will be concentrating the eluants in order to run on a SDS-PAGE gel. If you are skipping that step, you can instead add 1:1 μL of 4× Laemmli buffer to elutants and heat for 5 min at 75°C and flash freeze and store at −80°C.\nCritical: Avoid vortexing Dynabeads at any point as the process will fragment the beads.\nPause Point: Inputs/elutants may be kept at −80°C for up to a month before moving on to the next steps. Ideally, pooled elutants should be frozen for 16–18 h at −80°C before TCA precipitation (see below) to get optimum concentration.\nTrichloroacetic acid (TCA)/Ethanol Precipitation\nTiming: 1 h\nAs each immunoprecipitation tube will yield 20 μL of elutant, pooling together multiple replicates (>40 μL) will exceed the volume of standard SDS-PAGE gels. Furthermore, running larger volumes (>50 μL) on gels results in artifacts such as “smiling” that are visible by protein stains. TCA precipitation allows us to run the entire sample in a single well of a SDS –PAGE gel – either for a protein stain or an immunoblot.\nMeasure volume of each individual sample.\nAdd 1.96 μL sodium deoxycholate (5 mg/mL stock) per 100 μL of each sample.\nExample: for 200 μL sample, add 3.92 μL of sodium deoxycholate.\nAdd 10% TCA and incubate on ice for 20 min.\nExample: For above, would have 203.92 μL following step 41, so would then add 20.39 μL of TCA.\nIncubate on ice for 20 min\nCentrifuge at 16,100 × g at 4°C for 15 min.\nCarefully remove supernatant (should see very small, white pellet).",
    "Add cold acetone (same volume as TCA added in step 42).\nCentrifuge at 16,100 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nCarefully remove supernatant.\nLeave tube open with a Kimwipe over the top and air dry for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 10 μL 4× Laemmli buffer.\nSolution will most likely turn yellow due to acidity imparted by residual TCA in the pellet. Add 10 μL of 1 M Tris at pH 9.0. This should return the color of the solution to a dark blue.\nAdd another 10 μL of 4× Laemmli buffer.\nBoil for 5 min at 75°C.\nNote: Make sure you do not over-dry the pellet. This would make dissolution of the pellet extremely difficult. If the pellet is large and difficult to dissolve vortex the pellet and boil the sample repeatedly till a homogenous solution is obtained.\nBiochemical Analysis of Immunopurified Complexes\nTiming: 2 days\nTo confirm sufficient protein is enriched for mass spectrometry and that the immunoaffinity purification of FLAG-tagged protein complexes has worked, perform an immunoblot and a protein stain, such as with silver stain or Coomassie.\nLoad and run inputs and concentrated samples on an SDS-PAGE gel in duplicate.\nOne set of gels are analyzed by protein stain (Silver stain or Coomassie).\nThe protein stain confirms the amount of protein immunoprecipitated is sufficient for Mass Spectrometry analysis.\nThe second gel is transferred to a PVDF membrane for immunoblot analysis using the FLAG antibody.",
    "An example of such an analysis is depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] with confirmation of enrichment of FLAG-tagged protein and effective out-competition with 3× FLAG Peptide on Western blot (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Silver stain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) demonstrates sufficient enrichment of FLAG-protein complexes with nonspecific binding proteins identified in the 3× FLAG Peptide control. With Mass Spectrometry, the nonspecific binding proteins can be identified and excluded from the interactome of the protein of interest.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/162-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Immunoaffinity Enrichment of FLAG-Tagged Complexes\n(A) Western blot demonstration of FLAG-protein into N2A cells (input, top) and enrichment of FLAG-tagged protein following immunoprecipitation (bottom). Out-competition control with 3X FLAG Peptide co-incubation prevents immunopurification of FLAG-tagged protein complexes.\n(B) Silver Stain from same experiment as panel A shows an enrichment of putative FLAG-interacting proteins. Asterisk indicates major FLAG-tagged species (lane 1) that was out-competed by FLAG peptide (lane 2). Arrowheads indicate non-specific binding proteins in out-competition control (lane 2).\nMass Spectrometry\nTiming: weeks\nMass Spectrometry Services were contracted from MS-Bioworks (https://www.msbioworks.com[href=https://www.msbioworks.com]) to identify proteins enriched from the immunoprecipitation.\nSubmit eluted immunopurified complexes for Mass Spectrometry analysis.\nLabel free or isobaric tagging approaches can be used to identify hits from background.\nPeptides enriched two-fold compared to negative control can undergo DAVID Analysis (https://david.ncifcrf.gov[href=https://david.ncifcrf.gov]) to categorize the interactome based on gene ontology.\nIn previous publications, the DAVID analysis was run with medium classification stringency and threshold p value of <0.005 (Valdez-Sinon et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nFor additional guidance on DAVID analysis and selecting parameters, utilize the following references: Huang et al., 2007, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; ."
