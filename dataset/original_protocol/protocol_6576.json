    "Note: Perform all tissue culture steps in a sterile environment. Carry out dissections in a laminar flow hood on a dissection microscope. Perform microfluidic device preparation, tissue dissociation and cell culture in a vertical flow hood. Preparation of coverslips and microfluidic devicesGlass coverslipsPlace coverslips in a plastic container containing 1 N NaOH and wash for 1 h on an orbital shaker at approximately 120 rpm, careful to avoid spills.Remove NaOH from the container and wash coverslips with ddH2O several times until the pH returns to neutral.Store coverslips in 70% ethanol.Microfluidic devicesCover the structured surfaces of the device with 3M tape to remove any particulates and fibres.Peel off the tape and store devices in a container containing 70% ethanol.Note: Devices can be stored dry covered with 3M tape or in 70% ethanol for extended periods of time (several months to years). Assemble devices (1 day before dissection)Remove two glass coverslips from the 70% ethanol-containing container and place into a sterile Petri dish using forceps.Allow the glass to dry (~5 min in open air in hood) before applying 1 ml of 0.1 mg/ml PDL onto each the glass for at least 1 h to overnight (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816090827_0191.pngFigure 1. Coating of glass coverslipsRemove PDL solution and wash the glass with autoclaved ddH2O three times.Allow the PDL-coated glass to air-dry inside a sterile tissue culture hood for ~1 h prior to the addition of the microfluidic device.Note: Glass coverslips that have been PDL-coated, washed and dried can be stored in Petri dishes at -20 °C for up to two weeks.Remove the devices from the 70% ethanol and place the devices at an angle on the edge of a sterile Petri dish, channel-side up (i.e., upside down, see Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816090842_8482.pngFigure 2.

    "The devices are dried groove-side up in a 10 cm Petri dish in a sterile environment. B. They are then assembled with the structured side facing the glass coverslip, gently pushing the device down in the non-structured areas to allow good contact for leak-free sealing between PDMS and the glass substrate. (C, D) Photos of two assembled devices. C. Dry devices before media addition. D. Two filled devices showing one well sealed (top) and a leaky (bottom) device. Devices were filled with food dye for better contrast.Allow the devices to completely dry (~1 h).Using sterile forceps, set down the dry devices (channel-side down) on to the centre of the PDL-coated glass coverslips. Use the blunt end of the forceps to gently press down the devices onto the coverslips to ensure even PDMS-glass contact, removing any air pockets (see Figure 2B).Observe that the devices adhere to the surface of the glass, ensuring a tight seal.Add 10 µl of 70% ethanol to inlets at one side of the device and observe as the channels fill from one port to the next.Place lid on the Petri dish and examine the assembled device on a light microscope making sure that there is no leakage or bubbles trapped inside the channels and/or microgrooves.Next, rinse out ethanol by adding 50 µl of supplemented Neurobasal medium to each channel, allowing the device to fill. Remove ethanol from outlet and top up inlets with supplemented Neurobasal medium. Place in the incubator overnight.Note: Perform these steps in quick succession to ensure liquid in device does not evaporate.Hippocampal dissection and primary cell preparationSacrifice the pregnant female using CO2 followed by cervical dislocation.",
    "Remove the uterus, place it into sterile Petri dish filled with PBS and move to a horizontal flow hood for fine dissectionIsolate the embryos and collect into fresh PBS. Make sure to rinse off remaining blood.Isolate embryonic brains. Using a dissection microscope, remove the meninges and dissect out the hippocampi. On average, one embryo yields ~500,000 hippocampal neurons, with between 4-10 embryos per pregnant female.Note: A helpful illustration of murine embryonic hippocampal dissection can be found at Seibenhener and Wooten, 2012. Collect the isolated hippocampi in 1 ml PBS into a 15 ml conical tube and move to a vertical flow hood.Add 100 µl Trypsin-EDTA and incubate in a water bath at 37 °C for 8 min to disrupt cell-cell contacts.Add 1 ml serum to inactivate the trypsin and spin cells for 3 min at 300 x g. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 ml culture medium.Triturate cells with a 1 ml pipette about 6-8 times. This will dissociate tissue into a single cell suspension.Note: If the cell suspension begins to clump (often observed with older embryos), add 50 µl DNAse solution for trituration. Filter the dissociated cells through a 40 µm cell strainer to remove non-dissociated larger chunks and count cells using a hemacytometer.Cell CultureTransfer 300,000 cells into an Eppendorf tube.Note: If you plate more than 2 channels per device adjust cell number and media volume accordingly. Use 60,000-70,000 cells per channel. Spin the tube at 300 x g for 3 min. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in the Eppendorf tube in 50 µl complete NBM.Remove the primed devices from the incubator and transfer into a sterile culture hood.Remove all the media from all of the inlets in the device.",
    "Starting from the left port (Al) add 10 µl of cell suspension and remove 1 µl from the adjacent connecting right port (Ar) to encourage flow of cells (see Figure 3A). Close the Petri dish and use a light microscope to check that cells have entered the main culture channels. Return Petri dish into a sterile hood.Continue on to fill the other channels (e.g., Bl) as above.Allow the cells to settle close to the microgrooves by propping the Petri dish containing the device at an angle (see Figure 3B). After 5-10 min transfer the Petri dishes to the incubator for an additional 45 min to allow the cells to adhere to the glass.Top up medium by adding 50 µl of complete NBM to all the ports. Add 1 ml of sterile ddH2O on the side of the Petri dish to maintain humidified atmosphere before replacing the lid and place cells in incubator. This counts as day in vitro (DIV) 0.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816090900_9994.pngFigure 3. Plating of neurons into the device. A. Add neuronal suspension into port, as close to the channel as possible, and encourage flow into the channel by removing a small volume from the other side. B. Once plated, place devices at a gentle angle so that gravity guides the cells to settle near the microchannels. For this, the culture channels should be horizontal with channel A on top, so that cells in culture channel A settle near the microgrooves connecting to channel B and those in channel B near the microgrooves connecting to channel C.TransfectionOn the following day (DIV1), transfect the cultures in the devices with the relevant constructs. To assay tau propagation, we transfected human tau 0N4R constructs described in Hoover et al., 2010 as follows: GFP-tauE14 in channel A, and RFP-tauWT in channel B (Figure 4A).",
    "Add 25 µl of OptiMEM each in two separate Eppendorf tubes, labeled 1 and 2.Add 0.5 µg of plasmid in tube 1 and 0.5 µl Lipofectamine2000 in tube 2. Mix by pipetting up and down.Make the transfection reagent by mixing tube 1 and 2 by gentle bubbling. Do not vortex. Allow to stand inside a sterile hood for 20 min.Take the device from the incubator into a sterile TC hood and remove all media in both ports of channel A (the channel to be transfected) (see Figure 4B for workflow).Top up ports connected to culture channel B with complete NBM. A high volume of media within the ports of channel B will fluidically isolate this channel and prevent flow of the transfection reagent from channel A to channel B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816090918_3591.pngFigure 4.

Partial reconstruction of two transfected, connecting neurons within a device. Scale bar = 10 µm.Add 50 µl transfection reagent on the left feeding port of channel A.Close the Petri dish lid and incubate for 40 min in the incubator at 37 °C.Remove all media from ports A and add 50 µl of fresh complete NBM in all the left ports to flush remove the remaining transfection reagent.Leave for 2 min before removing excess media in the right port.Now, add 50 µl of complete NBM to all ports.Repeat to transfect channel B.Add 1 ml sterile ddH2O on the side of the Petri dish to prevent drying out before placing back into the incubator overnight.Feed cultures every 2-3 days by topping up one port.",
    "Remove excess media from opposite port as necessary.Note: Replenish the 1 ml sterile ddH2O in the Petri dish every 2-3 days to prevent drying out of cultures.FixationNote: Devices can be imaged live in phenol red-free media, or fixed for later observation. We typically fix the devices unless observing dynamic processes.On the desired day in vitro, stop the experiment by fixing cells.Remove the media from all ports.Fill port Ar with 50 µl PFA. Allow flow into the main channel and through the microgrooves.Top up port Ar and fill port Br.Leave to fix for 15 min.Remove PFA solution and fill device with PBS or TBS.Fixed devices can be stored short-term in the fridge (up to 2 weeks), but ensure that they do not dry out by topping ports up with PBS or TBS.MicroscopyNote: while we performed the imaging on a DeltaVision microscope, any high resolution inverted fluorescence microscope is suitable. We typically use a 60x oil objective, and 1 pixel = 0.1075 µm.Clean bottom of the glass coverslip with 70% EtOH.Image cells on an inverted fluorescence microscope using a 60x oil objective and adequate filter settings for the GFP and RFP channels.For every connecting pair, ensure you image the corresponding cell bodies and distal axonal segments. Ideally capture corresponding differential interfering contrast (DIC) or phase image for quality control.Notes:For the analysis you will need an axonal stretch that is in focus for a length of ≥ 75 µm. Any axonal stretch that is ≥ 300 µm from the cell body can be used as “distal axon”. Ensure you only use one axonal stretch per neuron for analysis.Ensure you do not image blebbed cells as this will interfere with the analysis (see Figure 5). In doubt check axonal integrity on transmitted light channel to ensure that the axon structure is smooth.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816090937_9012.pngFigure 5.",
