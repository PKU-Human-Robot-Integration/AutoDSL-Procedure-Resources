    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Procedure for the borylation of aryl and alkyl carboxylates\nTiming: 12 h\nIn this step, the synthesis of borylated products (Schemes 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sch2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sch3]) has been accomplished.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2254-Sch2.jpg\nScheme 2. Synthesis of aryl boronic esters\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2254-Sch3.jpg\nScheme 3. Synthesis of alkyl boronic esters\nPreparation of aryl boronic esters (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and Scheme 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sch2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2254_4.csv\nEquip one 25 mL of Schlenk tube with a magnetic stir bar.\nAdd (CF3COCHCOCH3)3Fe (15.5 mg, 0.03 mmol), PAd2Bu (21.5 mg, 0.06 mmol), MeOLi (34.2 mg, 0.9 mmol), B2hex2 (152 mg, 0.6 mmol) in the glove box.\nDissolve the newly generated aryl carboxylate (0.2 mmol) in dry MTBE (0.5 mL) and dry hexane (0.5 mL) and then add it to the Schlenk tube.\nSeal the tube with a cap containing a PTFE-lined silicone septum and move it out from the glove box.\nHeat the mixture in an oil bath at 130°C for 12 h.\nNote: This reaction can proceed well without the use of the freshly prepared aryl and alkyl carboxylates. Aryl and alkyl carboxylates are stable and can be stored under air conditions.\nPreparation of alkyl boronic esters (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and Scheme 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sch3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2254_5.csv\nEquip one 25 mL of Schlenk tube with a magnetic stir bar.\nAdd (CF3COCHCOCH3)3Fe (15.5 mg, 0.03 mmol), PAd2Bu (21.5 mg, 0.06 mmol), MeOLi (34.2 mg, 0.9 mmol), B2hex2 (178 mg, 0.7 mmol) in the glove box.\nDissolve the newly generated aryl carboxylate (0.2 mmol) in dry MTBE (0.5 mL) and dry hexane (0.5 mL) and then add it to the Schlenk tube.\nSeal the tube with a cap containing a PTFE-lined silicone septum and move it out from the glove box.\nHeat the mixture in an oil bath at 110°C for 12 h.\nPart 2: Purification of the crude products",
    "Timing: 2 h\nAfter the reaction is completed, allow it to cool down to 25°C.\nQuench the mixture with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (sat. aq. NH4Cl, 1 mL).\nDilute with 2 mL ethyl acetate and wash with 2 mL saturated brine.\nShake the separatory funnel vigorously and release pressure.\nAllow the aqueous and organic phases to fully separate.\nTransfer the organic phase and the aqueous phase in two 20 mL flasks.\nPour the aqueous phase back into the separatory funnel and then add 2 mL of ethyl acetate for extraction.\nAgain, shake the separatory funnel vigorously, and allow the aqueous and organic phases to fully separate, then transfer the organic phase and the aqueous phase into their corresponding flasks.\nRepeat steps 5 and 6 two times.\nTransfer the organic layer to an Erlenmeyer flask, then add sodium sulfate. Slowly shake the flask and filter the solution in a 25 mL round bottom flask.\nRemove the solvent by rotatory evaporation (45°C, 235 mmHg, ∼15 min) to afford the dried crude product.\nDissolve the dried crude product in 2 mL of dichloromethane and add 50 mg of silica to it. Carefully swirl the flask and remove the solvent under vacuum (45°C, 235 mmHg, ∼15 min).\nPurify the crude product by flash column chromatography (8 cm of silica, Ø of the column = 1.7 cm) using 20:1 (by volume) mixture of PE/EA (∼100 mL).\nMonitor the fractions by TLC (These borylated products will appear as bright black spots using the phosphomolybdic acid as stain).\nCollect the combined fractions containing pure product and concentrate under vacuum to deliver the aryl and alkyl boronic esters."
