    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRevival of HEK293T cells and Vero E6 cells\nTiming: 3–10 days (for steps 1–4)\nThis step will provide a brief procedure for revival of frozen cells.\nTake aliquots of HEK293T and Vero E6 cells stored at −80°C and thaw them immediately. Wash the cells once with 10% DMEM by centrifuging at 250 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells pellet into 5 mL of 10% DMEM to seed the cells into a T25 cell culture flask. Keep the flasks in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity, RH).\nAfter 3rd-day of reviving the cells, replace the medium with freshly prepared complete DMEM (10% DMEM) and repeat the process until a monolayer is formed.\nOn 7th day, split the cells into multiple tissue culture dishes of 100 mm for performing the experiments. On or after 10th day, when the cells are approximately 80% confluent, initiate the transfection experiments to generate pseudoviruses.\nTransfecting HEK293T cells for the generation of LV(CoV-2 S) pseudoviruses\nTiming: 3–4 days (for steps 5–13)\nWe describe here the detailed methodology for generating the pseudoviruses using HEK293T cells and concentrating such particles by PEG-NaCl.\nProduction of pseudovirus.\nProduction of pseudoviruses using HEK293T cells not expressing anti-CSP IB: For generating replication-deficient LV(CoV-2 S) pseudoviruses, HEK293T cells cultured at ∼80% confluency in 100 mm dishes are co-transfected with five plasmids (stored at −20°C and thawed on ice) viz., 10 μg of pLenti-GFP (reporter plasmid with GFP), 9.8 μg of pCMVR8.74 (packaging vector), 6 μg of SARS-CoV-2 spike encoding plasmid, 6 μg each of Tat (trans-activator) and Rev plasmids (which promote the expression of virion proteins).",
    "Production of pseudoviruses in anti-CSP IB-expressing HEK293T cells: Co-transfect HEK293T cells cultured at ∼80% confluency with 5 plasmids viz., 10 μg of anti-CSP IB construct in which the sequence of anti-CSP sdAb is cloned upstream of GFP using Xba1 and BamH1 sites (pLenti-GFP-anti-CSP sdAb GFP-reporter plasmid, 9.8 μg of pCMVR8.74, 6 μg of SARS-CoV-2 S construct, 6 μg each of Tat and Rev plasmids (trans activator and positive regulator of virion proteins expression, respectively). The cloning strategy is outlined in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nTo prepare the transfection mixture, aliquot the above-mentioned plasmids in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and add the plasmid mixture with the transfection agent, PEI in 1:3 ratios (37.8 μg of total 5 plasmids and 114 μL of PEI) in a final concentration of 1 μg/mL to make a final volume of 1 mL with serum-free DMEM. Vortex the mixture for 30 s and keep at 25°C for 15 min (Refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2302_13.csv\nCarefully add the transfection mixture onto HEK293T cells, cultured in 100 mm plates and gently swirl the plates.\nCritical: Make sure that the incubation time for making nano-vesicles does not exceeds 20 min, as this will reduce the transfection efficiency.\nAfter 16 h of transfection, replace the medium with complete DMEM.\nNote: This step will reduce PEI-induced detachment and death of the cells.\nAfter 72 h of transfection, collect the supernatant in separate falcon tubes from both the conditions (1, 2) and centrifuge the tubes at 100 × g to remove cell debris.\nNote: Check for GFP expression using a fluorescent microscope to assess the percentage of transfected cells.",
    "Collect supernatant in separate falcons and add PEG-NaCl in 1:3 ratios, i.e., one part PEG-NaCl (can be stored at 25°C for a week) and 3 parts of the supernatant with pseudoviruses to concentrate the pseudovirus particles by gently rotating at 25rpm for 16 h at 4°C.\nNext day, centrifuge the concentrated pseudoviruses at 3,000 × g for 80 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the pellet containing pseudoviruses in serum-free DMEM.\nNote: For the supernatant collected from at least 5 of the 100 mm plates, resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of serum-free DMEM.\nThe collected supernatant can be used for further experiments.\nPause point: Concentrated pseudoviral particles can be stored at 4°C for a week. For long time storage keep the pseudoviruses at −80°C.\nAssessing the infectivity of LV(CoV-2 S) pseudoviruses produced from the control cells and those expressing anti-CSP IB\nTiming: 3–4 days (for steps 14–20)\nThis section includes the detailed procedure for measuring the infectivity of the generated pseudoviruses in Vero E6 cells.\nSeed approximately 10,000 Vero E6 cells in 96 flat-bottom plates and keep the plate in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% RH) for 16 h.\nInfect Vero E6 cells at 80% confluency with 200 μL/well of pseudoviruses from each of the above conditions.\nAfter 16 h of infection, replace the medium with complete DMEM and observe for GFP expression using a fluorescent microscope.\nAfter 72 h of infection, capture images from different wells along with those from the control wells in which only LV(BALD) particles are added.\nCollect the infected and control cells from all the wells using 1×-PBS-EDTA (can be stored at 25°C for a week) and then wash twice with 1×-PBS (can be stored at 25°C for a week) to remove clumps of dead cells.",
    "Critical: Incubate the cells at 37°C for 15 min in a CO2 incubator to increase the isolation efficiency.\nAcquire and analyze the infected cells using a flow cytometer. To measure the frequency of GFP-positive i.e., the infected cells in different conditions, insert a gate to mark GFP-negative cells by using the LV(BALD) infected cells as a negative control. During the acquisition, remove all the debris by setting up a threshold of 5,00,000.\nCollect data and transform the above files as FCS files (if samples are acquired using a BD C6 Accuri) for analyzing the above samples in FlowJo software (Schematic is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and the data is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] of the original article Singh et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2302-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of production of LV(CoV-2 S) based pseudoviruses from transfected HEK293T cells (control and anti-CSP IB condition)\nThe transduction efficiency was measured using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Supernatant were also used for measuring the SARS-CoV-2 S protein assembled in the LV(CoV-2 S) pseudoviruses using ELISA.\nNote: While performing the analysis, first gating is done to include total live cells and then the GFP-positive cells are measured in different conditions.\nAssessing the production of LV(CoV-2 S) pseudovirus particles produced from control and anti-CSP IB by ELISA\nTiming: 1–2 days (for steps 21–29)\nThis section describes the method to measure differences in the titers of pseudoviruses produced in the supernatant of transfected HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of anti-CSP IB using ELISA.\nCoat the wells of ELISA plates in triplicate with 100 μL each of the concentrated pseudovirus preparations (those obtained from control and the anti-CSP IB-expressing cells) and keep the plates at 4°C for 16 h.\nNote: Include negative controls such as serum-free DMEM, LV(BALD) pseudovirus particles, and supernatant from the cultured Vero E6 cells.",

    "HEK293T cells were seeded onto coverslips and incubated for 16 h. The cells were transfected with the anti-CSP sdAb constructs for intracellular expression or with the control pLenti-GFP construct. Thereafter, the cells were re-transfected with the SARS-CoV-2 S construct. After 16 h of re-transfection, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with ER marker (calnexin) and SARS-CoV-2 S protein carrying a 6×(HIS)-tag using anti-6×(HIS) antibody and anti-mouse Alexa flour 647 as the secondary antibody. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in ER was measured using SP8 upright confocal microscope (Leica). All the images were analyzed using ImageJ software.
