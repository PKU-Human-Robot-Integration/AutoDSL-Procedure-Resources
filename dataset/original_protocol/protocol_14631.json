    "Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Keio University.\nNote: In this study, we used the Sftpc-rtTA and Tre-Fgf9-ires-eGfp DT mice in which lung adenocarcinoma rapidly develops after induction by feeding chow containing doxycycline6,7. However, all assessment procedures can be applied to other lung cancer mouse models.\n1. Experiment Outline:\nIdentify the status of the lungs at the baseline:\n\t\nBefore tumor induction, when the DT mice are 8 - 12 weeks old, perform the first micro-CT scan (see sections 2 and 3 below). This serves as the lung baseline scan, confirms the absence of spontaneously developed nodules caused by a leaky transgene, and document the absence of any existing lung pathology before tumor induction.\nInitiate tumor induction:\n\t\nSwitch the DT mice from regular chow to doxycycline chow to induce Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)9 expression in the alveolar cells and to initiate tumor development. Give doxycycline chow (200 ppm) ad libitum.\nConfirm the development of tumor nodules in mouse lungs:\n\t\nPerform a micro-CT scan to identify the development of tumor nodules compared to the pre-induction scan.\nAssess response to treatment:\n\t\nTo test the ability of the micro-CT to detect changes in tumor nodules in response to treatment, administer the FGF Receptor (FGFR) inhibitor AZD4547, then perform additional micro-CT scans after 5 and 10 weeks.\nEnd-point evaluation:\n\t\nEuthanize all treatment and control mice and process tissues for histological evaluation (see section 6 below).\n2. Preparing Mice for Micro-CT Image Acquisition:\nTurn on the micro-CT scanner and computer.\nClick on the software named \"R_m CT2\", then click on \"warm up\".\nRemove the sample bed upon which the mouse will be placed from the micro-CT chamber. Wrap the bed with plastic wrap.",
    "Set the anesthesia induction box by adding isoflurane to the anesthesia vaporizer up to the marked level. Set the isoflurane flow rate at 3 L/min.\nOpen the oxygen tank to start the oxygen flow into the induction box and set the flow rate at 1 L/min.\nPlace the mouse in the anesthesia induction box and confirm that it is deeply anesthetized by the absence of spontaneous movement and in response to a skin pinch (a gentle pinch of a small fold of skin, which does not cause tissue damage or skin break).\nApply an ocular lubricant to prevent corneal dryness during anesthesia.\nOpen the micro-CT chamber and place the mouse with the dorsal side up on the sample bed. Hold the head of the mouse and pull the body downward from the lower limbs in order to stretch and straighten the body symmetrically.\nTurn off the anesthesia flow to the induction box and turn it on towards the tube that connects to the micro-CT chamber.\nPlace the anesthesia tube into the mouse's nose to administer continuous anesthetic.\nIn order to fix the mouse in position; wrap the mouse and the sample bed with plastic wrap.\n\tNote: It is critical to keep the mouse under deep anesthesia and wrapped to the sample bed because any slight movement or twist of its body during the scan will result in hazy images and difficulty in interpretation.\nClose the micro-CT chamber.\nAdjust the micro-CT system to 90 kV and 160 µA and the scan time to 4.5 min. Set the image range to 24 × 19 mm and the voxel size to 50 × 50 × 50 µm. Use the synchronous mode for heartbeats.\nMake a new folder in the \"Database\" in order to save new images in that folder.\nStart the scan.",
    "After completion of the scan, move the mouse into an empty cage and observe it until it regains consciousness. Do not put it with other mice until it has fully recovered from the effects of the anesthesia.\n3. Pre-induction Micro-CT Image Visualization and Analysis:\nTo visualize the micro-CT images, download the free ImageJ software from the following web site: http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/[href=http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/] . Note: Every micro-CT data file is a stack of approximately 500 TIF Files (.tif). Other image viewing software can also be used.\nOpen the serial micro-CT images files and scroll through all of the images of each mouse from the neck to the abdomen or vice versa.\nUsing scans of naïve wild-type mice, identify the density of different areas and normal anatomical structures in the chest based on knowledge of mouse anatomy (see Figure 1A).\n\t\nHold the cursor with the computer mouse and scroll up, starting from the whitish abdominal viscera and diaphragm, through the chest and up to the neck.\nIdentify the bony chest cage landmarks (sternum in the front, vertebrae in the back and ribs on the sides).\nIdentify the heart in the front of the chest and the major blood vessels near the heart and in the mediastinum.\nObserve the trachea lumen (as a small dark circle at the level of the neck and upper chest), which bifurcates into the right and left main bronchi then continue to branch into smaller and smaller bronchi. Note that each bronchus is closely associated with two or three blood vessels (Figure 1A).\nStart examining the scans of un-induced DT mice and identify the presence of any abnormalities.\n\t\nExclude mice with abnormal pre-induction lung shadows (e.g., nodules, emphysematous bullae, etc.) from any further experiments. (Figure 1C-E, G, H).\n4. Tumor Induction:",
    "To induce tumor development in experimental mice that showed normal lung scans, switch their food from regular chow to doxycycline-containing chow (200 ppm).\n5. Follow-up scans:\nAfter 10 weeks, perform a second micro-CT scan of all mice to confirm the development of tumor nodules in their lungs (see Figure 2).\nSplit mice into two groups. Administer the FGFR blocker AZD4547 (125 µg/kg/day via a gastric tube for 6 days/week for 10 weeks) to one group and a placebo to the other control group for 10 more weeks.\nFollow up the changes in the nodular shadows by performing a third scan 4 - 5 weeks later.\nAt the end of 10 weeks of treatment, perform a fourth scan.\nEuthanize all mice with CO2 inhalation or with intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg/200 µl of pentobarbital.\nTo identify the dynamic changes in the tumor nodules after induction and in response to treatment, identify similar positions within the serial scan images of the same mouse at two or more different time-points then check for the appearance/disappearance of any abnormal shadows (Figure 3).\nTo facilitate the identification of the same plane in the same mouse at different time-points, try to associate the plane of interest with anatomical landmark structures within the mouse chest.\n\t\nUse landmarks such as the trachea, its bifurcation, the right and left main bronchi, aorta, diaphragm, and large blood vessels.",
    "Note: Chest bones, including the thoracic vertebrae, ribs, and sternum are less useful as positioning landmarks because of common minor tilts in mouse body alignment on the sample bed, which increase the possibility of misinterpretation of the scan position. Similarly, the image serial number within the scan file is unreliable for identifying the same position over time because of the change in mouse body length from one time-point to another. Failure or inaccuracy in identifying the same plane at different time points may result in false positive/negative interpretation of findings.\n6. Mouse Euthanasia and Lung Collection:\nEuthanize mice with CO2 inhalation or with intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg/200 µl of pentobarbital.\nExpose the abdominal viscera by cutting longitudinally through the abdominal wall. Bleed the mouse to reduce the volume of blood in the lungs by dissecting the abdominal aorta.\nSlit the diaphragm with fine scissors; this will result in loss of the negative pressure from the chest cavity, thus collapsing the lungs. Expose the lungs and heart by cutting and removing parts of the ribs of the anterior chest wall. Clean the frontal part of the neck by cutting the skin and soft tissues to expose the trachea.\nCut away the heart and thymus gland. Insert forceps behind the trachea to separate it from the esophagus.\nCannulate the trachea with a G24 cannula then secure it in place by tightening a thread around the inserted part.\nInflate and fix the lung using ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) through the tracheal cannula using a 25 cm column. Detach the cannula and tighten the thread to prevent PFA leakage then cut the upper trachea off its attachment to the larynx.",
    "Pull the trachea from the suture thread and dissect it from its attachment, and continue downward to remove it with the lung en-block. Insert it into a 15 ml tube containing 5 ml of 4% PFA. Leave the lungs in PFA O/N to ensure complete tissue penetration and fixation, then process the tissue into a standard paraffin block8.\nCut paraffin blocks into 6 um-thick slices on a microtome and stain with hematoxylin and eosin using standard techniques.\n7. Histological Evaluation:\nNote: Although the use of a \"slide scanner\" for digital histological evaluation is described here, the use of regular microscopes and visual histological evaluation for assessment is also possible.\nTurn on the slide scanner instrument and computer.\nClick on the \"NDP scan\" software.\nSelect the scan mode \"Batch of slides\" and \"Semi-Auto Mode\" for scanning a series of slides.\n\tNote: The robotic arm that picks up the slides during sequential scanning is very sensitive to any irregularities on the edges of the glass slides.\nPalpate the edges of all glass slides before loading them into the machine. If there is any protrusion of the cover glass or dried mounting medium, clean it off with a cutter or a scalpel.\nLoad the slides into a slide cassette. Open the specimen hatch and slide the cassette into position \"one\". Close the door.\nOn the computer software, give short descriptive names to all slides in their corresponding position in the cassette then click the \"OK\" button.\nSelect the profile mode: \"Brightfield\".\nClick on \"Start Batch\" to start the provisional scanning.\n\tNote: Once the machine has finished scanning all the slides, the software will automatically detect areas with tissues on all the slides and suggest it as a region of interest.",
    "If needed, redefine the region of interest by holding down the left mouse button and pulling the region border.\n\tNote: Defining excessively large areas of the slides as the regions of interest will result in a much longer scan time.\nOnce satisfied with the regions of interests on all of the slides, click on \"Scan\" to start scanning all slides.\n\tNote: The scanned files can be observed digitally in low and high resolution, and images can be exported as JPEG files.\nSubscription Required.
