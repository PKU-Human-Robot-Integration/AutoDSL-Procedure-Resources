    "1. Participants\nProvide approval for the protocol and informed consent procedures from the University Institutional Review Board.\nRecruit adolescent and young adult UHR participants by using Craigslist (i.e. local classified advertisements on the internet), email postings, newspaper ads, and community professional referrals.\nRecruit healthy control participants by craigslist, flyers and newspaper announcements.\n\t\nAdvertise that the study looks at healthy development for volunteers with no family history of psychosis and no psychiatric symptoms.\nExclude healthy controls based on the presence of any category of Axis I disorder or a psychotic disorder in a 1st degree relative.\n\t\tNote: A psychotic disorder in a first degree relative is intended as exclusion criteria for healthy controls because of the familial or genetic risk of psychosis1.\nExclude all participants based on criteria consisting of a history of head injury, the presence of a neurological disorder, substance dependence, or a history of taking neuroleptic medication.\n\t\nExclude UHR participants based on the presence of an Axis I psychotic disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform).\n2. Clinical Interviews\nTrain interviewers to administer the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) to diagnose a prodromal syndrome and the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis-I DSM IV Disorders (SCID) over a 2 month period.\n\t\nEstablish inter-rater reliabilities on clinical interviews to exceed the minimum study criterion of Kappa ≥80.\nDefine criteria for a prodromal or high-risk syndrome by moderate levels of positive symptoms and/or a decline in global functioning accompanying the presence of schizotypal personality disorder and/or a family history of schizophrenia.\nCompute a total sum score for each category as an indicator of the respective dimensions of symptomatology.\n\tNote: The SIPS gauges several distinct categories of prodromal symptom domains including positive, negative, and disorganized dimensions.",
    "Administer the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis-I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID) to rule out a psychotic disorder diagnosis.\n\tNote: This measure has been demonstrated to have excellent inter-rater reliability in adolescent populations and has been used in several previous studies focusing on adolescent populations with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.\nAssess the participant's nicotine usage during the past month. Rate tobacco usage on a 0-5 scale with 0 = abstinent and 5 = 20+ cigarettes per day.\n3. Handwriting Task\nRun Neuroscript MovAlyzeR software with a tablet computer and a noninking pen.\nCreate an example of LLeeLLee on a notecard (see Figure 1).\n\tNote: The software and stimulus are described previously and have been shown to be valid tools for detecting movement abnormalities in schizophrenia patients and Parkinson's patients15-17.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50852/50852fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of the test condition. Participants are instructed to write the word LLeeLLee in cursive in the MID section. It is helpful to have an example such as this to show the participant so that they understand the instructions.\nLeave the example notecard visible to the participant throughout the experiment. Note: The notecard will help the participant understand the experiment.\nOrient tablet into landscape mode to provide a writing space of 18 cm x 28 cm with a resolution of 1,280 x 800 pixels.\nAllow participants to position computer screen into a comfortable writing position.\nSet the sampling rate in the software to the measured sampling rate (e.g. 100-200 Hz).\nInstruct participant to write the word LLeeLLee in cursive in the 2 cm guidelines with the dominant hand.",
    "Note: The condition is programmed to divide the writing surface into 4 regions. There are horizontal lines measuring 1 cm, 2 cm, and 4 cm. The 1 cm region is marked TOP. The 2 cm region is marked MID, and the 4 cm region is marked BOT. Participants will use the MID section for all three trials.\nKeep instructions visible during each trial.\n\tNote: The instructions for the task are displayed at the top of the monitor and are as follows: \"DH lleellee MID Normal Speed\". The participant should be told prior to starting the program that these instructions mean to write the word LLeeLLee in the MID section with the dominant hand and at a comfortable handwriting speed. Also note that the software will redo trial automatically if the participant makes an error while writing.\n4. Processing Trials\nProcess trials using a Fast Fourier Transform Low Pass 12 Hz filter, with a 1.75 Sharpness, 1 Lump decimates sample, and 1 Up-sample Factor. Remove trailing pen lift and rotate to horizontal baseline. Set additional counter clockwise rotation when segmenting at vertical velocity to zero radians.\n\tNote: The handwriting analysis software will automatically incorporate these processing steps if they are selected within the program options.\nSummarize the absolute values of target variables LLeeLLee at two centimeters for Average Normalized Jerk (ANJ) per Trial. Collapse across trial and stroke.",
    "Note: The ANJ is a measure of movement dysfluency. Higher ANJ indicates greater dysfluency (See Figure 2). The dysfluency measure is based on the vertical component of the jerk (in cm/sec3), i.e. the 3rd time derivative of vertical position of the pen tip. Dysfluencies are caused by sudden changes in force. The 2nd time derivative, which is acceleration, is proportional to the net muscle force (if friction is neglected). Therefore, the 3rd time derivative is proportional to the force changes. To obtain an overall measure of dysfluency the vertical jerk is squared and integrated across the duration of a stroke (unit is cm2/sec5). To make this measure independent upon the duration and the vertical size of the stroke, multiply the integral by the 5th power of stroke duration (unit is sec5) and the inverse of the vertical size squared (unit is 1/cm2). The result is therefore unitless. Normalized jerk describes the shape of the acceleration curve irrespective of width and height. Take the square root of the end result to make ANJ proportional with jerk\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50852/50852eq1.jpg\nThe ANJ of a trial is defined by the average of the normalized jerk estimates across all up and down strokes of a trial 23.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50852/50852fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Trial from a control participant. Each trial is divided into 16 strokes. The segmentation of stroke for analysis of average normalize jerk is illustrated with the first pen stroke (in blue). A blue bracket outlines the stroke, and circles denote the start and stop of the stroke segment.

Statistical Analysis\nEmploy independent two tailed t-tests and chi-square tests to examine differences between groups in continuous and categorical demographic variables, respectfully. If necessary, adjust for inequalities of variance by Levene's test.",
    "Employ an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for nicotine use and gender with group (UHR and Control) as the independent variable and ANJ collapsed across trial.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
