    "1. Day 1: Inoculation and Acclimation of Cultures\nInoculate 3 mL of liquid lysogeny broth (LB, see Supplementary Table 1) with a scrape of ice from the E. coli MG1655 glycerol stock (18% glycerol, -80 °C). Shake the LB culture at 120 rpm for ~7 h at 37 °C.\nNOTE: In this experiment, E. coli K12 MG1655 growing in LB is used, but this assay can be performed with any E. coli strain or any other culturable microbial species. Incubation temperature, incubation times, and nutrient level of the growth media may all be subject to variation by species or strain.\nDilute the culture 2,000-fold using the saline solution. Add 100 µL of the diluted solution to three 50 mL screw cap conical bottom polymer tubes (50 mL tubes) with 10 mL of liquid Davis minimal medium (DM, see the Supplementary Table 1), respectively containing 80 mg/L, 125 mg/L, or 250 mg/L of glucose. This is the same medium (i.e., environment) in which the mutation rate will be estimated. Shake the cultures at 120 rpm overnight at 37 °C.\nNOTE: The choice of media is subject to variation by species, strain, or research question.\n2. Day 2: Generation of Mutants in Parallel Cultures\nFirst, prepare the environments in which the bacteria will be cultured. Always prepare 10% more than required (i.e., twenty 1 ml cultures require 22 mL). Prepare 22 mL of 1) DM with 80 mg/L of glucose, 2) DM with 125 mg/L of glucose, 3) DM with 250 mg/L of glucose, 4) DM with 80 mg/L of glucose, and 5) DM with 250 mg/L of glucose in five 50 mL tubes. Label them as GLC-80A, GLC-125, GLC-250A, GLC-80B, and GLC-250B, respectively.",
    "Prepare inocula for the environments. Ensure that the inoculum for 1 mL of the environment contains 1,000−5,000 cells. Do this by following the steps below.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) of overnight cultures (from step 1.2) at 600 nm.\nDilute each overnight culture in order to reach a final density of 1,000-5,000 cells per mL of DM with glucose. In our hands, if the OD measured in 2.2.1 is 0.3, this means making a 100-fold dilution (in saline solution) of the overnight culture, then adding 11µl of this solution to the 22 mL environment.\nPrepare parallel cultures.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is written for one 96 deep well plate, performing five fluctuation assays (the maximum reasonable number on one 96 well plate), using three environments. With experience, multiple deep-well plates may be run in parallel.\n\t\nCreate a random layout of parallel cultures for one 96 deep well plate. The Supplementary R script LayoutGenerator.R (see the layout in Figure 1B) can be used for this. Position each parallel culture on the 96 deep well plate according to the layout.\nNOTE: Running the LayoutGenerator.R will ensure that the first assay has 20 parallel cultures, and that the second, third, fourth, and fifth assays have 19 parallel cultures each.\nTransfer 1 mL of inoculated media into each well of a 96 deep well plate according to the randomized layout.\nFix the lid of the deep well plate with the tape. Do not fix the lid tightly, because the culture growth is sensitive to the amount of aeration.\nWeigh the entire plate with the lid and the tape and shake the plate at 250 rpm for 24 h at 37 °C. Place 2 L of distilled water in the incubator to stabilize the amount of evaporation among experimental sets.",
    "Determine the inoculum size by plating 10 µL of each of the inoculated media on the non-selective Tetrazolium (TA) agar plate (see Supplementary Table 1). Use a sterile L-shaped spreader until the agar surface is dry. Incubate TA agar plates lid down overnight at 37 °C.\nNOTE: TA agar is a rich agar that contains the sugar L-arabinose and the water-soluble dye 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, which is colorless in its oxidized form. When bacteria reduce the dye, it turns red due to the formation of formazan. Colonies on TA agar that cannot utilize L-arabinose are dark red. Other strains, such as MG1655, are pinkish. Use of TA agar rather than standard LB agar is recommended because colored bacterial colonies are easier to spot, which makes colony counting more reliable and quicker.\nPrepare selective TA agar containing rifampicin in 6 well plates. Pipette 5 mL of the selective TA agar into each well of the 6 well plates. Prepare the antibiotic rifampicin just before it is added to the TA agar.\n\tNOTE: When cycloserine is used as a marker, use Davis minimal medium with 250 mg/L of glucose supplemented with agar and L-arabinose and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride as a selective agar. Namely, TA agar does not select only cells that are resistant to cycloserine, because tryptone and yeast extract (both the essential components of TA agar) contain the amino acid D-alanine. This amino acid antagonizes the antimicrobial effect of the cycloserine and allows all cells to make a colony.\n\t\nLeave the selective and remaining non-selective plates in the dark (e.g., in a box) at room temperature.\n3. Day 3: Plating Cultures on Selective and Non-selective Agar Plates",
    "Count colony forming units (CFU) on the non-selective agar plates and determine the size of the inocula by multiplying CFU by 100. This is a ratio between a volume of the parallel culture (1 mL = 1,000 µL) and the plated volume (10 µL).\nNOTE: If non-selective plates are stored refrigerated the CFU can be counted later.\nAfter 24 h of incubation, weigh the entire deep well plate to determine the amount of evaporation. This is likely to be around 10%.\nCalculate the average volume of a parallel culture after 24 h of incubation (V[24h]) in microliters using a starting volume V[0h] = 1,000 µl and the plate's weight converted into microliters, where the density of the growth medium is measured in mg/µl. This study uses a density of 1 mg/µl:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60406/60406eq1.jpg\nTransfer the three randomly chosen cultures per assay (15 in total, highlighted with a black circle in the layout in Figure 1B) into labeled microcentrifuge tubes. Leave them on the bench to be used later (see step 3.6) for determining the final population size (or Nt).\nPlate the remaining 81 parallel cultures from the deep well plate onto the selective TA agar containing rifampicin. Pipette one entire parallel culture from the 96 deep well plate into one well of a 6-well plate. Ensure that any 6 well plate contains parallel cultures from more than one fluctuation assay.\nRemove the lids from the selective agar plates, and leave uncovered in sterile conditions. Dry out all the liquid on the surface of the selective TA agar.\nNOTE: The agar being completely dry is critical. However, do not overdry the selective TA agar, because it must not be allowed to crack.",
    "While the selective TA agar plates are drying, which can take up to several hours, determine Nt of the 15 cultures prepared in step 3.4 using colony forming units (CFU).\nDetermine CFU by diluting the cultures from the microcentrifuge tubes. Use five 10-fold dilution steps, mixing and vortexing 900 µL of saline solution with 100 µL of the culture on each step. Plate 40 µL of the last dilution (with a dilution factor of 105) on the non-selective TA agar and incubate plates lid down overnight at 37 °C.\nNOTE: The dilution series in 96 well plates can be performed with a multichannel pipette, which can increase the speed of this step.\nOnce all the wells on a 6 well plate are free of the culture liquid, put the lid back on and place the 6 well plate with the lid down on the bench until all 6 well plates are dry. Once all are dry, incubate the plates lid down at 37 °C for 44-48 h.\nNOTE: For other markers (nalidixic acid, cycloserine, hygromycin B, or 5-FOA) incubate the plates for 68-72 hours. Make sure that the humidity in the incubator is high. It is critical that the selective agar plates not dry out during the incubation period.\n4. Day 4: Determination of the Number of the Cells in the Cultures\nCount the CFU on the non-selective agar plates. Estimate the number of viable cells in the culture by multiplying the CFU with the dilution factor (105) and ratio between the calculated average volume V[24h] in microliters (see step 3.3) and plated volume (40 µl):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60406/60406eq2.jpg\nNt of a particular genotype growing in a particular environment is the mean of these values from the three cultures.\n5. Day 5: Estimation of the Mutation Rate",
    "Count the number of colonies resistant to the antibiotic on the selective TA agar plates (i.e., the numbers of resistant cells that arose through spontaneous mutation in the deep-well plate on days 2−3). Record the distribution among parallel cultures of the observed number of mutants for a particular assay (e.g., 16 or 17 values, including zero counts).\n\tNOTE: If selective plates are stored refrigerated, colonies resistant to the antibiotic can be counted later.\n\t\nUse each distribution to estimate the number of mutational events, m, using the R-package flan36.\nNOTE: There is also the R-package rSalvador with similar functionality29.\nSave the distribution of the observed mutants for one assay in a text file as a single column.\nUse Shinyflan software (http://shinyflan.its.manchester.ac.uk/) to estimate m as detailed below.\nIn the tab Hypothesis Testing leave values as defaults (i.e., Unknown Fitness ticked, Estimation Method = Maximum Likelihood (ML), Distribution of Mutant Lifetime = Exponential (LD model), Winsor Parameter = 1,024, Mutation Number and Fitness = 1, Confidence Level = 0.95, Number of Class and Maximal Value = 100).\nClick Browse and select the text file with the distribution of observed mutants. Try first with the Supplementary Data file.\nAfter uploading the file, click on Perform Test. On the right side under the Result of the Test, under the One Sample ML-Test (LD model), find the Mutation Number. This is m, the expected number of mutational events.\nUnder the 95 Percent Confidence Interval for the Mutation Number find the upper and lower bound of m.",
    "Once m and Nt (determined by CFU) are available, estimate the mutation rate of a particular genotype in a particular environment as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60406/60406eq3.jpg. Divide the upper and lower bounds on m by Nt in the same way to generate confidence intervals on the mutation rate (NB this does not account for the uncertainty in Nt).\nNOTE: Results are presented as the mutation rate per rpoB locus per generation. Mutation rate per base pair is generated by dividing the mutation rate per rpoB locus by 79, which is our current knowledge of how many point mutations within an rpoB gene confer resistance to rifampicin37. Multiplying the mutation rate per nucleotide by the size of the chromosome (E. coli K-12 MG1655 = 4,639,675 bp), gives the mutation rate per genome.\nRepeat steps 5.1−5.3 with the remaining four fluctuation assays."
