Synchronized real-time translocation measurement The upper graph shows the luminescence recording for a translocation experiment with oxidized pOA-mDHFR-p86 after mixing ATP, GST-dark, and SecYEG/SecA proteoliposomes containing encapsulated 11S. Closed orange circles are the data used to calculate a fit (black line) based on our detailed model (see Data analysis). Open orange circles are data points that were eliminated from the analysis due to an unusually high variance. The initial increase in luminescence results from side reactions that occur while stalled translocation substrate accumulates.",
    "Arrowheads indicate the addition of extra GST-dark and DTT to the reaction, as described in the Procedure (Section D). Additional GST-dark quenches any 11S protein that is accessible on the outside of the proteoliposomes. DTT reduces the substrate protein, restarting translocation and resulting in an increase in luminescence. The graph on the bottom shows the residuals from the fit."
