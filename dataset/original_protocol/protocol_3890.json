Lymphoprep/Ficoll with a density of 1.077g/mL is used in this protocol (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/831-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Lymophoprep/Ficoll separation demonstration and expected layering after centrifugation\n(A) Illustration of layering of Lymophoprep/Ficoll and diluted bone marrow before and after centrifugation in a SepMate tube.\n(B) Picture of separated layers of bone marrow after centrifugation.\nAdd 22 mL Lymphoprep/Ficoll to the 50 mL SepMate Tube by carefully pipetting it through the central hole of the SepMate insert without creating bubbles.\nDilute BMA with an equal volume of 2% FBS/DPBS and mix gently with wide-bore pipette.\nNote: The maximum volume of diluted BMA is 8 mL for SepMate-15 and 34 mL for SepMate-50.\nOverlay diluted BMA to Lymphoprep/Ficoll in the SepMate tube by slowly pipetting it down the side of the tube slightly above liquid level.\nCritical: Mixing diluted BMA and density gradient may result in incomplete separation or loss of cells and recovery will decrease.\nCentrifuge tube at 1200 × g for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C), with brake off.\nCritical: It is important that the brake is off otherwise the buffy layer of mono-nuclear cells (MNCs) will be disrupted and recovery will decrease.\nCritical: Polycythemia vera samples with high red blood cell (RBC) counts may require additional RBC lysis. The enriched cell layer (layer above the SepMate barrier) should be poured off into a new tube before lysing the RBCs using eBioscience 1X RBC Lysis Buffer. The manufacturer’s protocol can be found here: https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F00-4333.pdf&title=VGVjaG5pY2FsIERhdGEgU2hlZXQ6IDFYIFJCQyBMeXNpcyBCdWZmZXI=[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F00-4333.pdf&title=VGVjaG5pY2FsIERhdGEgU2hlZXQ6IDFYIFJCQyBMeXNpcyBCdWZmZXI=]\nRemove the top layer of plasma/platelet and move the buffer layer containing MNCs to a new 50 mL tube.",
    "Top up the MNCs to 45 mL with 2% FBS/PBS and mix well with a wide-bore pipette.\nCentrifuge MNCs at 300 × g for 12 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C), with low brake.\nRemove and discard supernatant.\nTop up the MNCs again until 45 mL with 2% FBS/PBS and mix well with a wide-bore pipette.\nCentrifuge MNCs at 120 × g for 12 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C), with no brake\nCritical: If excess platelets remain (common when samples are from patients with essential thrombocythemia), repeat steps 9 and 10 once. Excess platelets can be identified by visual inspection of the supernatant after step 10. If the supernatant appears cloudy, we identify the sample as having excess platelets.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend MNC in 1 mL of EasySep buffer on ice, mix with a wide-bore pipette.\nMeasure cell concentration with a hemocytometer and an automatic cell counter.\nMagnetic-beads cell enrichment\nTiming: 45 min\nThe subsequent steps are performed to obtain a single-cell suspension of CD34+ cells.\nAdd MNCs (at concentration of >108 cells/mL) to 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube.\nAdd 100 μL EasySep Human CD34 Positive Selection Cocktail to the sample.\nCritical: If sample volume is greater than 1 mL, add the selection cocktail at a ratio of 100 μL per 1 mL of sample.\nIncubate the sample at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 10 min.\nVortex EasySep Dextran RapidSpheres for 30 s immediately before use.\nAdd 75 μL of EasySep Dextran RapidSpheres to the sample (Van Egeren et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCritical: If sample volume is greater than 1 mL, add the RapidSpheres at a ratio of 75 μL per 1mL of sample.\nMix the sample and incubate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 5 min.\nTop up the sample to 2.5 mL with EasySep Buffer.",
    "Place the tube containing the sample in an EasySep magnet and incubate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 3 min.\nDiscard supernatant by inverting the magnet with the tube inside.\nRinse the tube with EasySep buffer.\nNote: Rinse the side of the tube to achieve maximum recovery.\nRepeat steps 19 to 22 four more times.\nResuspend MNC in 1 mL of EasySep buffer on ice, mix with a wide-bore pipette.\nMeasure cell concentration and cell viability with a hemocytometer and an automatic cell counter. The target final concentration is 700–1,200 cells/μL. The typical percent CD34+ cells viability obtained by following this procedure ranges from 85%–95% based on trypan blue staining.\nNote: Measuring cell concentration with both a manual hemocytomter and an automatic cell counter is recommended to minimize the counting error.\nKeep isolated cells on ice and proceed immediately to the 10× Genomic Chromium Single Cell protocol.\nChromium single cell 3′ GEM cDNA and library construction\nTiming: 45 min\nGenerate the full transcriptomic libraries according to 10× Genomic Chromium Single Cell v3 manufacturer’s protocol.

Illumina sequencing adaptors are subsequently added to the amplified products by PCR (PCR 4–5). Libraries are then quantified on an Agilent Tapestation or Bioanalyzer. (Tapestation traces can be found in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/831-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

However, other Agilent ScreenTapes or Agilent Bioanalyzer reagents can be used for quantifying the libraries. If a TapeStation or Bioanalyzer is not available, quantification can be done by running a 2%–3% agarose gel with appropriate ladder. Quantification with NanoDrop and Qubit is not sufficient due to the lack of the fragment size information.\nSequence the locus-specific library using the following cycles:\nRead 1 28 cycles\nI7 Index 8 cycles\nI5 index 0 cycles\nRead 2 91 cycles\nNote: The locus-specific library can be pooled with the transcriptome library for sequencing or be sequenced alone. We sequence the pooled transcriptome and locus-specific libraries on a NovaSeq SP Flowcell (800 million reads) and the locus specific libraries are usually allocated with 2% of the total reads (16 million reads). The libraries can also be sequenced on MiSeq Flowcells for testing and troubleshooting. Please take into account the multiple peaks in fragment size distribution when calculating library concentration."
