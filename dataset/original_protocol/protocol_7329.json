    "Part I: HIV-1 viral particle preparation Note: This protocol is reproduced from Márquez et al. (2019). Producing HIV-1 viral particles (2.5 days)Note: The combination of plasmids used in this protocol results in the production of viral particles that lack envelope proteins and are non-infectious. Procedures should be done in accordance with local biosafety regulations for producing virus-like particles. All the following steps are performed in a biosafety cabinet. Culture HEK-293T cells as follows:Thaw a vial of HEK-293T cells by gently agitating in a 37 °C water bath for 2 min or until completely thawed.Remove the vial from the water bath, decontaminate the tube by spraying with 70% ethanol, and transfer the vial to the interior of a biosafety cabinet to work in aseptic conditions.Transfer the thawed cells to a centrifuge tube containing 9 mL of cell culture media (see Recipes).Spin at 125 × g for 10 min and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet with 5 mL of culture media and transfer to a T25 cell culture flask.Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the tissue culture incubator.Passage the cells when confluency reaches approximately 80%–90% by performing a dilution of 1:10 per passage. This should be done every two to three days.Note: Do not exceed 20 passages. In a 15 mL conical tube, prepare DNA solution for transfection by mixing 6.6 μg of pNL4.3-iGFP-∆Env plasmid, 3.3 μg of psPAX2 plasmid, and 60 μL of 1 mg/mL PEI Max solution in a final volume of 500 μL of 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. Incubate the mixture for 30 min at room temperature to allow formation of DNA/PEI complexes.Split the HEK-293T cell culture as follows:Heat 1× PBS, 1× trypsin–EDTA, and culture media to 37 °C.Remove the culture media and wash the cell monolayer with 1× PBS.",
    "Add 1× trypsin–EDTA (typically 1 mL for a T25 cell culture flask) and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.Stop the trypsin digestion by adding new culture media and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.Take a sample to count cells using the Neubauer cell counter and determine the total number of cells in the tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in the appropriate volume of fresh culture media to obtain a concentration of 7 × 106 cells/mL.Gently add 1 mL of cell suspension to the DNA/PEI mix and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Plate the cells/DNA/PEI mixture drop by drop in a 10 cm2 culture dish containing 6.5 mL of culture media. Slightly shake the dish to distribute the cells homogeneously. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 h.Collect the virus-containing supernatant in a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 2,100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris.Collect the supernatant and transfer to a new conical tube. The final volume of the cleared virus-containing medium should be approximately 7 mL.Notes:  Handling of viral particles must always be done wearing gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment, which should be discarded according to local biosafety regulations. To verify the presence of fluorescent HIV particles in the supernatant, dilute the supernatant 1 in 100 in PBS and then spinoculate 200 μL of the virus preparation onto a poly-L-lysine-coated glass bottom plate well at 1,200 × g and 4 °C for 60 min. Inspect for fluorescent dots with a 60× objective in a fluorescence microscope.",
    "The number of viral particles per surface area can be determined by counting the number of fluorescent dots in at least four fields of view. The particle concentration can then be obtained by multiplying the number of particles per surface area by the surface area of the well (to obtain the number of particles per well) and then dividing this number by the volume of supernatant added to the well (0.2 mL). Purifying the HIV-1 viral particles by size exclusion chromatography (1 day)Connect a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-500 HR size exclusion chromatography column to the FPLC system. All solutions used for FPLC should be passed through a filtration membrane with 0.2 μm pore size for the removal of particulates and to degas the solutions.Replace the storage solution (usually 20% ethanol) with 2 column volumes (CV) of purified water and then equilibrate the column with 2 CV of HBS pH 7.5. Monitor the absorption at 280 nm. Flow rate: 1 mL/min.Note: This step should be started the day before collecting the viral particles, as it takes approximately 8 h for the column to be equilibrated. Load the viral particles (approximately 6.5 mL) onto the column using a 10 mL super loop. Monitor the absorption at 280 nm. Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min.Elute the sample with HBS pH 7.5 and collect 1 mL fractions until a total of 1.5 CV is reached (approximately 6 h). A representative elution profile is shown in Figure 1.Combine the fractions corresponding to the first small peak that contains the viral particles (typically around fractions 34–39 or C10–D3 on a microwell plate, see Figure 1).Purified viral particles can be used within seven days if they are stored at 4 °C. Alternatively, make 200–500 μL aliquots and store at -80 °C (no flash freezing in liquid nitrogen needed).",
    "Frozen samples can be thawed on ice before use.Wash the column with 2 CV of purified water and then 2 CV of storage solution.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4536/bioprotoc-12-20-4536-g001.jpgFigure 1. Representative elution profile of HIV-1 viral particles by size exclusion chromatography. Chromatographic separation of HIV-1 viral particles from culture media proteins. The first small peak (fractions C10–D3, marked with a red asterisk) corresponds to the HIV-1 viral particles. Reproduced from Márquez et al. (2019).Part II: Negative staining of viral particles stabilized with IP6 Preparing reagents for negative staining (1 h)Thaw viral particles and concentrate the particles 40–60-fold using the Amicon concentrator Ultra-4 at 4,000 × g and 4 °C, at 10 min per spin (Figure 2A1). Resuspend after each cycle to prevent clumping until the final volume is achieved.Note: For example, the pooled SEC fractions C10–D3 (approximately 9.5 mL) in Figure 1 were concentrated to a final volume of 160 μL. Thaw a solution of uranyl formate (1% w/v in water) and centrifuge at 18,000 × g and room temperature for 30 min to remove the precipitate. Transfer the supernatant to a clean Eppendorf tube wrapped in aluminum foil to protect uranyl formate from light (Figure 2A2).Note: Uranyl formate can be replaced by uranyl acetate. Prepare the Corning Cell-Tak cell tissue adhesive solution (100 μL) by mixing 3.34 μL of 1.5 mg/mL of Cell-Tak tissue adhesive, 93 μL of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, and 1.73 μL of 1 M NaOH (Figure 2A3).Dilute perfringolysin O in HBS to a final concentration of 20 µM and keep at room temperature.Passivating the electron microscope (EM) grid with Cell-Tak (0.5 h)Pick up a Carbon Type B electron microscope grid with reverse action tweezers and place them onto the Pelco easiGlow TEM grid holder block with the carbon (dark) side facing up.",
    "Insert the grid holder block into the Pelco easiGlow 91000 Discharge Cleaning System and glow discharge the grid on AUTO setting.Apply 5 μL of the Cell-Tak adhesive solution to a glow-discharged EM grid on the carbon (dark) side of the grid and invert the grid on a layer of parafilm so that the grid floats upside down. Alternatively, a drop of Cell-Tak solution can be placed onto parafilm followed by inverting the grid onto the drop for incubation.Incubate the Cell-Tak on the EM grid for 5 min (Figure 2B).Negative staining of viral particles (0.5 h)Prepare viral particle solution by mixing 9.5 μL of concentrated viral particles, 0.25 μL of IP6 (4 mM), and 0.25 μL of PFO (20 µM). The final concentration of PFO is 500 nM and of IP6 is 1 mM. This is sufficient for the preparation of two grids.Note: The IP6 is prone to precipitation in the presence of divalent cations. If necessary, the IP6 concentration can be lowered to 0.1 mM, or it can be replaced by mellitic acid (hexacarboxybenzene) to stabilize the capsids. Incubate the viral particle solution in a water bath (37 °C) for 10 min for PFO to form pores on the membrane (Figure 2C1).Wick dry a Cell-Tak-coated EM grid with a small piece of filter paper.Apply 5 μL of the incubated viral particle solution to the side coated with Cell-Tak and incubate at room temperature for 1 min (Figure 2C2).Wick dry the sample using filter paper.Apply 5 μL of uranyl formate (1%, supernatant, free from aggregates) and wick dry immediately with filter paper (Figure 2C3).Repeat step 6 twice.",
    "Allow the sample to air dry and store at room temperature in a 100 mm bacterial Petri dish lined with a filter paper for 10 min; then, transfer the grid to the EM grid box.Load sample onto the FEI Tecnai G2 and image at condenser aperture of 3 and objective aperture of 1 or 3, at 19,500× magnification (Figure 2C4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221019/20221019182015_3110.jpgFigure 2.
