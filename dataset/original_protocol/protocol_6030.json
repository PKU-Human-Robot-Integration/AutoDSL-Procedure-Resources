    "Oligo designation Select 20 nt length sgRNA upstream of NGG within -100 to -400 of the target gene’s TSS The following parameters should be considered to ensure the quality of sgRNAs:TTTT sequence should not be in 20 nt sgRNA sequence because it is the transcriptional termination signal.To avoid off-target, ≥ 18 nt of the targeting sequence of sgRNA should not match to other genomic loci.The optimal sgRNA normally carries high GC content, usually over 50%.To synthesize the 20 nt DNA sequence, the overhang sequence 5’-TTCG-3’ from BbsI should be added into forward primer and 5’-aaac-3’ to the reverse complement primer.e.g., 5’-NNNAGCAATCGACATGCAAGCGGCTCGGAGCCAGGGCACCTGCNNN-3’(Underlined AGG is the PAM sequence)Forward: 5’-ttcgCATGCAAGCGGCTCGGAGCC-3’Reverse: 5’-aaacGGCTCCGAGCCGCTTGCATG-3’ Resuspend oligos with ddH2O to final 20 µM and set up the annealing reaction:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190115/20190115001137_0744.jpgBackbone preparationBbsI is used to linearize flySAM vector.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190115/20190115001838_7838.jpgRun 1.5% agarose gel. Two bands should be visible (Figure 2), one is about 700 bp (this spacer can help to evaluate the cutting efficiency and later on to select correct clones by PCR, as the size of PCR product from correct clone is different from incorrect clone), another is about 14 kb. Cut and collect the 14 kb band and extract the backbone by AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction kit following the standard protocol. Elute DNA with 50 µl ddH2O, measure the DNA concentration with NanoDrop 2000, should be around 50 ng/µl.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190115/20190115000959_8074.jpgFigure 2.

    "jpgRun agarose gel, one band should be about 2 kb (if two sgRNAs together), another is about 13 kb if the plasmid is right.Purification and microinjectionFor microinjection, the plasmid (~10 mg) should be purified. PurePlasmid Mini Kit is used according to the producer’s specifications. The plasmid DNA is finally eluted in 70 µl of 1x Injection Buffer. The appropriate concentration of each sample is 100 ng/µl-200 ng/µl, which can be determined by NanoDrop 2000.Prepare the injected embryos and inject the transgene vector into the embryos of tool flies as standard procedure (Chromosome II y sc v nanos-integrase; attP40. Chromosome III y sc v nanos-integrase;; attP2) (Ni et al., 2011).The injected embryos should be kept at 25 °C and 60% humidity to adulthood (G0).Selection for transgenic flyBoth ♂ G0 and ♀ G0 should be crossed to opposite sex of y sc v;;. Since the flySAM transgenes carry a copy of vermillion (v+), which rescues the mutant vermillion (v) allele inherited from the injection stock. Thus transformants will have a dark red wild type (v+) eye color and the v+ G1 should be picked (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190115/20190115001023_3146.jpgFigure 3. Eye color screening marker. The transformants have a dark red wild type (v+) eye color (left) while flies that haven’t been genetically modified have a light red (v-) eye color (right).For G1♂ transformants from ♂ G0 follow these sequential stepsCross the siblings to the virgin ♀ of y sc v;; Dr, e/TM3, sb (for 3rd chromosome insertions) or y sc v; Gla Bc/CyO (for 2nd chromosome insertions).Collect ♂ and virgin ♀ siblings that have v+ (wild type) eye color and CyO or TM3 and cross them to each other.Keep the homozygous flies (keep the stock as balanced heterozygotes in case the homozygous flies are unhealthy).",
