    "All procedures involving mice adhered to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition, National Academies Press, Washington DC, 2011) and were reviewed and approved by the University of Tennessee Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Implantation of Recording Electrodes and Initial Data Collection\nPurchase mice and keep them in a humidity- and temperature-controlled room with ad libitum access to food and water. Allow mice to adapt to their new environment for one week before surgical implantation of recording electrodes. The implantation procedure has been described in detail1,14.\nSterilize all surgical equipment.\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane at 2.5%−3% delivered in 100% oxygen.\nFollowing the loss of the righting reflex, remove the mouse from the anesthesia induction chamber and transfer it to a stereotaxic frame.\nApply an ophthalmic ointment to both eyes.\nReduce the isoflurane to 1.7%, continuously delivered via a mask.\nMake a midline scalp incision to expose the skull.\nDrill two craniotomies above the left and right cortex (each at stereotaxic coordinates anterior = 1.0 and lateral = 3.0 relative to the bregma15).\nInsert the EEG electrodes into each craniotomy and secure with dental acrylic.\nImplant bipolar electrodes in the dorsal trapezius muscle for recording the electromyogram (EMG).\nNOTE: The four electrodes are led to a wireless telemeter implanted subcutaneously above the lower right body quadrant. These surgical techniques can be viewed here (https://www.datasci.com/services/dsi-surgical-services/surgical-videos).\nAfter the surgery, administer analgesic carprofen and place the mouse in a warm recovery cage. Observe the mouse until it is ambulatory. House implanted mice individually.\nUpon full recovery from the surgery, handle mice daily and evaluate the quality of the EEG and EMG recordings.\nConfigure the data acquisition system to record all signals ± 1,000 mV.\nObtain EEG and EMG recordings for the duration needed.",
    "Score each 10 s bin of the digital EEG and EMG recordings as wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, or non-REM (NREM) sleep using sleep scoring software.\nNOTE: Among mouse strains there are genotype- and state-specific differences in EEG power expressed as a percentage of the total power16. In B6 mice, states of wakefulness are characterized by a 75−100 mV, mixed frequency EEG, and by EMG signals showing prominent muscle tone with large increases in amplitude during movement. Criteria for scoring NREM sleep include a reduction in EMG amplitude relative to the EMG amplitude of wakefulness. The NREM sleep EEG has a slower frequency and increased amplitude (100−150 mV) compared to wakefulness. REM sleep is characterized by muscle atonia and an EEG signal that is similar to the EEG of wakefulness.\nInstruct two individuals to independently score the same record. At least one individual should be blinded to the treatment condition. Concordance values between the two sleep scorers should be greater than 90%.\n2. Facilities and Equipment\nAmplify and digitize unfiltered EEG and EMG signals using data acquisition instrumentation and software.\nNOTE: The Chronux Spectral Analysis Toolbox developed in the Mitra Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is used to express EEG signals as power in relation to time and frequency domains.\n3. Spectrogram Computation\nIf a Windows user, use the compiled program.\nIf a Macintosh user, run the raw code file.\nObtain raw, unprocessed EEG data in either EDF or CSV file format and place it in the same location as the compiled program file.\n\t\nName the data files using the following constraints: names must consist of only letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes.\nName the data files using the following constraints: filenames must not contain periods, commas, spaces, or any other symbols.",
    "Download the compiled Multitaper Spectrogram Program (https://drive.google.com/[href=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cyb3T3IkjQvkc-H6lm__17CpRMqkTbNt?usp=sharing] or contact C. O'Brien at cobrien8@vols.utk.edu[href=https://www.jove.com/mailto:cobrien8@vols.utk.edu]).\nLaunch the spectrogram program and follow the pop-up prompts. Choose file type: *.CSV or *.EDF.\nNOTE: Further program installation details are located in the readme.txt file.\nType the entire EEG file name (e.g., 419eeg.edf or 419.eeg.csv).\nSelect parameters for spectrogram calculation: Default or New. This step requires the longest processing time as the spectrogram is being computed. The mathematical windowing function (taper) provides statistically-independent estimates of the underlying spectrum. The longer the recording duration, the longer this step will take. On a PC platform running Windows 10 this required a maximum of about 3−4 min for a 4 h recording.\n\t\nUse the following default spectrogram parameters:\n\t\tSampling frequency = 500 Hz. This represents the number of samples per second.\n\t\tfpass = 0.3 Hz and 30 Hz. Fpass defines the frequencies of input and controls the range of frequencies supplied in the output.\n\t\tPadding = 2. Padding works to finely interpolate the output without affecting the result calculation in any way. This may assist with visualization and the precise identification of spectral lines. The field is any integer from -1 and up.\n\t\tTime-bandwidth product (NW) = 15. The product of the signal temporal duration and spectral width.\n\t\tNumber of tapers = 29. When choosing number of tapers, it is essential to use 2NW-1. There is no limit on the number of tapers used. The more tapers used will result in the inclusion of tapers with poor concentration in the specified frequency bandwidth.",
    "Trial average = 1. This parameter governs whether or not trial or channel averaging is performed. If this parameter is set to 0, there is no channel averaging and the function will output independent results for each trial or channel passed as input data. However, if the trial average is set to 1, the results output to the user are averaged over trials or channels.\n\t\tTime to compute FFT ~30 s. Used to follow the evolution of the spectrum by calculating the spectrum over many small windows.\n\t\tStep size of window for FFT computation = 5. The amount the sliding time window advances after each spectrum calculation is performed.\nNOTE: The default spectrogram parameters stated in step 3.7.1 can be changed as needed.\nEnter titles for both the spectrogram and EEG.\nSave the resulting spectrogram and EEG.\n\t\nSave figures by clicking File | Save in the figure window.\nNOTE: The figures will provide program users with summaries that can be developed into publication-quality figures.\n4. Troubleshooting\nDownload the sample mouse sleep EEG data for sample spectrogram computation.\nRun program with the sample data to ensure the user is correctly using the program. Find the figures for these sample data in the appendix to ensure that the figures created from the sample data are accurate.\nNOTE: All equipment and materials used have been provided in the Table of Materials."
