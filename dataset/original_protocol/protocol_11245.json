  "procedures": [
    "All of the experiments presented herein were reviewed and approved by the appropriate ethical committees at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The use of deidentified, primary human tumors has been approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board (Protocol numbers 17-000037, 17-001169, and 11-001363). At UCLA, Animal Research Committee review is not required for experiments using chicken embryos; protocol approval is only required when the eggs will be hatched. However, best practices, such as the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals, were used to handle chicken embryos ethically and to avoid pain as much as possible. Researchers are urged to verify the oversight requirements at their institution prior to initiating studies using CAM models.\n1. Preparing the eggs\nBefore receiving the eggs, assemble and equilibrate the egg incubator to 37.8 °C (100 °F) with 60-70% humidity following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: To minimize contamination risks, autoclaved water may be used to control the humidity.\nUpon receiving fertilized, Rhode Island Red chicken eggs from a certified laboratory-grade egg supplier, dry wipe the surface of the shells with paper towels. A lightly dampened paper towel may be used to remove adhered material. Dry immediately.\n\tNOTE: Wetting the shell with liquid below 43.3 °C can introduce bacteria into the egg. If one chooses to wash or disinfect the eggs, the temperature of the liquid must be between 43.3-48.9 °C. Higher temperatures can boil the eggs. The choice of disinfectant should be made based on the microorganisms causing concern.\nUse a pencil or marker to label the date on the egg. This is considered development day 0.",
    "Place the eggs into the egg incubator and incubate for at least 7 days with rotation to permit CAM development. An automatic rotator may be used, or the eggs may be rotated 180° 2-3x per day.\n2. Opening the eggs\nNOTE: Opening of the eggs should be done when the CAM has fully developed. This is typically on development day 7 or 8.\nDisinfect a biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol. Similarly disinfect and place into the biosafety cabinet an egg rack, egg candler, marker, cordless rotary tool with a silicon carbide grinding stone and circular cutting wheel, 18 G needle, pipet controller with quarter-inch vacuum tubing, packing tape, office scissors, curved scissors, Semken (or similar) forceps, cotton balls, and 6 x 7 cm transparent film dressing. Whenever possible, use sterile, disposable or autoclaved tools.\nTurn off the egg rotator. Place approximately 1-3 eggs into the biosafety cabinet on the egg rack. While in the dark, place the egg candler against the eggshell to identify the air cell. Mark the location of the air cell.\n\tNOTE: The intensity of illumination from the egg candler is crucial for visualizing the interior of the egg. If the air cell or vasculature is consistently difficult to see, try replacing the egg candler batteries.\nMove the egg candler over the shell to find a large blood vessel network. Rotate the egg if necessary. An ideal vasculature will be branching near the middle of the egg. Use a marker to draw over the vasculature to be used for implantation.",
    "Turn on the light in the hood. Using a cordless rotary tool fitted with a silicon carbide grinding stone, drill a small hole in the shell directly over the center of the air cell. Drill until most of the shell has been removed, but the white, inner membrane is intact.\n\tNOTE: Drilling over the air cell before targeting the vasculature permits determining the thickness of that particular eggshell over the air cell rather than over the CAM and vasculature. If the CAM or vasculature is disrupted, then the egg is not useable for implantation.\nDrill and open another small hole where the vascular window will be opened as was done for the air cell (step 2.4).\nUsing an 18 G needle, gently pierce through the white, inner membrane over the air cell and vasculature. If unable to penetrate the shell, then carefully drill a little more. Ensure that the white, inner membrane (but not the CAM) is disrupted throughout the entirety of the drilled area. Removal of the membrane piece is not necessary.\n\tNOTE: If the CAM or vasculature is disrupted during this step, discard the egg. Damage is evident if there is blood or albumin leaking from a drilled hole.\nTurn off the hood light. Using the egg candler, verify that the air cell was transferred from the end of the egg to the area over the vasculature. If necessary, place the vacuum tubing inserted into a pipet controller around the hole over the original air cell and gently apply suction in short bursts to move the air cell.",
    "Use a marker to outline the new location of the air cell approximately 0.5 cm inside the air-CAM boundary. Affix a piece of packing tape just over the new air cell. If necessary, use standard office scissors to trim the tape to an appropriate size.\n\tNOTE: Tape can disrupt airflow through the shell and should not be larger than necessary to fully cover the air cell.\nReturn the eggs to the incubator to warm without rotation with the new air cell facing up. Repeat steps 2.2-2.9 for the remaining eggs to be opened.\n\tNOTE: The protocol may be paused here. If unsure of the quality of CAM development, a small number of eggs should proceed through step 2.16 prior to opening the remaining eggs.\nPlace approximately 1-3 eggs with relocated air cells onto the egg rack in the biosafety cabinet.\n\tNOTE: Care should be taken to avoid introducing contamination into the opened egg. Therefore, always open eggs inside a biosafety cabinet, and use sterile tools and equipment whenever possible.\nUsing a cordless rotary tool fitted with a circular cutting wheel, cut a small line over the air cell boundary drawn in step 2.8. Ensure that this is approximately 0.5 cm inside the actual air-CAM boundary to avoid disrupting the CAM or vasculature. Cut completely through the shell but be careful not to penetrate deeply enough to disrupt the CAM or vasculature.\nUsing curved scissors, cut around the remaining air cell to create a window in the shell.",
    "NOTE: If blood or membrane is present on the removed shell, then the egg is not suitable for implantation. If a high proportion of the eggs are not cleanly opened, consider waiting at least 1 additional day to open the remaining eggs to permit better CAM formation. If the shells of the remaining eggs have not been pierced, rotation of the eggs within the incubator should be resumed.\nVerify the viability of the embryo. Viable embryos will display extensive vasculature, clear albumin, embryo movement, or a visible heartbeat.\nUsing Semken forceps, pull small pieces of cotton from a sterile cotton ball. Gently blot the CAM surface to remove the shell dust and debris.\n\tNOTE: The removal of debris must be performed on the same day that the eggs are opened.\nCover the shell opening with a one-quarter piece of 6 x 7 cm transparent film dressing.\nReturn the eggs to the incubator. Ensure that the egg sits securely with the opened window facing up and the CAM not touching the transparent film dressing. Use a piece of egg rack, the edge of the egg rotator, or another suitable item to prop any eggs that keep rolling.\nRepeat steps 2.10-2.16 for all remaining eggs to be opened.\n\tNOTE: The opening of the eggs does not need to be completed on the same day as implantation. Waiting at least 1 day can help eliminate eggs whose viability was compromised by opening the shell.\n3. Preparing the cancer cell suspension for transplantation (option 1)",
    "NOTE: This is to be completed just prior to the implantation, which should ideally take place between days 7 and 10. Please see notes at the beginning of step 5 or 6 for further information concerning the implantation date. This approach was used for all the cell lines and cultured kidney cancer tumor digests.\nThaw the extracellular matrix solution on ice.\nUsing mechanical and/or enzymatic digestion, obtain a single cell suspension using a method appropriate for the cell type being implanted.\nResuspend the total number of cells to be implanted in an appropriate medium for implantation. Implants of 1-2 x 106 cells per egg are typical.\n\tNOTE: The medium used for the implantation of the cell lines is typically the complete medium used for culturing the cells, containing FBS or serum replacement. The implantation of tumor digests typically uses the complete medium used for culturing cell lines of the same cancer type. However, adjustments to the medium formulation may be made if needed experimentally. The effects on tumor development and growth would need to be empirically determined.\nPellet the cells using a centrifuge speed and time appropriate for the cells being used. Typical speeds are 250-300 x g, and times are 5-10 min.\nRemove the supernatant from the pelleted cells by pipetting. Mechanically resuspend the cells in the residual medium via flicking or pipetting. Place on ice to cool. Measure the volume of cells and medium using an appropriately sized pipet.\nCalculate implantation volumes such that 1-2 x 106 cells are implanted in a volume of 20-100 μL per egg with a final extracellular matrix concentration of 2.7-4 mg/mL protein. Add medium, any desired growth factors or additives, and extracellular matrix solution according to this calculation. Keep on ice until ready to implant.",
    "NOTE: For the calculations in steps 3.3 and 3.6, an extra volume of at least one-half egg implant should be incorporated to ensure an adequate volume for all eggs in the group. For implantation of the ovarian cancer cell lines (i.e., SKOV3 and ID8), 106 cells per egg were implanted. For implantation of the renal cell carcinoma cell line RENCA, cultured cells derived from digested primary human renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer cell lines (i.e., CWR, C4-2, and MyC-CaP), and bladder cancer cell lines (i.e., HT-1376 and T24), 2 x 106 cells were implanted.\n4. Preparing tumor pieces for implantation (option 2)\nNOTE: This is to be completed just prior to implantation, which should ideally take place between days 7 and 10. Please see notes at the beginning of step 5 or 6 for further information concerning the implantation date. Primary ovarian and bladder cancers were implanted as tumor pieces.\nThaw extracellular matrix solution on ice. Dilute to a final protein concentration of 2.7-4 mg/mL in an appropriate medium containing any desired growth factors or additives. Keep on ice.\n\tNOTE: Implantation of tumor pieces typically uses the complete medium used for culturing cell lines of the same cancer type. However, adjustments to the medium formulation may be done if needed experimentally. The effects on tumor engraftment and growth would need to be empirically determined.\nUsing a scalpel or scissors, excise pieces from the fresh tumor. Ideal sizes range from 2-5 mm on each side. Keep tissues immersed in the medium until ready to implant.\n5. Implantation using a nonstick ring (option 1)",
    "NOTE: Cells may be implanted beginning on development day 7 if the CAM is fully developed. Implantation can occur any time prior to hatching that permits adequate time for tumor development and the desired experiment, but note that the embryo's immune cells begin to be present around day 10 postfertilization27. Tumor growth rate varies considerably by cell type and needs to be empirically determined for the cell type of interest. The ovarian cancer and the prostate cancer cells were implanted using the nonstick ring method. Note that when a nonstick ring is not available, a pipet tip may be cut to a similar size and used.\nUse 70% ethanol to disinfect a biosafety cabinet and all the required tools: an egg rack, curved iris forceps, nonstick rings (1/4 inch inner diameter), glass stir rod, appropriate volume pipets and tips, 6 x 7 cm transparent film dressing, office scissors, and marker or pencil. Whenever possible, sterile, disposable or autoclaved tools should be used.\nPlace eggs to be implanted on an egg rack in a biosafety cabinet. Select a manageable number of eggs. Up to six is typical. Avoid allowing the eggs to cool substantially while working with them.\nRemove transparent film dressing from the shell by rolling the edges towards the open window to avoid pulling away pieces of shell. Check that the eggs are viable and healthy. Ideal eggs will have a large vessel in the center of the opened area with smaller vessels branching from it.\nUsing curved iris forceps, place a sterile, nonstick ring onto the CAM over the vessel, ideally over a branch point. Use a sterile glass stir rod to gently abrade the CAM.",
    "Pipet the cell suspension from step 3.6 into the center of the nonstick ring. Alternatively, use forceps to place a tumor piece from step 4.2 into the center of the nonstick ring and cover with 20-50 μL of the extracellular matrix solution generated in step 4.1.\nSeal the opening with a one-quarter piece of 6 x 7 cm transparent film dressing. Label the eggs with an appropriate implant designation.\n\tNOTE: Numbering the eggs within a group facilitates longitudinal observations.\nReturn the egg to the incubator. Ensure that the opening of the shell sits upright and that the egg is secure.\n\tNOTE: Eggs can be returned to an egg incubator without rotation. Alternatively, high postimplant viability can be obtained using a 37-38 °C cell incubator with the CO2 deactivated and a hygrometer to monitor the humidity, which should be 50%-80%.\n6. Implantation without a nonstick ring (option 2)\nNOTE: Cells may be implanted beginning on development day 7 if the CAM is fully developed. Implantation can occur any time prior to hatching that permits adequate time for tumor development and the desired experiment, but note that the embryo's immune cells begin to be present around day 10 postfertilization27. This method was used for implanting the renal cell carcinoma cells and the bladder cancer cells.\nUse 70% ethanol to disinfect a biosafety cabinet and all required tools: appropriate volume pipets and tips, sterile 10-cm tissue culture dishes, egg rack, 6 x 7 cm transparent film dressing, office scissors, and marker.\nAspirate an inoculation volume of the cell suspension generated in step 3.6 into an appropriately sized pipet tip (200 μL is typical). While holding the top portion of the tip, carefully eject the pipet tip and place horizontally into a sterile, 10-cm tissue culture dish.",
    "Repeat step 6.2 for all samples within a group with one dish for each group.\nPlace tips into a 37 °C incubator for 15-30 min to allow the extracellular matrix to partially polymerize.\nAfter 15 min of incubation, begin checking for polymerization. A small amount of liquid typically leaks out of the tip when placed onto the dish. Polymerization of this liquid can be used to estimate the extent of polymerization of the liquid within the tip.\nPlace the eggs to be implanted on an egg rack in a biosafety cabinet. Select a manageable number of eggs. Up to six is typical. Avoid allowing the eggs to cool substantially while working with them.\nRemove the transparent film dressing from the shell by rolling the edges towards the open window. This avoids pulling away pieces of shell.\nCheck that the eggs are viable and healthy. Ideal eggs will have a large vessel in the center of the opened area with smaller vessels branching from it.\nPlace one pipet tip onto an appropriately sized pipet. Depress the plunger to force the partially polymerized cell suspension onto the CAM over a large, well-developed vessel, ideally over a branch point.\nSeal the opening with a one-quarter piece of 6 x 7 cm transparent film dressing.\nLabel the egg with an appropriate implant designation.\n\tNOTE: Numbering the eggs within a group facilitates longitudinal observations.\nReturn the egg to the incubator. Ensure that the opening of the shell sits upright and that the egg is secure.\n\tNOTE: Eggs can be returned to a dedicated egg incubator without rotation. Alternatively, high postimplant viability can be obtained using a 37-38 °C cell incubator with the CO2 deactivated and a hygrometer to monitor the humidity, which should be 50%-80%.\n7. Bioluminescence imaging of firefly luciferase marked tumors",
    "NOTE: If the implanted cells were stably transduced with the gene encoding firefly luciferase or other imaging factors, then the resulting tumors may be visualized using bioluminescence imaging. Fluorescence imaging is not recommended on intact eggs due to high background from the eggshell. This is endpoint analysis, as the opening of the shell drastically reduces survival. Tumors may be imaged at any time that is appropriate for experimental needs and the speed of tumor growth. However, on average, eggs hatch 21 days postfertilization. Therefore, development day 18 is an appropriate endpoint to avoid unwanted hatching.\nIf necessary, transport eggs to the imaging facility. Tape eggs onto 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Return them to a 37.8 °C (100 °F) egg incubator with the rotation mechanism removed or deactivated. Humidity is not crucial for transport and imaging.\nUsing curved iris forceps, gently push the CAM away from the shell until the CAM is flush with the albumin and embryo. Using wide-tipped specimen forceps, break away pieces of the shell to expand the shell opening adequately for tumor visualization.\nInject a minimum of 50 μL of 30 mg/mL D-luciferin into the egg albumin. A similar volume of D-luciferin may also be pipetted into the nonstick ring or onto the surface of the CAM in the area containing the implanted cells. This ensures optimal bioluminescence in the absence of an ideal vascular supply. Incubate for 8 min.\nInject 20-50 μL of isoflurane into the albumin of the egg to anesthetize the egg. Incubate for an additional 2 min. Alternatively, the egg may be placed into an induction chamber containing 2-2.5% vaporized isoflurane. Adequate anesthesia depth is obtained when embryonic movement ceases.\n\tNOTE: Larger volumes of isoflurane (100 μL) can be used to euthanize the egg.",
    "Place eggs into a bioluminescence imaging device and image using appropriate settings as determined by the manufacturer's instructions. For this study, an exposure time of 1 min was used.\nTo image the remaining CAM and embryo, open the egg into a 10-cm tissue culture dish.\n\t\nGrasp the egg with the fingers of both hands on the underside of the egg near the middle of the egg and the thumbs on either side of the shell opening.\nGently pull apart the two halves of the egg with the thumbs while gently pressing into the egg with the fingers.\nWhen the shell is approximately half-separated from the CAM and embryo, flip the egg upside down over a 10-cm tissue culture dish.\nContinue to separate the shell halves. If the CAM sticks to the inside of the shell, gently use the fingers to push the CAM away from the shell.\nThe embryo may be flipped into another dish if desired.\nIf necessary, additional isoflurane may be administered as in step 7.4.\n8. Tumor harvesting\nNOTE: Tumors may be harvested at any time that is appropriate for the experimental needs and the speed of tumor growth. However, on average, eggs hatch 21 days postfertilization. Therefore, development day 18 is an appropriate endpoint to avoid unwanted hatching.\nGrasp tumor with forceps. Using scissors (spring iris scissors work well) or a scalpel, carefully excise tumor from CAM.\nIf the tumor has been transduced with the firefly luciferase gene, reimaging may be performed to verify successful removal of difficult-to-visualize tumors.\n\tNOTE: Excised tumors may be analyzed by any method appropriate for a particular experiment. Tumors may also be reimplanted into CAM or mice. To confirm tumor identity, tumors may be fixed, paraffin embedded, and examined with hematoxylin and eosin or immunohistochemical staining.",
