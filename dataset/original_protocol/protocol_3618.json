    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBone marrow cell isolation\nTiming: 3 h\nNote: Ensure that all the reagents and samples are kept on ice during the entire procedure. Perform all steps in a laminar flow hood with sterile equipment to maintain sterility.\nFor 2–4 whole Seahorse XF24 cell culture microplates, you will need BMDCs from one mouse.\nNote: We recommend using male 6–10 week-old mice.\nSterilize the dissection kit and bench area with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol spray. Euthanize the mice with CO2 or inhaled anesthetics, such as isoflurane or sevoflurane, followed by cervical dislocation.\nPin down the mouse to expose its abdomen. Spray the euthanized mice with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol to sterilize its skin.\nUse scissors to cut along the midline of the abdomen until exposing the femurs. Remove the femurs and tibias and place them in a dish containing PBS. (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nRemove the muscle and as much connective tissue as possible from the femurs and tibias. Place the harvested bones on a 60-mm dish filled with PBS.\nCritical: If the bone is broken or the soft tissue is inadequately removed, the number of bone marrow cells harvested may be decreased.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Collect femurs and tibias from mouse (step 3)\nThis section is shown in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nTrim both ends of the femurs and tibias carefully using sterile scissors to expose the interior marrow shaft (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nUse a 5 mL syringe to draw up to 5 mL of fresh culture medium. Attach a 21-gauge needle to the syringe. Hold the bone over a fresh 60-mm dish, with its narrow end pointing down. Flush the marrow out of the bone with 5 mL of PBS (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
    "Methods video S2. Trim both ends of the femurs and tibias (step 5)\nAspirate the marrow and the medium from the 60-mm dish and pipette up and down three times, rinsing the sides of the dish each time to disperse the marrow.\nCollect the cell suspension with the syringe and add the suspension to a 15 or 50 mL tube.\nOptional: Pass the cell suspension through a 70-μm cell strainer to remove any remaining bone or muscle fragments.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 3,000× rpm (800 × g) at 4°C for 5 min to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant by gently tilting the tube and pouring the media into a waste disposal beaker. Recap the tube and gently tap to disperse the cell pellet.\nAdd 1.0 mL / body of RBC lysis buffer to the cells and gently tap the tube with fingers to mix the lysis solution for 30–60 s. Add 10 mL of RPMI medium to dilute the buffer after RBC lysis.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 3,000× rpm (800 × g) at 4°C for 5 min to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant by gently tilting the tube and pouring the media into a waste disposal beaker. Recap the tube and gently tap to disperse the cell pellet.\nCritical: If red blood cell lysis fails, return to step 10.\nResuspend the cells in 10 mL of culture medium and place on ice. Mix the cell culture medium well and count the cells; 2–6 × 107 bone marrow cells can be collected from two tibias and two femurs.\nDay 0: Seed 2 × 106 bone marrow cells in 2 mL of culture medium onto a 12-well culture plate with 10–25 ng/mL of GM-CSF in a 37°C and humidified 5% CO2 incubator.",
    "Note: BMDCs can be cultured in a 60-mm dish (12 × 106 bone marrow cells/ 6 mL), a 100-mm dish (2 × 107 bone marrow cells/ 10 mL), or a 6-well dish (8 × 106 bone marrow cells/ 4 mL).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Collect bone marrow cell suspension (steps 6–8)\nIf you wish to culture plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) or macrophages, you can obtain pDCs and macrophages using Flt3 ligands or M-CSF at the same concentration as GM-CSF (Gotoh et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) (Sasaki et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nMyeloid dendritic cell culture\nTiming: 6–7 days\nDay 3, 5: Add 2 mL of culture media with 10–25 ng/mL GM-CSF and divide 1 well into 2 wells.\nDay 6–7: Collect the myeloid dendritic cells. We speculate that 1–3 × 107 DCs / body can be recovered.\nCritical: Be careful to avoid collecting the highly adherent cells.\nImportant: Non-BMDCs can be eliminated by early washing steps, discarding highly adherent cells, and enriching or sorting for CD11c+ cells (Helft et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: If the culture media is not added properly, the survival rate and number of the BMDCs will be reduced.\nPurification of myeloid dendritic cell\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: The percentage of CD11c+ BMDCs is approximately 60%–90%. Use the following process to obtain a more concentrated population of CD11c+ BMDCs. After this step, we speculate that 0.5–1 × 107 DCs / body can be recovered.\nNote: If you will purify CD11c+ BMDCs, refer https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/DE-en/shop/comMiltenyiDatasheet/product?productId=54985[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/DE-en/shop/comMiltenyiDatasheet/product?productId=54985].\nMix the cell culture medium well and count the cells.",
    "Centrifuge the cell suspension at 3,000× rpm (800 × g) at 4°C for 5 min to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant by gently tilting the tube and pouring the media into a waste disposal beaker. Recap the tube and gently tap to disperse the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 3,000× rpm (800 × g) at 4°C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant by gently tilting the tube and pouring the media into a waste disposal beaker. Recap the tube and gently tap to break up the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 400 μL of MACS buffer per 1–2 × 10⁸ cells.\nAdd 100 μL of CD11c MicroBeads UltraPure per 1– 2 × 10⁸ total cells.\nMix well and incubate for 10 min in the dark in the refrigerator at 2°C–8°C.\nAfter incubation, add 10 mL of MACS buffer and centrifuge the cell suspension at 3,000× rpm (800 × g) at 4°C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. Recap the tube and gently tap to disperse the cell pellet.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of MACS buffer.\nPlace an LS column in the magnetic field of the MACS Separator. Add 3 mL of MACS buffer onto the LS column to rinse the column.\nApply 1 mL of the cell suspension onto the column. After adding the cell suspension, wash the LS column three times with 3 mL MACS buffer each.\nRemove the LC column from the MACS Separator and place it on a 15 mL collection tube.\nApply 5 mL of MACS buffer onto the column. Immediately flush out the CD11chigh mDCs by firmly pushing the plunger into the column.",
    "Optional: If you use the autoMACS® Pro Separator, refer to the corresponding user’s manual on using the autoMACS® Pro Separator.\nNote: After collecting the CD11chigh mDCs, we recommend checking the purity of BMDCs by flow cytometry. If you will check the purity of BMDCs, refer https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/cell-surface-flow-cytometry-staining-protocol[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/cell-surface-flow-cytometry-staining-protocol].\nHydration of a Seahorse XFe sensor cartridge\nPlace the assay cartridge upside down next to a 24-well utility plate. Add 1.0 mL of XF calibrant solution to each well of the 24-well utility plate.\nPut the cartridge back onto the utility plate and the sensor cartridge with the lid.\nPlace it in a 37°C incubator without CO2 to hydrate for 4–48 h. To prevent evaporation of the water, verify that the incubator is properly humidified.\nNote: The sensor cartridge should be hydrated for at least 4 h before assay. However, we do not recommend using an XFe sensor cartridge after >48 h of hydration.\nPreparation of poly-L-lysine-coated microplates\nNote: If you use non-adherent cells including BMDCs, we recommend this step. The adhesion of cells to a plate affects the accuracy of the experiment.\nApply 50 μL of 0.01% poly-L-Lysine (PLL) or poly-D-Lysine (PDL) to the wells of the 24-well XF cell culture microplate. Tap the microplate to ensure that the liquid completely covers the bottom of the well.\nIncubate the microplate with the PLL or PDL solution for at least 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the PLL or PDL solution by aspiration and thoroughly rinse the bottom of the plate with sterile water. Dry for at least 2 h before seeding cells.",
    "Note: If you use PLL, please check this information on the Sigma Aldrich website (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biofiles/poly-lysine-product.html[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biofiles/poly-lysine-product.html]).

Discard the supernatant by gently tilting the tube and pouring the media into a waste disposal beaker. Recap the tube and gently tap to disperse the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in XF assay medium at a density of approximately 2 × 106 /mL. Mix the cell suspension well and seed 100 μL of it on a PLL-coated 24-well XF microplate without a blank well.\nNote: This protocol describes measuring oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and ECAR at 2 × 105 BMDCs/well using an XF24 analyzer. If you would like to analyze only OCR, you will obtain the results by reducing the number of mDCs used. If you would like to analyze splenic dendritic cells or plasmacytoid dendritic cells, you should seed 2–5 × 105 mDCs/well.\nCentrifuge the microplate for 2–5 min at 2000 rpm at room temperature to allow the cells to settle into a monolayer at the bottom of the plate.\nNote: BMDCs are non-adherent cells. Therefore, to use swinging buckets or plates attach BMDCs to the bottom of the plate.",
    "Slowly add 400 μL of XF assay medium into the sample to avoid disrupting the cell monolayer. Add 500 μL of XF assay medium into the blank well. Normally, 4 wells (1A, 3C, 4B, 6D) are used as a blank well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/543-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Photographs of XFe sensor cartridge and XF24 extracellular flux analyzer\nCritical: No cells should be placed in the blank wells.\nIncubate the microplate for 30–60 min at 37°C without CO2 until you are ready to load the plate onto the XF24 extracellular flux analyzer.\nCritical: This session is critical for obtaining accurate results of the Seahorse assay. The number of cells directly affects the values of OCR and ECAR. If you seed too many cells, the cells will be seeded in multiple layers. You should observe the cells under an inverted microscope to confirm that a monolayer of cells is present in all the wells.\nXF assay\nPrepare 2 mL of 10× TLR agonist, mitochondrial inhibitor, or uncoupler injection solutions and an XFe sensor cartridge.\nAdd 56–75 μL of each 10× injection solution into injection ports A, B, C, and D, respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Return the hydration cartridge to the 37°C incubator without CO2 before setting up the run.\nDesign a study protocol in the XF24 extracellular flux analyzer software provided by the manufacturer (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D). Click the “I’m Ready” button and place the hydrated cartridge from the 37°C incubator without CO2 on the XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/543-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

ECAR and OCR of immature and mature BMDCs\nBMDCs (2 × 105 cells/well) stimulated without (immature) or with (mature) LPS (100 ng/mL) for 12 h were seeded in an XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer. The real-time OCR and ECAR were measured during the sequential treatments with a mitochondrial stress test (A: oligomycin, FCCP, antimycin-A/rotenone) and glycolysis stress test (B: Glucose, oligomycin, 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG)).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/543-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. OCR of BMDCs for FAO assay\nWild-type DCs (2 × 105 cells/well) pretreated with PA+BSA (A) and Etomoxir (B) for 30 min were seeded in an XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer. The real-time OCR was determined during the sequential treatments with a mitochondrial stress test (A: oligomycin, FCCP, antimycin-A/rotenone).\nNote: We recommend 4 blank (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and 3 or more replicas wells for 1 plate.\nWait for the machine to calibrate the sensors. When the calibration is finished, keep the cartridge on the machine while the calibrant plate in the load position is sent out. At this point, take the XF24 cell culture microplate from the 37°C incubator without CO2 and put it into the load position and click the “CONTINUE” button.\nAfter the XF24 extracellular flux analyzer run is finished, remove the assayed XF24 cell culture microplate, place it in a 37°C incubator to determine the cell counts or the protein concentration, and click the “CONTINUE” button to end the program.\nAfter XF assay (optional)",
    "Note: Normalization is an important component in the workflow for performing analysis of raw data to ensure accurate and consistent interpretation of results. We show a method using the number of cells. If you will use the method of normalization (e.g., using protein concentration, cell count, DNA content), refer https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/technicaloverviews/public/Methods_and_Strategies_for_Normalizing_Tech_Overview_022118.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/technicaloverviews/public/Methods_and_Strategies_for_Normalizing_Tech_Overview_022118.pdf]\nNote: If XF plate is coated with protein containing cellular adherents (e.g., collagen, laminin, Matrigel), normalization using total protein is also not applicable.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and add PBS 100 μL.\nStrip off the cells on bottom and count the cells.\nStandardize using Wave software."
