  "procedures": [
    "Permethylation of glycansAny glycan of reasonable size including the normal range of mammalian N- and O-glycans prepared from glycoprotein(s), cells, tissues and organs using the conventional protocols (Jang-Lee et al., 2006; Morelle and Michalski, 2007), with free or reduced reducing ends depending on the glycan release methods, can be subjected to the permethylation and sample clean-up/ microfractionation protocols described here. Heavily sulfated glycosaminoglycan fragments have not been tested but 50 pmole starting material of tetrasulfated diLacNAc tetrasaccharidescould be efficiently permethylated, retained by SepPakC18, and successfully detected by subsequent MALDI-MS analysis (Yu et al., 2009).Aliquot the suitably prepared glycan sample (in Milli-Q water) into a 13 x 100 mm glass tube.Dry the glycans by SpeedVac.Add 5 ml of DMSO into mortar followed by 5 NaOH pellets. Grind the NaOH pellets to a slurry by the use of a pestle.Add 0.2 ml of the NaOH/DMSO slurry into glass tube containing glycans, followed by the addition of 0.1 ml of methyl iodide. Perform this step in the laboratory fume hood.Put the sample onto vortex mixer and vortex gently for 3 h, at 4 °CAdd dropwise 0.2 ml of cold Milli-Q water into glass tube directly to quench the reaction, followed by careful neutralization with several drops of 5% aqueous acetic acid. Check the pH value of sample until pH 5-8 by pH indicator strips. Remove methyl iodide by putting samples under a stream of nitrogen in the fume hood.Note: The neutralized reaction mix can be loaded into Oasis® MAX cartridge directly (see Procedure E).Clean-up permethylated glycans by Sep-Pak C18Equilibrate C18 Sep-Pak cartridge by 3 ml of 100% ACN, 3 ml of methanol, 3 ml of water sequentially.Transfer the neutralized reaction mixture into the primed C18 Sep-Pak cartridge.Wash cartridge with 5 ml of water, 5 ml of 2.",
    "5% ACN, and 10% ACN subsequently to remove hydrophilic salts and contaminants.Elute permethylated glycans by 3 ml of 25% ACN, followed by 3 ml of 50% ACN into the same tube.Notes:Di-sulfated permethylated N-glycans will be collected in the 25% ACN fraction, and mono-sulfated along with non-sulfated permethylated N-glycans will be eluted in 50% ACN fraction. For O-glycans, di-sulfated, mono-sulfated, part of smaller non-sulfated permethylated O-glycans will normally be found in 25% ACN fraction, whereas larger mono-sulfated permethylated O-glycans and larger non-sulfated O-glycans will be collected in 50% ACN fraction. Dry samples by SpeedVacScreen permethylated sulfated glycans by MALDI-MS in negative ion modePrepare 10 mg/ml of 3,4-diaminobenzophenone in 75% ACN, 0.1% TFA in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Dissolve the permethylated glycan samples in 20-50 μl of ACN.Note: The volume of ACN to dissolve the sample highly depends on the amount of glycans. If the quantity is unclear, 20-50 μl of ACN is a good starting volume. Take 0.5 μl of sample and mix well with 0.5 μl of 3,4-DABP as matrix in an Eppendorf tube.Spot the mixed sample onto the MALDI target plate above a 50 °C heater.Acquire MS data in the negative ion mode, reflector mode.MS data was acquired under either manual or automated target movement depending on the state of crystallizationThe laser energy set for 3,4-DABP is similar to that for 2,5-DHB. In our 4700 Proteomics Analyzer and experience on 4800 Plus MALDI TOF/TOF Analyzer, the laser energy is set to around 4,500-5,000. Laser Nd-YAG 200 Hz is used.A typical acquisition comprises a total of 20 sub-spectra with 50 laser shots per sub-spectrum.Separation of sulfated permethylated glycans from non-sulfated ones by amine tipPrepare self-packed amine tip.Take a 200 μl yellow pipette tip and plug its tapered end with filter paper (0.1 cm x 0.",
    "1 cm size) by the use of 5 cm length needle or any equivalent tool (as shown in Figure 2A).Take up the amine beads in methanol, and pack them into the yellow tip. The volume of the packed beads in yellow pipette tip is normally 20 μl.Use the plunger of a 20 ml syringe (Figure 2B) to gently apply pressure to wash out the methanol (Figure 2C). Do not completely dry out the self-packed amine tip.Equilibrate the packed amine tip by adding 100 μl of 100% ACN and again use the 20 ml syringe plunger to apply pressure to push out the solvent. Follow with another 100 μl of 95% ACN with 0.1% FA and 100 μl of 50% ACN with 0.1% FA, and 100 μl of 95% ACN with 0.1% FA, sequentially.Dissolve the permethylated glycans from Step B5 in 20-50 μl of 100% ACN.Load the permethylated glycans onto self-packed amine tip and collect the flow through in the Eppendorf tube.Reload the collected flow through sample onto tip, and collect the flow through in the new Eppendorf tube.Wash the tip with 100 μl of 95% ACN. Collect the flow through and wash fractions in the same Eppendorf tube. This tube contains non-sulfated permethylated glycans.Elute mono-sulfated permethylated glycans with 100 μl of 2.5 mM NH4OAc in 50% ACN, and collect the eluent in the new Eppendorf tube.Elute di-sulfated permethylated glycans with 100 μl of 10 mM NH4OAc in 50% ACN, and collect the eluent in the new Eppendorf tube.Screen samples by MALDI-MS in the negative ion mode (the same as Procedure C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200511/20200511033847_0352.jpgFigure 2. The demonstration how to make self-packed amine tip. Step 1. Plug the yellow tip with filter paper by needle (shown in A). Step 2.",
    "Use 20 ml syringe as a plunger and put on a plastic hose on syringe to fit with yellow tip (shown in B). Step 3. Pack amine beads into the yellow tip by using syringe to wash out the solvent (shown in C).Separation of sulfated permethylated glycans from non-sulfated ones by Oasis® MAXEquilibrate an Oasis® MAX cartridge with 3 ml of 95% ACN and 3 ml of 100 mM NH4OAc.Add 1 ml of 100 mM NH4OAc into the cartridge and load the neutralized reaction mixtures (Procedure A) and collect all the unbound samples in one glass tube. Reload the unbound fraction into the MAX cartridge.Wash the cartridge by 1 ml of 100 mM ammonium acetate, followed by 6 ml of water to remove as much salts as possible.Elute the non-sulfated permethylated glycans by 6 ml of 95% ACN, and collect the eluent in the new glass tube.Elute the mono-sulfated permthylated glycans by 6 ml of 1 mM NH4OAc in 80% ACN, and collect the eluent in the new glass tube.Elute permethylated glycans with more than one sulfate by 3 ml of 100 mM NH4OAc in 60% ACN, 20% methanol, and collect the eluent in the new glass tube.Dry samples by SpeedVacNote: This mixed mode cartridge allows direct cleanup and sequential fractionation into non-sulfated, and sulfated glycans in one step.Further clean-up of permethylated glycans or concentration by ZipTipC18 Transfer permethylated glycans (in ACN) into 0.5 ml or 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and dry.Dissolve permethylated glycans in 20 μl of 10% ACN.Note: To have better solubility of permethylated glycans in 10% ACN, use 2 μl of 100% ACN to re-dissolve and sequentially add 18 μl of water while constantly vortex the tube. Equilibrate ZipTipC18 by 10 μl of 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA, then 10 μl of 0.1% TFA.",
    "Load sample by pipetting several times.Wash ZipTipC18 by 10 μl of 0.1% TFA, three times.Elute the glycans by 10 μl of 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA, or less volume, for collection into microtubes or direct spotting with matrix onto the MALDI target plate, followed by MS acquisition (Procedure C)."
