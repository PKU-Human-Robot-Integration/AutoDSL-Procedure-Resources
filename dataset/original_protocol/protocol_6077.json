    "Riboprobe synthesisNote: DNA templates for riboprobes can be either cDNA cloned into a plasmid backbone downstream of an RNA polymerase promoter or PCR product amplified from cDNA or genomic DNA. See Note 1.Template preparationPreparing a template from a plasmidLinearize the plasmid by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme at 37 °C. Choose an enzyme such that the template is linearized immediately downstream of the cDNA insert. Set the reaction up as:table:\n﻿0,1\nPlasmid template,5 μg\nRestriction enzyme,5 μl\n10x restriction buffer,10 μl",
    "Make up to 100 μl with distilled water/nuclease-free water.Purify the linearized plasmid with a commercial clean up kit. We recommend the Qiaquick PCR purification kit. Purify the plasmid as per the manufacturer’s instructions and elute the plasmid in 30 μl of elution buffer.Dilute 1 μl of the eluent in 4 μl of distilled water. Use 1 μl to assess concentration on a spectrophotometer and 4 μl to check the linearization with agarose gel electrophoresis. A single band corresponding to the linearized plasmid should be visible on the gel. Proceed with riboprobe synthesis if a single band corresponding to the fully linearized plasmid is visualized. Preparing a template by PCRDesign primers to amplify the desired target from cDNA or genomic DNA. To make a riboprobe that is complementary to the target mRNA, add the RNA polymerase (T7/T3/Sp6) promoter sequence to the reverse primer as: 5’-RNA polymerase promoter sequence + template specific sequence-3’.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190318/20190318182440_8216.jpgCarry out the PCR with the optimal cycling conditions. We recommend using a high fidelity DNA polymerase like Phusion.Clean up the PCR product. We recommend the Promega SV Gel Wizard PCR purification kit. Elute in 30 μl of the kit elution buffer. Dilute 1 μl of the eluent in 4 μl of distilled water. Use 1 μl of this dilution to assess concentration on a NanoDrop and 4 μl to assess product quality by gel electrophoresis. Proceed with riboprobe synthesis if a single band of the appropriate length is obtained. It is not necessary to sequence the PCR product to confirm sequence accuracy of the template (see Note 6).In vitro transcriptionThaw the reaction components (except the enzymes) and place on ice.Set up each 20 μl transcription reaction as:table:\n﻿0,1\nDNA Template,1-1.5 μg of linearized plasmid or 100-500 ng of PCR product\n10x Transcription buffer,2 μl\nrNTP-DIG,2 μl\nRNase Inhibitor,0.5 μl",
    "RNA polymerase,2 μl",
    "Adjust the volume to 20 μl with RNase-free water, if needed.Transcribe for 2-4 h at 37 °C. The yield of the reaction is equivalent when the transcription time is between 2 h and 4 h.Purify the riboprobe from the reaction with a commercial kit like QIAGEN RNeasy Min Elute. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and elute the riboprobe in 30 μl of RNase-free water. Dilute 1 μl of the probe in 4 μl of water. Use 1 μl to assess the concentration on a spectrophotometer and 4 μl to assess the quality of the transcription by agarose gel electrophoresis. The typical A280/A260 ratio of the synthesized probe after clean up is between 1.85 and 2.00. To resolve the RNA riboprobe on a 1% agarose gel in 1x TAE, run it at 140 V for 10-15 min. The riboprobe should resolve as a distinct band. Occasionally, a longer band is also obtained–this is typically an electrophoresis artifact arising due to RNA secondary structure, if a high-quality PCR product or completely linearized plasmid template has been used.Store the remainder of the synthesized riboprobe at -20 °C. Dilute the riboprobe in 5 ml of Hyb to perform in situ hybridization. See Note 2.Test the probe by performing in situ hybridization and assessing the pattern of hybridization obtained. In situ hybridizationNotes: This protocol has been optimized for embryos up to 48 h post fertilization (hpf) and is carried out in 24-well plates. Use 800 μl for washes and 500 μl for incubations. When exchanging media, the embryos being stained should not be allowed to dry out and should always remain covered with liquid.",
    "To ensure that they do not get stuck to the bottom or on to the sides of the wells, pipette gently and check after each solution change that embryos are covered by liquid. All incubation steps, unless specified, are performed at room temperature on a shaker.  Fixation and dehydration of embryos (see Note 3).Fixing embryos younger than 24 hpf Transfer embryos into 2 ml microfuge tubes (for long-term storage) or into wells of a 24-well plate (for immediate use for in situ) with a 3 ml plastic Pasteur pipette. Up to 100 embryos can be stored in a single tube and up to 30 embryos can be processed per well in a 24-well plate.Remove as much embryo medium as possible. If the embryos are in their chorions, all the liquid can be removed. Add 4% PFA in PBST (fix)–1 ml per tube, 800 μl per well. Incubate on a shaker for 5 min at room temperature. This step serves to remove any excess embryo medium.Exchange the fix with fresh fix–up to 2 ml per tube, 800 μl-1 ml per well. Incubate at room temperature for 1 to 4 h or overnight at 4 °C, with shaking.Remove the fix and add PBST–up to 2 ml per tube, 800 μl-1 ml per well.Transfer embryos into PBST in a 35 mm Petri dish with a 3 ml plastic Pasteur pipette and use forceps to dechorionate the embryos under a stereo microscope (Video 1). Transfer embryos back into the well plate or into a fresh tube/vial. The pipette should be rinsed by pipetting up and down in PBST, and the PBST should be exchanged between batches of embryos to prevent cross-contamination. Fixing embryos older than 24 hpf From 24 hpf onwards, add PTU to the embryo medium to a final concentration of 0.",
    "003% to inhibit pigment development in the embryos.Dechorionate embryos in embryo medium in a 35 mm Petri dish under a stereomicroscope (Video 2) and transfer them with a 3 ml plastic Pasteur pipette to the well plate or microfuge tube vial–30 for a well, 100 for a tube. The embryo medium should be exchanged between batches of embryos to prevent cross-contamination.Remove as much embryo medium as possible. Add 4% PFA in PBST (fix)–1 ml per tube, 800 μl per well. Incubate on a shaker for 5 min at room temperature. This step serves to remove any excess embryo medium.Exchange with fresh fix–up to 2 ml per tube or vial, 800 μl to 1 ml per well in the well plate. Incubate with shaking at room temperature for 1 to 4 h or overnight at 4 °C.Briefly rinse the embryos by removing fix and adding PBST–up to 2 ml per tube, 800 μl-1 ml per well.Exchange the PBST and wash the embryos in PBST 3 times, for a duration of 5 min each time, on a shaker at room temperature.Dehydration and permeabilization of embryosDehydrate the embryos in a graded methanol series: add 800 μl of 30% methanol in PBST, then replace with 800 μl of 50% methanol in PBST and then with 800 μl of 70% methanol in PBST. Incubate on a shaker between each replacement for 5 min.Incubate the embryos in 800 μl of absolute methanol for 5 min on a shaker.Replace the methanol and incubate embryos at -20 °C overnight to permeabilize the embryos. Use 1.1 ml of methanol per well or 2 ml per microfuge tube.The protocol can be stopped here if necessary as embryos can be stored at -20 °C in methanol indefinitely (see Note 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

Incubate on a shaker for 5 min at each step. Perform two 5-min washes with PBST.Digest embryos in Proteinase K (PKA). Dilute the PKA stock 1:200 for embryos younger than 24 hpf and 1:100 for embryos older than 24 hpf in PBST. Incubate in 500 μl without shaking at room temperature. Digestion time is embryonic stage dependent; the timings listed below can be used as a guideline. Stages indicated here are as per Kimmel et al. (1995).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190318/20190318181803_0336.jpgStop the reaction by making a rapid exchange with PBST followed by a 20-min re-fixation with 500 μl of fix at room temperature on a shaker.Remove the fix; perform one rapid wash with PBST followed by two 5-min PBST washes.HybridizationNote: The temperature used for hybridization is probe-dependent, but a good starting temperature is 60 °C (see Note 4). Perform hybridization steps in a water bath set to the hybridization temperature. Use a thin-walled plastic container lined with moistened tissue to incubate the well plate in the water bath. The container and hybridization solutions need to be pre-warmed to the hybridization temperature in the water bath before use. Pre-hybridize in 500 μl of Hyb at the hybridization temperature for a minimum of 30 min. Embryos can be pre-hybridized for up to 3 h at the hybridization temperature. Remove the Hyb and replace it with 500 μl of labeled riboprobe diluted in Hyb. Hybridize overnight at the hybridization temperature. See Note 5.Post-hybridization washesNote: These washes are also performed in a water bath at the hybridization temperature.",
    "Prepare the wash solutions fresh and warm them in the water bath before use. Timings indicated in this step are critical–do not wash for shorter or longer than the time recommended.Remove and recycle probe. Store it at -20 °C. See Note 2.Wash embryos 2 times, for 30 min each time in Wash 1.Wash embryos for 15 min in Wash 2.Wash embryos 2 times, for 30 min each time in Wash 3.DetectionMake a quick rinse with MABT to remove any remaining Wash 3 from the embryos.Add 500 μl of 2% blocking reagent and incubate without shaking in the dark at room temperature for at least 30 min.Dilute AP-conjugated anti-DIG antibody 1:2,000 in 2% blocking reagent. Remove the blocking reagent and add 500 μl of the diluted antibody in blocking reagent to the embryos. Incubate for 2 h, without shaking, at room temperature in the dark.Remove antibody solution and make 2 quick washes with MABT.Wash in 10-20 min intervals over 1 to 2 h at room temperature; at least 6 exchanges of MABT should be made. Alternatively, embryos can be washed at 4 °C overnight in MABT, followed by three 5-min washes the next day.Equilibrate embryos in freshly prepared staining buffer twice for 5 min each.Add 500 μl of the staining solution to the embryos. Stain in the dark at room temperature without shaking. See Note 5.Control the staining reaction by eye under a stereomicroscope. Place the well plate on a white background and illuminate the plate from above. Monitor the development of the embryos in the first 5 min after the staining solution has been added and then in 10-15 min intervals till the stain saturates or the desired contrast is achieved.Stop the staining reaction by performing three 5-min washes in PBST.",
    "Incubate embryos in methanol at room temperature till the yolk is cleared and appears white, or overnight at 4 °C or -20 °C.Note: See Figures 2, 3B and 4B for stains we have made with this protocol. See Note 6 for notes on troubleshooting.Mounting and photographyRemove the methanol from the embryos by making two 5-min washes in PBST.Re-fix in 4% PFA in PBST for at least 15 min at room temperature.Wash embryos twice each for 5 min in PBST.Add 87% glycerol to the embryos and leave to equilibrate at 4 °C. When the embryos sink to the bottom of the well, they are completely equilibrated. This takes ~12 h. Embryos can be subsequently stored in 87% glycerol either at 4 °C or -20 °C.Photograph the embryos: Photographing whole mount preparations: Photograph the embryos in 87% glycerol in a 35 mm Petri dish or an imaging mold (see Note 7) with an RGB camera coupled to a stereomicroscope. Illuminate the embryos from above using a ring light. Place a white sheet of paper below the dish to provide a white background for the image. An eyelash, tungsten wire or fine pipette tip can be used to manipulate the embryos. Photographing flat mount preparations: See also the JoVE video protocol for de-yolking and flat mounting (Cheng et al., 2014).1)Transfer the embryos to be flat mounted onto a glass slide with a drop of 87% glycerol. De-yolk the embryos with an eyelash or sharpened tungsten wire (see Note 8) in the drop. Move the embryo to the edge of the drop so that a minimal volume of glycerol covers it. Remove the remaining yolk cells with the eyelash. Periodically rinse the loosened yolk cells off the embryo in the glycerol drop. Move the embryo to a fresh drop of glycerol after de-yolking.",
    "2)Place the embryonic axis, dorsal side up, on a clean glass slide with the wire or the eyelash. Place approximately 15-20 μl total volume of 87% glycerol in small drops next to the embryos. Up to 10 de-yolked embryos can be flat mounted on a single slide.3)Make 4 small grease pillars with a 10 μl pipette tip to hold the corners of a glass coverslip in place. Carefully lower the coverslip onto the slide (Figure 1).4)Seal the 4 edges of the coverslip with transparent nail varnish.5)Photograph the embryos with transmitted light on a stereoscope with an RGB camera.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190316/20190316050345_4964.jpgFigure 1. Preparing a flat mount. A. Placing drops of glycerol next to de-yolked embryos (circled) and gently lowering a coverslip on the slide that will be held in place by grease pillars at the corners. B. The finished slide with flat mounted embryos (circled) and coverslip edges sealed with transparent nail varnish.GenotypingNote: Genomic DNA can be extracted from intact embryos or from tissue fragments after in situ hybridization. Fragments of tissue are taken before de-yolking and flat mounting the embryos. Perform the following steps in PCR tubes–1 embryo per tube.Select the embryos to be genotyped and rinse them together in a small Petri dish or singly in PCR tubes with PBST to remove the glycerol. A few rapid exchanges followed by three 5-min washes on a shaker at room temperature are typically sufficient.Transfer the whole embryo with forceps into a PCR tube. If DNA is being extracted from tissue fragments, transfer the embryo onto a glass slide into a 15-20 μl drop of PBST. Cut one-third to one-half of the embryo that is not stained with a micro knife. Transfer the piece to a PCR tube. Ensure that no excess liquid is transferred.",
    "Add 87% glycerol to the tissue on the glass slide to continue with de-yolking and flat mounting. Add 15 μl of 1x base solution to the tube and incubate at 95 °C for 30 min.Bring to room temperature and add 15 μl of 1x neutralization solution.Note: This solution is PCR ready (see Note 9)."
