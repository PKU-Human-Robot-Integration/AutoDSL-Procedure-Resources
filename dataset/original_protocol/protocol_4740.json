    "GST fusion NLRP3 proteins were previously produced in BL21 bacteria. GST alone was used as a control. Briefly, classical cloning method was used to insert GST-NLRP3 sequence in pGEX-4T-1 vector. BL21 were transformed by a heat shock according to supplier’s instructions. 24 h later bacteria were lysate with 1% Triton X-100 solution.Day 1     Binding of GST-fusion protein and Glutathione Sepharose 4B beadsGlutathione Sepharose 4B was washed twice with 5 ml binding buffer and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.GST-fused proteins were purified with Glutathione Sepharose 4B. Three ml of bacteria lysate obtained after BL21 sonication were added to the prepared Glutathione Sepharose 4B in a final volume of 30 ml of binding buffer, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Protein/Glutathione Sepharose 4B complexes were isolated by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature and washed with 5 ml binding buffer. Centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min allowed collecting Protein/Glutathione Sepharose 4B complexes.DNA labeling reaction The NLRP3-binding sequence (NBS) (5′-TCTGTTTTGGGAGGCAGAGCTTTGTTTCTATG-3′) was labeled with Digoxigenin through the use of a DIG Gel Shift Kit but Liquid chemiluminescent DNA pull-down assays can also be performed using biotinylated DNA.Double-stranded oligonucleotides were diluted to 10 ng/µl with DNAse/RNase free water. Put the tubes containing 100 ng of double-strand DNA (10 µl) on ice and add 4 µl labeling buffer, 5 mM CoCl2-solution, 0.05 mM DIG-ddUTP solution and 200 U Terminal transferase. Mix by pipetting up and down.The tubes were centrifuged and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in a dry block heater and put immediately on ice after this incubation.The reaction was stopped with 2 µl EDTA.DNA was then diluted to 4 ng/µl by adding 3 µl of water (DNAse/RNAse free).",
    "Protein-DNA binding reaction2 µg of GST-proteins bound to Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with 20 fmol DIG-labeled double-stranded DNA fragments in protein-DNA binding buffer from the DIG Gel Shift Kit in a final volume of 20 µl overnight at room temperature.Day 2GST-fused proteins bound to DNA were washed three times with 1 ml Washing Buffer from the kit and centrifuged each time at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Then the beads were incubated in 500 µl 1x blocking solution (dilution of 10x blocking solution in maleic acid buffer) for 30 min at room temperature.GST-fused proteins bound to DNA were incubated with anti-DIG Fab fragments conjugated with 75 mU/ml alkaline phosphatase (from DIG gel shit kit) for 30 min at room temperature in 1x blocking solution.GST-fused proteins bound to DNA are washed twice with 5 ml Washing Buffer.After washes, the complexes were transferred in detection buffer to 96-well plates and were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 1 μg/ml 3-(4-methoxyspiro {1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro) tricyclo [3.3.1.13,7] decan}-4-yl) phenyl phosphate (CSPD) , followed by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C.Light emission was measured using a PerkinElmer Envision Plate Reader. Light detection was performed during 1 sec per well."
