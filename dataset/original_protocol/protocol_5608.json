    "Take 30 males for every group (experimental and control). Notes: You can use different control groups, according to your experiment:    Control for the staining conditions: positive (incubated with etoposide) and negative (without primary antibodies).   Control for UV light effect–flies unexposed to light (kept in constant darkness).   Control for feeding effect–flies fed with glucose only.    Keep flies for 5 days in constant darkness (DD) on a standard medium.   Place flies for 6 h into an empty vial, with no access to food, but with wet filter paper to provide them water ad libitum. Keep them in DD conditions.   Apply selected chemicals diluted in 6% glucose to a filter paper for 6 h or 6% glucose only for control groups. In this experiment, we used heme oxygenase inhibitor (100 µM protoporphyrin IX–SnPP IX) and activator (100 µM hemin chloride).  Note: Avoid leaving big droplets of a liquid at the bottom of vial–flies can be trapped in liquid and drown.   Use CO2 to anesthetize one of the control groups.   Decapitate one of the control groups and put heads for 4 h in 500 µl Schneider’s medium supplemented with 20 µM etoposide at room temperature.    Expose experimental flies and second control group (fed with glucose only) to 1 h of UV light pulse (100 lux) and then to 3 h of intensive white light (1,500 lux) (Figure 1).  Note: Be sure that flies have access to water during the experiment (wet filter paper).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180130/20180130193221_9311.jpg Figure 1. UV/white light exposure. Vial (orientated upside down) with flies is placed on the transilluminator. Filter paper attached to the vial provide water ad libitum.    Keep one of control group continuously in constant darkness until decapitation.   Use CO2 to anesthetize flies.   Decapitate the anesthetized flies (all experimental and control) in a drop of 4% PFA.",
    "Fix all heads in 500 µl 4% PFA for 4 h at 4 °C.   Remove PFA using a pipette and wash heads 2 times each for 10 min at room temperature (RT) in 500 µl PBS (see Recipes).   Cryoprotect material by washing for 10 min in 500 µl of 12.5% sucrose and then overnight in 500 µl of 25% sucrose (Figure 2).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180130/20180130193316_8082.jpg Figure 2. Fixation and cryoprotection of material. Flies heads are fixed in 4% PFA, then washed in PBS and cryoprotected in 12.5% and 25% sucrose.    Put a droplet of Tissue-Tek to small plastic holders, embed heads into Tissue-Tek, put them into the bottom and organize in rows (Figure 3).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180130/20180130193352_3648.jpg Figure 3. Sample preparation for cryostat. Small plastic holder is filled with TissueTek, then heads are put into the bottom in rows and cut (frontal sections). Sections are collected on microscope glass.     Freeze material in liquid nitrogen for few seconds.   Remove frozen sample from the holder.   Use a cryostat to cut 20 µm thick sections.   Dry the cryosections for 30 min at room temperature.   Keep the sections frozen for long-term storage at -20 °C or use them immediately for immunodetection at room temperature.   Rehydrate material by incubating with 500 µl PBS for 30 min. Note: Use PBS, PBT at room temperature.   Wash sections for 10 min in 200 µl 0.5% PBT (see Recipes).   Wash sections for 5 min in 200 µl 2% PBT.   Wash sections 3 times for 5 min each in 200 µl 0.5% PBT.   Block unspecific binding sites by the incubation with 200 µl 5% NGS in BSA for 45 min.   Apply anti-8-hydroxyguanosine primary antibodies (1:500, in 0.5% BSA) and incubate overnight at 4 °C.   Keep one section as a negative control and do not apply primary antibodies.",
    "Use HRP/DAB (ABC) detection kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In this step secondary antibodies are used (they are provided in the kit).   Close sections with glycerol and cover glasses.   Take the retina pictures under a light microscope using a microscope camera. Note: To visualize cell nuclei in the retina keep one section unstained with anti-8OHdG. Rehydrate material and close with fluorescence medium–Vectashield with DAPI. Use a fluorescent or confocal microscope to take pictures."
