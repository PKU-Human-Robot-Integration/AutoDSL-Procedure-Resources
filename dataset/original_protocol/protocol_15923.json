    "This protocol begins with an IVT reaction to enable the production of an mRNA transcript from a linearized DNA template (see Strategic Planning and Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0001]). This protocol is based on the kit protocol provided by New England Biolabs (see Internet Resources) and has been further optimized as described here. The mRNA yield (mass recovery) of this reaction can vary; a reduction in yield can be expected when modified NTPs such as m1Ѱ are used. Reactions can be scaled as necessary. After IVT the mRNA is capped enzymatically by combining the vaccinia capping system and cap 2′-O-methyltransferase to result in the installation of a cap1 structure to the 5′ end of the construct. The capped mRNA is then tailed enzymatically using the Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase resulting in a poly(A) tail of >100 bases (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0001]). For the IVT, capping, and tailing reactions, reagents are combined, mixed thoroughly, and incubated for the appropriate amount of time at 37°C. After each reaction the mRNA is purified away from DNA, salts, free nucleotides, and proteins using lithium chloride precipitation (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0001]). Lithium neutralizes the negative charge of the mRNA phosphate backbone allowing the neutralized molecules to precipitate. Although lithium chloride precipitation of mRNA is an efficient method of purifying mRNA from solutions containing DNA, some DNA can co-precipitate. Therefore, we recommend carrying out a DNase treatment following the IVT step to ensure that no DNA is carried through to the successive reactions. Once purified, the mRNA can be visualized using gel electrophoresis which separates mRNA molecules based on size (exploiting the negatively charged backbone) (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0002]). This allows assessment of the mRNA integrity, size, presence of the poly(A) tail and, in some cases, the approximate length of the tail.",
    "Here, we describe visualization of the mRNA with both a 1% agarose gel and the Agilent TapeStation automated electrophoresis system which is commonly used to determine sample integrity (amount of intact vs degraded RNA). mRNA should be adjusted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium acetate at pH 3 to 5 to allow the user to continue immediately to the encapsulation procedure (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002]).",

Allow the 10× T7 reaction buffer and NTPs to equilibrate to room temperature.",
    "If small scale reactions, as described in this protocol, will be carried out frequently, the 10× T7 reaction buffer should be stored in smaller aliquots to prevent excessive freeze-thawing.\nEnzymes should be kept in a cooling block or ice bucket while on the bench. Enzymes should not be vortexed.\nTable 1.\n                Volume of Reagents to be Added for an In Vitro Transcription Reaction Part 1\ntable:\n﻿Reagent,Volume (µl),Final concentration\nNuclease-free water,6,\n10× T7 reaction buffer,2,1×\nNTP mix,8,40 mM\n3. Mix, spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature, and use micropipettes to combine NTPs equally into a 100 mM final concentration (i.e., 25 mM of each NTP).\nNTPs can be stored combined for future reactions.\nIf modified NTPs will be used for example N1-methylpseudouridine this can be added to the mix in place of UTP.\n4. Set up the reaction in a 200-µl PCR tube, the final volume will be 20 µl. Add the required amounts of each reagent in the order listed in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0001] to reach a 16 µl total. Mix the reaction thoroughly by vortexing and spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature, to get the liquid to the bottom of the tube.\nA 20 µl reaction will produce ∼150 µg of RNA. This can be scaled as required.\nTypically for a return of 100 µg of iLNP-encapsulated mRNA we start with 300 µg of mRNA (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002]).\n5. To reach 20 µl final volume add the DNA template and RNA polymerase as listed in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0002] to the tube. Mix them gently with a pipette and spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature, to get all liquid to the bottom.\nNever vortex enzymes or template DNA.",
    "1 µg of DNA template is required for a 20 µl reaction. Here, the concentration of the DNA template is 500 ng/µl. The amount of water and DNA can both be adjusted to account for a different template concentration.\nFor difficult DNA templates where low yields are achieved after IVT, DTT (5 mM final) can be added to the reaction. The volume of nuclease-free water should be adjusted to account for the added DTT so the final volume is still the same (see Troubleshooting).\nTable 2.\n                Volume of Reagents to be Added for an In Vitro Transcription Reaction Part 2\ntable:\n﻿Reagent,Volume (µl),Final concentration\n500 ng/µl DNA template,2,50 ng/µl\nRNA polymerase mix,2,2 µl/20 µl\n6. Place tubes in a thermocycler or heat block and incubate for 2 hr once 37°C is reached.\nSometimes visible RNA precipitate is observed at the end of the incubation. Any precipitate formed gets dissolved by addition of water before DNase treatment in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0001], step 7.\nDNase I treatment\n7. Thaw and mix the tube of the DNase I buffer supplied with the DNase I enzyme (NEB). After incubation is complete (step 6) add the reagents to the reaction in the order listed in Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0003]. Mix the reaction gently with a pipette and incubate the reaction for 15 min at 37°C in the heat block or thermocycler.\nIf small scale reactions as described in this protocol will be carried out frequently, the DNase I buffer should be stored in 10 µl aliquots to prevent excessive freeze-thawing.\nTable 3.\n                DNase I Reaction Components\ntable:\n﻿Reagent,Volume (µl),Final Concentration\nNuclease-free water,68,\n10× DNase I buffer,10,1×\nDNase I,2,4 U/µg DNA\nPrecipitation of mRNA",
    "8. To precipitate the mRNA the reaction should be transferred to a tube able to fit the centrifuge that will be used for precipitation e.g., a 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube. Half the sample volume of 6 M lithium chloride should be added to the DNase I-treated IVT reaction. In this case add 50 µl of 6 M lithium chloride.\nIf precipitating a small amount of mRNA, especially if the sample is dilute (<400 ng/µl), a carrier such as glycogen can be added at 1 µg/µl together with the lithium chloride to assist precipitation (Walker & Lorsch, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0077]).\nLithium chloride may not work well for molecules ≤100 nucleotides. In this case ethanol precipitation with 3 M sodium acetate can be used (Walker & Lorsch, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0077]).\n9. Mix the reaction and lithium chloride mixture by gently inverting the tube and spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature, before storing at −20°C for at least 30 min.\nThis is a safe stopping point as mRNA can be precipitated in lithium chloride at −20°C overnight.\n10. Cool the centrifuge to 4°C. Spin the sample for at least 30 min at >14,000 × g, 4°C.\n11. Discard the lithium chloride and retain the pellet. Wash the sample by adding 1 ml pre-chilled 70% ethanol. Gently flick the tube until the pellet comes loose and can be rinsed by the ethanol.\nThe pellet should be visible by eye. Try to retain all parts of the pellet including small pieces that may have broken off.\n12. Spin the pellet down 5 min, >14,000 × g, 4°C.\n13. Discard the ethanol and retain the pellet. Remove as much ethanol as possible with a pipette and allow the pellet to dry.\nSteps 10-12 can be repeated if a second ethanol wash is desired.",
    "This is a good stopping point if time restraints mean you cannot continue with the next step for some time. mRNA can be stored in ethanol at −20°C for several months (Walker & Lorsch, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0077]) (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0001]).\n14. Resuspend the pellet in 150 µl nuclease-free water by pipetting gently up and down. The expected yield is 150 µg of mRNA.\nThe volume of water will differ depending on the expected mRNA yield and desired mRNA concentration. A concentration >1 µg/µl works well for proceeding to the next steps.\nIf time allows, incubate the mRNA pellet at 4°C in water for ≥15 min before pipetting, this makes resuspension of the pellet easier.\nThe mRNA should be stored in a 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube or similar, as the capping reaction requires a larger volume than IVT.\n15. Take an aliquot of at least 5 µl of mRNA for quality control. Measure and record the concentration of the mRNA by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a nanodrop spectrophotometer.\nIf quality control will be carried out on the same day store the sample at 4°C. If quality control will be carried out >24 hr later, it is best to freeze the sample short-term at −20°C or long-term at −80°C.\nIf the mRNA concentration is likely to be outside of the absorbance limits of your instrument, dilute the mRNA 1:5 in nuclease-free water before measuring the concentration on the nanodrop to minimize instrument error.\nNanodrop results use the 260 nm absorbance peak to calculate concentration. In addition, A260/280 and A260/230 ratios can be used as an indicator for purity with pure RNA giving a ratio between 2.0 and 2.2 for both read outs (Henderson et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0035]).\nEnzymatic capping of mRNA",
    "16. Heat one heat block or thermocycler, water bath or incubator to 65°C and another to 37°C.\n17. Remove a single tube of 10× capping buffer, GTP and SAM (see Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0004]) from the freezer and allow to equilibrate to room temperature. Mix and spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature, to ensure the liquid is at the bottom before opening.\nTable 4.\n                One Step Capping and 2′-O-methylation reaction\ntable:\n﻿Reagent,Volume (µl),Final concentration\nUncapped RNA,150.0,1 µg/µl\nNuclease-free water,65.5,\nRNase inhibitor,7.5,1 U/µl\n10× capping buffer,30.0,1×\n10 mM GTP,15.0,0.5 mM\n32 mM SAM,2.0,0.2 mM\n18. Denature the precipitated mRNA from the IVT reaction (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0001], step 14) at 65°C for 5 min in the preheated device selected above (step 16).\nAfter 5 min denatured mRNA should be immediately cooled in a cold block for ∼5 min to cool the solution rapidly before addition of the enzymes.\n19. During the denaturation step of the uncapped mRNA, add all other reagents in Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0004] to an Eppendorf tube in the order listed, mix reagents thoroughly and spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature, to ensure the mixture is in the bottom of the tube.\nThis protocol is a one-step reaction that results in the addition of cap1 to the mRNA by adding cap0 to the 5′ end of the mRNA (Vaccinia virus capping enzyme) and facilitating its 2′-O-methylation converting it to cap1 (cap 2′-O-methyltransferase) (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0003]).\nThis protocol is designed to cap 150 µg of mRNA in a 300 µl reaction. The values in Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0004] should be adjusted to the amount of input mRNA from the previous reaction (step 14).",
    "Use of RNase inhibitor is optional, but it should be used at temperatures below 50°C as the RNase inhibitor is a protein that can be degraded at elevated temperatures, rendering it ineffective. The inhibitor can be added to the reaction after the denaturation step to prevent degradation of the mRNA by RNases. If used, it should be added before all possible contaminants e.g., enzymes.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3d0f0ab3-3347-4ebf-8ae9-52790db88642/cpz1898-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nStructure of mRNA including the 5′ cap, 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the protein to be translated, and the poly(A) tail.\n20.

Add the enzymes listed in Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0005] to the reaction and mix by gently pipetting. Spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature, the tube and incubate at 37°C for 1 hr.\nTable 5.\n                Enzymes to be Added to the Capping Reaction\ntable:\n﻿Reagent,Volume (µl),Final concentration\n10 U/µl vaccinia capping enzyme,15,1 U/µg mRNA\n50 U/µl cap-2′-O-methyltransferase,15,5 U/µg mRNA\n22. After incubation, proceed with precipitation of the mRNA and resuspension in nuclease-free water as described above in steps 8 to 14.\nThe precipitation at −20°C overnight is a safe stopping point.\n23. Take an aliquot of at least 5 µl of the capped mRNA for quality control. Measure and record the concentration of the mRNA using a nanodrop spectrophotometer as described in step 15.\nEnzymatic tailing of mRNA\n24. Heat the heat block, thermocycler, or water bath or incubator to 37°C.",
    "25. To set up the enzymatic tailing reaction add the reagents in Table 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0006] in the order listed. The ‘capped mRNA’ component is the mRNA resuspended in water during ‘Enzymatic capping of mRNA’ (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0001], step 22). Mix gently, spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature and incubate at 37°C for 1 hr.\nThis protocol is designed to tail 150 µg of mRNA in a 300 µl reaction. The values in Table 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0006] should be adjusted to the amount of input mRNA from the previous steps.\nDue to the nature of an enzymatic reaction, tail length can be varied by changing the reaction time, concentration of ATP or the poly(A) polymerase, and the molar concentration of the mRNA. We consistently observe that the protocol below results in a tail >100 nucleotides.\nTable 6.\n                Poly(A) Polymerase Tailing Reaction Components\ntable:\n﻿Reagent,Volume (µl),Final concentration\nCapped mRNA,150.0,1 µg/µl\nNuclease-free water,67.5,\nRNase inhibitor,7.5,1 U/µl\n10× E. coli poly(A) polymerase reaction buffer,30.0,1×\n10 mM ATP,30.0,1 mM\n5 U/µl poly(A) polymerase,15.0,0.5 U/µg\n26. After incubation, proceed directly to precipitate the capped and tailed mRNA as described in steps 8 to 13. This will both stop the reaction and separate the mRNA product from reagents. Resuspend the washed pellet in slightly less nuclease-free water than above aiming for a concentration above 1 mg/ml.\nThe reaction can also be stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM; however, this may interfere with downstream applications.\nDue to the addition of the poly(A) tail, an increase in the concentration of the mRNA may be observed.",
    "To prepare the sample for encapsulation described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002], the final concentration of the mRNA should be 1 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 3 to 5. The pellet must first be resuspended in nuclease-free water due to the difficulty of resuspending in sodium acetate directly.\n27. Take an aliquot of at least 5 µl of the capped and tailed mRNA for quality control. Measure and record the concentration of the mRNA using a nanodrop spectrophotometer as described in step 15.\nIf mRNA is not intended for encapsulation, storage in water at −80°C in small aliquots is the most versatile solvent. In this case, step 28 can be skipped.\n28. Adjust the mRNA to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 3 to 5, using equations 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-disp-0001] to 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-disp-0003] to calculate the volume of nuclease-free water (VWater) and 3 M sodium acetate (VNaOAc) to be added.\n         \nformula:\n$$\\begin{equation} {V_{Final}} =  \\; {C_{mRNA}} \\times  \\; {V_{mRNA}} \\end{equation}$$\nformula:\n$$\\begin{equation} {V_{NaOAc}} =  \\; {V_{Final}} \\times  \\; \\frac{{100}}{{3000}} \\end{equation}$$\nformula:\n$$\\begin{equation} {V_{Water}} =  \\; {V_{Final}} - {V_{mRNA}} - {V_{NaOAc}} \\end{equation}$$\n29. Aliquot the mRNA into 100-µl single-use aliquots and freeze at −80°C for long-term storage until required for encapsulation as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002].\nThe aliquot size can be adjusted depending on the amount of mRNA required for encapsulation. For example, if encapsulating using Alternate Protocol, smaller aliquots of 50 µg may be more appropriate.\nAssessment of poly(A)tail presence by gel electrophoresis",
    "30. Measure agarose and add to appropriate volume of 1× TAE buffer to make a 1 % gel (e.g., 1 g agarose in 100 ml TAE buffer). Mix agarose and buffer and melt in microwave. Once melted add 1 µl SYBR Safe (10,000× stock) for every 10 ml. Mix well and pour into gel tray with comb to set.\nIn some cases, depending on the length of the mRNA, a different percentage gel may be required. Agarose gel can be used to assess both the integrity of mRNA and check for the presence of a poly(A) tail. To screen for size increase after tailing, run samples from post-IVT, post-capping and post-tailing adjacently (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0002]).\nTAE buffer is suggested here as it is widely used in laboratories working with DNA. However, gels can also be run in 1× TBE buffer which runs at cooler temperature due to higher conductivity and allows a sharper image to be acquired. Where TBE is not available but higher resolution is required, gels can be run in TAE at a lower voltage or in an ice box (Koontz, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0046]). For RNA molecules ≥600 nt we recommend the use of agarose gels as described here. However, when smaller RNA molecules are produced the user should consider the use of polyacrylamide (PAGE) gels to assess the integrity and size of the product (Rio et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0065]).\n31. Prepare the ssRNA ladder by adding 3 µl ladder to 9 µl 2× RNA loading dye. Prepare the samples by adding 2× RNA loading dye and the mRNA samples 1:1. Denature ladder and sample for 5 min at 72°C in a pre-heated heat block, thermocycler or a PCR thermocycler programmed to reach 72°C.",
    "The loading dye is a denaturing buffer containing formamide which acts to prevent mRNA folding back to its native state. It has been shown that the treatment of mRNA samples maintains the mRNA in a denatured state during native gel electrophoresis removing the need to run samples on a fully denaturing agarose gel (Masek et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0056]).\n32. Once set, submerge gel in running cell filled with 1× TAE buffer. Remove comb and load ssRNA ladder followed by samples. A control sample of mRNA from the IVT reaction (e.g., not yet enzymatically tailed) should be included as a reference to screen for a size increase. Run gel at 120 V for 45 min.\nThis is an example, both voltage and running time are dependent on the system and agarose percentage used.\n33. Image gel and assess the presence of the poly(A) tail after the enzymatic tailing reaction through an increase in size on the gel (see Understanding Results, Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0002]).\nAssessment of mRNA integrity with automated gel electrophoresis\n34. Dilute samples to ∼100 ng/µl in nuclease-free water for best results.\nThe Agilent RNA ScreenTape assay can measure in the quantitative range of 25-500 ng/µl but for optimal results we suggest adjusting to 100 ng/µl.\nThe Agilent TapeStation is an automated gel electrophoresis system that requires only a small amount of sample to produce faster and more easily analyzable results than traditional gel electrophoresis. Other systems including the BioAnalyzer, and the Fragment Analyzer are also suitable for quality control of the product.\n35. Remove a 1 µl aliquot of RNA ScreenTape ladder from the −80°C freezer and place on ice.\nRNA ScreenTape ladder should be aliquoted into single-use 1 µl fractions upon arrival and immediately frozen at −80°C to ensure longevity.",

Using the optical tubes 8× strip, pipette 5 µl sample buffer into each tube that will contain a sample plus one extra tube for the ladder.\nAlways use a complete strip of optical tubes even if the sample number is less than eight.\n37. Pipette 1 µl of each sample into a tube containing sample buffer. Cover the tubes using the optical caps, mix the samples by shaking the tubes in the orbital shaker at 2000 rpm for ∼1 min, and spin in a mini-centrifuge 10 s at maximum speed, room temperature.\n38. Heat the samples in a PCR thermocycler for 3 min at 72°C, followed by cooling the tubes immediately on ice for 2 min.\n39.

    "This protocol describes the encapsulation of mRNA into ionizable lipid nanoparticles (iLNPs) (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0006]). The protocol uses a microfluidic mixer to control nanoprecipitation of the lipids and mRNA in an acidic buffer, followed by buffer exchange to DPBS resulting in a rearrangement and stabilization of the particles (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0001]). Neutral nanoparticles with >80% encapsulation efficiency that are 80 to 150 nm in diameter can be expected (see Understanding Results section). It is expected that following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002] will produce 100 µg of encapsulated mRNA in iLNPs using the Dlin-MC3-DMA (MC3) ionizable lipid (Jayaraman et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0037]). Generally, this should be sufficient for routine characterization and subsequent murine experiments (for example, two 5 µg doses for five mice). Users can easily scale up the protocol to encapsulate up to 1 mg of mRNA.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/772eee71-bb5e-453b-840a-99c79eb7f03d/cpz1898-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\n(A) Illustration of iLNP structure and components.

    "The protocol can be adapted to produce particles with different cargo (for example, siRNA or saRNA) or different lipids; however, optimization may be required. A spreadsheet is provided in the supplementary information to alter the recipe as required for different outputs. The formulation described here has a standard lipid molar ratio of 50 ionizable/10 DSPC/38.5 cholesterol/1.5 DMG-PEG2000 and an N/P ratio of 4 (N being the ionizable amine and P the phosphates in the mRNA backbone). For mRNA it is generally recommended that an N/P of 3 to 8 is used. The PEGylated lipid component should consist of 1% to 2% of the formulation (Belliveau et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0009]; Kulkarni et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0048]; Ly et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0054]). The helper phospholipid should be 8% to 12% of the formulation, with DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DOPE (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine) being the most commonly used. DSPC is used in all of the currently approved iLNP products, likely because it is known to improve stability of other lipid nanoparticles such as liposomes. DOPE, which forms a cone structure as opposed to the cylindrical structure of DSPC, has been reported to improve the packing properties of iLNPs resulting in a more uniformly spherical particle. The conical shape of DOPE may lead to increased intracellular delivery of mRNA but the particles may be less stable (Albertson et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0001]; Cheng & Lee, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0018]; Kauffman et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0041]; Leung et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0051]; Ly et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0054]). The ionizable lipid can be reduced to 40% and still produce the expected type of iLNP (see Understanding Results section for examples of different iLNPs generated using this protocol), and the cholesterol should be adjusted to make up the remaining percentage of lipids.",
    "The structure of the ionizable lipid is likely to have the largest effect on the properties of the lipid nanoparticle and should be selected carefully. Some ionizable lipids and lipidoids contain more than one ionizable head group and this should be factored into the N/P calculation.",
    "This protocol makes use of a NanoAssemblr Ignite microfluidic mixer but may be adapted to suit other microfluidic mixers employing a syringe pump and a T-mixer or staggered herringbone mixer. Centrifugal spin filters are used here to exchange buffers and concentrate the iLNP solution as they provide a convenient and high recovery solution when working at this small scale. Alternatively, dialysis or tangential flow filtration may be used when reduced recovery is not an issue or larger scales are used, respectively.\nBasic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002] encapsulates the mRNA in the iLNP during the microfluidics nanoprecipitation step; however, this results in a significant amount of wasted mRNA due to dead volumes and instrument waste. Where the mRNA is expensive or in limited supply, the use of preformed vesicles outlined in Alternate Protocol may be preferable.\nNOTE: It is important to work in an environment and with reagents that are nuclease-free to prevent degradation of the mRNA, as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0001].

To prepare lipid stock solutions (MC3, Cholesterol, DSPC, DMG-PEG2000), allow the lipids to equilibrate to room temperature before opening the bottle to prevent moisture getting into the bottle. Weigh at least 3 mg of each lipid individually into clean glass 4 ml vials on a 4 decimal place balance.\nThe ionizable lipid is usually a liquid so it can be transferred to a vial for weighing using an autopipette. Due to the viscosity, it should always be weighed rather than relying on the autopipette volume. MC3 is light and moisture sensitive, therefore, to prevent repeatedly opening a stock bottle the MC3 lipid can be aliquoted at 10 to 15 mg in small amber vials. Aliquots can be stored in an airtight container or bag with desiccant at −20°C.\n2. Add the appropriate volume of ethanol to the lipids with an autopipette such that the final concentration is 10 mg/ml. The lipid stock solutions can be stored at −20°C for later use.",
    "For example, if 3 mg of lipid was weighed into a vial, add 300 µl of ethanol. The cholesterol, DSPC and DMG-PEG2000 may need to be warmed in order for the lipids to dissolve. This can be done by carefully holding the vial under running warm water. It may be useful to parafilm the lid to prevent moisture entering the vial. Be careful not to hold the vial under the water too long and ensure there is plenty of volume in the vial for any vapors produced from heating the ethanol. The lipid is dissolved when there is no more evidence of white solids in the vial and a clear solution is obtained. Precipitation may occur upon storage in the freezer so the vials may need to be warmed in this way to dissolve the lipids.\n3.

Discard filtrate and retentate and immediately add 13 ml DPBS to each tube.\nOnce wet, do not allow spin filters to dry out. 0.5 to 1 ml of the formulated lipid nanoparticle solution can be added to each tube containing 13 to 14 ml DPBS. The number of tubes can be adjusted depending on the volume to be formulated.\n6. Thaw 300 µg of the mRNA aliquot(s) in the fridge (4°C) or on ice. Once thawed and just before use, allow to warm to room temperature.",
    "Once the mRNA is thawed it is not advisable to freeze again, therefore it is helpful to store the mRNA in small aliquots (such as 100 µg) as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0001]. It is best if the thawed aliquot is used the same day to prevent degradation of the mRNA. Rapid handling is advised when the aliquot is handled at room temperature.\n7. Prepare 100 mM pH 5 sodium acetate buffer by diluting 1 ml of 3 M stock into 30 ml using RNase-free, sterile water. Vortex briefly to mix. Measure the pH of the buffer to ensure it is still ∼5.\nAcetate buffer at 100 mM can be stored frozen at −20°C in useful aliquots (such as 10 ml) in centrifuge tubes to ensure the solution remains sterile and free of RNase contamination. 3 M sodium acetate stock solution can also be stored frozen between uses. If the pH needs to be adjusted, concentrated HCl or NaOH may be used as required.\n8. Adjust the concentration of the mRNA solution to 241.5 µg/ml by diluting the aliquot with room temperature 100 mM sodium acetate buffer and combine aliquots if necessary.\nFor example, if three 100 µg aliquots were thawed, combine the aliquots into one Eppendorf tube (300 µg) and adjust the volume to 1.25 ml by adding 0.95 ml 100 mM acetate buffer.\n9. Enter the formulation parameters into the NanoAssemblr Ignite according to Table 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0010].",
    "The volumes can be adjusted to reflect the scale of formulation desired. With these settings on this instrument, it is not practical to formulate less than 0.4 ml.

Draw the aqueous mRNA solution into the 3-ml syringe using a blunt needle. Draw in some extra air and invert the syringe so the needle is pointing up and tap the syringe to dislodge any air bubbles. Remove the needle and plunge the syringe to remove any remaining air.

Place the syringe firmly in the R position of the cartridge.",
    "13. Ensure the instrument is in the ready state and start the formulation.\nEnsure the volume in each syringe is at least a syringe-graduation more than is displayed on the instrument before formulation. For example, a 1-ml syringe has graduations of 0.1 ml, therefore an extra 0.1 ml should be available in the syringe.\n14. When the formulation is complete, immediately transfer the lipid nanoparticle suspension to the DPBS in the pre-rinsed spin filters.\nEvenly split the formulation between the two spin filters, in this case 0.65 ml to each. The resulting iLNP solution will be diluted 15 to 30 times in DPBS.\n15. Concentrate the iLNP solution in DPBS to the initial volume of iLNP added by centrifugation for 30 min at ≤4000 × g, 4°C (if the centrifuge is equipped with cooling). Repeat the centrifugation step if needed (see annotation below).\nFor example, if 0.65 ml of the iLNP solution following formulation was added to each tube, concentrate until the volume is reduced to 0.65 ml. The centrifugation can take several hours; therefore, it is preferable to do this at reduced temperature to reduce the chance of degradation, however, it is not necessary if the centrifuge does not have cooling capacity.\n16. Transfer the concentrated iLNP solution to an appropriate sterile, RNase-free vessel (cryovial, Eppendorf tube, centrifuge tube) and note the final volume.\nTo ensure the iLNP is suspended in the spin filter and not stuck on any surfaces, pipette up and down a number of times before removing the solution from the filter. Long pipette tips may be useful for high recovery from the spin filters.\n17. Characterize the iLNP as desired according to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0004].",

This value can be used to adjust the concentration of the solution to that desired using DPBS. A concentration of 100 µg/ml is suitable for intramuscular delivery of a 5-µg mRNA dose and for storage.\nFor example, if the RiboGreen assay returns 250 µg/ml encapsulated mRNA and the volume of the sample is 1 ml, adjust the concentration of the sample to 100 µg/ml by adding 1.5 ml DPBS.

The detergent Triton X-100 is used to destroy the particle so the total mRNA can be detected by the fluorescent dye. The difference between the total mRNA and unencapsulated mRNA detected by the dye, is used to determine the encapsulated mRNA.\n18. Store the iLNP solution at 4°C (do not freeze). It is preferable to use the product immediately, but it can be stored for up to 1 month in the fridge.\nIf storing for 1 month or longer, it is advised that iLNP characterization is repeated before use to detect any degradation or aggregation.",
    "This alternate protocol is conceptually similar to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002] and will follow many of the same steps: generating a lipid nanoparticle using microfluidics, complexing mRNA to a cationic iLNP at low pH, fusion of the lipid nanoparticles at neutral pH, concentration, and analysis. However, the mRNA is complexed to the iLNP after it is formulated rather than when the iLNP is formed using microfluidics (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0001]). This means it can be carried out on a smaller scale and with less waste.\nThe Alternate Protocol may be required when mRNA is made in small quantities due to expensive reagents or special modifications. In this case 300 µg of mRNA as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002] may be too much to produce or the amount of waste (∼80 µg) is too significant. A preformed vesicle (PFV) approach involves forming the lipid nanoparticle by microfluidics without the mRNA present during the nanoprecipitation and adding this preformed vesicle to the mRNA at low pH so the electrostatic interactions can still occur (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0001]). The resulting particles are then neutralized at pH 7.4 and processed as normal. This process results in minimal waste compared to encapsulating during the microfluidics process; however, it can lead to a higher PDI and lower encapsulation efficiency (see Understanding Results). For payload optimization or screening, this may not be a hindrance.\nAs in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002], the steps described are expected to return 100 µg mRNA encapsulated in iLNPs. In contrast to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002], there is no minimum scale, and it is much easier to scale down. If required, 4-ml instead of 15-ml spin filters may be used if more appropriate to the scale.\nMaterials\nSee Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002]\n1. Follow steps 1 to 5 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002] (prepare lipids and spin filters).",
    "2. Thaw at least 150 µg of the mRNA aliquot(s) in the fridge (4°C) or on ice. Once thawed and just before use, allow to warm to room temperature.\nThe mRNA solution must be 1 mg/ml in 100 mM pH 5 sodium acetate buffer. If the mRNA is supplied in water, use the 3 M acetate stock solution to adjust the buffer as required.\n3. Enter the formulation parameters into the NanoAssemblr Ignite (Table 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0011]).\nThe volumes can be adjusted to reflect the scale of formulation desired. For example, if two mRNA constructs are being formulated with the same preformed vesicle, the scale can be increased to 2.4 ml to account for the extra 0.9 ml required for the extra preparation. 0.6 ml of preformed vesicle is required per 100 µg mRNA.\nTable 11.\n                Parameters to Enter into NanoAssemblr Ignite to Form Preformed Vesicles\ntable:\n﻿Parameter,Value\nTotal volume,1.5 ml\nTFRa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl11-note-0001_122],12 ml/min\nFRRb[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl11-note-0002_123],3:1\nStart waste,0.25 ml\nEnd waste,0.05 ml\nC syringe volume,3 ml\nR syringe volume,1 ml\na Total Flow Rate.\nb Flow Rate Ratio.\n4. Insert a new NxGen cartridge into the instrument and check that it has been recognized. Insert the waste and 15-ml sample centrifuge tubes.\n5. Draw a little more than the required volume of 100 mM acetate buffer into the 3-ml syringe using a blunt needle. Draw in some extra air and invert the syringe so the needle is pointing up and tap the syringe to dislodge any air bubbles. Remove the needle and plunge the syringe to remove any remaining air. Place the syringe firmly in the C position of the cartridge.\nFor example, if the formulation total volume is 1.5 ml, at least 1.125 ml is required in the aqueous syringe. Therefore, it is advised to add at least 1.25 ml to the syringe.",
    "6. Draw the lipids solution into the 1-ml syringe using a blunt needle. Remove the needle and plunge the syringe so that there is no air remaining. Place the syringe firmly in the R position of the cartridge.\n7. Ensure the instrument is in the ready state and start the formulation.\nEnsure the volume in each syringe is at least a syringe graduation more than is displayed on the instrument before formulation.\n8. When the formulation of the preformed vesicles is complete, immediately add the appropriate volume of preformed vesicle to the mRNA solution and pipette up and down to mix thoroughly.\nFor example, 150 µg mRNA requires 0.9 ml preformed vesicles. It is important not to leave the iLNP solution (both before and after complexing to mRNA) standing in the presence of ethanol for long.\n9. Immediately transfer the lipid nanoparticle suspension to the DPBS in the pre-rinsed spin filters from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002], step 5.\nEvenly split the formulation between the two spin filters, in this case 0.525 ml to each. The iLNP solution should be diluted 15-30 times in DPBS.\n10. Follow steps 15-18 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002] to complete the formulation.",
    "Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0004] describes the routine analysis and quality control of iLNPs including the mRNA concentration and encapsulation efficiency (RiboGreen), particle size, and zeta potential (DLS). The protocol also describes extraction of mRNA from the nanoparticle to assess the integrity of the mRNA. An assay to determine the apparent pKa of the particles is also described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0004] but is not required for routine analysis. In depth analysis of the morphology and structure of iLNPs using techniques such as cryo-TEM is not described here. Detailed studies on the structure of iLNPs have been described by Brader et al. (2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0014]), Kulkarni et al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0048]) and Li et al. (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0052]). Examples of results obtained and how to interpret them using the methods described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0004] are in the Understanding Results section.\nThe RiboGreen experiment should typically be carried out first to determine the encapsulation efficiency and concentration of encapsulated mRNA. The concentration should be adjusted to 100 µg/ml according to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002], step 17. The remaining analyses (DLS, apparent pKa, mRNA extraction) should be carried out with the diluted solution.\nThe RiboGreen assay uses a dye that is non-fluorescent when free in solution but becomes fluorescent in the presence of RNA. The detergent Triton X-100 is added to the iLNP sample to disrupt the particle so that the total mRNA present in the well can be detected (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0009]). The difference between the total mRNA sample (with Triton X-100) and the free, non-encapsulated mRNA is used to determine the concentration of encapsulated mRNA and the encapsulation efficiency. The encapsulation efficiency should typically be greater than 80%.",
    "The particle size and polydispersity index is measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS). DLS measures the fluctuations of scattered light by particles as they move in solution according to Brownian motion and uses algorithms to determine hydrodynamic diameter of the particles and the polydispersity index (PDI). The DLS instrument can also be used to measure the zeta potential of particles. Zeta potential is deduced from the electrophoretic mobility of charged particles under an applied electric field and is therefore a measure of the surface charge of the particles. iLNPs should typically be a uniform distribution of particles (i.e., one peak) with a diameter of 50 to 200 nm and a polydispersity index below 0.2. As iLNPs were designed to have a neutral surface charge, the zeta potential of particles generated using Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002] should be -10 to +10 mV. The size and charge of iLNPs have an effect on the activity and stability of the particles, therefore it is important to characterize the particles and adjust the formulation in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0002] as required (Hassett et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0033]; Nakamura et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0058]).",
    "The apparent pKa of particles is determined by measuring the fluorescence of 6-(p-toluidino)-2-napthalenesulfonic acid sodium salt (TNS) in buffers with pH 3 to 9. TNS is a negatively charged dye which becomes fluorescent as it partitions into the lipid membrane of the iLNP, attracted by the positive charge of the particle at low pH (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0010]). The pH-dependent behavior of the ionizable lipid generates a pH titration curve for the iLNP used to describe the apparent pKa of the particle. This assay can be used to evaluate the properties of novel ionizable lipids. The optimal apparent pKa for iLNPs is 6 to 7 as this allows the particles to have a neutral charge in neutral pH, which reduces toxicity and improves stability. A pKa in this range also means that under the reduced pH conditions in the endosome the ionizable lipid becomes protonated, facilitating the interaction with negatively charged endosomal phospholipids and eventual endosomal escape of the RNA cargo (Carrasco et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0016]; Patel et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0060]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53223939-2250-46ed-8292-4ed608f58bb5/cpz1898-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nSchematic of apparent pKa assay and TNS chemical structure. The negatively charged TNS dye is attracted to the positively charged surface of the iLNP at low pH resulting in increased fluorescence.\nExtraction of the mRNA from the iLNP is achieved using detergent and/or ethanol to break open the particle followed by adsorption and subsequent release of the mRNA from a solid phase. This provides an alternative to the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction with safer reagents and a simple protocol. This analysis may not be required routinely if the nanoparticles are being used within a few days; however, it may be useful if the iLNP has been stored for a few weeks. It may also be adapted for nuclease-protection assays [not described here, see Geall et al. (2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0029])].",

Rinse the cells with ethanol between uses as described here and store dry.\nExtract mRNA for quality assessment\n30. Prepare RNA wash buffer by diluting the RNA wash buffer concentrate (provided in the Zymo Quick-RNA Microprep kit) five-fold with ethanol.\nFor example, 24 ml RNA wash buffer concentrate is diluted with 96 ml ethanol.",
    "31. In an RNase-free Eppendorf tube add 20 µl of the iLNP sample at 100 µg/ml, followed by 10 µl RNA lysis buffer then 10 µl ethanol. Pipette up and down to mix.\nThe column capacity of the spin columns provided with the kit is 100 µg of mRNA, therefore, more sample can be loaded than described here if required for downstream analysis. For example, the TapeStation requires a minimum sample size of 25 ng, however, gel electrophoresis requires at least 300 ng for a visible band (see Understanding Results section) consequently the mRNA extraction procedure would need to be carried out with more sample loaded on to the column.\n32. Transfer the solution to a Zymo-Spin IC column in a collection tube, provided with the kit. Centrifuge 30 s at 10,000 to 16,000 × g, room temperature. Discard flow through.\n33. Add 400 µl RNA prep buffer provided with the kit to the column and centrifuge as in step 32, discard flow through.\n34. Add 700 µl RNA wash buffer prepared in step 30 to the column and centrifuge as in step 32, discard flow through.\n35. Add 400 µl RNA wash buffer to the column and centrifuge 60 s at 10,000 to 16,000 × g, room temperature.\nThe extra centrifugation time is to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer.\n36. Transfer the column to a new RNase-free Eppendorf tube. Add 15 µl RNase-free water to the column and centrifuge as in step 32.\n37. The flow through contains the extracted mRNA. Analyze by automated gel electrophoresis as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0001] step 34 to 41. See the Understanding Results section for examples and interpretation (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0005], Fig. 13[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0013], and Table 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-tbl-0007]).",
    "Alternatively, the extracted mRNA can be analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-prot-0001], steps 30 to 33). While it is more difficult to quantify degradation using agarose gel, analysis of the band intensity can be used to estimate mRNA integrity using imaging software such as FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-bib-0068]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/eee659ab-8055-453d-9054-ce79754484bd/cpz1898-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nOverlay of electropherogram traces of mRNA samples pre-encapsulation (blue) and post-encapsulation (red). The band at 25 nt indicates the lower size marker added to each sample in the sample buffer.\nApparent pKa assay\n38. Portion the phosphate-citrate-borate buffer evenly across 20 containers (50 ml each). Adjust the pH of each aliquot using 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCl to achieve roughly even increments between pH 3 and 9 (∼0.3 units).\nNalgene bottles or centrifuge tubes are appropriate containers. The contents in Nalgene bottles can be stirred with a magnetic flea and centrifuge tubes can be vortexed before measurement. It is important that the solution is properly mixed prior to taking a pH measurement. When adjusting the pH, the pH can be estimated using a digital pH meter followed by a more precise measurement with a benchtop pH meter with multipoint calibration. The pH-adjusted stocks can be stored frozen for later use; however, after a few freeze-thaw cycles the pH should be measured again. Ensure that the thawed buffer has reached room temperature before use in the assay or measuring the pH.\n39. Dissolve the TNS reagent in DMSO to 0.1 mg/ml.\nFor example, make a 1 mg/ml stock solution by dissolving 1 mg of TNS reagent in 1 ml DMSO. Take 100 µl of the 1 mg/ml stock solution and add 900 µl DMSO to make the 0.1 mg/ml solution. Both solutions can be stored frozen (-20°C) in the dark for later use.",
    "40. Aliquot 1 ml of each of the 20 buffers into an appropriate container such as an Eppendorf tube or cryovial. Add 22 µl of 0.1 mg/ml TNS in DMSO solution to each buffer and vortex.\nDiscard these solutions when done with the assay. Do not freeze for future use.\n41. Add 2.5 µl of each iLNP sample into 20 wells of an opaque or black walled 96-well plate. Layout samples according to Figure 11B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0011].\nWhen analyzing multiple LNP samples, ensure that all 20 aliquots of each LNP are laid out on the same 96-well plate.\n42. Add 92.5 µl of each buffer containing TNS into the wells with iLNP sample so that each iLNP well has a different pH buffer added to it.\n43. Read the fluorescence of the TNS reagent with a plate reader using λex 325 nm and λem 435 nm.\n44. Convert the fluorescence readings to relative fluorescence (divide all values by the highest reading) and fit the relative fluorescence data to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (see Equation 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-disp-0007] below). Report the apparent pKa for each lipid (pH at which half of the maximum TNS fluorescence is reached). Examples of fluorescence curves and fitting data is described in the Understanding Results section (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.898#cpz1898-fig-0008]).\n         \nformula:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} RFU = RF{U_{min}} + \\frac{{RF{U_{max}} - RF{U_{min}}}}{{1 + {{10}^{p{K_a} - pH}}}}\\nonumber\\\\ \\end{eqnarray}$$\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation fits a sigmoidal function to the data points. In software such as GraphPad Prism, an EC50 shift equation, for example Y = Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/{1 + 10[(LogEC50-X) × HillSlope]}, where X values are logarithms, may be used and logEC50 reported as pKa. Set the HillSlope value constraint to 1."
