    "In this protocol, neonatal immunodeficient pups are injected intrahepatically with HUSCs (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-fig-0001]; Pearson et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-bib-0018]). Engraftment can also be done intravenously via the intracardiac route or facial vein, intraperitoneally, or by intratibial injection. Prior to engraftment, preconditioning of the pups with low-dose sublethal irradiation is necessary to ensure engraftment, proliferation, and survival of HUSCs.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2e07f516-ff9c-4a1b-b463-707bb1e6398d/cpz1800-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nHUSC engraftment of neonatal immunodeficient mice. NSG pups are sublethally irradiated at 100 cGy to improve engraftment. After irradiation, HUSCs are injected intrahepatically and development of human cells is assessed after 10-12 weeks.\nMaterials\nMale and female adult mice: NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (The Jackson Laboratory, IMSR cat. no. JAX:005557, RRID:IMSR_JAX:005557)\nHUSCs (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-prot-0003])\nTopical, petroleum-based nasal decongestant (e.g., Vicks VapoRub)\nAutoclaved, ventilated cage or container for housing pups in irradiator chamber\nSterile biosafety hood\nX-ray irradiator (RS 2000 X-ray Biological Irradiator, RadSource)\n26- to 30-G insulin syringes (BD, cat. no. 328466)\nWarming lamp or heating pad\n1. Pair male and female NSG mice and monitor for new litters (from day 20 onwards).\nOnce pups are present, watch for cannibalism. Do not waste HUSCs on a litter that will be cannibalized. The presence of a milk spot (stomach filled with milk) indicates that the pups are nursing and are well enough to be injected. The milk spot can be seen through the abdomen skin (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/076ea432-4880-42da-9ccb-61268c658e7b/cpz1800-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nThe milk spot in newborn NSG pups can be visualized through the skin of the abdomen. The presence of the milk spot indicates that pups are nursing and are well enough to be injected.\n2. On the day of the engraftment, turn on the X-ray irradiator and initiate the warm-up procedure.\n3. Count HUSCs and suspend in medium at 3–10 × 104 CD34+ cells/50 µl.",
    "4. Place 24-hr to 48-hr-old pups in a sterile, ventilated cage (typically one litter per cage) in a sterile biosafety hood.\n5. Before pups are irradiated and anesthetized, restrain parents and place a small amount of topical, petroleum-based nasal decongestant on their snouts.\nThis will reduce their ability to detect any scent transferred to the pups during handling, which will increase parent acceptance and reduce potential pup cannibalism.\n6. Place the cage containing pups in the RAD+ reflector block of the irradiator chamber (level 1 of the instrument) and irradiate pups for ∼1 min at 1 Gy.\nThe RS 2000 is a direct replacement for cesium-137 and cobalt-60 irradiators. Each irradiator may vary in dose rate and function. The radiation dose is measured in rad or Gray (100 rad = 1 Gy). Irradiation times correspond with dose rates.\n7. Transfer irradiated pups to a weigh boat on ice until they are anesthetized by the cold. Use cessation of movement as a sign of anesthesia (this could take ∼5 min).\nDo not place pups directly on ice.\n8. Load an insulin syringe with a 26- to 30-G needle with the HUSC suspension.\n9. Restrain pups for intrahepatic injection and dispense 50 µl HUSC suspension into the liver.\nA second person is needed to help restrain the pup for intrahepatic injection. For restraint technique and location of liver, see Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-fig-0003].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a9be5d6f-e377-4a38-944b-ca9bc7600ade/cpz1800-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nNSG pup restraint technique and site for intrahepatic injection. The pup is restrained by having a second person gently scruff at the nape of the neck and hold the base of the tail. The liver should be visible to allow for proper injection.",
    "10. Return pups to the parent cage and roll them in the bedding to reduce smells associated with handling. Warm the pups under a warming lamp for 1-2 min.\nWhen the pups are returned to the cage, the parents will start to move them in various directions as they try to move them to safety.\n11. Wean pups at 21-24 days post birth.\n12. Verify engraftment of HUSCs starting at 10 weeks of age by using flow cytometry to analyze peripheral blood staining for human CD45+ (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-prot-0004]).",
    "To generate humanized mice at the age of 4 weeks, mice are injected with HUSCs by intravenous tail injection. This method can be used for NSG or NSG.HLA-A2 strains.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-prot-0001])\n4-week-old mice (The Jackson Laboratory):\n               \nNOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (IMSR cat. no. JAX:005557, RRID:IMSR_JAX:005557)\nNOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl Tg(HLA-A/H2-D/B2M)1Dvs/SzJ (ISMR cat. no. JAX:014570, RRID:IMSR_JAX:014570)\n28-G insulin syringes (BD, cat. no. 329424)\nInjection platform (Brain Tree Scientific, cat. no. IL-300)\nAlcohol wipes\n1. Turn on the X-ray irradiator and initiate the warm-up procedure.\n2. Count HUSCs and suspend in medium at 3–10 × 104 CD34+ cells/50 µl.\n3. Place 4-week-old adult mice in a sterile, ventilated cage (up to five per cage) in a sterile biosafety cabinet.\n4. Place the cage in the RAD+ reflector block of the irradiator chamber (level 1 of the instrument) and irradiate mice at 1.5 Gy for ∼2 min.\n5. Return irradiated mice to their cages.\n6. Prior to engraftment, warm one to several mice by placing a heat lamp within a few inches of the cage (this should take ∼30 min).\nHeat will increase the blood flow and make the tail vein more visible for easier injection. If the cage is hot to the touch, move the heat lamp further away.\n7. Load an insulin syringe with a 28-G needle with the HUSC suspension.\n8. Place the first mouse under the dome on the injection platform and then slide the tail through the slot so that it is facing you. Secure the tail by gently holding it with thumb and index finger, then wipe the tail with an alcohol wipe.\nWiping the tail skin with alcohol will sterilize the surface and improve visibility of the tail vein.",
    "9. Grab the tail with the thumb and index finger from top and bottom and twist it so that one of the four tail veins faces up.\nYour grip should be halfway down the tail so that you can try again closer to the tail base if the injection fails.\n10. Slightly pull and bend the tail so the surface of the bend (the injection site) is flat. Hold the needle parallel to the tail, insert it bevel-up into the vein, and inject 50 μl suspension.\nFor a video of the tail vein injection method, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TqphNj6-z0[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TqphNj6-z0].\nWhen the cells are injected properly, the fluid will move towards the tail base and replace the blood. Paravenous injection results in slight swelling of the injection site, which appears white. If this happens, stop any bleeding at the injection site using pressure with your thumb or a piece of gauze and try again closer to the base of the tail.\n11. Return mouse to its cage and repeat for all remaining mice.\n12. After 8 weeks, verify engraftment of HUSCs starting at 10 weeks of age by using flow cytometry to analyze peripheral blood staining for human CD45+ (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-prot-0004]).",
    "Human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells are isolated from human cord blood to alter immunodeficient mice. For sources of HUSCs, see Strategic Planning. This protocol describes how to thaw the cells and prepare them for injection.\nMaterials\nHematopoietic growth medium (HPGM; Bioz, cat. no. PT-3926)\nFetal bovine serum (FBS)\nFrozen HUSCs\n70% ethanol\nStemSpan CC100 (human cytokine cocktail; Stem Cell Technologies, cat. no. 02690)\n37°C water bath\n15-ml tubes\n37°C incubator\n1. Prepare 30 ml HPGM with 10% FBS and warm in a 37°C water bath.\n2. Wipe the exterior of a vial of frozen cells (typically 106 cells) with 70% ethanol and thaw quickly in a 37°C water bath.\n3. Aseptically transfer the entire volume of thawed cells to a 15-ml tube.\n4. Rinse vial that the cells were frozen in with 1 ml warm medium and add it dropwise (over ∼1 min) to the 15-ml tube while swirling.\nSlow and gentle addition of medium is important to optimize cell recovery.\n5. Slowly add warm medium dropwise to the cells, while swirling, until a total volume of 5 ml is reached over a 3-min period.\n6. Slowly add medium dropwise up to a total volume of 15 ml over ∼5-10 min, gently swirling after each addition.\n7. Centrifuge suspension for 15 min at 200 × g, room temperature.\n8. Remove most of the supernatant by pipet, being careful not to disturb the pellet (leave a few milliliters of supernatant behind).\nSave all washes in secondary tubes until the procedure is complete in case cell recovery is needed.\n9. Slowly add fresh medium to a volume of 15 ml while gently swirling.\n10. Centrifuge 15 min at 200 × g, room temperature.\n11. Carefully remove supernatant by pipet, leaving 1-2 ml.",
    "12. Gently resuspend pellet in a known volume of HPGM and count cells.\nDetermine how many mice will be injected and adjust the volume to use as many of the cells as possible.\n13. Add 1× StemSpan CC100 to the cells.\nStemSpan CC100 contains a combination of recombinant human cytokines to support proliferation of human hematopoietic cells. Recombinant human cytokines include FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and stem cell factor (SCF).\n14. Place cells in a 37°C incubator until ready to use.",
    "Flow cytometry is an easy method for monitoring human stem cell engraftment in the peripheral blood of humanized mice. Peripheral blood from the facial vein can be collected into a microtainer tube containing EDTA and stained using antibodies specific for human markers.\nMaterials\nEngrafted mice (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.800#cpz1800-prot-0001] or 2)\nFluorescently labeled antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific):\n               \nHuman CD45 FITC (clone HI30)\nHuman CD4 Superbright 600 (clone RPA-T4)\nHuman CD8 Superbright 436 (clone HIT8a)\nHuman CD3 PE Cyanine 5.5 (clone SK7)\nUltraComp eBeads Plus Compensation Beads (Invitrogen, cat. no. 01-3333-42)\nBD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences, cat. no. 349202)\nFlow buffer: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.02% NaN3\nEDTA blood collection tubes (e.g., BD Biosciences Microtainer tubes, cat. no. 365974)\n21-G BD PrecisionGlide Needles (cat. no. 305165)\n12 × 75–mm round-bottom disposable test tubes (Falcon, cat. no. 352052)\nTest tube shaker\nFlow tubes: 12 × 75–mm round-bottom disposable test tubes (Falcon, cat. no. 352052\nFlow cytometer (e.g., Attune NxT, Life Technologies)\n1. Restrain mice and collect 50-200 µl whole blood by submandibular bleed into one EDTA collection tube per mouse.\nThe volume of blood collected over a 24-hr period must not exceed 1% of the animal's body weight. For a video of the submandibular bleed procedure, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niTVnEAHOko[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niTVnEAHOko].\n2. For each sample, resuspend blood and transfer 50 µl to a labeled 12 × 75–mm flow tube. Use the remaining blood for unstained controls and compensation beads.\nAt least one unstained control is needed for each group to compare to the stained samples. These are used to find and gate the target cell population and help indicate background fluorescence. UltraComp eBeads contain both positive and negative beads that, when stained with single fluorophores, remove spillover from other channels.",
    "3. Stain each sample by adding 5 µl of each antibody (typically 0.5 μg per sample). Do not add antibody to unstained controls.\nThe indicated antibodies detect the percentage of mature human T lymphocytes (CD3+), suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+CD8+), and helper/inducer T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+CD4+) in erythrocyte-lysed whole blood.\n4. Cover samples to protect from light and shake at 150 rpm for 30 min at room temperature.\n5. While samples are staining, prepare the compensation bead controls:\n         \nVortex the bottle of beads briefly and then add one drop to a separate flow tube for each fluorophore.\nAdd 0.5 μl of each antibody to the respective tubes. Cover and vortex for ∼5-10 s.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min.\n6. Add 200 ml of 1× BD FACS Lysing Solution to each sample tube. Vortex for ∼5-10 s and incubate 15 min at room temperature, protected from light.\n7. While samples are lysing, finish the preparation of the compensation beads:\n         \nAdd 2 ml flow buffer per tube and centrifuge 5 min at 400 × g.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend beads in 0.5-1 ml flow buffer.\n8. Wash samples by adding 2 ml flow buffer to each tube and centrifuging 5 min at 200 × g. Aspirate supernatant.\nRepeat wash if the pellet remains red.\n9. Add 0.5-1 ml flow buffer to each tube and analyze on a flow cytometer.\n         \nBriefly vortex each sample immediately before analysis.\nUse a flow cytometer that can read four-color cytometry. Collect at least 10,000 events.\nIf the cytometer is equipped with greater configuration options capable of reading more colors, the antibody panel can be increased."
