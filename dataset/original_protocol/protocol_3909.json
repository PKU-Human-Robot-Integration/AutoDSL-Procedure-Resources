For digestion of kidney tissue, 1 h 30 min. For gRECs, 1 h. For renal parenchyma ECs: Endothelial cell enrichment using CD31 murine MicroBeads, 45 min. For FACs, 1–2 h.\nFigure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A shows a detailed scheme of kidney EC isolation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/879-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. EC isolation from mouse kidney and glomeruli\n(A) Detailed scheme illustrating isolation of ECs from kidney.\n(B and C) Representative FACS plots for gating strategy to sort ECs from kidney glomeruli (B) based on sorting live/CD45-/CD73-/CD102+ cells and from renal parenchyma (C) based on sorting live/CD45-/CD31+ cells.\nThe kidney EC isolation protocol is designed for separate isolation of glomerular ECs and renal parenchyma ECs (Dumas et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The fraction of renal parenchyma ECs still contains some glomerular ECs (as shown in (Kalucka et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B) therefore if no pure population of glomerular EC is needed, steps #1b, #1d, #2i, #3, #5b, #5g are optional.\nPreparation of kidney and glomeruli digestion buffer\nRight before isolation, prepare kidney digestion buffer containing:\nHBSS (Ca2+, Mg2+)\n0.2% (w/v) collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#C9891)\n7.5 μg/mL DNase I\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_879_3.csv\nPrepare fresh PBS-based glomeruli digestion buffer:\nNote: We recommend to prepare and pre-warm (at 37°C) glomeruli digestion buffer after step #3c.\n80% (v/v) of Trypsin-EDTA 0.25% (final concentration of trypsin: 0.2%)\n20 IU/mL Heparin\n50 μg/mL DNase I\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_879_4.csv\nPrepare PBS-based Wash Buffer 2.\nRight before isolation prepare trypsin neutralization solution:\nHBSS (containing Ca2+, Mg2+)\n10% (v/v) FBS\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_879_5.csv\nStore prepared buffers and solutions at 4°C until needed.\n15 mL of kidney digestion buffer suffices for kidneys from 3 adult mice. 1 mL of glomeruli digestion buffer suffices for glomeruli from 3 adult mice.",
    "Digestion of kidney tissue\nBefore dissecting kidneys, perform transcardial perfusion via the left ventricle with ice-cold PBS at a perfusion rate of 1 mL/minute for 5 min.\nHarvest kidneys. Removing the capsules is optional.\nStore kidneys in ice-cold HBSS.\nTransfer kidneys to a petri dish containing around 5 mL kidney digestion buffer, cut the kidneys into small pieces (approx. 1-2 mm2) using a scalpel blade and transfer everything into a 50 mL conical tube. Fill up the volume with kidney digestion buffer (e.g., 15 mL for 6 kidneys).\nIncubate the sample in digestion buffer for 40 min in a 37°C water bath.\nCritical: Shake the tube vigorously by hand every 10 min for faster tissue dissociation.\nCritical: After this step, the digestion should be complete (single cell suspension with glomeruli, no macroscopic pieces left). This is critical for the following steps.\nAdd an equal volume (same volume as digestion buffer) of cold HBSS to stop the digestion.\nFilter cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer, and wash the conical tube and the strainer once with 5-10 mL of cold HBSS.\nSplit the flow-through in two equal fractions and filter each fraction using a 40 μm cell strainer: a part of undigested glomeruli remains stacked in the strainers.\nWash the glomeruli on the cell strainers extensively (15 times) with 6 mL of cold HBSS to allow the tubules wash through the strainers → continue to step 3 for isolation of the glomerular ECs.\nCentrifuge the filtered cells suspension (flow-through) for 7 min at 300 g, remove the supernatant → continue to step 4 for isolation of renal parenchyma ECs.\nGlomerular Renal Endothelial Cells (gRECs)\nTransfer the 40 μm cell strainers to a Petri dish.",
    "Collect glomeruli in a 15 mL conical tube by washing the interior of the strainers (upper side of the mesh and inner sides) and collecting from the top of the strainers (with 200 μL HBSS each time for a minimum of 10 times).\nNote: Thoroughly inspect the interior of the strainers when collecting the glomeruli: the glomerular material is visible by eye. Wash until no more glomerular material can be seen.\nNote: If necessary, in order to collect remaining glomeruli, one could cut out the mesh from cell strainers and immerge filter meshes in 1ml HBSS for additional washing. Additional cell suspension should be transferred to the 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the glomeruli at 300 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nNote: After this step, the pellet can be resuspended in 1 mL of HBSS to inspect, under the microscope, the purity of the glomerular suspension. Following by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Typical suspension yields >80% glomerular structures and contaminating remaining tubules, which do not include ECs, therefore their presence doesn’t preclude obtaining a high glomerular EC purity.\nReconstitute and preheat glomeruli digestion buffer for 5 min in water bath at 37°C.\nIncubate for precisely 23 min in a 37°C water bath.\nResuspend every 5 min by pipetting up and down with a 1 mL tip.\nNeutralize trypsin activity by adding 2 mL of trypsin neutralization solution and dilute up to 10 mL with HBSS.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 400 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL HBSS.\nContinue with FACS staining.\nRenal parenchyma ECs: Endothelial cell enrichment using CD31 murine MicroBeads",
    "Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of Wash Buffer 1 and add the appropriate volume of CD31 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-097-418) to the suspension according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nNote: We suggest to resuspend the cells in 90 μL of Wash Buffer 1, determine the cell number and follow the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd31-microbeads-mouse.html?countryRedirected=1#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd31-microbeads-mouse.html?countryRedirected=1#gref]) i.e., for up to 1×107 total cells, resuspend the cells in 90 μL of Wash Buffer 1 and add 10 μL of CD31 MicroBeads. If fewer than 1×107 cells are available, use the same volumes as indicated above. When working with higher cell numbers than 1×107 cells, scale up all reagent volumes and total volumes accordingly.\nMix and incubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: Process samples fast in order to avoid non-specific binding of beads at 20°C–22°C.\nWash the cells by adding 3 mL of Wash Buffer 2 and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDuring the centrifugation prepare collection tubes and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-042-401) according to the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ls-columns.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ls-columns.html#gref]) i.e., place the column in the suitable magnetic separator and prepare the column by rinsing with 3 mL of Wash Buffer.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of Wash Buffer 2.\nApply the cell suspension onto the prepared LS column through a 40 μm cell strainer to remove potential cell aggregates in order to prevent clogging of the column.\nWash the LS column 3 times with 3 mL Wash Buffer 2, adding buffer each time once the column reservoir is empty.\nNote: The eluent (CD31-negative fraction) from step #4f can be used to prepare controls for FACS analysis or can be discarded if not further needed.\nRemove the LS column from the separator and place it onto a new 15 mL conical collection tube.",
    "Pipet 5 mL Wash Buffer 1 onto the LS column. Immediately flush out the fraction containing the magnetically labeled cells (CD31-positive fraction) by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column.\nContinue with FACS staining.\nFACS\nTiming: 1–2 h\nCritical: Prepare all required controls for flow cytometry analysis beforehand i.e., unstained cell (US) control, viability control (VB), Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) control, isotype controls (optional), as well as the compensation controls (one for each fluorophore) for proper set up of the cytometer.\nNote: We recommend to use the cells from the final step of the isolation as the cell controls (US, VB, FMO, isotype controls). However, if the cell number is limited, one can use other cells (e.g., CD31-negative fraction) to prepare the controls. For compensation controls we would recommend to use compensation beads (e.g., OneComp eBeads™ Compensation Beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#01-1111-41) to ensure clear fluorescence signal and sufficient compensation.\nCentrifuge the glomerular and the renal parenchymal cell suspensions at 300 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the glomerular cell pellet in 0.5 mL Wash buffer 1-based staining solution containing:\nCD102 (ICAM-2) Monoclonal Antibody (3C4), e.g.,: CD102/ICAM-2-Alexa647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A15452) (1:300).\nCD73 Monoclonal Antibody (TY/11.8), e.g., CD73-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BioLegend, Cat#127213) (1:100).\nCD45 Monoclonal Antibody (30-F11), e.g., CD45-PE-Cyanine7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#25-0451-82; 1:700).\nViability Dye, e.g. eFluor 450 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#65-0863-18; 1:1000).\nResuspend the renal parenchyma cell pellet in 0.5 mL Wash Buffer 1-based staining solution containing:\nCD102 (ICAM-2) Monoclonal Antibody (3C4), e.g., CD102/ICAM-2-Alexa647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A15452) (1:300).\nCD31 (PECAM-1) Monoclonal Antibody (390), e.g., CD31-FITC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#11-0311-82; 1:300).\nCD45 Monoclonal Antibody (30-F11), e.g., CD45-PE-Cyanine7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#25-0451-82; 1:700).\nViability Dye, e.g., eFluor 450 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#65-0863-18; 1:1000).\nStain the cells for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.",
    "Add 3 mL of Wash Buffer 1 and centrifuge the stained cells at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellets in Wash Buffer 1 and proceed with FACS.\nFor glomerular cells sort viable, CD45- & CD73-, CD102+ cells to the collection tubes.\nFor renal parenchyma cells sort viable, CD45-, CD31+ cells to the collection tubes.\nFigure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B shows representative FACS plots and gating strategy of viable, CD45-, CD73-, CD102+ glomerular ECs. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C shows representative FACS plots and gating strategy of viable, CD45-, CD31+ renal parenchyma ECs.\nNote: Renal parenchyma ECs are CD102+ and CD31+. Although it is not mandatory to include both antibodies in the staining panel, we highly recommend to do so. In this way, CD102 staining can serve as a control ensuring that the antibody works.\nNote: To ensure high viability of the ECs, sort the renal parenchyma ECs to a collection tube containing collection medium (10% (v/v) FBS in PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A38401).\nCritical: Sort the pure glomerular EC fraction to a collection tube containing Wash Buffer 2. Presence of FBS in collection medium reduces viability of the gRECs after sorting.\nSpleen endothelial cell isolation\nTiming: ∼6 h 15 min. For preparation of spleen digestion buffer, 45 min. For digestion of spleen tissue, 2 h. For immune cell depletion using CD45 murine MicroBeads, 45 min. For endothelial cell enrichment using CD31 murine MicroBeads, 45 min. For FACS, 1–2 h.\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A shows a detailed scheme of spleen EC isolation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/879-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
