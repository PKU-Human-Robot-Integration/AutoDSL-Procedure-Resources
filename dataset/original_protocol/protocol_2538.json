The method could be applied for isolation of different cell types with a similar positive selection approach.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2170-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the biotin labeling of the CD34+ and CD45+ cells\n(A) Labelling of target cells by magnetic bead. (B) Biotinylation in MACS column. (C) Termination of biotinilation with TBS. (D) PBS washing step (optional). (E) Elution.\nNote: We suggest using swing-bucket centrifugation to reduce the loss of cells.\nCollect the cells into a conical tube and centrifuge at 125 × g for 10 min.\nDissolve the cell pellet in 10 mL PBS.\nCount the cells with the help of a hemocytometer.\nContinue with 2 × 107 cells.\nCentrifuge at 125 × g for 10 min. Repeat the PBS washing step 2 twice.",
    "Dissolve the cell pellet in 80 μL MACS buffer.\nNote: Be gentle when dissolving the cells. Try not to use small pipette tips; narrow tips may increase cell damage.\nAdd 20 μL CD34 and CD45 microbeads to the cell suspension.\nMix gently and incubate at +4°C for 15 min; rotate slowly.\nAdd 2 mL labeling buffer and centrifuge the cells at 125 × g for 10 min to wash the cells.\nPlace the LS (largescale) MACS column on the magnetic separator.\nRinse the column by adding 2 mL MACS buffer.\nAdd the labeled cells into the MACS column. Unlabeled cells will flow through the column.\nWash the cells with 3 mL MACS buffer once then wash with PBS 3 times.\nNote: If cells do not attach to the column in magnetic field, see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] for workable solutions. In case of slow or no flow through on the column, see troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] for possible solutions.\nCritical: Ensure that the MACS buffer is thoroughly washed/removed from the column, as it can interfere with the biotinylation process. Additional washing steps with PBS can be performed/are recommended.\nSurface biotinylation of the cells in the MACS column\nTiming: 40 min\nThis section describes an efficient way of surface biotinylation of the cells in the MACS column (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPlace a 15 mL Falcon tube to collect the flow-through solution and add the biotinylation solution into the column.\nTake the flow-through (biotinylation solution) and add it to the column again. Repeat this process at least 10 times.\nNote: The labeling process should be limited to a maximum of 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Note: The flow rate depends on the scale of the column. Therefore, the process needs to be repeated for at least 15 min, and the repeat process needs to be adjusted accordingly.\nApply 2 mL TBS buffer into the column to quench the biotinylation reaction. Repeat the TBS wash 3 times.\nAdd 2 mL MACS buffer to the column.\nRemove the column from the magnetic separator.\nPlunge the column into the collection tube to elute the surface biotinylated cells.\nValidation of surface biotin labeling\nTiming: 20 min + Flow cytometry analysis\nThis section describes a flow cytometry-based method to validate biotinylation of surface proteins and plasma membrane integrity.\nTake 75 μL (it should be approximately 106 cells) from the eluted cells obtained from step C6 to validate biotinylation.\nTake 106 cells from the non-biotinylated CD34+ CD45+ PBMCs into a separate tube as a control to measure the non-specific streptavidin bindings.\nTake 106 cells from the non-biotinylated CD34+ CD45+ PBMCs into a separate tube as an auto-fluorescent to adjust the fluorescent intensity threshold. (Do not add any fluorescence-emitting substance).\nAdjust the volumes to 100 μL with PBS.\nAdd 3 μL streptavidin-FITC onto the 100 μL of cells (steps 26 and 27) and incubate at RT for 15 min in a dark place.\nAdd 2 μL 7-AAD to the samples and incubate at RT for 2–3 min.\nComplete the volumes to 2 mL with PBS.\nAnalyze the cells with appropriate settings in a Flow cytometry instrument (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Note: After flow cytometry analysis, over 80% of the population should be FITC positive and 7-AAD negative. If the percentage of FITC positive cells is below 80%, do not continue the downstream workflow. This situation may result from low biotinylation efficiency (troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). The presence of a high number of 7-AAD-positive cells could indicate cell death. We recommend an additional wash during the MACS step.\nOptional: If there is a need to confirm the MACS step, researchers may add properly selected antibodies to validate the purity of the cell population. One should remember that the fluorochrome chosen should not be in the spectrum of Streptavidin conjugated FITC and 7-AAD.\nIsolation of biotinylated surface proteins\nTiming: 60 min\nThis section describes cell lysis and isolation of biotinylated proteins using streptavidin resin from the lysate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2170-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of On-Bead digestion of biotin-labeled cells\nCentrifuge the cells obtained from step 25 at 125 × g for 10 min.\nAdd protease inhibitor (2% v/v) to the 500 μL RIPA lysis buffer and dissolve the cell pellet.\nNote: Pipetting will improve the efficiency of cell lysis; repeat 20 times at least.\nIncubate the cells on ice for 30 min and apply a 5-s vortex every 10 min through dispersion and disruption of the cell pellet.\nNote: DNase (0.5 μL/mL Benzonase) could be applied to reduce the viscosity of the lysate.\nNote: If it is available, Bioruptor sonication can be applied.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 15000 × g for 10 min at +4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a clean collection tube.\nCritical: Use protein low-bind tubes after this step.\nWash the 75 μL streptavidin resin with 500 μL PBS and centrifuge at 1000 × g for 1 min to clean the storage solution.",
    "Repeat the washing step with 100 μL lysis buffer to equilibrate the resin with the cell lysate.\nCombine the streptavidin resin with cell lysate and incubate at RT for an hour on a rotator mixer.\nCentrifuge the resin at 1000 × g for 1 min; the unbound proteins will remain in the supernatant.\nNote: Unbound proteins can be discarded or stored for further analysis.\nWash the resin with 100 μL lysis buffer and centrifuge at 1000 × g for 1 min.\nWash the beads with 1 mL PBS and centrifuge at 1000 × g for 1 min; repeat the washing step 3 times.\nCritical: Additional extensive washing steps (step 44) are strongly recommended to prevent detergent contamination for the mass spectrometry.\nPause point: Keep the samples −80°C, proteins could be stored on beads for couple of months.\nOn-bead digestion\nTiming: 30 min + overnight incubation. 4 h + 15 min\nThis section describes enzymatic digestion of enriched biotinylated proteins on streptavidin agarose bead for mass spectrometry analysis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nSuspend the resin in 300 μL 0.2% (w/v) RapiGest solution containing TEAB.\nAdd TCEP and IAA to the solution at a final concentration of 20 and 40 mM, respectively.\nIncubate the resin at 60°C for 30 min and cool on ice.\nAdd 200 ng Lys-C to the resin mixture and incubate overnight at 37°C.\nAfter Lys-C incubation, add 800 ng Trypsin-Gold to the resin and incubate for 4 h at 37°C.\nCentrifuge the resin at 10000 g for 1 min; transfer the supernatant into a low-bind collection tube.\nAcidify the sample with TFA (1% final concentration) before loading it into Stage Tips.\nActivate the Stage Tips with the addition of 250 μL In-Stage conditioning buffer.\nAdd 250 μL In-Stage washing buffer to equilibrate the Stage Tips.",
    "Load the acidified samples into the Stage Tips and wash the peptide-bounded tips with washing buffer. Repeat the washing step 3 times.\nAdd 50 μL In-Stage elution buffer and elute the peptides with a syringe; apply pressure on the In-Stage tips to facilitate the elution process.\nNote: Additional extensive washing steps (step 54) are strongly recommended to prevent detergent contamination for the mass spectrometry.\nNote: In our experience, repeating the elution step is increases the peptide yield. If a high volume of elution is not preferred 25 μL elution can be repeated 2 twice.\nDry the eluate with a vacuum concentrator and store at −20°C.\nNote: On-bead Digestion protocol adapted from Bonn and Otto (2018).4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nPause point: Keep the samples −80°C, lyophilized peptides could be stored for couple of years.\nLC-MS/MS analysis\nTiming: 30 min + 180 min LC-MS/MS + 4–6 h Protein Identification\nThis section illustrates parameters of mass spectrometry analysis of enriched membrane proteins. The parameters depend on the available device.\nNote: Proteomic analysis may be conducted with any high-resolution LC-MS configuration if compatible or equivalent to the ABSciex ToF 5600+ System.\nDissolve the dried samples in 12 μL of the sample solution (5% ACN, 0.1% Formic Acid),\nSonicate the samples in the ultrasonic water bath for 1 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 15000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant into insert-vials.\nInject 4 μL of peptide mixture in a trap elute mode and separate in a reverse phase analytical column.\nNote: LC separation method and parameters depend on the available instrument and columns. We applied 4 μL of peptide mixture to Monocap Column (1.8 μm HSS T3 75 μm × 250 mm) with trap elute mode. A 180-min gradient (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) with a 350 nL/min flow rate for the peptide elution was used.",
    "table:files/protocols_protocol_2170_14.csv\nIdentify peptides using a high-resolution mass spectrometry instrument. The mass spectrometry data acquisition and analysis will vary based on the mass spectrometry to be employed.\nNote: We employed Eksigent expert nanoLC 425 integrated with ABSciex TripleTOF® 5600+. The Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) approach was applied for peptide analysis. Positive TOF MS scanning type (Accumulation time: 0.250 s, Collision Energy (CE): 10, Declustering Potential (DP): 100, TOF Masses 350.000–1250.000 Da) was used to do the precursor ion (Precursor-lon) analysis. Positive Product Ion scanning type was used to analyze product ions created by fragmented precursor peptides. Collision Energy (CE): rolling (Accumulation Time: 0.0500 s. TOF Masses 230.000–1500.000 Da, Declustering Potential (DP) 100, Collision Energy Spread (CES) 10. The top 35 candidate molecules (Top35) for each study cycle were selected based on their mass and charge (Switch criteria: >350.000 m/z, 1250.000 m/z, Ion tolerance 150.000 mDA).\nCollect and analyze mass spectrometry raw data with accompanying software.\nIdentify proteins via proteomics search engine.\nUse organism specific reference proteome database.\nApply Carbamidomethyl as a fixed modification, and Thioacyl modification as a variable modification during data analysis.\nNote: The mass spectrometry raw data was collected and analyzed using Analyst® TF v 1.6 (ABSciex). Peak View (1.2) Mass fingerprint ProteinPilot 4.5 Beta (ABSciex) generated by the reporting of the device) were used to evaluate the peptides and product ions. The proteins, their modifications and isoforms were identified using the current protein session retrieved from UniProtKB (UniProtKB: UP000005640, Organism ID:9606, 06_2022). We used global false discovery rate (FDR) 1%. Every identified protein must be represented with at least 2 unique peptides.",
