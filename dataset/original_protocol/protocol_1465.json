    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue harvest\nTiming: 20 min per mouse\nFor non-arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation and intra-abdominal heterotopic heart transplantation surgical procedures please refer to (Yokota et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and (Corry et al., 1973[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Here, we describe the harvesting of transplanted and native hearts and livers from mice. Harvesting of tissues is ideally performed under terminal anesthesia to reduce the risk of thrombosis, though may be done immediately after euthanasia. The transplanted heart is located in the abdomen, thus harvesting of the transplant and native hearts require separate procedures. The transplanted liver replaces the native liver, thus the procedure for harvesting either a transplanted or native liver is the same.\nInduce anesthesia and place the mouse in a supine position with continuous anesthetic delivery. Secure the limbs with tape to provide access to the abdomen.\nSterilize the abdomen with 70% ethanol.\nOpen the mouse:\nWith forceps, lift the skin at the pelvis and make an incision with scissors.\nContinue the incision to the sternum, exposing the peritoneal cavity membrane.\nCarefully cut open the peritoneum from the pelvis to the sternum.\nFurther open the abdomen by incising along the flanks.\nMove the abdominal organs aside with cotton tip applicators to expose the transplanted organ.\nProceed with step 5 for liver transplant mice, and steps 6 and 7 for heart transplant mice.\nPerfuse and collect the transplanted liver (Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]):\nLocate and incompletely sever the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the top of the liver (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPerfuse the liver with 10 mL cold saline by inserting a 23 G needle attached to a 10 mL syringe into the IVC. The liver will blanch and appear pale with correct perfusion.\nRemove and discard the gallbladder (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).",

Resection of the transplanted liver, related to step 5d\nPerfuse the mouse and collect the transplanted heart (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]):\nPerfuse the mouse by injecting 3 mL cold saline into the abdominal aorta using a 30 G needle below the heart graft. The transplanted heart will become pale with correct perfusion.\nCut the aorta and soak up the perfusate with a cotton ball.\nResect the heart graft from the abdomen, place in DMEM and keep on ice.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Perfusion and resection of the transplanted heart, related to step 6\nCollect the native heart (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]):\nCut both lateral sides of the rib cage and the diaphragm.\nClamp the sternum with clamp forceps and invert to expose the chest cavity.\nIsolate and resect the heart from the chest cavity, place in DMEM and keep on ice.\nCritical: Ensure the entire liver is well perfused to limit collection of blood-borne cells that will contaminate the tissue-resident leukocyte populations of interest.\nNote: Other tissues such as blood (prior to euthanasia), spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow can also be harvested for analysis and should be collected into DMEM and placed on ice prior to processing.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S5. Resection of the native heart, related to step 7\nPreparation of single-cell suspension from liver tissue",
    "Timing: 1 h\nThis step describes the process of mechanical disruption and differential centrifugation of liver tissue to prepare a single-cell suspension of leukocytes for flow cytometry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). We have found that compared to enzymatic digestion, mechanical disruption has reduced impact on the expression of markers of interest, but does not allow for isolation of Kupffer cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1009-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of liver leukocyte isolation procedure\nRecord the weight of liver tissue to be used for flow cytometry if taking a section for histology.\nPlace the liver into a 70 μm cell strainer atop a 50 mL tube.\nMash the liver through the strainer with the rubber end of a 3 mL syringe plunger, rinsing with FACS buffer (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g with swinging buckets for 3 min at 21°C–23°C then carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL 42% isotonic Percoll and transfer to a 15 mL tube.

    "Incubate for 5 min at 21°C–23°C with occasional shaking.\nAdd 5 mL FACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min at 21°C–23°C to re-pellet the leukocytes. At this point the pellet should be pale and free of RBCs.\nResuspend the pellet in 400 μL of FACS buffer and count with 5–10 μL of the cell suspension (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPause point: Samples can be kept on ice for 1–2 h until ready to proceed to the next step.\nPreparation of single-cell suspension from heart tissue\nTiming: 1 h 40 min\nThis step describes the process of enzymatic digestion and differential centrifugation of heart tissue to prepare a single-cell suspension of leukocytes for flow cytometry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1009-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration of heart leukocyte enzymatic digestion and differential centrifugation isolation procedure\nRecord the weight of heart tissue to be used for flow cytometry if taking a section for histology.\nTransfer the heart to a 60 mm petri dish and rinse with PBS.\nDissect the heart in half lengthways, rinse again with PBS and transfer to a clean 60 mm petri dish.\nInject 500 μL of the heart digestion cocktail into the heart tissue. Disperse the cocktail evenly throughout the tissue by injecting at multiple points.\nDecant the remaining 4.5 mL of the digestion cocktail into the petri dish with the heart.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37°C with gentle shaking at 80 rpm.\nRemove the heart from the digestion cocktail (e.g., to the petri dish lid) and mince with a scalpel until pieces are approximately 0.5–1 mm3 in size.\nResuspend the minced heart tissue in the digestion cocktail and transfer to a 50 mL tube.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C with shaking at 150 rpm to prevent the tissue from settling.",
    "Pass through a 70 μm strainer, mashing any remaining clumps gently through with the rubber end of a 3 mL syringe plunger.\nRinse the cell strainer with 10 mL DMEM with 15% HI-NCS.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min at 21°C–23°C to pellet cells then carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL 42% isotonic Percoll, transfer to a new 15 mL tube, wash the tube with a further 4 mL 42% isotonic Percoll and combine in the new tube.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 20 min at 21°C–23°C with no brake to separate parenchymal cells (top layer) and leukocytes (pellet).\nCritical: Ensure brake is off during centrifugation.\nCarefully and completely remove and discard the top cellular layer and supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 μL RBC lysis buffer and transfer to new 15 mL tube containing 900 μL RBC lysis buffer (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nRinse the bottom of the tube with a further 100 μL RBC lysis buffer and combine in new tube.\nIncubate for 2 min at 21°C–23°C until RBCs are lysed.\nAdd 5 mL FACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min at 21°C–23°C to re-pellet the leukocytes. At this point the pellet should be pale and free of RBCs.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 μL of FACS buffer and count with 5–10 μL of the cell suspension (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nStimulation for functional analysis\nTiming: 4 h 15 min",
    "Here we describe the in vitro stimulation of isolated leukocytes for the analysis of cytokine and cytotoxic granule production by T cells (CD8αβ T, CD4 T, regulatory T (Treg), natural killer T (NKT), CD8αα T, and CD8-CD4- double-negative (DN) T cells) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Stimulation reveals the capacity of these cells to produce these cytokines and granules, while unstimulated controls show the existing activity of the cells. Both stimulated and unstimulated samples should contain the same number of cells per well and simultaneously be subjected to identical incubation times and conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1009-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

All remaining antibodies are for surface staining use. For exact antibodies, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nStaining for flow cytometry\nTiming: 2 h\nThis major step details the method of staining isolated leukocytes for identifying and characterizing lymphocyte populations (CD8αβ T, CD4 T, Treg, NKT, CD8αα T, and DN T cells). We have performed staining in 96 well U-bottom plates, however this can also be done in Eppendorf or FACS tubes.",
    "Transfer 0.1–4 × 106 cells per well for staining.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min at 21°C–23°C and discard supernatant.\nNote: This protocol uses Zombie UV for assessing the viability of cells prior to surface marker staining; therefore cells must be in a protein-free buffer such as PBS during this step.\nWash the cells by resuspending in 150 μL PBS then pellet the cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min at 21°C–23°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 40 μL Zombie UV solution diluted 1:1000 in PBS.\nIncubate for 20 min at 21°C–23°C in the dark.\nWash the cells with 150 μL FACS buffer.\nPause point: Samples can be kept on ice for 1–2 h until ready to proceed to the next step.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min at 21°C–23°C and discard supernatant.\nNote: CD69 and CD49a markers should be included for analysis of tissue-resident populations as the majority express a CD69+CD49a+ phenotype (Mackay et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Prosser et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). In the liver, CXCR6 is also a useful inclusion as many tissue-resident lymphocytes express this molecule (Prosser et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nResuspend the cells in 40 μL surface antibody cocktail as per Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] or 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1009_10.csv\nNote: Intracellular antibodies are: GATA3, T-bet, RORγt, FoxP3 and Eomes.

For detailed information for each of the recommended resources please refer to the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nCompensation Controls\nUltraComp eBeads compensation beads are recommended to achieve reliable and robust positive and negative populations for the fluorochromes listed in each suggested antibody panel.\nFlow cytometer setup and quality control",
    "BD Cytometer Setup and Tracking (CST) Beads consist of bright, mid and dim beads dyed with a mixture of fluorochromes. Using CST beads, the BD acquisition software measures changes in median fluorescence intensity and robust CV for each bead intensity in all fluorescence detectors and reports on changes from baseline. It is recommended to run CST each time the cytometer is switched on to confirm consistency of data being acquired.\nUltra Rainbow Calibration Particle (URCP) Kits\nSimilar to CST beads, URCP allow for rapid routine calibration and long-term performance tracking of flow cytometers. URCP produce standardized multiple peaks in each fluorescence detector, which can be easily tracked for changes in cytometer performance. It is recommended to run URCP at the start of each data acquisition experiment.\nFluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls\nFMO controls are recommended for gating accuracy and confirmation of fluorochrome spread. For each panel, it is recommended to prepare FMO control samples for each non-lineage phenotypic or functional marker."
