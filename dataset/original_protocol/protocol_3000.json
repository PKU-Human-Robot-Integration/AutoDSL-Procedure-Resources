    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCell Preparation for Transfection\nTiming: 5 min\nSplit sub-confluent EA.hy926 cells into 24-well plates (∼ 5 × 104 cells/well). Cells are left untreated for 8–10 h and cells reach ∼60%–70% confluence upon transfection.\nNote: Duplicates/triplicates are needed for western blot analyses and triplicates are needed for mRNA and ELISA assays.\nCritical: Ensure cell confluence is ∼60%–70% to achieve optimal transfection efficiency.\nISD90 or 2′,3′-cGAMP Transfection\nTiming: ∼20 min\nTransfection:\nPreparation of DNA complex for a single well in 24-well plates: mix desired amounts (starting from 2.5 μg for general purpose) of ISD90 or 2′,3′-cGAMP with P3000 in a 1:2 ratio in 65 μL OPTI-MEM medium (low serum and antibiotics free) using a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and vortex at medium speed. For example, for a transfection of 2.5 μg ISD90, 5 μL P3000 is added with ISD90 to 65 μL OPTI-MEM medium.\nPreparation of lipid complex: mix lipofectamine 3000 (in a 1:3 ratio for ISD90/2′,3′-cGAMP to lipofectamine 3000) with 65 μL OPTI-MEM medium and vortex at medium speed. For example, for a transfection of 2.5 μg ISD90, 5 μL lipofectamine 3000 is added to 65 μL OPTI-MEM medium.\nMix DNA and lipid complex and vortex at medium speed.\nLeave at room temperature (∼25°C) for 15 min.\nCarefully and slowly drop the mixture to cells. 5–6 h post transfection, cells are washed with sterile PBS and cultured in DMEM medium with 10% FBS and antibiotics (pen/strep) until cell collection.\nCritical: Optimal DNA/P3000/lipofectamine 3000 ratios are critical for transfections with high efficiency.\nCritical: Too much lipofectamine used in a transfection reaction may cause cell toxicity.\nCritical: Dripping transfection mixture into dishes should be slowly and evenly performed with minimal disturbance to the cell monolayer.\nCell Collection to Examine cGAS/STING Signaling by Western Blotting",
    "Timing: ∼2 days\nCell collection: At desired time periods post transfection, wash cells with 1× PBS and lyse cells by EBC buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) or Triton X-100 buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (diluted to 1× following manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.bimake.com/product/protease-inhibitor-cocktail-mini-tablet.html[href=https://www.bimake.com/product/protease-inhibitor-cocktail-mini-tablet.html] and https://www.bimake.com/product/phosphatase-inhibitor-cocktail.html[href=https://www.bimake.com/product/phosphatase-inhibitor-cocktail.html]). Incubate cells at 4°C for 10 min with gentle rotation. Spin down cell debris in an Eppendorf 5424R centrifuge at 4°C for 10 min at maximum speed (∼21,300 × g). Transfer supernatants to a new tube and save as whole cell lysates (WCL) with no visible cell debris.\nCritical: Inhibitors for proteases and phosphatases are important to preserve protein phosphorylation signals.\nProtein concentration determination: Add 1 μL of WCL into 1 mL of 1:5 diluted Bradford protein assay reagent and determine protein concentrations by Nanodrop OneC. Establish a standard curve using 1, 3, 6 and 9 μg/μL BSA.\nCritical: Careful and thorough mixture of WCL with diluted Bradford assay reagent is important to obtain reliable protein concentration measurements.\nSDS-PAGE: Add 1/3 volume of 3× SDS sample buffer into WCL and boil samples at 95°C for 10 min. Load same amounts of WCLs (usually ∼50 μg) on 10% SDS-PAGE gels in SDS-PAGE running buffer and run at 128 V constant voltage for 70 min, or until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.\nCritical: Samples should be spun down briefly after boiling to collect any evaporates on lids or tube walls, and should be vortexed before sample loading.",
    "Transfer of proteins onto PVDF membrane: Assemble transfer sandwiches by positioning the SDS-PAGE gel next to the PVDF membrane per manufacture instructions in the transfer buffer. Potential air bubbles should be removed by careful rolling with rollers purchased from Bio-Rad. Insert the transfer sandwiches into the western blot transfer device in SDS-PAGE transfer buffer and cooling pad at 128 V for 2 h.\nCritical: Rolling out air bubbles in the assembled transfer sandwiches is important to ensure a successful transfer.\nWestern blotting: Upon completion of transfer, block PVDF membranes with 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer for 30 min on a Labnet shaker at room temperature (∼25°C).\nDilute desired primary antibodies in 5% non-fat milk in a 1:1,000 dilution and incubate with PVDF membranes at 4°C for 8–10 h with gentle shaking.\nOn the next day, wash PVDF membranes thoroughly with 1× TBST buffer with shaking on a Labnet shaker at room temperature (∼25°C) for 10 min and repeat this four times.\nDilute HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies into 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer in a 1:3,300 dilution and incubate with PVDF membrane for 1 h at room temperature (∼25°C) with gentle shaking.\nWash PVDF membranes thoroughly with 1× TBST buffer for four times with 10 min/time with shaking on a shaker at room temperature (∼25°C).\nAfterwards, incubate PVDF membranes with ECL reagents for 5 min at room temperature (∼25°C) before imaging by QUANT imager.\nNote: The signal intensity for ECL-Pierce is the weakest and the signal intensity for ECL-Femto is the strongest. The choices of these ECL reagents can be determined by the expression level of the protein target or if this is unknown, start with the ECL-Pierce to avoid overexposure.",
    "Critical: Primary antibody dilution affects WB signal intensity. This should be determined by manufacturer instructions or amounts of samples loaded.\nCritical: These ECL reagents sustain reliable and stable signals for ∼20 min so ECL detection should be done within 20 min.\nRT-PCR Analyses to Examine IFNβ mRNA Changes\nTiming: ∼4–5 h\nExtract total RNA using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-mini-kit/#orderinginformation[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-mini-kit/#orderinginformation]). Dissolve/Elute extracted RNA in DNase-free and RNase-free DEPC water.\nDetermine RNA concentrations by a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop OneC, Thermo Scientific).\ncDNA synthesis from mRNA: Use iScriptTM Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR to reversely transcribe mRNA into cDNA following manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/product/iscript-reverse-transcription-supermix-for-rt-qpcr?ID=M87EVMKG4[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/product/iscript-reverse-transcription-supermix-for-rt-qpcr?ID=M87EVMKG4]). A total of 1 μg RNA is used as the template in this step.\nRT-PCR and data analyses: Mix iTaqTM universal SYBR Green Supermix (https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/product/itaq-universal-sybr-green-supermix?ID=M87FTF8UU[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/product/itaq-universal-sybr-green-supermix?ID=M87FTF8UU]) with cDNA template (with a final amount of 500 ng), forward and reverse primers (500 nM of each primer) together in a 20 μL reaction volume and perform the PCR reaction on the ViiATM6 Real-Time PCR system with the settings as below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_275_7.csv\nIFNβ mRNA levels are calculated by using the comparative Ct (Livak 2–ΔΔCt) method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The expression of IFNβ mRNAs is normalized to the expression of β-actin.\nCritical: Although much less cells are needed for RT-PCR analysis, increasing number of cells used for RNA extraction increases quality and quantity of RNA.\nELISA for Extracellular IFNβ Protein Measurement\nTiming: 24 h\nPreparation of plates:\nReconstitute Capture Antibody with 0.5 mL PBS to the working concentration, and dilute Capture Antibody reconstitution solution (480 μg/mL) with PBS without carrier protein to working solution concentration (4.00 μg/mL). Coat high binding 96-well plate with Capture Antibody working solution (100 μL/well), cover the plate and incubate at 4°C for 8–10 h.",
    "Aspirate wells and wash wells three times with Wash Buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, pH 7.2–7.4, 400 μL/well). After washing, invert and tap the plate on clean paper towels to remove remaining Wash Buffer.\nBlock the plate with blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.2–7.4, 300 μL/well) for 1 hour at room temperature (∼25°C).\nRepeat step 12b.\nCritical: Avoid freeze/thaw of reconstitute Capture Antibody\nEstablishment of the standard curve using recombinant IFN-β proteins provided in the ELISA kit:\nReconstitute standard with 0.5 mL Reagent Diluent (1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.2–7.4), and dilute standard reconstitution solution (55 ng/mL) with Reagent Diluent to working solution concentration (500 pg/mL). Perform a seven-point standard curve by using 2-fold serial dilutions from 500 pg/mL.\nIFNβ protein measurements:\nCollect culture media from samples and centrifuge in a table top centrifuge at top speed (∼21,300 × g) briefly to eliminate cell debris or dead cells.\nAdd 100 μL standard (two replicates each concentration) and centrifuge-cleared supernatant (1:1 mixed with Reagent Diluent) to designated wells. Seal the plate and incubate for 2 h at room temperature (∼25°C).\nRepeat step 12b in the preparation of plates.\nReconstitute Detection Antibody with 1 mL Reagent Diluent, and dilute Detection Antibody reconstitution solution (15 μg/mL) with Reagent Diluent to working solution concentration (250 ng/mL). Add Detection Antibody working solution to each well (100 μL/well), seal the plate and incubate the plate for 2 h at room temperature (∼25°C).\nRepeat step 12b in the preparation of plates.\nDilute Streptavidin-HRP with Reagent Diluent to a working solution concentration (a 40-fold dilution), and add 100 μL Streptavidin-HRP working solution to each well. Seal the plate and incubate the plate in the dark for 30 min at room temperature (∼25°C).\nRepeat step 12b in the preparation of plates.",
    "Add 100 μL substrate solution to each well, seal the plate and incubate the plate in the dark for 20 min at room temperature (∼25°C).\nAdd 50 μL of Stop Solution to each well.\nMeasure absorbance with a microplate reader (BioTek Cytation 5) at 450 nm after adding Stop Solution.\nCritical: Sample dilution may increase variances among measurements.\nDate Analyses\nGenerate the standard curve (y axis: protein concentration, x axis: absorbance) with a 4-parameter algorithm using Excel. Subtract background from the readings by using the blank samples and use the standard curve to calculate concentrations of samples.\nHSV-1 Infection and Streptavidin Nanoparticles Injection into Mice\nTiming: 24 h\nSix-week-old C57BL/6 WT and cGAS-/- female mice were used for this study.\nInject 100 μL of purified HSV-1 viruses (in PBS) with indicated pfu as described in (Zhang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) into indicated mice through tail vein injection.\nInject 100 μL of streptavidin nanoparticles into indicated mice through tail vein injection.\nTwenty-four hours post infection, euthanize mice using carbon dioxide for at least 4 min followed by cervical dislocation according to the approved IACUC protocol.\nCritical: Tail vein injection requires experience and training.\nCollection of Mouse Tissues for Analyses\nTiming: 15–20 min per mouse\nCollect blood by cardiac puncture as described (Parasuraman et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) right after mice are euthanized. Proper aseptic technique is recommended during the process. Store collected blood in clean sterile Eppendorf tubes.\nCritical: Blood collection should be performed immediately after euthanization.\nTo obtain the serum, centrifuge the tube with the collected blood for at least 15 min at 1,000 × g. Pipette the serum or plasma into a clean Eppendorf tube and attach the label. Avoid transferring red blood cells into the final tube.",
    "Note: The serum can be stored at −80°C (should be used as soon as possible) before it is subjected to ELISA to detect interferon and cytokines.\nHarvest spleen and brain tissues after euthanasia. Split the harvested tissues into three sections.\nNote: Tissue sections can be stored at −80°C (should be used as soon as possible) before being subjected to further analysis.\nThe first aliquot is subjected to RNA extraction using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kits following manufacturer's instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-mini-kit/#orderinginformation[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-mini-kit/#orderinginformation]) and qRT-PCR as described above to detect cellular gene expression at the RNA levels.\nThe second aliquot is subjected to DNA extraction using QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kits following manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/pcr/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit/[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/pcr/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit/]) and qPCR as described above to detect HSV-1 genome copy numbers.\nThe last aliquot is subjected to western blot analysis by extracting proteins using a plastic pestle to grind tissues in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube in lysis buffer (EBC buffer) used above and follow the exact steps as described in step 3 to detect cellular protein or HSV-1 viral protein expression levels."
