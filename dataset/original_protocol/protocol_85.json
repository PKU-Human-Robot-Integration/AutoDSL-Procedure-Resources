    "**General points to note:**\n- Chromatin material and enzymes are sensitive to both proteases and nucleases. Care should be taken to avoid introducing these contaminants. Precautionary procedures such as swabbing down lab benches with 70% ethanol are advised, as well as the use of nuclease-free water.\n- The use of DNA Lo-Bind tubes \\(Eppendorf) is recommended to reduce loss of sample.\n- A general note for all enzymatic reactions: because excessive glycerol from the enzyme stock may interfere with the reaction, ensure the volume of enzyme is <10% of the final reaction mixture. \nThe starting material is cells. The chromatin should be isolated from about 10<sup>6</sup> - 10<sup>7</sup> cells such that there will be sufficient chromatin material for library construction and the resulting library will be of high complexity. The cells may be treated with drugs as appropriate \\(Appendix I). The results shown came from a 4C library prepared from estrogen-treated MCF-7 cells. \n**A. Chromatin preparation**\nTiming: ~ 1-2 days\n1. To treated MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells growing in a 150 mm diameter plate in 20 ml of media \\(Appendix I), add 540 μl of fresh formaldehyde \\(37% stock) to obtain a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde for cross-linking. Rotate on a belly dancer for 10 min at 22°C.   \n  \n\\! CRITICAL STEP:  Fresh formaldehyde should be used. The amount and timing of formaldehyde cross-linking should be controlled and optimized, as too much formaldehyde cross-linking will make sonication difficult as well as increase the level of non-specific interactions, while too little formaldehyde would result in insufficient capture of chromatin interactions.\n2. Add 2 ml of 2.5 M filter-sterilized glycine to stop the cross-linking. Rotate on a belly dancer for 5 min at 22°C. Pour away the medium into a waste flask.",
    "3. Wash 2x with 10 ml of cold \\(4°C) 1x PBS with gentle shaking. Pour away the PBS into a waste flask.\n  \n4. Add 2 ml of 1x PBS and 2 ml of trypsin to each plate. Mix well and let the plates sit for 10 min at 22°C.\n  \n5. Add 4 ml of growth media to stop the trypsinization.\n  \n6. Use a blade scraper to scrape off the cells. Collect cells into a 15 ml falcon tube.\n  \n7. Wash the plates with 4 ml of 1x PBS and place these cells into the same 15 ml falcon tube.\n  \n8. Pellet cells at 3,000 rpm \\(800xg, Eppendorf) for 15 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\n  \n9. Wash the pellet with 5 ml of 1x PBS, then pellet cells at 3,000 rpm \\(800xg, Eppendorf) for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\n  \n10. Resuspend and wash each pellet with 5 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Incubate at 4°C with gentle agitation \\(Stuart Roller Mixer SRT9) for 30 minutes. \n  \n11. Spin at 3,000 rpm \\(800xg, Eppendorf) for 5 min at 4°C and pour away supernatant. \n  \n\\! PAUSE POINT: The pellet may be stored for several months at -80°C.\n12. Resuspend the pellet \\(nuclear lysate) with 600 μl SDS lysis buffer.\n  \n13. Sonicate the nuclear lysate for 8 min using the Bioruptor \\(Diagenode) operated in a 4°C cold room, 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off, at high power.\n  \n14. Pellet cell debris at 13,000 rpm \\(15700xg, Eppendorffor 10 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant \\(chromatin) into a fresh 1.7 ml tube. Store at -80°C.",
    "\\! CRITICAL STEP:  Ensure that the sonicator is balanced. Clean probes with 70% ethanol before and after sonication. Sonication of the chromatin should be done to a DNA size of approximately 500 bp with a range from 100-2000 bp, and be checked by reverse cross-linking an aliquot of 5 µl of nuclear lysate with 1 µl proteinase K \\(20 mg/ml) at 37°C for 1h and running on an 1% agarose gel to check the sizes of the DNA. Also, quantitate the reverse cross-linked DNA concentration with Picogreen Fluorimetry \\(Appendix II).\n\\! PAUSE POINT: The chromatin may be stored for several months at -80°C. \n**B. 4C library preparation**\nTiming: ~ 3-4 days\n1. To a 125 μl aliquot \\(corresponding to approximately 10<sup>6</sup> cells) of sonicated, cross-linked chromatin containing 0.1% SDS, add 6.5 µl of 20% Triton-X. \n  \n\\! CRITICAL STEP:  If taking aliquots out of -80˚C, thaw chromatin samples gently on ice, and let them stand at 37˚C for 1h to equilibrate. Clarify chromatin to remove any remaining cellular debris by spinning down chromatin in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 20 min at 4˚C, and keeping the supernatant. Chromatin samples must contain 0.1% SDS – if samples contain no SDS, add SDS, or if samples contain too much SDS, then dilute down the sample in Buffer EB, mix well, and let chromatin samples stand at 37˚C for 1h to equilibrate. The volume of the aliquot here is given for reference; the actual volume of the reference to be used should be calculated based on the DNA concentration. A maximum of 100 µg of DNA can be used. \n2. For each sample, prepare the following End-blunting reaction mix:\n  DNA 263 µl  \\(this comes from two 125 μl aliquots of chromatin)\n10x End-Repair Buffer 33 µl \n2.5mM dNTP Mix 15 µl",
    "10mM ATP 15 µl\nEnd-Repair Enzyme Mix 5 µl\nTotal volume: 330 µl\nIncubate at room temperature for 45 min. \n3. Set up the following ligation reaction:\n  DNA 330 µl\n10x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer \\(NEB) 5 ml \nT4 DNA Ligase \\(30u/µl, Fermentas) 166 µl\nWater \\(with 1x protease inhibitor) 44.5 ml\nTotal volume: 50 ml\n Incubate at 16˚C overnight \\(at least 16h).\n\\! CRITICAL STEP:  Dissolve protease inhibitor tablets in autoclaved water just before use. For proximity ligation, the concentration of the DNA should not be higher than 2 ng/µl).\n4. Perform reverse cross-linking by adding 375 µl of Proteinase K \\(20mg/ml, Invitrogen), mixing by inverting the tube several times and standing at 65°C overnight \\(at least 16h).\n  \n5. Split each ligation reaction into three 16.7 ml portions, and transfer each portion to a separate Maxtract High Density \\(50 ml) tube. Add an equal volume of phenol-chloroform and mix by inverting for about 2 min. Centrifuge at 1800 × g \\(3000 rpm), 5 min, room temperature \\(22-25°C). \n  \n\\! CRITICAL STEP: Pre-pellet the phase lock gel in the Maxtract tubes by centrifugation at 1800 × g \\(3000 rpm), 5 min, room temperature \\(22-25°C).\n6. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a 50-ml Nalgene PPCO tube.  Perform isopropanol precipitation by adding:\n  Sodium acetate \\(3 M, pH 5.2) 1.7 ml\nGlycoblue 6 µl\nIsopropanol 17 ml\nTotal volume: 17.7 ml\n \nIncubate at -80°C for at least 1 h. \n7. Pre-chill the Sorvall centrifuge to 4°C and pellet the DNA at 38730 × g \\(18000 rpm), 30 min, 4°C, using the SS-34 fixed rotor. \n  \n8. Carefully decant the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with 30 ml 75% ethanol. Allow the pellet to air dry in a laminar flow hood and re-suspend in 100 µl EB buffer.",
    "9. Quantitate the DNA concentration using Picogreen Fluorimetry \\(Appendix II).\n  \n\\! PAUSE POINT: DNA may be stored for several months at -20°C. We recommend aliquots be stored at -20°C in case the downstream procedures fail for some reason. In this protocol, we assume half was stored.\n10. Further purify the DNA by removing RNAs. \n  DNA 49.5 µl\nRNase A \\(Qiagen, diluted to 2 µg/µl in EB buffer) 1 µl \nEB buffer  49.5 µl\nTotal Volume: 100 µl\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min. \n11. Purify using phenol-chloroform extraction \\(Appendix III) followed by isopropanol precipitation \\(Appendix IV). Re-suspend each sample in 50 µl of EB buffer and quantitate using Picogreen \\(Appendix II).\n  \n12. Remove non-circular DNA by setting up the following reaction:\n  DNA 49 µl\n25 µM ATP 2 µl\n10 x reaction buffer \\(provided with the plasmid-safe DNase kit) 6 µl\nPlasmid-safe DNase 1 µl \nWater  2 µl\nTotal volume: 60 µl\nIncubate overnight at 37°C.\n13. Inactivate plasmid-safe DNase by incubating the samples at 70°C for 20 min. Purify using phenol-chloroform extraction \\(Appendix III) followed by isopropanol precipitation \\(Appendix IV). Resuspend in 100 µl of EB buffer and quantitate using Picogreen \\(Appendix II).\n  \n**C. 4C library amplification**\nTiming: ~ 2-3 days\n1. Amplify the samples by nested inverse PCR \\(All PCR primers and adapters are listed in Appendix VI). For the first round of inverse PCR, prepare the following reaction mix:\n  DNA 100 ng\nInverse primer 1 \\(25 µM) 1 µl\nInverse primer 2 \\(25 µM) 1 µl\n2 x Phusion Master Mix 25 µl \nWater To 50 µl\nTotal volume: 50 µl\nCycle conditions are:\n98 °C, 30 s\n98 °C, 10 s\n  70 °C, 30 s     20 cycles\n  72 °C, 45 s\n  72 °C, 10 min; hold at 4 °C",
    "2. To carry out nested PCR, prepare the following reaction mix:\n  Undiluted product from inverse PCR 1 µl\nNested, adaptor B-tailed primer 1 \\(biotinylated) \\(25 µM) 1 µl\nNested, adaptor A-tailed primer 2 \\(25 µM) 1 µl\n2 x Phusion Master Mix 25 µl \nNuclease-free H2O 22 µl\n 50 µl\n Cycle conditions are:\n                        98 °C, 30 s\n98 °C, 10 s\n  72 °C, 30 s         20 cycles\n  72 °C, 1 min\n72 °C, 10 min; hold at 4 °C \n\\! CRITICAL STEP: Because the PCR step selects sequences for analysis, it is critical that PCR cycle conditions be optimized for every 4C experiment. The use of 2-step PCR \\(the first few cycles is done with reference to the melting temperature of the primer without the adapter, and the next few cycles is done with reference to the melting temperature of the primer with the adapter as the proportion of PCR products containing flanking adaptor sequences increases) might be useful for certain primers. \n3. Run the PCR products in a 4-20% TBE PAGE gel at 200 V, 40 min in a Novex mini-cell. Stain with SYBR Green for 15 min in the dark and visualize on a DarkReader. We should observe a smear band across a range of approximately 200bp to >600bp. \n  \n4. Carry out additional nested PCR reactions using the products obtained from the first round of inverse PCR. At least four 50 µl reactions are recommended.\n  \n5. Run the PCR products in a 6% TBE PAGE gel for 30 min at 200V in a Novex mini-cell, together with 500 ng 25bp DNA ladder. Stain with SYBR Green for 15 min in the dark and visualize on a DarkReader.",
    "\\! CRITICAL STEP: We have observed that certain DNA ladders that work well on agarose gel do not work on PAGE gels. We have tested Invitrogen’s 25 bp DNA ladder and Low Mass ladder and found these to work well on PAGE gels.\n6. Excise the smear band in the region of 400bp to >600bp, using a sharp scalpel and gel-handler sheets to protect the DarkReader. Take a photo of the gel before and after excision. Purify by the gel-crush protocol \\(Appendix V). Resuspend the pellet in 40 µl TE buffer. \n  \n7. Quantitate DNA concentration using Picogreen \\(Appendix II). Perform a quality control check using an Agilent DNA 7500 LabChip according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. \n  \n8. Prepare and sequence the sample with Roche 454 Titanium sequencing according to the manufacturer’s guidelines."
