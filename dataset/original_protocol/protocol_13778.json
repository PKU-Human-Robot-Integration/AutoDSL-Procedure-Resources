    "The experiments were conducted at the Department of Experimental Medicine, Charité - University Medicine, Berlin, Germany (certiﬁed according to the EN DIN ISO 9001:2000) and were approved by the federal authorities for animal research in Berlin, Germany, prior to the experiments (G0229/18). The principles of laboratory animal care were used in all experiments and are in accordance with the guidelines of the European and German Society of Laboratory Animal Sciences.\n1. Laboratory animals and animal welfare\nConduct all the experiments in deeply anesthetized male pigs (German Landrace × Large White) of 3-4 months of age with a body weight (bw) of 30-40 kg.\n2. Anesthesia, intubation, and mechanical ventilation\nDo not provide dry food for 12 h prior to anesthesia to avoid a full stomach of the pigs. Allow free access to water and straw/hay to minimize stress.\nPremedicate with an intramuscular injection of a combination of azaperone (3 mg/kg bw), atropine (0.03 mg/kg bw), ketamine (25 mg/kg bw), and xylazine (3.5 mg/kg bw) into the neck musculature of the pig, while the animals are still kept in their housing facility to minimize stress.\n\t​NOTE: Daily training of petting the animal's neck while feeding a few sugar cubes prior to the experiment and applying the injection while feeding sugar cubes in the trained fashion will facilitate a smooth premedication and reduce stress further.\n\t\nPlace the animal onto a stretcher and cover the eyes with a cloth for transportation once an adequate level of anesthesia is reached.\nTransfer the pig to the surgical theater and always ensure sufficient spontaneous breathing.\nTake an oxygen cylinder, fitting tubing, and mask to provide supplemental oxygen while transporting the pigs, if the housing facilities are not adjacent to the laboratory.",
    "Place the pig in the prone position and preoxygenate with a mask that fits the animal's snout using a high flow of oxygen (e.g., 10 L/min).\nUse a peripheral vein catheter (usually 18 or 20 G) to gain venous access. Place the peripheral vein catheter into one of the ear veins after a wipe-down procedure with alcohol swaps.\n\t\nStart an infusion with a balanced crystalloid solution and ensure the correct placement of the catheter for subsequent infusion of anesthetics.\nInfuse 500 mL of a balanced crystalloid solution as bolus i.v. followed by continuous infusion of 4 mL/kg/h for fluid support.\nStart monitoring the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) by securing the SpO2-Sensor at one of the ears or the tail.\nInduce anesthesia by injecting propofol (about 5-10 mg/kg - the exact dose depends on the effect of the premedication and differs from animal to animal) for orotracheal intubation.\n\t​NOTE: Prior injection of an opioid will facilitate intubation further but requires ample experience to avoid a premature apnea of the animal. An injection of 100 µg of fentanyl (fentanyl citrate, 100 µg/mL) may be repeated until the spontaneous respiratory rate slows down to about 20/min before injecting propofol.\nIntubate the animal with a cuffed endotracheal tube (7.5 - 8.0 mm ID) and a laryngoscope designed for large animals (straight blade of about 25 cm length).\n\tNOTE: Intubation is easiest in the prone position as described in detail by Theisen et al.8.\n\t\nVerify the placement of the endotracheal tube by observing the typical waveform of CO2 during expiration on the CO2-monitor (capnograph).\nUse auscultation to check for equal bilateral breath sounds.\n\t\tNOTE: The pigs can be mechanically ventilated with manual compression of the rib cage from both sides while supplying oxygen with a high flow in case of failed or delayed intubation.",
    "Set the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) to 1.0, respirator frequency to 15-20/min, tidal volume to 8-9 mL/kg bw, inspiration to expiration ratio (I:E) to 1:1.5, and apply a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O to start mechanical ventilation. Adjust the settings to target an end-expiratory partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PetCO2) of 35-40 mmHg and a SpO2 above 95%.\n\t\nUse a continuous i.v. infusion of thiopentone (20 mg/kg/h) and fentanyl (7 µg/kg/h) to maintain anesthesia.\n\t\t​NOTE: The necessary dosage may vary from animal to animal and between experimental settings. It is essential to maintain a sufficient depth of anesthesia during the course of the experiment for animal welfare and scientific reasons.\nMonitor the animal closely for stress/pain reactions (such as an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, or respiratory rate) during instrumentation.\n\t\t​NOTE: Instrumentation should be possible without administering a muscle relaxant if the depth of anesthesia is sufficient.\nAdminister a muscle relaxant, e.g., pancuronium bromide (0.15 mg/kg bw i.v. bolus, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 mg/kg bw/h or repeated bolus injections), if muscle relaxation is necessary for the experiment (e.g., before a surfactant depletion, before injurious ventilaion lung compliance measurements).\nInstrumentation techniques\n\t\nTurn the animal into the supine position.\nSecure the endotracheal tube and i.v. line while turning the animal.\nRetract the legs using bandages to stretch the skin above the planned incision sites.\nSterilize the operating areas with an appropriate skin disinfectant such as an alcohol and iodine 1% solution.\nCannulate the external jugular vein with a central venous catheter and, in addition, introduce the introducer sheath of the pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC) into the same vein.\n\t\nPerform a 10 cm skin incision on the line connecting the mandible and the sternum (left or right side possible).",
    "Always reassess the depth of anesthesia and adjust the dosage, if necessary.\nSeparate the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma with tissue forceps and surgical scissors until the brachiocephalic and the sternocephalic muscles are visible.\nContinue with a blunt cut down procedure to separate the fascia between the muscles until the external jugular vein is visible.\nUse the Seldinger technique9 to cannulate the external jugular vein with the central venous catheter and the introducer sheath for later insertion of the PAC.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not dilate the vein with a dilator as it is done in case of a percutaneous approach. This would tear the vein. Close with standard sutures. The sizes of the sheath depend on the size of the chosen PAC. A 6F introducer sheath (10 cm length) and a 5F PAC of 75 cm length in pigs of 30-40 kg body weight are typically used.\nCannulate the femoral artery for invasive blood pressure monitoring.\n\t\nIdentify the fold between the gracilis and sartorius muscle of the hind leg (left or right is possible) to place an arterial line.\n\t\tNOTE: The pulsation of the femoral artery should be easily palpable.\nCannulate the artery percutaneously with the Seldinger technique9.\nUse a direct approach if the artery is not easily palpated.\n\t\t\nCut through the skin with a 5 cm long incision and separate the subcutaneous tissue with tissue forceps and surgical scissors.\nUse a blunt cut down procedure separating the fascia between the muscles to the level of the femoral artery.\n\t\t\t​NOTE :Do not injure the saphenous vessels by performing the cut down procedure cranial of them.",
    "Loop a ligature around the femoral artery so that the vessel can be closed in case of bleeding at the site of puncture. Avoid this step whenever possible, as it compromises blood flow to the hind leg.\nCannulate the artery with the Seldinger technique9.\nCalibrate the transducers against the atmosphere (zero) and either 200 mmHg (arterial line) or 50 mmHg (central venous line) and connect them to the arterial catheter and the central venous line to start monitoring.\n\t\nPlace the pressure transducers about half the height of the thorax at the estimated position of the right atrium.\nPerform a small (4-5 cm) incision cutting through the skin above the bladder for catherization of the urinary bladder.\n\t\nSeparate the subcutaneous tissue using blunt instruments.\nPlace a purse-string suture (1-2 cm in diameter) in the wall of the bladder.\n\t\tNOTE: The sutures should not penetrate through all layers of the bladder wall, which would result in the loss of urine through the punctures.\nPerform a small incision in the middle of the suture and introduce the urinary catheter.\nImmediately, block the balloon with 10 mL of distilled water and pull the catheter toward the bladder wall until a light resistance is felt.\nClose the purse-string suture around the catheter. Close the skin using standard sutures.\n3. Introduction of the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)\nCheck the patency of the balloon of the PAC with 0.5-1 mL of air depending on the size of the catheter and deflate the balloon again.\nConnect the PAC to the pressure transducer system and calibrate the transducer against the atmosphere (zero) and 100 mmHg.\nIntroduce the PAC through the introducer sheath with a deflated balloon for 10-15 cm (depending on the sheath length).",
    "Inflate the balloon after it has left the sheath and advance the PAC further while monitoring the pressure and the typical wave forms on the pressure monitor.\nPush the PAC forward while the waveforms typical of the right atrium, right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery appear and stop advancing the PAC when the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) waveform is seen.\nRecord the PCWP at end-expiration and deflate the balloon (see Figure 1 for the respective curves).\n\t\tNOTE: After deflation of the balloon, the PCWP-waveform must disappear, and the pulmonary arterial pressure waveform must be visible. If the pulmonary arterial pressure waveform cannot be seen, the catheter is most likely inserted too far into a pulmonary artery and has reached an auto-wedge position. This results in a permanent occlusion of a pulmonary vessel and must be corrected by pulling the catheter back until the pulmonary arterial pressure waveform reappears thereby avoiding complications, e.g., rupture of the pulmonary vessel10. The PAC catheters are often accidentally advanced into liver veins via the inferior caval vein in pigs. Thus, if the right ventricle pressure signal is not reached after about 30 - 50 cm, pull the catheter back and start all over again.\n4. Pulmonary artery thermodilution technique for hemodynamic measurements\nMeasure cardiac output (CO) with the thermodilution technique11.\n\t\nConnect the thermistor and a flow through housing to the respective lumen of the PAC.\nNext, connect the hemodynamic monitor with the distal temperature port of the PAC (red cap).\nAdjust the hemodynamic monitor to the necessary mode compensating for catheter size, catheter length, injected volume, and temperature of the injected saline solution.\nInject the appropriate volume of 0.9% saline as quickly as possible (usually 5 or 10 mL of 0.9% saline with a temperature of 4 °C).\nWait until the measurement is completed.",
    "Randomize five measurements in quick succession over the respiratory cycle of the ventilator.\n\t\nDelete the highest and the lowest values and use the remaining three values to calculate the mean.\nNote this mean value as the cardiac output.\nMeasure the PCWP afterwards by inflating the catheter balloon, and deflate it after the measurement.\nUse the mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), central venous pressure (CVP), PCWP, and the CO for all further hemodynamic calculations.\n\t\t​NOTE: The volume of saline as well as the temperature have to be entered into the monitor before the measurements. The normal saline has to be kept at the same temperature (usually <5 °C) for correct measurements. The size and length of the catheter have to be entered as well. Some monitors require the entry of a correction factor.\nFor studies involving exact measurements of electrolyte balance, use 5% glucose solution instead of 0.9% saline.\nEnsure to record all the parameters. Take simultaneous arterial and mixed venous blood samples shortly before or after CO measurements to enable calculation of the intra-pulmonary right-to-left shunt.\n\t\nRecord all needed respiratory settings and measurements to complete the data set, e.g. peak, plateau and end-expiratory pressure.\n\t\t​NOTE: The induction of anesthesia, intubation, and full instrumentation may require 1.5 h depending on the experience and number of the investigators.\n5. Surfactant depletion\nVentilate the animal with a FIO2 of 1.0.\n\t\nDisconnect the animal from the ventilator.\nFill the lungs with prewarmed 0.9% saline (37 °C, 35 mL/kg) with a funnel connected to the endotracheal tube.\n\t\nFor this, raise the funnel about 1 m above the animal.\n\t\t​NOTE: The hydrostatic pressure will allocate the saline into all pulmonary sections.\nImmediately stop filling when the MAP decreases below <50 mmHg.",
    "Lower the funnel to ground level to drain the lavage fluid. Reconnect the animal to the ventilator for oxygenation.\nWait until the animal recuperates and repeat the lavage a soon as possible, if required.\n\t​NOTE: The necessity for a further lavage is defined by the PaO2/FIO2 ratio.\n\t\nTake an arterial blood gas sample after 5 min following each lavage.\nRepeat lavages until the PaO2/FIO2 ratio (Horowitz index) decreases below 100 mmHg for at least 5 min at FIO2 1.0 and PEEP > 5 cmH2O.\n\t\tNOTE: The respiratory rate must be adjusted during the period of lavages to keep the arterial pH above 7.25 in order to prevent hemodynamic decompensation.\nBe aware that this animal model is based on a combination of surfactant depletion and VILI.\n\tNOTE: The lavages will be stopped after the PaO2/FIO2 ratio remains below 100 for 5 min NOT after 60 min as published previously for a model of surfactant washout without VILI5.\n\t\nCommence with high Tv/low PEEP ventilation after the targeted PaO2/FIO2 has been reached.\n\t\t​NOTE: Otherwise, an overly aggressive surfactant depletion combined with VILI will result in multiple organ failure and compromise the experiment. The duration of surfactant depletion varies between animals, since a defined PaO2/FIO2 is targeted. It may take 45 min to 1.5 h.\n6. Injurious ventilation with high tidal volume/low PEEP (high Tv/low PEEP)\nKeep an FIO2 of 1.0.\nSet the ventilator on a volume guaranteed, pressure-controlled ventilation mode.\nIncrease the alarm threshold for peak inspiratory pressure to 60 mbar.\n\tNOTE: The ventilator should apply an inspiratory pressure up to 60 mbar, but not higher.\nLower the respiratory rate to 12/min and set the inspiration to expiration (I:E) ratio to 1:1.5 (resulting in an inspiration time of 2 s and expiration time of 3 s).",
    "Increase the tidal volume slowly up to 17 mL/kg bw over at least 2 min.\n\t\nDo not increase the tidal volume further if an inspiratory pressure of 60 mbar is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: The limited inspiratory pressure can result in tidal volume below 17 mL/kg body weight depending on the lung injury after surfactant washout. A sudden increase in tidal volume may result in barotrauma or hemodynamic decompensation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to increase tidal volumes slowly over several minutes.\nReduce the PEEP to 2 mbar.\nVentilate the animal for up to 2 h (see Figure 2 for the ventilator settings and the flow curve).\n\tNOTE: Ventilation with high tidal volumes will result in good oxygenation of the animal, but the cyclic near-complete inflation and deflation results in structural injury of the lungs. Structural damage cannot be reversed with recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, high PEEP, etc. The resulting injury has to be tolerated throughout the investigation. A shorter high Tv/low PEEP ventilation time may be required depending on the following experiment and duration of the investigation.\n7. End of experiment and euthanasia\nEnsure that all measurements of the experimental protocol, which will follow the induction of lung injury, are performed.\nInject fentanyl (at least 0.5 mg) additionally to the continuous anesthesia and wait at least 5 minutes. Inject thiopental (at least 1000 mg) quickly followed by at least 60 mmol of potassium using the central line.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
