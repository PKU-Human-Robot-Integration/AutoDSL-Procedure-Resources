    "The protocol follows the guidelines of Baylor College of Medicine human ethics committee. All experimental procedures performed on mice are approved by Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. sgRNA Fwd Design\nNavigate to http://www.crisprscan.org/?page=track8 to begin designing sgRNAs of interest.\nClick on the \"Mouse\" or \"Human\" button depending on the cell type of interest.\nEnter the gene of interest into the UCSC search box and press go.\nZoom in and move to the region of the gene (i.e. a specific exon) that is of interest to target.\nNote: To achieve efficient gene disruption it is recommended targeting the earliest exon(s) present in all transcribed isoforms in your specific cell type.\nEnsure that the potential sgRNA target sequences are listed under a \"CRISPRscan predictions on genes (CDS)\" heading.\nFind and click on a target sequence with a relatively high score and few off-targets (highlighted in bright green). Copy the full sequence displayed under the \"Oligo sequence\" section and paste it into a text document. Add \"ATAGC\" to the 3' end of the sequence. Once completed, place the order for the full-length sequence.\nNote: For each target sequence, CRISPRscan8 provides an \"integrated\" forward sgRNA primer that includes the T7 promoter, the protospacer (target) sequence, and the universal scaffold overlap sequence (see Figure 1A). A full-length sequence is made of either 56 or 57 nucleotides depending on the length of protospacer.\n2. sgRNA DNA Template Synthesis\nDissolve and dilute the sgRNA Fwd and universal Rev primer (see Table 1 for the complete sequence). In order to obtain a 10 µM final concentration, follow the manufacturer instruction on how to dilute primers to 100 µM, then make a 1:10 dilution with nuclease-free water.",
    "To perform overlapping PCR (see Figure 1B), mix the following in PCR strip tubes: 2 µL Forward sgRNA primer (10 µM), 2 µL Universal Rev scaffold primer (HPLC purified) (10 µM), 10 µL High fidelity DNA polymerase master mix (2x) and 6 µL nuclease-free water.\nRun the PCR with the following program: 95 °C for 3 min,98 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 5 s, 72 °C for 10 s, Go to 2 for 6 cycles, 72 °C for 1 min, 4 °C forever.\nPurify the PCR product using DNA purification columns (See Table of Materials). Follow manufacturer instructions and elute with 11.5 µL of elution buffer.\nMeasure the concentration of the PCR products on a spectrophotometer. Blank the instrument with elution buffer.\nNote: The DNA concentration should be between ~50 and ~120 ng/µL.\n3. In Vitro Transcription of sgRNA\nMix the following components in PCR strip tubes (reagents are provided in the RNA synthesis kit): 4 µL of eluted DNA, 4 µL of dNTPs, 1 µL of 10x Reaction Buffer, and 1 µL of T7 RNA polymerase enzyme mix.\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C for at least 4 h.\nApply the RNase cleaning agent to remove RNase from gloved hands.\nBring each RNA sample up to a total volume of 50 µL with nuclease-free water (first step of RNA purification following manufacturer instructions).\nProceed with RNA purification following manufacturer instructions and elute in 50 µL of kit-provided nuclease-free water.\nMeasure the concentration of the eluted sgRNA on a spectrophotometer. Blank the instrument with nuclease-free water.\nNote: The expected yield after purification is 50 - 80 µg of RNA (i.e. concentration of 1.0 - 1.5 µg/µL).\nUse the purified sgRNA immediately or store in aliquots of 2 - 4 µL at -80 °C for the long-term.",
    "4. HSPC Isolation and Culture\nMurine HSPCs isolation and culture\nNote: Male and female Ubc-GFP mice (JAX004353) and Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato (JAX007914) crossed with Vav-iCre (JAX008610) at 2 - 6 months of age were used to obtain the results shown below.\n\t\nEuthanize anesthetized mice through cervical dislocation.\nNote: Two trained persons should independently verify successful euthanasia by noting a lack of respiration and heartbeat for at least 5 min. Remove the skin from the animals.\nDissect tibias, femurs, and iliac crests of mice and remove all muscle and connective tissue around the dissected bones. Place intact bones into a tissue culture dish on ice with HBSS supplemented with 2% FBS (HBSS+). Move to a laminar flow hood as soon as al the bones have been cleaned and transferred to the tissue culture dish.\nTransfer cleaned bones to sterile mortar, containing 2 mL ice-cold HBSS+ per 3 bones. Using the pestle, crush bones into bone fragments, releasing marrow from within. Continue pestling until bones stop cracking under the pestle.\nCollect supernatant from the mortar and filter into a 50-mL conical tube using a 40 µm cell strainer. Rinse the remaining bone fragments with 5 mL ice-cold HBSS+ and filter into the same 50 mL conical tube using the same 40 µm strainer.\nWash the cells twice by topping off the tube with ice-cold HBSS+ and centrifuging at 400 x g for 7 min. Discard the supernatant.\nFollowing the second wash resuspend the cell pellet in 20 mL of ice cold PBS. Count viable cells by trypan-blue exclusion9.\nIncubate 1 x 108 viable cells per 1 mL ice-cold HBSS+ with biotin-conjugated c-kit antibody at 1:100 dilution for 45 min on ice.\nWash the cells with ice-cold HBSS+ by centrifuging at 400 x g for 7 min and discarding the supernatant.",
    "Incubate the cells with anti-biotin magnetic beads following manufacturer instructions.\nIsolate c-kit positive cells using magnetic columns or magnetic-activated cell sorters following manufacturer instructions. Collect c-kit positive cells in 15 mL conical tubes.\nWash the cells twice with PBS by topping off the 15-mL conical tube and centrifuging at 400 x g for 7 min. Discard the supernatant. Between the two washes calculate the total number of viable cells by trypan blue exclusion9.\nResuspend c-kit+ cells at a concentration of up to 106 viablecells per 100 µL of culture medium for murine HSPCs supplemented with 2% FBS, 50 ng/mL mouse stem cell factor (SCF), 50 ng/mL mouse thrombopoietin (TPO), 10 ng/mL mouse IL-3, and 10 ng/mL mouse IL-6.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for at least 1 h to a maximum of 24 h prior to the electroporation.\nHuman HSPCs isolation and culture\nNote: These steps must be performed in a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nFilter bone marrow/cord blood cells through a 40 µm cell strainer.\nDilute 1:2 the filtered bone marrow/cord blood cells with PBS supplemented with 1 mM EDTA (PBS/EDTA).\nDispense 15 mL of density gradient medium into a 50-mL conical tube. Gently pour 30 mL of the diluted bone marrow/cord blood on the density gradient medium surface. If the volume of cell suspension is greater than 30 mL prepare multiple tubes.\nNote: Make sure to keep the interface between the blood and the density gradient medium as sharp as possible.\nSpin the tubes at 750 x g for 30 min with no deceleration.\nCollect the mononuclear cell layer detectable at medium's interface and transfer to a clean 50 mL conical tube. Fill up the tube with PBS/EDTA and spin the cells at 280 g for 15 min. Discard the supernatant.",
    "Wash the cells twice in PBS/EDTA spinning at 400 x g for 7 min and discarding the supernatant.\nIncubate the mononuclear cells with anti-CD34 magnetic beads following manufacturer instructions.\nIsolate CD34+ cells using magnetic columns or magnetic-activated cell sorters following manufacturer instructions. Collect CD34+ cells in 15 mL conical tubes.\nWash collected CD34+ cells twice by topping off the tube with PBS and spinning at 400 x g for 7 min and discarding the supernatant. Between the two washes calculate the total number of viable cells by trypan blue exclusion9.\nResuspend the cells in culture medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL human SCF, 100 ng/mL human FLT3 ligand (FLT3L), 100 ng/mL human TPO at a concentration of ~2.5 x 105 viable cells/ml. Culture isolated CD34+ cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h to a maximum 48 h prior to electroporation.\nNote: Prior to electroporation check purity of enriched CD34+ population by flow cytometry.\n5. Electroporation\nNote: The following protocol is optimized for 10 µL electroporation tips. All steps should be performed in a laminar flow hood.\nCount cells by trypan blue exclusion9. Collect 2 x 105 viable cells per replicate (e.g. collect 6 x 105 cells for 3 electroporations).\nWash cells twice with PBS, spinning at 300 x g for 7 min and carefully remove the supernatant.\nIn parallel, prepare Cas9-sgRNA RNP complexes by incubating in PCR tubes for 20 - 30 min at RT 1.5 µg Cas9 with 1 µg of total sgRNA for each replicate, except the Cas9 only control.",
    "Note: Cas9 protein is provided at 10 µg/µl concentration. To ensure accurate pipetting, dilute 1:10 the total amount of Cas9 protein needed with nuclease-free water (e.g for 10 electroporations take 1 µl of Cas9 protein and dilute it with 9 µl of nuclease-free water and incubate 1 µl of diluted Cas9 per replicate. Depending on the concentration of the sgRNA, the total volume of Cas9 and sgRNA should be comprised between 1.7 and 2 µl per replicate. If using two sgRNAs incubate 500 ng of each sgRNA per replicate; if using 3 sgRNAs incubate 330 ng of each sgRNA per replicate, and so on.\nCalculate the total volume of resuspension Buffer T needed by multiplying 10 µL by the number of total replicates needed (e.g. 30 µL for 3 replicates). Resuspend pelleted cells with the calculated volume of Buffer T. Ensure that the final concentration of the cell suspension is 2 x 107 cells/mL.\nAliquot 10 µL of resuspended cells/replicate into each PCR tube containing the pre-complexed sgRNA/Cas9 RNP (e.g. for a triplicate aliquot 30 μL of cell suspension into a PCR tube containing pre-complexed Cas9-sgRNA).\nTo set up the electroporation system turn on the instrument and add 3 mL of buffer E into an electroporation cuvette, and slide the cuvette into the cuvette holder.\nSet the desired electroporation conditions on device: human HSPCs (1600 V, 10 ms, 3 pulses) or mouse HSPCs (1700 V, 20 ms, 1 pulse).\nNote: If desired, before performing experiments on CD34+ HSPCs, sgRNA efficiency can be tested on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines (e.g. HL60) using the same strategy (use antibiotic-free medium for AML cell lines) with the following electroporation conditions: Buffer R, 1350 V, 35 ms, 1 pulse.",
    "The electroporation is performed with a special electroporation pipette, which has a claw that latches onto the electroporation pipette tip. Hold the electroporation pipette, extend the claw, grab the disc inside the pipette tip, and then firmly press the pipette down to secure the tip.\nPipette the sample up and down 10 times to mix. Take out 10 µL, making sure there are no bubbles, and insert the pipette tip directly into the electrolytic buffer in the electroporation cuvette. Try not to touch the walls of the cuvette. Press \"start\" on the screen. After the \"complete\" message appears, remove the pipette, and dispense contents into well with new HSPC culture medium.\nRepeat for all samples. Change pipette tips between samples, only if necessary."
