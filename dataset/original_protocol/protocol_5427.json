    "Fill sterile NGM agar plates with a 35 mm diameter with 1 ml of M9 buffer. Before the start of this assay, put a worm on a sterile NGM agar plate without bacteria and allow it to crawl freely to remove the agglomerated bacteria from the worm. After examining whether the bacteria were removed by visually, put a worm (4-day-old) into the buffer and allow it to swim freely for 1 min to be accustomed to the environment.Â  Then count the number of thrash for 1 min (Nawa et al., 2012). Count at least 10 worms for each assay.Note: A movement of the worm that swings its head and/or tail to the same side is counted as one thrash. A movie of body-bending worms makes counting more correct and easy. The bacteria that are served as food for worms should be removed as completely as possible because they affect the worm's movement."
