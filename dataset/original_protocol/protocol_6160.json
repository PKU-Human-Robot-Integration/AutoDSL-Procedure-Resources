    "Extraction of bulk DNA: extract DNA from the sample of interest. The sample can be a bulk of tissue or cell lines. No special kit is required for bulk analysis, for instance, we routinely use either the DNeasy kit from Qiagen or a phenol/chlorophorm extraction followed by ethanol precipitation (Zambelli et al., 2018). For single cells, we manually collect them with the aid of a stereomicroscope under a horizontal flow in 2.5 μl of alkaline lysis buffer (200 mM NaOH and 50 mM DTT) in 200 μl Eppendorf tubes (Spits et al., 2006) and store them at -20 °C. Before amplification, the single cells are incubated for 10 min at 65 °C for lysis, then prepared for amplification as under Step 3. Dilute the DNA sample to a working solution of 10 ng/μl (only for bulk DNA).Prepare the master mix as following:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702050521_4123.jpg*Tricine is used in the PCR reaction to buffer the alkaline lysis buffer used in the single cell collection.Aliquot 45 μl of the master mix to PCR tubes and add 5 μl of 10 ng/μl DNA for bulk.Note: For single cells, add 47.5 μl of the master mix to the Eppendorf tubes with the cells collected in the alkaline lysis buffer. Use the following PCR program:step 1 (Initiation): 30 s at 94 °Cstep 2 (8 cycles): 15 s at 94 °C30 s at 64 °C minus 0.",
    "4 °C per cycle (this is the touchdown step)11 min at 65 °C (for primer set 1) or 5 min at 65 °C (for primer set 2)step 3 (22 cycles for bulk; 27 cycles for large single cells (human oocytes), 37 cycles for other single cells): 15 s at 94 °C 30 s at 61 °C 11 min at 65 °C (for primer set 1) or 5 min at 65 °C (for primer set 2)step 4 (Final): 11 min at 65 °C (for primer set 1) or 5 min at 65 °C (for primer set 2)step 5: cooling step at 4 °C until storage.Keep the amplicons stored at 4 °C (for short-term storage) or -20 °C (long-term storage) until further processing.Confirm successful amplification by running a gel-electrophoresis (1% for bulk, 1.5% for single cells) (see Recipes).Load 9 μl per sample on the gel and run the gel at 80 V for 1 h. Successful amplification should be as shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702050756_2132.jpgFigure 1. Successful amplification of the two primer sets compared to a DNA ladder shown by gel-electrophoresisClean up the samples with AMPure beads as follows.Note: This is usually done in batches of 96 samples in a 96-well plate. Add 54 μl of AMPure beads to 30 μl of each amplicon (the ratio is 1.8x).Mix the samples by pipetting up and down and incubate the samples for 5 min at room temperature.Place the samples on the magnet for 5 min or until the solution is clear.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Add 200 μl ethanol (80%).Incubate the samples for 30 s on the magnet.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Repeat Steps 9e-9g.Let the beads dry for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the samples from the magnet.Add 30 μl of Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 8.",
    "0) and incubate the samples for 2 min at room temperature.Place the samples on the magnet until the solution is clear.Transfer the supernatant into a new 96-well plate.Quantify the DNA concentration of the samples using the Qubit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Pool the amplicons of primer sets 1 and 2 together per sample, and to maintain a uniform coverage, the amplicons need to be mixed in a 0.35/0.65 ratio (35% of the shorter amplicon generated by primer set 2 and 65% of the longer amplicon generated by primer set 1). Use a total of 500 ng DNA in 17.5 μl Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 8.0). Note: The procedure is also possible for each amplicon separately, again with a total of 500 ng. Prepare the library with the KAPA HyperPlus Kit using half of the reagent volumes as specified by the supplier. This is the protocol in summary:Prepare the fragmentation mix (on ice):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702060323_2878.jpgVortex the fragmentation mix and spin down.Add 7.5 μl of the fragmentation mix to 17.5 μl of the purified DNA sample and mix by pipetting (work on ice).Incubate the samples in a thermocycler (lid heated at 50 °C).10 min at 4 °C15 min at 37 °CKeep the samples at 4 °CProceed immediately to the End Repair and A-tailing.Prepare the End Repair and A-tailing mix as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702060437_6712.jpgMix the End Repair and A-tailing mix by vortexing and spin down.Add 5 μl of the End Repair and A-tailing mix to the fragmented DNA.Incubate the samples in the thermocycler (put the lid on 85 °C).30 min at 65 °CKeep the samples at 4 °C.Proceed immediately to the Ligation step.Prepare the Ligation mix as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702060518_1809.jpgMix the Ligation mix by pipetting up and down.Add 20 μl of the Ligation mix to 30 μl of the End Repaired and A-tailed DNA.",
    "Add a unique adapter per sample: 5 μl of 7.5 μM Illumina TruSeq Unique Dual (UD) indexed adapter.Note: These adapters may be custom produced by an oligo supplier (e.g., Integrated DNA Technologies) or may be purchased as a kit (e.g., IDT for Illumina–TruSeq DNA UD Indexes). Be aware that most suppliers deliver ready-made adapters at 15 μM while in this protocol we use 7.5 μM. Mix thoroughly by pipetting.Incubate the samples in a thermocycler (no heated lid) for 15 min at 20 °C.Proceed immediately with the bead sample clean up. Clean up the libraries with AMPure beads as follows:Add 44 μl of AMPure beads to 35 μl of the library (the ratio is 0.8x).Mix the samples by pipetting up and down and incubate the samples for 5 min at room temperature.Place the samples on a magnet for 5 min or until the solution is clear.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Add 200 μl of ethanol (80%).Incubate the samples for 30 s on the magnet.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Repeat Steps 13e-13g.Let the beads dry for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the samples from the magnet.Add 27 μl of Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 8.0).Incubate the samples for 2 min at room temperature.Place the samples on the magnet until the solution is clear. Transfer 25 μl of the eluate to a new 96-well plate.Note: This can be a stopping point. Keep the samples in the fridge (4 °C) for 24 h, or for longer storage, keep them in the freezer (-20 °C). Size-select the libraries with AMPure beads as follows:Add 75 μl of nuclease-free water to the purified libraries.Add 50 μl of AMPure beads to 100 μl of the library (the ratio is 0.5x).",
    "Mix the samples by pipetting up and down and incubate the samples for 5 min at room temperature.Place the samples on the magnet for 5 min or until the solution is clear.Transfer 140 μl of the supernatant to a new 96-well plate.Add 20 μl of AMPure beads to 140 μl of supernatant (the ratio is 0.7x).Mix the samples by pipetting up and down and incubate the samples for 5 min at room temperature.Place the samples on the magnet for 5 min or until the solution is clear.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Add 200 μl of ethanol (80%).Incubate the samples for 30 s on the magnet.Remove supernatant without disturbing the beads.Repeat Steps 14j-14I.Let the beads dry for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the samples from the magnet.Add 15 μl of Tris-HCl (10 mM; pH 8.0).Incubate the samples for 2 min at room temperature.Place the samples on the magnet until the solution is clear.Transfer 13 μl of the eluate to a new 96-well plate.Note: This can be a stopping point. Keep the samples in the fridge (4 °C) for 24 h or, for longer storage, keep them in the freezer (-20 °C). Check the quality of the final library (1/10 dilution of the prepared library) by electrophoresis on the AATI Fragment Analyzer using the HS NGS Fragment Kit. An example of successful libraries is shown in Figure 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702051753_8141.jpgFigure 2. Successfully prepared libraries shown by electrophoresis on an AATI Fragment AnalyzerQuantify all samples using the Qubit according to the supplier’s instructions.Use the average size (smear analysis on the AATI Fragment Analyzer between 200 and 1500 base pairs) and the Qubit concentration, to calculate the molarity of the obtained library. Use the formula below:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190702/20190702051919_3964.jpgDilute all libraries to 2 nM in EBT buffer.",
    "Pool all the samples by combining equal volumes of each 2 nM library.Load the samples on the Illumina platform of choice. For the Illumina NovaSeq6000, perform the library denaturation as mentioned in the NovaSeq6000 Sequencing System Guide (Document 1000000019358v11). For 96 samples, use 6% capacity (matching the denaturation of 9 μl of 2 nM library pool) of the NovaSeq6000 S2 Reagent Kit (200 cycles)."
