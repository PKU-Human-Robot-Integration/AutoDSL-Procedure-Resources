    "The mice used in this study were cared for according to the guidelines of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center Division of Laboratory Animal Resources (DLAR) protocol number 15-10492.\nNOTE: Primary oligodendrocytes were isolated from neonatal (P5-P7 wild-type C57Bl/6N) mice. At this stage, immature OLs constitute more than 80% of the rodent white matter ensuring high cellular yield. All buffer and reagent compositions are available at the end of the Table of Materials.\n1. Coverslips Preparation\nNOTE: Poly-D-lysine (PDL)/laminin coated coverslips should be prepared prior to OL isolation.\nPlace #1 German glass coverslips into a 50-mL conical tube and add 35 mL of 70% EtOH to clean them.\nClose the tube, place it in a nutating mixer and incubate at room temperature for at least 30 min while gently rocking. Coverslips can be incubated overnight.\nDiscard the 70% EtOH.\nWash the coverslips 3 times with deionized water, remove the water every time with vacuum aspiration.\nAdd 30-35 mL of PDL 50 µg/mL to the coverslips in the 50-mL tube, enough to cover the coverslips.\nPlace the 50-mL tube containing the coverslips on a nutating mixer and incubate at room temperature for at least 30 min while rocking gently.\nWash the coverslips 3 times with deionized water, removing the water every time with vacuum aspiration.\nTransfer the coverslips into 60-mm Petri dishes containing deionized water.\nUse a P200 pipette tip to arrange the coverslips as a layer covering the entire surface of the Petri dish.\nCarefully, remove the water from the dishes with vacuum aspiration.\nRemove the excess of water around the coverslips and let them dry overnight with lid open and under UV light in the hood.\n\tNOTE: PDL coated glass coverslips can be stored at 4 °C in sterile Petri dishes for up to three months.",
    "Place the coverslips into 24-well plates, one per well, using fine forceps.\nMove the coverslips to the center of the well making sure the edges do not touch the wall of the well.\nAdd 100 µL of 10 µg/mL laminin diluted in B27NBMA (see the Table of Materials) starting in the center of each coverslip and moving in a circular fashion towards the edges to cover all the area.\n\tNOTE: Since laminin is involved in OL maintenance and promotes differentiation into mature OLs, it is an important OL survival factor for in vitro culture41,42,43,44.\nIncubate the plate in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2 for at least 1 h or until the OLs are ready for plating.\n2. Mouse Brain Cortex Dissociation\nSacrifice postnatal 5-7-day old C57Bl/6N mouse pups by quick decapitation with scissors previously cleaned in 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Cerebral cortices from 5-6 neonatal mice pups were used for each preparation. On average, one mouse brain yields 1-1.5 x 106 OLs.\nCut the scalp skin along the midline with small dissecting scissors and retract to expose the skull.\nCut the skull carefully along the midline starting from the opening in the back of the skull towards the frontal area, lifting up with the scissors to avoid damaging the brain. Then, using the opening in the back of the skull cut toward each eye socket along the base of the skull.\nUse fine forceps to gently tease the cortices away from the midbrain and transfer them to a 60-mm tissue culture dish containing 7 mL of B27NBMA. Repeat steps 2.2 through 2.4 for each brain, pooling the dissected cortices.\nTransfer the cortices to a new 60-mm tissue culture dish containing 5 mL of dissociation buffer (B27NBMA, 20-30 U/mL Papain, and 2,500 U DNase I).",
    "Dice the cortices into small pieces of about 1 mm3 using a #15 scalpel blade and incubate for 20 min in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nAdd 1 mL of bovine growth serum (BGS) to stop the enzymatic reaction.\nTransfer the cortices along with the dissociation media to a 15-mL conical tube using a 10 mL serological pipet.\nGently begin to dissociate the brain tissue by slowly pipetting up and down 6-8 times using a 10-mL serological pipet, using care to minimize bubbles.\nAllow the tissue chunks to settle for 2-3 min and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\nAdd 3 mL of B27NBMA containing 10% BGS/2500 U DNase I to the tissue pellet.\nUse a 5 mL serological pipette to gently dissociate the brain tissue while pipetting up and down 6-8 times. Be careful to minimize bubbles.\nAllow the tissue chunks to settle for 2-3 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. Add 3 mL of B27NBMA containing 10% BGS/DNase I to the tissue pellet.\nGently dissociate the brain tissue using a P1000 pipet tip, while pipetting the mix of media and brain tissue up and down. Repeat Steps 2.13 and 2.14 until no large chunks of tissue remain or until B27NBMA containing 10% BGS/DNase I is exhausted, whichever comes first. Be careful to minimize bubbles.\nPool cell suspension with previous supernatants.\nPlace 70-µm cell strainer in a 50-mL tube. Using a 10-mL serological pipet, pass the pooled cell suspension gently over the 70-µm cell strainer.\nWash the cell strainer by adding 1 mL of B27NBMA containing 10% BGS/DNase I.\nDiscard the cell strainer. Bring the volume to 30-mL with B27NBMA containing 10% BGS/DNase I.\nTransfer the cell suspension to two 15-mL conical tubes. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 10 min at 200 x g.",
    "Remove the supernatant without leaving the cells exposed to the air. The supernatant will be cloudy due to cell debris. Add 3 mL of B27NBMA containing 10% BGS to the pellet.\nCarefully dissociate the cell pellet using a P1000 pipet. Bring the volume to 15 mL with B27NBMA containing 10% BGS.\nPass the cell suspension over a fresh 40 µm cell strainer.\nWash the cell strainer by adding 1mL of B27NBMA containing 10% BGS. Discard the cell strainer.\nBring the volume to 30 mL with B27NBMA containing 10% BGS.\nTransfer the cell suspension to 2 x 15-mL conical tubes. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 10 min at 200 x g.\nRemove most of the supernatant without leaving the cells exposed to the air. Resuspend the cell pellets in 5 mL of ice cold magnetic cell sorting (MCS) buffer.\n3. Determination of Cell Count and Viability\nDilute 100 µL of the cell suspension with 400 µL of Trypan Blue Solution in a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube to achieve a 1:5 dilution in 0.4% (w/v).\nCenter a cover glass over a hemocytometer chamber and fill the two chambers with 10 µL of the cell dilution using a P10 pipette and avoiding overfill. The solution will pass under the cover glass by capillary action.\nPlace the hemocytometer on the microscope stage and adjust focus using 40X magnification.\n\tNOTE: Cell counts are recorded using a hand-held counter in each of five squares (four corners and one center). Only non-viable cells absorb the dye and appear blue, while live and healthy cells appear round and refractive and do not absorb the blue-colored dye, allowing for determination of the number of viable and total cells per milliliter.\n4. Isolation of O4+ Oligodendrocytes\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 x g for 10 min.",
    "Carefully discard the supernatant by using vacuum aspiration, avoiding exposure of the cells to the air.\nResuspend the pellet in 90 µL of MCS buffer per 1 x 107 total cells followed by the addition of 10 µL of anti-O4 beads per 1 x 107 cells.\nMix the cell suspension and beads by gently flicking the 15-mL conical tube with the finger 4-5 times.\nIncubate the mix for 15 min at 4 °C, flicking the 15-mL conical tube with the finger 4-5 timesevery 5 min.\nWash the mix by gently adding 2 mL of MCS buffer per 1 x 107 cells to the tube. Centrifuge the mix at 200 x g for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant by carefully using vacuum aspiration, avoiding exposure of the cells to the air. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of MCS buffer for every 1 x 107 cells.\nAttach a magnetic separator to a magnetic separator stand. Attach a selection column to the magnetic separator and place a 40 µm cell strainer on top of the column. Place two 15-mL or one 50-mL conical tube below the separation column to collect the flow through.\nPre-rinse the 40-µm cell strainer and separation column with 3 mL of MCS buffer and let the buffer run through the column without letting it dry.\nAdd the mix of cell suspension and beads to the cell strainer and into the selection column.\nWash the 40 µm cell strainer with 1 mL of MCS buffer.\nDiscard the cell strainer and let the mix of cells, beads and buffer run through the column without letting it dry.\nWash the separation column 3 times with 3 mL of MCS buffer and 1 time with OL proliferation media.",
    "Remove the separation column from the magnetic separator, quickly place it into a 15-mL conical tube, and immediately add 5 mL of OL proliferation media.\nPlace a plunger on top of the column and firmly push to flush out the labeled cells into the 15-mL conical tube.\nRemove 100 µL of cell suspension to determine cell count and viability using Trypan Blue and hemocytometer as indicated in section 3.\n\tNOTE: Cell viability above 80% is considered acceptable to proceed with the culture of OLs, but viability greater than 90% is optimal.\n5. Plating of Isolated O4+ Oligodendrocytes\nDilute the cell suspension to the desire plating density (5 x 105 cells per coverslip) using OL proliferation media.\n\tNOTE: OL seeding density is very important, so appropriate cell density should be confirmed using a tissue culture microscope prior to proceeding. Seeding density below 10,000 cells/coverslips may lead to poor cell survival. At plating density at 10,000 to 25,000, OL morphological differentiation is slow45. We plate OLs at a seeding density of at least 50,000 cells/coverslips to ensure cell survival.\nMove the 24-well plates containing coverslips coated with laminin from incubator to the tissue culture hood.\nRemove laminin from each coverslip and replace it with 100 µL of OL suspension.\nIncubate OLs in the 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator for a maximum of 45 min to promote OL adhesion to the coverslips.\nAfter incubation, remove the 24-well plates from the incubator. Flood each well of the 24-well plate with 500 µL of OL proliferation media.\nPlace the OLs back in the 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator for additional 24 h.\n24 h after plating of OLs, remove proliferation media and substitute with OL differentiation media to induce differentiation.",
    "Place the OLs back in the incubator and do not remove until the cells are ready for fixation.\n\tNOTE: Changes in pH are detrimental for OLs and decrease cell viability, therefore unnecessary removal of OLs cultures from the incubator should be avoided.\n6. Immunofluorescence Staining\nFor the detection of cell surface markers (NG2, O1 and O4) remove the media from the wells.\nAdd 250 µL of mouse hybridoma supernatants containing primary antibodies against O1 (undiluted)13 and O4 (undiluted)13 and rabbit polyclonal against NG2 (1:150 diluted in B27NBMA).\n\tNOTE: If commercially available anti-O1 and anti-O4 antibodies are to be used, it is advisable to utilize dilutions suggested by the manufacturer.\nIncubate the cells with primary antibody for 45 min maximum in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator.\nWash twice with 0.05% Tween-20/1X PBS. Fix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (4% PFA) for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash three times for 5 min each with 0.05% Tween-20/1X PBS.\nDilute Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:400) in B27NBMA.\nRemove the 0.05% Tween-20/1X PBS from the coverslips. Incubate the cells with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nWash three times for 5 min each with 0.05% Tween-20/1X PBS.\nFor double staining for the detection of internal markers (GFAP), remove the 0.05% Tween-20/1X PBS and block/permeabilize cells with block/permeabilization buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Otherwise proceed to step 6.17.\nRemove block/permeabilization buffer and add 250 µL chicken anti-GFAP (1:100) diluted in block/permeabilization buffer.\nIncubate the cells with anti-GFAP for 1 h at room temperature. Wash three times for 5 min each with 0.05% Tween-20/1X PBS.\nDilute Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG secondary antibody (1:400) in B27NBMA.",
    "Remove the 0.05% Tween-20/1X PBS from the coverslips. Incubate the cells with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nWash three times for 5 min each with 0.05% Tween-20/1X PBS.\nCounterstain with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mount the cells with antifade mounting media containing DAPI.\nLet the coverslips cure overnight in the dark at room temperature.\nImage the stained cells with an epifluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, the cells were imaged at 40X magnification using a uniform exposure time.\nSubscription Required.
