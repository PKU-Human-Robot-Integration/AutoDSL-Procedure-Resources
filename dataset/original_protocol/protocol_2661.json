To avoid localization artifacts due to strong or variable overexpression, we used clonal NCI-H295R cell lines with doxycycline-inducible PKAc-miniTurbo variants. This strategy allows for titration to achieve uniform, subtle expression levels of the exogenous kinase (∼20% of endogenous PKAc) and matched expression of variants across experimental conditions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2317-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Optimizing expression levels of exogenous miniTurbo fusion proteins in NCI-H295R cells\n(A) Immunoblot of PKAc expression after 48 h of doxycycline induction. Top bands represent exogenous miniTurbo-tagged WT PKAc (lane 1), PKAc mutant 1 (lane 2), and PKAc mutant 2 (lane 3). Bottom bands represent native PKAc.\n(B) Quantitation of immunoblot in A. Percent expression calculated according to Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. No significant differences across conditions by 1-way ANOVA. n ≥ 3. Adapted from Omar et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nH295R lentiviral transduction.\nPlate approximately 300,000 cells in 6-well plate 2 days before applying virus. Plan for 70% confluence at time of transduction.\nPlan for different viral amount conditions: No virus, low, mid, and high. Transduction media for a 6-well plate well totals 1 mL. It is composed of 1) harvested lentiviral supernatant from HEK293T viral production cells, 2) 5 μg/mL polybrene, and 3) fresh H295R media to bring volume up to 1 mL. For our experiments and titers, low = 10–50 μL virus-containing supernatant, medium = 50–150 μL, and high = 250–450 μL. Combine these in 1.5 mL tubes in a sterile biosafety cabinet just prior to transduction. An example setup is shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2317_2.csv\nAspirate old media and apply the viral transduction mixture.",
    "Incubate 6–8 h in cell culture incubator.\nAdd 1.5 mL fresh media (do not aspirate viral media) and continue incubating overnight (∼12–16 h).\nAdminister selection agent.\nAfter at least 24 h (and up to 48), change media and add selection agent (blasticidin, 5 μg/mL final concentration).\nMonitor cells for several days, changing media every 2–3 days to keep antibiotic fresh. There should be increasing death in the no virus control well. The low, medium, and high infections should demonstrate a dosage-dependent survival curve. Control cells should be completely dead within a week. Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nExpand well of best condition to 10-cm plate and continue selection.\nThis is your population cell line. Grow enough of this cell line to freeze down multiple tubes for a backup cache.\nNote: When deciding which conditions to expand, consider the viral impact on the cell genome. A linear increase in cell viability from low to high would suggest no over-saturation in the high condition. A plateau between medium and high conditions, however, would suggest the high condition contains excess copies of virus per cell. This may increase the genomic disruption as more copies of viral DNA are being integrated into the chromosomes.\nIsolating clones.\nNote: There are two main options for clonal isolation: FAC sorting and dilution plate colony picking. If the viral vector includes a fluorescent protein, FACS is ideal to separate cells based on predicted expression level. Even without a fluorescent marker, FACS combined with single cell plating is a good way to isolate clones. If FACS is not possible, diluting to very low cell density and picking colonies after growth is a viable option. This is detailed here.\nWash a confluent plate of cells with PBS.\nAspirate and add 1 mL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA.",
    "Place in incubator for ∼5 min (monitor cell rounding on microscope).\nThoroughly dissociate cells by pipetting up and down with 9 mL cell media using a 10-mL pipet.\nCritical: Greater percentage of single cells vs. multiple cells equals greater percentage of true clones upon picking colonies.\nDilute 20 μL into 2 mL media.\nFilter out large multi-cell aggregates by passing through a 40-μm cell strainer.\nFrom the strained cells, plate 100 μL and 200 μL in 10-cm dish with 10 mL media. This will yield 1:10,000 and 1:5,000 dilution colony plates, respectively. Due to dilutions and straining out aggregate cells, approximate cell numbers plated should be somewhat less than 500 and 1000 per plate, respectively. Factors such as failure to attach or grow will reduce these numbers to a manageable number of cell colonies well-spaced for discrete picking and transfer.\nChange 5 mL media every 4–5 days. Grow until most colonies are between 0.5 and 2 mm in diameter.\nTransferring colonies.\nOnce the clonal colonies have grown to appropriate size, they must be isolated.\nIn a fresh 24-well plate, add 60 μL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in each well and keep in hood.\nAlso, have a new, empty 24-well plate adjacent.\nReplace media in either the low or high-dilution colony plate with 15 mL serum-free media.\nPlace colony plate on a tissue culture or dissection microscope and use a low magnification objective (2.5× – 4×) to see multiple colonies at once.\nNote: Reduce traffic in the area and minimize air flow in area around microscope to decrease chance of contamination. While we have not experienced contamination in the 24-well plate, fungal contaminants have occurred in retained 10 cm colony plates after transferring colonies outside a laminar flow hood.",
    "While observing through the eye pieces, use a 1,000 μL pipette with tip to manually scrape and aspirate each desired colony. Only take up the smallest volume possible, ∼20–100 μL.\nExpel cells into the 0.25% trypsin-EDTA of the 24-well plate well.\nContinue picking in this manner. After 5–10 min of trypsin incubation, pipette cells up and down 10–20× with a 200 μL pipette.\nAdd 1 mL H295R cell culture media (complete with NuSerum and ITS+), pipet to mix, and move 500 μL to the corresponding well in adjacent clean 24-well plate. This duplicate plate will be tested when screening clones.\nOnce all colonies are picked, add extra 1 mL of complete media to each well in order to dilute trypsin.\nChange media the next day.\nNote: Depending on your expected success rate, you will need multiple 24-well plates of clones to ensure success. We generally screen 48–96 colonies per condition.\nScreening clones.\nOnce cells have grown sufficiently to evaluate heterogeneity, they can be screened via cell staining.\nFor each duplicate 24-well clone plate, replace media with fresh media containing 1 μg/mL doxycycline.\nGrow cells in doxycycline-containing media for 48 h.\nAspirate media and add 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS. A volume of 250–300 μL should be sufficient to cover cells.\nIncubate covered at room temperature (RT, ∼25°C) for 15 min.\nWash 3 × 5 min in 500 μL 1× PBS.\nBlock with 3% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at RT (∼25°C).\nReplace solution with Invitrogen anti-V5 tag antibody at a dilution of 1:800 in blocking solution.\nIncubate at 4°C overnight (∼12–16 h).",
    "Note: If reducing the total amount of needed antibody is desired, plates can be stained sequentially, reusing the diluted antibody for each plate. In this case, fixed and washed plates can be stored, sealed with parafilm around the edges to avoid dehydration, for up to three weeks at 4°C.\nNext day, wash 3 × 5 min with 1× PBS.\nAdd Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody at 1:1000 and DAPI at 1:5000 in blocking solution.\nProtect from light and incubate at RT (∼25°C) for 1 h.\nWash 1–2× with 1× PBS.\nCells can now be imaged using a fluorescent microscope.\nIdeal clones would have 100% of cells expressing construct at close to equal levels (with variance during the cell cycle). See “expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]” and Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nDoxycycline induction optimization.\nGrow up selected clones and maintain a passage plate/freeze down tubes for backup.\nSplit cells into a 12-well plate to test doxycycline response. Four wells per clone, including 0, 250, 500, and 1,000 ng/mL doxycycline conditions.\nNext day, add appropriate doxycycline and incubate for 48 h in tissue culture (TC) incubator.\nAfter incubation, scrape cells and perform western blot analysis with antibody to PKAc. Typical dilution factor for BD PKAc antibody is 1:2000. Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nUse ImageJ software to calculate PKAc-miniTurbo (65 kDa) induction curve as a percentage of endogenous PKAc (40 kDa) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nOnce ideal clones and doxycycline induction parameters are established, plate H295R cells in 10-cm dishes and allow to grow until 60–70% confluent in preparation for live cell labeling.\nCritical: When working with lentivirus or low-passage lentiviral cell lines, follow safety protocols, work in appropriate biosafety cabinet, avoid aerosol production, and use proper bleach disinfectant methods.\nLive-cell labeling and sample preparation",
    "Timing: Start 2 days before cell lysis. Labeling: ∼1–2 h. Sample prep: ∼1 h\nOnce 10-cm plates are 60–70% confluent, you can induce expression of the bait protein and biotinylate. Consider appropriate controls when setting up experiment. For instance, “no biotin” and “no doxycycline” conditions are two slightly different methods to control for non-specific binding in the pulldown. In addition, further validation of labeling efficiency and specificity are recommended as detailed in Hung et al.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] An example of the impact of increased doxycycline concentration on PKAc-miniTurbo expression and the resulting biotin labeling efficiency is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2317-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Testing labeling variables\n(A) Immunoblot showing effect of doxycycline concentration on PKAc-miniTurbo expression and biotin labeling efficiency.\n(B) Immunoblot exhibiting effect of biotin concentration on labeling efficiency.\n(C) Immunoblot demonstrating effect of biotin incubation time on labeling efficiency. For PKAc panels (middle) in (A–C), the bottom bands represent native PKAc while the top bands represent exogenous miniTurbo-tagged PKAc. Standard conditions for this protocol are designated by green text in all three experiments.\nBiotinylate proximal proteins.\nAdd biotin (100 mM stock in DMSO) to cell media at 50 μM. Gently rock plate to mix.\nIncubate in TC incubator for 1 h at 37°C. This time can be increased or decreased to address different labeling objectives.",
    "Note: Results from an experiment testing how increased biotin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) and labeling time (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) affect biotinylation extent are shown in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C. While increased labeling will yield more peptides detected by mass spectrometry, thereby decreasing false negatives, high amounts of labeling will likely increase false positives. The parameters used in this protocol aim to strike a balance between these two undesirable results. If increased biotinylation is needed, longer labeling time is favorable to higher doxycycline (increased PKAc-miniTurbo expression) as the latter will likely result in mislocalized bait protein.\nSample preparation.\nWash cells in 10 mL RT (∼25°C) 1× PBS twice for 1 min each to remove excess biotin.\nAspirate thoroughly.\nLyse and scrape cells in 750 μL RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors.\nMove to a 1.5-mL tube on ice.\nPipette up and down several times.\nLet lyse for 5 min on ice.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 8 min in cold room or refrigerated centrifuge set to 4°C.\nMove supernatant to a clean 1.5-mL tube on ice.\nDetermine sample protein concentration (e.g., using Pierce™ BCA).\nRun 15–25 μg of experimental and any control samples on western blot to test for biotin labeling (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Neutravidin™-HRP is used overnight (∼12–16 h) at 4°C. The typical dilution is 1:4000 in azide-free 5% BSA TBST.

Testing biotin labeling of PKAc-miniTurbo clonal line",
    "Western blot of clonal cell line lysates in 4 conditions probing with NeutrAvidin™-HRP at 1:4000 dilution. Protein biotinylation by PKAc-miniTurbo occurs only when bait protein expression is induced (+ doxycycline) and exposed to exogenous biotin (+ biotin) as shown in lane 4. Bands at ∼65 kDa and ∼130 kDa in lanes 1–3 are endogenous biotinylated proteins. Ponceau S demonstrates equal protein loading. Doxycycline treatment was 48 h. Biotin incubation was 2 h.\nProceed to pulldown or freeze down samples in liquid nitrogen and store in -80°C freezer.\nStreptavidin pulldown\nTiming: 2–3 h\nOnce proteins proximal to your bait have been labeled with biotin, they can be biochemically isolated by exploiting biotin-avidin affinity. This is an especially strong non-covalent interaction and allows for harsh washing conditions to minimize non-biotinylated proteins in your isolated samples.\nWash magnetic beads in the RIPA lysis buffer.\nResuspend stock supply of NanoLink® magnetic streptavidin beads by gently swirling or tapping the bottle/tube.\nMove enough beads for 25 μL per pulldown to a 1.5-mL tube. Take precaution when pipetting by using a cut P200 pipette tip or a P1000 pipette tip.\nAdd 1 mL lysis buffer and mix by inverting.\nPlace on magnetic rack and wait 30 s–1 min for buffer to clear.\nAspirate buffer while on holder.\nMove tube to non-magnetic rack and add 1 mL fresh lysis buffer.\nRepeat steps d and e.\nMove tube to non-magnetic rack and resuspend beads in original volume.\nPrepare working concentrations.\nCalculate the appropriate volume of lysis buffer and cell lysate to make 1 mL of 0.5 mg/mL samples. Remember to account for 25 μL of beads.",
    "Note: The amount of beads used depends on the amount of labeled proteins. The amount stated above was sufficient for 1 h of labeling time with PKAc-miniTurbo expression at 20% endogenous expression. Using a great excess of beads is not advised as it increases non-specific binding and the amount of streptavidin peptides post digestion.\nAliquot the needed lysis buffer for each sample into low protein binding tubes.\nAdd 25 μL magnetic beads to each tube of lysis buffer using a cut P200 tip. Resuspend beads before each pipetting to ensure equal bead allocation.\nFinally, add the appropriate amount of cell lysate to their respective tubes.\nIncubate to allow binding of biotinylated proteins to beads.\nPlace tubes on an orbital nutator or mechanical tube invertor and mix for 1 h at RT (∼25°C).\nDuring incubation, make urea solutions for washes and digestion.\n2 M Urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0: Make enough for 400 μL per tube. For 5 mL, weigh out 600.6 mg urea. Add 4 mL 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8 and mix. Once dissolved, bring to 5 mL with additional 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8. Keep at RT (∼25°C) until use.\n8 M Urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5: Make enough for 50 μL per tube. For 750 μL, weigh out 300.3 mg urea. Take caution not to add too much volume of 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5. Measure final volume with P1000 pipette. Keep at RT (∼25°C) until use.\nCritical: To avoid significant carbamylation of protein samples, make urea solutions fresh on day of use and avoid heating.\nWash samples.\nRemove tubes from rotator and place in magnetic holder. Let sit 30 s.\nBriefly invert tube rack and let sit another 30 s.",
    "Remove supernatant from tubes using P1000 and save small amount (∼50 μL) for diagnostic assessment by western blot.\nMove tubes to non-magnetic rack and add 1 mL lysis buffer to each.\nNote: It is important to prevent drying of the beads. To minimize time the beads are out of liquid, tubes can be aspirated, moved, and refilled one at a time.\nInvert several times. Ensure beads are not clumping together. If so, you can gently pipette up and down with a P1000 tip.\nPlace on magnet and let sit 30 s.\nBriefly and gently invert tube rack and let sit another 30 s.\nAspirate lysis buffer.\nRepeat wash steps d–h with 500 μL lysis buffer.\nAspirate and replace with 200 μL 2 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0.\nNote: Do not invert tubes at this point. After the first two lysis buffer washes, avoid all unnecessary contact between beads and plastic surface area. Absence of detergent in the buffer leads to adhesion of beads on side walls of the tube.\nTap gently to mix. If beads are clumping together, use a wide-bore tip to pipette up and down minimally.\nPlace on magnet and wait 1 min before aspirating with P200 or P1000/P200 pipette tips (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2317-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. P1000/P200 pipette tip stacking for careful aspiration following urea washes\nRepeat steps j–l for a total of 2 urea washes.\nWash twice with 150 μL 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5 in same manner as urea washes. Move directly to digestion steps. Troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].\nReduction, alkylation, and digestion of proteins\nTiming: 3 h + overnight (∼12–16 h) incubation",
    "The high-affinity biotin-streptavidin interaction may complicate elution of labeled proteins from the beads. To circumvent sample loss due to poor elution, we digest on the beads to prepare for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.\nReduction and alkylation.\nUse wide-bore tip to resuspend beads in 50 μL 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5 with 5 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl) and 10 mM chloroacetamide (CAM).\nIncubate shaking at 1,000 rpm and 37°C for 30–60 min in ThermoMixer. Avoid heating urea over 37°C as it will lead to increased protein carbamylation.\nDigest.\nAdd 50 μL 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (or 100 mM tris-HCl buffer pH 7.8 or 100 mM ammonium carbonate).\nPrepare LysC by dissolving in 100 μL double-distilled water to make 200 ng/μL LysC solution. Add 1 μg LysC and incubate 2 h at 37°C, shaking at 1,000 rpm in ThermoMixer. Check pH of digest to ensure pH is around 8.\nReconstitute MS-grade trypsin to 1 μg/μL in 50 mM acetic acid just before use.\nAdd 100 μL of the same buffer used in step 17a and add 1 μg trypsin. Recheck to ensure pH is around 8.\nUse ThermoMixer to shake overnight (∼12–16 h) at 1,000 rpm, 37°C.\nAcidify.\nNext morning, add 200 μL 2% formic acid to new labeled tubes.\nPlace digested samples on magnet and wait 1 min.\nMove supernatant to formic acid tubes and pipette up and down briefly to mix.\nSamples can now be loaded onto StageTips for LC-MS analysis.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] If needed, samples can be frozen until StageTip loading."
