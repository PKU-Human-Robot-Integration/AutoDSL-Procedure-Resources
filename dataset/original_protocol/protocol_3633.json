    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeeding and culturing of the cells\nTiming: 1 day\nDepending on the aim of your experiment, seed the cells you will need. Since the Hippo signal is regulated by cell confluency (Zhao et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), to inhibit the Hippo signal, cells should be seeded in a low-cell density condition such as 1.0 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate (Tsutsumi et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). If confluency does not interfere with or have an effect on your experimental process, approximately 50% confluency will give good staining images.\nCritical: When you have a positive or negative control for your experiments, you should simultaneously prepare the samples to know whether clustering or the PLA has succeeded or not (for preparation of the control, see individual sections and Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nCritical: Please confirm mycoplasma contamination before starting this experiment and use mycoplasma-eliminated cells (It is possible that contamination of mycoplasma disturbs the physiological intracellular signaling pathways. Such signal perturbation might substantially influence protein-protein interaction of interest, thereby leading to incorrect conclusions.).\nSterilize the cover slips by UV irradiation in a clean bench (tissue culture hood) for 30–60 min (if collagen solution is sterilized, you can skip UV irradiation).\nWash the cover slips twice using a medium (your cell culture medium with antibiotics) by gently shaking.\nSeed the cells on collagen-coated cover slips and culture at 37°C in 5% CO2.",
    "Note: MCF10A cells were cultured in Mammary Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (MEGM) (Lonza Cat. No. CC-3150) with penicillin (final concentration: 100 units/mL) and streptomycin (final concentration: 100 μg/mL) instead of GA-1000 (gentamycin-amphotericin B mix), and they were used in experiments at less than 7 passages. We seeded cells at 6.25 × 103 cells/cm2 for low density condition. We also used cells cultured at high density (6.25 × 104 cells/cm2) as a positive control of Hippo signal activation.\nAfter seeding, culture cells for 16 h in a 5% CO2 condition at 37°C (until the cells are attached well to the over slips) and then subject the cells to a cross-linking step. Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] or 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nNote: If you have control samples for clustering of the transmembrane protein (positive or negative control for clustering), you should prepare these samples.\nClustering of the transmembrane proteins by antibody-mediated cross-linking\nTiming: 2 h\nFor cross-linking, selection of the antibody is the most critical point.\nNote: Recognition of the extracellular domain is required for cross-linking.\nNote: Decrease nonspecific signals as much as possible. Before using the antibody, check the specificity of antibody by immunofluorescence staining or immunoblotting (Knockdown or knockout of your targeted-protein will give you information on the specificity of your primary antibodies.).\nNote: Consider the appropriate concentration, incubation time, incubation temperature and solution for antibody dilution.\nNote: When you performed a PLA after antibody-mediated cross-linking, you must use antibodies (both for primary and secondary antibodies) made by animal species that are different from those used for the PLA reaction. (e.g., in this protocol, mouse and rabbit primary antibody for the PLA, rat antibody (primary) and goat antibody (secondary) for cross-linking).\nNote: An overview is shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/558-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) CD44 clustering by cross-linking of the anti-CD44 antibody.\n(B) Negative control of cross-linking.\n(C) Without cross-linking (control for ignoring the effect of the primary antibody).\nPrepare the primary reaction solution (medium containing the primary antibody).\nAdd the primary antibody to the culture medium (final concentration: usually 0.5–20 μg/mL, please optimize the proper concentration). Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nNote: In this protocol, we added a rat monoclonal anti-human CD44 antibody (RRID: AB_467248) or normal rat IgG (as a negative control of cross-linking, RRID: AB_737202) to MEGM with penicillin and streptomycin (The final concentration of the primary antibody was 10 μg/mL.).\nAlternatives: Anti-hCD44s pan specific antibody (mouse monoclonal; clone: 2C5, #BBA10, R&D) and anti-mouse IgG-Fc fragment antibody (goat polyclonal; #A90-131A, Bethyl) can also be used for clustering of CD44.\nIncubate the cells for 90 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 with 1 mL of the primary reaction solution.\nWash the cells with a culture medium or PBS three times.\nPrepare the secondary reaction solution (medium containing the secondary antibody).\nAdd the secondary antibody into the culture medium (final concentration: 1–10 μg/mL, please optimize the concentration). Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nNote: In this protocol, we added a goat anti-rat IgG-Fc (RRID: AB_228348) to MEGM with penicillin and streptomycin (The final concentration of a secondary antibody was 1 μg/mL.).\nIncubate the cells for 60 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 with 1 mL of the secondary reaction solution. Then subject the cross-linked cells to an immunofluorescence staining (move to step 10) or a PLA (move to step 30). (If you prepare two cover slips for each sample, you can do both of PLA and IF in parallel.)\nNote: To confirm the effect of the primary antibody, prepare an additional control sample (primary antibody (+)/secondary antibody (-)). (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nImmunofluorescence staining (IF)",
    "Timing: 6 h – 18h\nNote: To test whether the clustering of a targeted membrane protein is successful or not, you should check the localization of the targeted protein or examine changes in the downstream signals by appropriate experiments before conducting the PLA (In this protocol, confirmation of the CD44 or YAP localization by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: Please optimize the conditions (concentration of the antibodies, incubation time, medium and temperature) for your experiments. To decrease non-specific PLA signals, optimization of the staining condition of your antibodies should be performed by immunofluorescence staining before conducting the PLA.\nCritical: To decrease nonspecific signals or background, avoid drying the cover slips.\nRinse the cells with 1 mL of PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nAdd 1 mL of PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 to a new 12-well plate and then transfer the cover slips into the new 12-well plate.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 for 5 min ×2 by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nFix the cells with 1 mL of 4% PFA/PBS for 15 min at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS for 5 min ×2 by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nPermeabilize the cells with 1 mL of 0.25% TritonX-100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS for 5 min ×2 by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nPerform blocking using 1 mL of proper blocking solution (this protocol used blocking solution which was described in “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”) for 60 min at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nWash the cells with PBS containing 0.1% tween 20 for 5 min ×2 by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C).",
    "Incubate the cells overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C or for 60 min at room temperature (23°C–26°C) with a primary antibody (you could speed up the reaction of the primary antibody by incubating at 37°C).\nDilute the primary antibody in PBS or blocking solution (usually 1:100–1:1000, concentration should be optimized).\nTo make a humidified chamber, place a parafilm and wet paper on to 10 cm dish (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/558-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. How to handle cover slips\n(A) To make the humidified chamber, cut the parafilm to an appropriate size and moisten the paper (e.g., KimWipes) with 18.2 Ω MilliQ sterilized H2O. Then put the parafilm and the wet paper onto a dish.\n(B) Tap off the PBS (left panel) and transfer the cover slips into a humidified chamber (right panel). Red arrows indicate the cover slip.\n(C) Drop 50 μL of the antibody solution onto the cover slip.\n(D) Drop 5–10 μL of mount medium onto the slide glass (left panel). Tap off PBS (as in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and then transfer the cover slips upside down onto the slide glass (middle and right panels).\n(E) Gently wipe the extra amount of medium (left panel) and then seal the edges of the cover slips using nail polish (middle and right panels). (Be sure the nail polish is cured in the dark before imaging.)\nTap off the PBS containing 0.1% tween 20 and transfer the cover slips into the humidified chamber (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nDrop 50 μL of the antibody solution onto the cover slip (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: In our experiments, to confirm CD44 clustering and re-localization of YAP, we used a mouse anti-CD44 antibody (CST, 8E2; 1:500 in PBS) and a rabbit anti-YAP antibody (CST, D8H1X; 1:500 in PBS), respectively.",
    "Transfer the cover slips into a 12-well plate and wash the cells with 1 mL of PBS containing 0.1% tween 20 for 5 min ×2 by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nPrepare a secondary antibody solution.\nDilute a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (please optimize the proper concentration) in PBS or blocking solution.\nNote: Choose an appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for your experiment. In our case, we used an Alexa-Fluor 488 mouse anti-IgG for CD44 (1:1000) and an Alexa-Fluor 488 rabbit anti-IgG for YAP (1:1000).\nIncubate the cells for 60 min with a secondary antibody solution at room temperature (23°C–26°C) in the dark.\nTap off the PBS containing 0.1% tween 20.\nTransfer the cover slips into the humidified chamber and drop 50 μL of the secondary antibody solution onto the cover slip.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS containing 0.1% tween 20 for 10 min by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C) in the dark.\nIncubate the cells for 15 min with DAPI solution at room temperature (23°C–26°C) in the dark.\nDilute the DAPI in PBS (1:1000).\nTap off the PBS containing 0.1% tween 20.\nTransfer the cover slips into the humidified chamber and drop 50 μL of the DAPI solution onto the cover slip.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS containing 0.1% tween 20 for 10 min by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C) in the dark.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS for 10 min by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C) in the dark.\nDrop 5–10 μL of 90% glycerol/PBS onto the slide glass (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D left panel).\nTap off the PBS and transfer the cover slips upside down onto the slide glass (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D middle and right panels).\nNote: Avoid the presence of air bubbles.",
    "Wipe the extra amount of medium (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E left panel), seal the edges of the cover slips using nail polish and then move to step 56 to take images (Be sure the nail polish is cured before imaging to avoid damage to the objective.) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E middle and right panels).\nPause Point: You can store the slides at 4°C in the dark for several days.\nProximity ligation assay (PLA)\nTiming: 24 h\nNote: An antibody that recognizes the intracellular domain of the target transmembrane protein is required for detection of the interaction between transmembrane protein and intracellular protein using PLA.\nNote: Since the PLA is a highly sensitive assay that detects protein-protein interaction, several negative control experiments should be required (e.g., knockout of targeted protein with PLA and PLA performed without a primary antibody are shown in Rawat et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].).\nNote: This step was referred to in the sigma protocol for Proximity Ligation Assay (Sigma-Aldrich; https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/cell-biology/antibodies/duolink-and-pla-technology.html[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/cell-biology/antibodies/duolink-and-pla-technology.html]) and was optimized for our experiments (Ooki et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). When you observe inadequate protein-protein interactions, additional optimization of the PLA conditions may be required (see Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nNote: Bring the wash buffers A and B to room temperature (23°C–26°C) before use.\nCritical: To decrease nonspecific signals or background, avoid drying the cover slips.\nCritical: To avoid contamination of nuclease, use autoclaved PBS and ddH2O (Contamination of nuclease interferes with ligation and amplification.).\nRinse the cells with 1 mL of PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 at room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nAdd 1 mL of PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 to a new 12-well plate and then transfer the cover slips into the new 12-well plate.\nWash the cells with PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 for 5 min ×x2 by gently shaking at room temperature (23°C–26°C).",

Cross-linking of the anti-CD44 antibody mimicked HMW-HA treatment and activated Hippo signal\nFor CD44 clustering, we prepared two control samples. Specifically, cells were treated with MEGM containing HMW-HA (1000 ng/mL) and with medium containing LMW-HA (1000 ng/mL) for 20 min as a positive and a negative control, respectively (Yang et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). As a positive control of activation of the Hippo signal, MCF10A cells were seeded in a high cell density condition (6.25 × 104 cells/cm2) and then cultured for 16 h. Cultured cells were fixed with 4% PFA and then used for IF staining (Figure. 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) or a PLA (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).",
    "(A) Cells were cultured in the indicated conditions and stained with the anti-CD44 antibody (green). Nuclei were stained by DAPI (blue). Cross-linking of the anti-CD44 antibody increased clustering of CD44 as well as in HMW-HA-treated cells (positive control of CD44 clustering). On the other hand, LMW-HA treatment (negative control of CD44 clustering) failed to induce CD44 clustering. Clustering of CD44 was also increased in cells cultured in a high cell density condition.

Cultured cells were stained with an anti-YAP antibody (green) and an anti-actin antibody (red). Nuclei were stained by DAPI (blue). Cross-linking of the anti-CD44 antibody activated the Hippo signal (induction of cytoplasmic accumulation of YAP) as well as a high density condition (positive control of activation of the Hippo signal) and HMW-HA treatment.
