    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nGenerating SplM from hPSCs\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step provides directions about how to perform the first stage of differentiation, involving conversion of hPSCs to SplM.\nCulture hPSCs on Geltrex-coated plates in SFM from our previous protocol (Menendez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). hPSCs should be >95% positive for pluripotency markers OCT4 and NANOG and be of normal karyotype. Once cell density reaches 80%–90% of the plate surface area, aspirate medium and add enough Accutase® (25°C–37°C) to cover the plate surface (i.e. 2 mL to a 60 mm plate). Incubate the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 5–7 min.\nNote: Monitor dissociation under a bright-field microscope (10X) to ensure that cells are dissociated into singlets. Extend the dissociation time to 10 min if needed.\nPool all cells in a 15 mL conical tube. Wash the plate with 2 mL of SFM and collect into the same conical tube. Centrifuge at 200 × g for 4 min at 25°C–37°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and fully resuspend cell pellets in 5 mL of SplM medium then, plate at a density of 5 × 104–1 × 105 cells per cm2 onto Geltrex-coated plates to initiate differentiation.\nNote: Seeding density for SplM differentiation may vary for different cell lines. Adjust seeding density if required. For WA09, seed cells at a density of 5 × 104 cells per cm2. Other hPSC lines such as WA01, WA07, TE03 (https://grants.nih.gov/stem_cells/registry/current.htm[href=https://grants.nih.gov/stem_cells/registry/current.htm]) and K3 (hiPSC) (Si-Tayeb et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]) are routinely seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cm2. A suggested density range of ±1.25, 1.5 and 2.0-fold that of the seeding density described in the main protocol.\nCulture the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nReplace SplM medium each day until day 4. Warm medium to 37°C before use.",
    "Alternatives: Several protocols have been described for the generation of SplM from hPSCs. We recommend using SFM described in this protocol supplemented with differentiation factors although other media formulations support SplM differentiation (Lindsley et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]; Sumi et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]). So long as >90% of cells express ISL1, NKX2.5 and FOXF1 after 4 days these cultures should be suitable to use for next stage of differentiation (MesoTs). In some alternative approaches, GSK3β inhibitors are used in place of WNT ligands to the same effect. Base media such as RPMI can also be used instead of DMEM/F12. In addition to Geltrex, low growth factor Matrigel can also be used as a matrix onto which cells are seeded. Different cell lines respond to different concentrations of differentiation factors. It may be necessary to titrate these factors if desired results are not obtained but it is recommended that conditions specified in the main protocol are used initially.\nMaking MesoT Vascular Progenitor Cells from Splanchnic Mesoderm\nTiming: 16 days\nHere, directions are provided for conversion of SplM to MesoT cells.\nAfter 4 days in SplM differentiation medium, cells are ready for culture in MesoT medium. First, aspirate the medium and wash the plate with DPBS twice.\nNote: No re-plating of cells is required during the transition from SplM to MesoT.\nPre-warm MesoT medium (-RA) in a 37°C bath and thaw out one vial of aliquot RA. Add RA into warm medium at final concentration of 4 μM to make complete MesoT medium.\nCritical: After reconstitution, RA should be aliquoted into 1.5 mL tubes for single use. RA should be protected from light so working quickly is crucial. Do not re-freeze or re-use RA.\nAspirate DPBS and add complete MesoT medium onto the plate.",
    "Culture cells at 37°C, 5% CO2. Change MesoT medium daily for 16 days. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for expected results.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/77-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Successful Differentiation versus Failed Differentiation of MesoT Cells\nSuccessful differentiation (A) versus failed differentiation (B and C) of MesoT cells. (A) A layer of collagen forms beneath densely packed MesoTs after 20 days of differentiation- seen as white areas between cells. (B and C) Cells are sub-confluent and lack a definable collagen layer, indicative of sub-optimal differentiation. All images are at 10X. Micron bars, 200 μm.\nAlternatives: Generation of MesoT cells from SplM is best performed with DMEM/F12 basal media supplemented with fraction V BSA that is depleted of fatty acids, growth factor and endotoxin activity. Probumin (Life Science Grade) or equivalent products from other vendors (LifeCycle Biotechnology, MP Biomedical) are suitable for this application. Replacement of BSA with other stabilizers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and amino acids are also an option (Biggers et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Batch testing of BSA is always recommended. Media is supplemented with FGF2, WNT3a, BMP4 and all-trans retinoic acid. Optimal concentrations of these compounds may vary depending on the cell line used but a useful starting point is defined in the main protocol. Depending on the hPSC line used, MesoT differentiation ranges from 14–18 days.\nGeneration of Smooth Muscle Cells from MesoT Cells\nTiming: 12 days\nThis step involves the generation of smooth muscle cells from MesoT cells.\nOn day 16 of MesoT differentiation, aspirate medium and add warm dissociation solution I onto the plate. Incubate cells with dissociation solution I in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 30–45 min.\nMonitor cell detachment every 15 min and stop dissociation once the edge of cell layer detaches from the plate by aspirating dissociation solution I. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for expected results.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/77-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Monitoring MesoT Dissociation\nStep 1: 3 mL of dissociation solution I (Col IV) is added to a 60 mm plate followed by incubation at 37°C. Images shown (from left to right) indicate incubation of cells in Col IV for 0, 10, 20 and 30 min, respectively. Optimal time of dispersal is 30–45 min. The far-right image represents excessive dispersal. Red arrows indicate areas where the cell sheet is lifting from the culture dish. When the edge of the cell sheet starts to detach, cells are ready to proceed to the next step of dissociation (addition of TrypLE).\nAdd dissociation solution II with TrypLE™ at 9:1 to plate and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 15 min. Check cells under microscope until cell are fully dissociated into single cells.\nOnce in a single cell suspension, transfer all cells into a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge cells at 200 g for 4 min at 25°C–37°C.\nSeed at 1.5 × 105 cells per cm2 in SMC differentiation medium comprising SFM depleted of rhActivin A, supplemented with 50 ng/mL PDGF-BB on Geltrex-coated plates or chamber slides.\nChange SMC differentiation medium every other day until day 12.\nGeneration of Endothelial Cells from MesoT Cells\nTiming: 12 days\nHere, steps for the generation of endothelial cells from MesoT cells are described.\nOn day 16 of MesoT differentiation, aspirate medium and add warm dissociation solution I onto the plate. Incubate cells with dissociation solution I in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 30–45 min.\nMonitor cell detachment every 15 min and stop dissociation once the edge of cell layer detaches from the plate by aspirating dissociation solution I (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
