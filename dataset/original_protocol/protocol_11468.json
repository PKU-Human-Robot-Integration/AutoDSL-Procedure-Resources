    "1. Preparation of Materials\nAutoclave cover slips.\nPlace cover slips in a glass beaker.\nCover the glass beaker with foil.\nAutoclave at 121 °C at 15 psi for 20 min.\nDry at 50 °C. Store at room temperature in a culture hood.\nPrepare Fixation Solution: 3% paraformaldehyde + 2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nTo a 1,000 mL glass bottle, add 700 mL PBS and 30 g paraformaldehyde.\n\t\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is corrosive, wear appropriate gloves.\nDissolve paraformaldehyde completely by heating to 80 °C using a microwave.\n\t\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde fumes are toxic, wear a mask.\nLeave at room temperature overnight.\nAdd 20 g sucrose.\nAdd PBS to make the total volume 1 L.\nAliquot in 50 mL tubes. Fixation Solution can be stored for 3 years at -20 °C or for 3 months at 4 °C.\n2. Preparation of Cell Culture\nNOTE: These procedures should be performed in a culture hood.\nCulture and passage U2OS human osteosarcoma cells to maintain logarithmic growth5.\n\tNOTE: Other cell types can be used after determining the optimal irradiation dose.\nWipe a scalpel with paper towels moistened with 70% ethanol. Using the scalpel, place a cover slip on a 35 mm cell culture dish (hereafter simply referred to as \"the dish\").\n\tNOTE: The number of cover slips in one dish can be increased according to the experimental design (see Discussion).\nAdd 1 mL culture media: DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.\n\tNOTE: Other media can be used according to the chosen cell type.\nWipe forceps with paper towels moistened with 70% ethanol. Using the forceps, gently hold the center of the cover slip. Aspirate the culture media from the dish completely, while maintaining a hold on the cover slip.\n\t​NOTE: This step promotes immobilization of the cover slip to the dish.",
    "Detach adherent cultured cells using trypsin5.\nAspirate culture media from the dish.\nAdd 1 mL PBS and shake the dish gently.\nAspirate PBS from the dish.\nAdd 1 mL trypsin [0.25w/v% Trypsin-1mmol/L EDTA] to the dish.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\nAdd 9 mL culture media to the dish.\nUsing a 1000 μL micropipette, prepare a single-cell suspension.\nCount the cells5.\nIn a 1.5 mL tube, add 0.9 mL cell suspension and 0.1 mL 0.4% Trypan Blue solution.\nApply 10 μL to a hemocytometer.\nExamine the number of unstained (i.e., live) cells under an inverted-phase microscope.\nIn a 15 mL tube, prepare 3 mL cell suspension in culture media at a density of 0.5 x 105 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: Cell density can be modified according to experimental need (see Discussion).\nGently add 2 mL of the cell suspension to the dish.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n3. Irradiation\nCAUTION: Handle the X-ray irradiator carefully according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nExamine the cells under an inverted-phase microscope. Confirm that the cells are attached to the cover slip and alive.\nIrradiate the dish with 6 Gy X-rays (1.4 Gy/min, 300 KVP, 20 mA).\nIncubate for 72 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Incubation time can be modified according to the experimental design (see Discussion).\n4. Fixation\nAspirate culture media from the dish.\nUsing scissors, cut the tip of a 1,000 μL micropipette tip 5 mm from the end.\n\tNOTE: The cut tip helps to smoothly apply the Fixation Solution.\nUsing the cut tip, add 1 mL Fixation Solution (prepared in step 1.2) to the dish from the side wall of the dish.",
    "NOTE: This step is time-sensitive and should therefore be performed without changing micropipette tips when handling multiple samples. Application of Fixation Solution directly to the bottom of the dish can damage the cells.\nPlace the dish in a square culture dish. Shake the square culture dish gently to distribute the Fixation Solution over the cover slip evenly.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nAspirate Fixation Solution from the dish.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS to the dish from the side wall of the dish.\n\tNOTE: Application of PBS directly to the bottom of the dish can damage the cells.\nAspirate PBS from the dish.\nRepeat steps 4.7 and 4.8 twice.\n\tNOTE: The dish can be stored for 1 week at 4 °C with the cover slips bathed in 2 mL PBS.\n5. DAPI Staining\nTo a slide glass, apply 5 μL 1 μg/mL DAPI staining reagent.\n\tNOTE: The DAPI staining reagent is stable for 6 months when stored protected from light at or below -20 °C.\nUsing a scalpel, remove the cover slip from the dish.\nDraw off the excess PBS on the cover slip by touching the edge of the cover slip with a paper towel.\nMount the cover slip upside-down onto the drop of DAPI staining reagent on the slide glass so that the cells are exposed to DAPI staining reagent.\n\tNOTE: This step is time-sensitive. Drying of the DAPI staining reagent can lead to suboptimal staining.\nThe samples can be stored for 1 year at -20 °C.\n6. Image Acquisition\nExamine the sample on a fluorescence microscope. Nuclei are visualized using the DAPI filter.",
    "NOTE: Either a 20X or a 60X oil lens can be used, according to the researcher's interest. When using a 60X oil lens, add one drop of oil onto the cover slip. Be careful that the samples do not touch the lens; otherwise, the lens can be damaged.\nAcquire images of nuclei using a CCD camera and digital image acquisition software with the following settings and parameters: DAPI filter, monolayer images, gain of 1X, and automatic exposure.\nFinish image acquisition: Wipe the 20X lens with paper towels moistened with lens cleaner. Wipe the 60X oil lens with paper towels moistened with chloroform.\n7. Evaluation of Clonogenic Cell Death Mode\nIn randomly selected images, count the number of nuclei that meet the criteria for apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and cellular senescence until the total number of counted nuclei reaches 300. Conduct this step in triplicate for each experimental setting.\nCriteria for apoptosis: presence of apoptotic bodies (i.e., condensed and fragmented nuclei)6,7.\nCriteria for mitotic catastrophe: presence of nuclei showing two or more distinct lobes or micronuclei8,9,10.\nCriteria for cellular senescence: presence of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) (i.e., nuclear DNA containing 30-50 bright, dense foci)2,11."
