    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nGeneral Description of the Construct Design\nTo enable investigation of the flaviviral replication organelle biogenesis independent of viral replication, an expression plasmid is required which can continuously be transcribed and translated by the host cell machinery. Since flaviviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and therefore, the viral RNA genome is not spliced, expression of flaviviral constructs by conventional expression plasmids bears the risk of inadvertent splicing, thus affecting the expression of viral proteins. Therefore, we employ a cytoplasmic transcription/translation system originally developed by Fuerst et al. (1986)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]. For this, parts of the viral genome (ETm-3′ UTR; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) are inserted into the pTM expression plasmid, which allows cytoplasmic transcription via the promoter of the T7 RNA polymerase. By using the Huh7/Lunet-T7 cell line, which stably expresses the T7 RNA polymerase, viral RNA is continuously produced upon DNA transfection. To promote RNA translation, an EMCV IRES element is added to the 5′ end of the viral open reading frame encoding the polyprotein. To ensure the generation of viral RNAs with an authentic 3′UTR, the hepatitis D virus ribozyme was inserted downstream of the ZIKV or DENV 3′ UTR (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The present protocol describes the procedure for inducing and analyzing replication organelles of Zika virus (the pIRO-Z system). However, the same method can be applied to dengue virus replication organelles, simply by switching the backbone plasmid from pIRO-Z to pIRO-D.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/294-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Design of the pIRO Construct",
    "Schematic representation of the pIRO (pTM/Δ 5′SLAB–3′WT-Ribozyme) expression plasmid. The pIRO construct is composed of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (blue box), a short part of the capsid coding region containing the 5′ cyclization sequence (CS), the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) to facilitate high-level RNA translation, the NS1 to NS5 coding region, the 3′ non-translated region (NTR), and the HDV ribozyme for generating authentic 3′ ends. The nucleotide positions of the ZIKV H/PF/2013 (GenBank accession number KJ776791.2) and DENV-2 genome (GenBank accession number NC_001474.2) used to generate the constructs are given below each element in brackets. Sequences of ZIKV are given in green; sequences corresponding to DENV are given in purple.\nPlasmids Transfection and Validation of Experiments\nTiming: ∼2 weeks in total\nHuh7/Lunet-T7 cells are seeded for transfection experiments which will be analyzed 18 h.p.t. (pIRO-Z) or 20 h.p.t. (pIRO-D) by western blot, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy.\nSeeding of Cells\nTiming: ∼1 h\nOne day prior to transfection, Huh7/Lunet-T7 cells are seeded either on glass coverslips in 24-well plates or 6-well plates at a cell density of 3 × 104 cells/well and 2 × 105 cells/well, respectively. Cells grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates are used to estimate the transfection efficiency via immunofluorescence microscopy and to analyze the ultrastructural membranous rearrangements via electron microscopy. Cells seeded in a 6-well plate are subjected to western blot analysis for verifying polyprotein expression and processing.\nTransfection of Cells\nTiming: ∼5 h\nOn the day of transfection, change medium of seeded cells at least 30 min prior to transfection.\nNote: We recommend replacing the medium by 500 μL/well fresh and pre-warmed DMEM complete medium for 24-well plates and 1 mL/well in case of a 6-well plate.\nPrepare the transfection mixture in sterile reaction tubes:",
