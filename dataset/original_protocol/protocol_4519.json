    "In order to visualize vessels and blood flow (leakage of blood as example), perfuse the animal for 10 min by intravenous (IV) injection (200 μl/25 gr of animal) of 20 mg/ml FITC-dextran (2,000 kDa lysine fixable at 20 μg/μl in saline). (Animals should not be anesthetized because anesthetics cause reduced heart rate and blood pressure, requiring longer perfusion times).Euthanize the animal by using CO2 10 min after IV injection. Enucleate the mouse eye by pulling apart the eyelids, and placing a curved forcep under the eyeball. Close the forcep and grip the connective tissue and optic nerve, being careful to avoid squeezing the eyeball, and gently pull the eyeball from the orbit. Place the eye in 10% Formalin (or 4% PFA) overnight at 4 °C to fix the tissue.Wash eyes after formalin-fixation 3 times for 15 min with shaking at room temperature in PBS.After washing the fixed, enucleated eyes, remove the cornea, iris, lens, sclera, and choroid (primary cut around the limbus). Use an 18G needle to make a small hole in the posterior of the limbus. After puncturing the limbus, use micro-scissors to cut around the circumference of the limbus. After finishing the cut, use forceps to remove the cornea, iris, lens, and sclera. Extract the vitreous gel using micro-forceps, or by gently squeezing the. In order to free the retina use two pairs of micro forceps and go around the edges to separate the retina from the eyecup and then gently squeeze the retina out. If necessary, remove the hyaloid vessels with micro forceps (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150802/20150802220857_7112.pngFigure 1. Diagram describes the dissection of the eye resulting in a whole mount of the retinaIncubate tissue (retinas) with blocking buffer (materials and reagents) for 1-3 h.",
    "Incubate retinas overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation in blocking buffer containing BS-1 isolectin (LEC)-TRITC [incubation longer than overnight (12-24 h) may increase nonspecific fluorescence]. Wash retinas 4-5 times (1 h between washes) in PBS at room temperature on a shaker.In order to flatten and mount the retina under a coverslip, make four incisions as shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150802/20150802220917_2892.pngFigure 2. Retina cup is cut with surgical blade in order to allow the retinas to lie flat on the slidePlace the retina onto a slide with the eyecup facing up, and cut the retina in each quarter with a micro-scissor. Using a wide-bore plastic Pasteur pipette, remove excess PBS and spread the eyecup open like a flower. Add 1 drop (around 10 μl) of mounting media over the retina and cover with a coverslip.Images of flat-mounted retinal vascular plexus are acquired with an epifluorescence microscope. To capture 3D images of the retinal vascular plexus, use a confocal microscope fitted with a CCD camera. A 5x or 10x objective offers the best image resolution for Angio Tool software.Angio Tool image software can be used for quantifying numerous features of the angiogenic vessels including vascular density, number of branch points and tip cells, and others (Zudaire et al., 2011)."
