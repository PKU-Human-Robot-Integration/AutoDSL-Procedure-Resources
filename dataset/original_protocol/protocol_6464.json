    "The steps of the RNA extraction (A) and purification (B) are summarized in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200423/20200423222404_8110.jpgFigure 1. Steps of RNA extraction and purification. This diagram represents the steps of RNA extraction (A) and purification (B).

They are derived from Lgy M4147 (MHOM/BR/75/M4147). Under a laminar flow hood, collect 5 ml of a 10 ml stationary phase parasite culture (day 6 of culture, for a detailed protocol of culture, see pages 3 and 4 of the Bio-protocol by Reverte and Fasel, 2019) in a 50 ml tube.Note: The authors recommend to use a 50 ml tube even for 5 ml parasites, as discarding the medium from the pellet (at Step A3) is easier with a 50 ml tube. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 24 °C.Under a laminar flow hood, discard the medium and resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of DPBS 1x.Under a laminar flow hood, transfer to a 1.5 ml tube.Centrifuge at 2,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Under a laminar flow hood, discard the supernatant.Resuspend and homogenize the pellet with 1 volume of TRI® reagent (1 ml) under chemical hood, in order to extract RNA from the parasites. At this step, the sample can be kept for a few weeks at -80 °C.Total RNA purification (not DNA-free) from Leishmania parasites (see Figure 1)Note: The following protocol is adapted from the protocol of TRI® reagent provided by the manufacturer. Clean the bench and the pipettes with RNase AWAYTM reagent.If kept at -80 °C, thaw the sample and let equilibrate to room temperature (RT) for 5 min.",
    "Under chemical hood, add 1/5 volume of chloroform (200 µl).Mix vigorously and wait for 2 min at room temperature.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the upper aqueous phase (approximately 500 µl) into a new 1.5 ml tube.Add the same volume of isopropanol (here 500 µl) and mix, wait for 5 min at room temperature. Note: At this step, the purification procedure can be stopped and the tube can be stored at -20 °C overnight. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g, for 20 min, at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and add 1 volume of Ethanol 75% (1 ml) to the pellet.Centrifuge at 7,500 x g, for 10 min, at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.Let the pellet dry at room temperature under the chemical hood for approximately 10 min.Note: Do not over dry the pellet as it may be difficult to dissolve. Add 25 µl UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water and vortex briefly to dissolve the pellet at room temperature.Put the tube on ice and measure RNA concentration with 1.5 µl RNA with NanoDropTM. Check that the A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios are of good quality (not contaminated).Note: Make the blank of the NanoDropTM with 1.5 µl of UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water. RNA can be kept at -80 °C for long storage.Note: Repeated freeze and thaw can decrease the concentration of the RNA and fresh RNA can give better results.Enzymatic digestion of total RNA (not DNA-free) from Leishmania parasites: degradation of DNA by DNase I, and single-stranded DNA or RNA by Nuclease S1Clean the bench and the pipettes with RNase AWAYTM reagent.Warm up the water bath to 37 °C.Thaw parasite-isolated total RNA (if frozen) and keep on ice.Note: If the RNA is frozen, measure RNA concentration with NanoDropTM after it thaws. In a new 1.",
    "5 ml tube, add between 5 and 50 µg of RNA, on ice.For 1 reaction, digest the total RNA (not DNA-free) with 60 U of Nuclease S1 in Buffer S1 1x and with 10 U of DNase I in UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water.Note: In a new 1.5 ml tube on ice, prepare the enzymatic mix for several reactions: mix DNase I, Nuclease S1, Buffer S1 diluted to 1x and UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water. Then dispense on RNA. This enzymatic mix has been tested on the range: 5 to 50 µg of RNA. Prepare an undigested negative control for each sample: in a new 1.5 ml tube, on ice, add between 2 and 5 µg of RNA and dilute in UltraPureTM DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water (final volume of 10 µl).Note: Different quantities of RNA between digested and undigested samples have been used to avoid huge differences of exposure times between them when acquiring pictures of the gel electrophoresis. Vortex briefly and spin down.Incubate the tubes containing RNA and enzymatic mix, and negative control (without enzymatic mix), in the water bath at 37 °C for 1 h.Note: During this incubation time, the agarose gel can be prepared. At the end of the incubation, transfer the tubes with the digested RNA and the undigested negative control on ice.Note: At this step, the samples can be kept at -80 °C for several weeks.Visualization of viral dsRNA by migration on mini-gel electrophoresisRinse the autoclaved glass bottles needed with Ultra-pure DNase/RNase-free water, type Ultra ClearTM.Prepare 1x TBE solution (Recipe 5) in an autoclaved glass bottle.Prepare 1x TBE containing 2% SDS solution (Recipe 6) in an autoclaved glass bottle.",
    "Clean the material for mini-gel electrophoresis (tank, spacers and comb) with 1x TBE containing 2% SDS solution, then rinse very well with Ultra-pure DNase/RNase-free water, type Ultra ClearTM and with RNase AWAYTM reagent.Prepare 0.8% agarose gel.Weigh agarose powder in an autoclaved glass bottle: 0.4 g for 1 mini-gel.Add 1x TBE: 50 ml for 1 mini-gel.Heat with a microwave until agarose is homogeneously dissolved.Note: Monitor the aspect of the mixture and be careful of the high temperature. Cool down at room temperature for a few min.Mount the mini-gel electrophoresis (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200423/20200423222602_8013.jpgFigure 2. Mini-gel migration system “home-made” for gel electrophoresis. This figure represents the different pieces to assemble before putting the agarose gel.Add SYBRTM Safe to agarose gel (0.5 µl for 1 mini-gel), shake well but without making bubbles and fill the electrophoresis tank.Remove potential bubbles with a tip and let the agarose gel polymerize for 30-45 min at room temperature.Pour 1x TBE in the electrophoresis tank (75 ml for 1 mini-gel) and carefully remove the spacers and the comb.Add 6x Gel Loading Dye to the samples: the digested RNA and the undigested negative control in order to have Gel Loading Dye at 1x.Load the wells with 10-25 µl of each sample and 2-4 µl of 1 kb DNA Ladder (50 µg/ml).Connect the electrophoresis tank to the power supply with cables: the top electrode is connected to the negative pole and the bottom electrode to the positive pole.Switch on the power supply: run the gel at 80-100 volts for 45-60 min, until the Gel Loading Dye has reached the ¾ of the mini-gel.Switch off the power supply and disconnect the electrophoresis tank.",
    "Transfer the gel to a transilluminator coupled to camera and printer, adjust the zoom, the focus and the exposure time, then take a picture of the mini-gel (see Figure 3).Observe and analyse the picture of the gel electrophoresis (see Data analysis)."
