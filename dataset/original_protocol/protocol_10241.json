    "Animal experiments followed strict protocol approved by the Animal Ethics Committee on the Center of Biomedical Analysis, Tsinghua University. Under approval of Ethics Committee, human adipose tissue was obtained from Department of Plastic Surgery of Peking Union Hospital with informed consent from the patients.\n1. Fabrication of 3D Microcryogels\nDesign and fabrication of microstencil array chips\nUse a commercial software to design arrays of specific geometries, such as circles, ellipses, triangles or clovers14, depending on subsequent application.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to section 2 of the protocol for regenerative medicine and section 3 of protocol for drug screening for design details.\nImport the design into the laser engraving software accompanying the laser engraving machine. Using the laser settings according to the factory recommendations for the laser engraving machine, laser-engrave the imported design onto Poly (methymethacrylate) (PMMA) sheets.\nWash the microstencil array chips with deionized water to clean debris from the laser engraving. Dry the microstencil array chips at 60 °C. Store in a sealed bag at room temperature for months.\nFabrication of microcryogel array chips\nPlace 4 microstencil array chips on the sample tray and insert into the plasma cleaner. Close the door of the cleaner and turn on the vacuum pump for 2 min, then turn on the maximum RF power (18 W) to treat the microstencil array chips in the plasma cleaner for 3 min at room temperature to increase hydrophilicity.\nAdd 0.06 g gelatin to 1 mL deionized water to form 6% (wt/vol) gelatin precursor solution (enough to make 5 chips). Warm at 60 °C in a water bath to dissolve adequately. Incubate on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 3 µL of glutaraldehyde into the gelatin precursor solution to a final concentration of 0.3%. Mix thoroughly.",
    "Pipette 200 µL precursor solution with glutaraldehyde onto the upper surface of the microstencil array chip.\n\t\tNOTE: 200 µL is sufficient for a 75 mm × 25 mm chip regardless of design. Increase the amount proportionally when surface area of chip is increased.\nManually distribute the solution evenly over the chip by scraping back and forth with a bent glass rod 2 to 3 times.\n\t\tNOTE: Each micro-well on the microstencil chip can be filled with precursor solution due to their hydrophilic nature after plasma treatment.\nImmediately place the precursor-solution-filled array chip in a -20 °C freezer for 16 h for cryogelation.\nAdjust the lyophilizer to -40 °C for 30 min. Place the array chips after cryogelation in the lyophilizer and lyophilize the array chips for 2 h in vacuum.\n\t\tNOTE: Gelatin microcryogels with interconnected macropores are formed because ice formed during cryogelation sublimes in the lyophilizer.\nProceed to section 2 for treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) and section 3 for high-throughput drug screening.\n2. Harvesting Individual Microcryogels to Form Injectable 3D Microtissues for Treatment of CLI\nHarvesting individual microcryogels\nDesign arrays (75 mm × 25 mm) of 600 circles, each with 400 µm diameter, in commercial software for injectable 3D microtissue construction. Use PMMA of 300 µm thickness for fabrication of microstencil array chip as detailed in section 1.1.\nFabricate microcryogel array chips as in section 1.2.\nFabricate a PDMS Ejector Pin array with the same design as in step 2.1.1 by standard soft lithography16,17.",
    "Overlay the microcryogel array chip on top of the PDMS Ejector Pin array, aligning each microcryogel with an ejector pin on the array. Press the microcryogel array chip towards the ejector pin array to push the microcryogels out of the microwells with the protruding pins on the PDMS ejector pin array to harvest individual microcryogels.\nHarvest the microcryogel into water and collect them with the aid of cell strainers. Use one strainer to collect microcryogels from one chip (i.e., 600 microcryogels).\nWash microcryogels with 0.1 M NaBH4 on ice for 20 min to quench any uncross-linked aldehyde residue. Use 5 mL of 0.1 M NaBH4 per chip. Discard NaBH4 and wash with 5 mL deionized water for 3 to 5 times, 15 min each time.\nDiscard water from the cell strainer and gather microcryogels into one cluster per cell strainer and place one cluster in one 35-mm Petri dish using a curved tweezer. Add 50 - 70 µL deionized water to each cluster and cover the lid of the Petri dish. Gently tap the Petri dish on the tabletop to level out all microcryogels, so that no microcryogels are lying on top of another microcryogel to form a monolayer of microcryogels on the surface of the Petri dish.\nFreeze the harvested microcryogels at -20 °C for 4 to 16 h before lyophilizing them for 2 h(see step 1.2.7).Store microcryogels in a vacuum at room temperature until further use.\nCharacterization of microcryogels\nEvaluate the pores of the microcryogels by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging.",
    "Immobilize the harvested and lyophilized microcryogels onto a sample holder by double-side adhesive tape and coat with gold with a sputter coater for 90 s, before imaging by SEM11. Evaluate and analyze the distribution of diameters of pores in the microcryogel from seven different SEM images using image analysis software.\nWeigh one cluster of 600 lyophilized microcryogels in a 35-mm Petri dish for the weight of dried gelatin microcryogels (GMs). Add 60 µL deionized water to the cluster of lyophilized microcryogels and wait for 30 s for microcryogels to fully absorb water and swell. Weigh the swollen microcryogels.\n\t\t\nDetermine the equilibrium swelling ratio and porosity of microcryogels, as the ratio of weight of swollen microcryogels to that of dried gelatin microcryogels and the ratio of weight of held water in microcryogels to that of hydrated microcryogels, respectively13.\nMeasure injectability of microcryogels using a programmable syringe pump integrated with a digital force gauge14.\n\t\t\nStain 600 pieces of microcryogels by Trypan blue and suspend in 600 µL 15% gelatin solution to achieve homogeneous distribution. Load 1 mL microcryogel suspension in 1 mL syringe. Inject the mixture through a 27-gauge needle attached to the 1 mL syringe using a programmable syringe pump at flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nMonitor real-time injection force by digital force gauge testing and plot the force-time curve. After injection, observe the integrity of microcryogels under a microscope.\n\t\t\tNOTE: GMs suspended in 15% (wt/vol) gelatin solution can be smoothly injected and remained intact after injection.\nCharacterize the degradability of microcryogels.\n\t\t\nFirst, measure the weight of one cluster of 600 lyophilized microcryogels in a 35-mm Petri dish as the dry weight. Then, immerse 600 lyophilized microcryogels in 2 mL 0.025% (vol/vol) Trypsin/EDTA.",
    "Collect microcryogels from the solution using a cell strainer at different time points (i.e., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 min). Wick away excess solution with a tissue. Measure the weight of microcryogels at different time points and calculate the degradation degree, as the ratio of weight of microcryogel at a certain time point to that of microcryogel at time zero.\nAutoloading of cells into microcryogels to form 3D microtissues\nSterilize microcryogels from step 2.1.8 by ethylene oxide sterilization system with 12 h gas exposure followed by 12 h degassing under vacuum.\nChoose human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) for treatment of mouse ischemic hindlimb. Isolate cells by following procedures as previously reported18.\nCulture hMSCs in the growth medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor bb (PDGF-bb), 1X insulin transferrin selenium (ITS), 10-8 M dexamethasone, 10-4 M ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin in DMEM/F12. Passage the cells at the ratio of 1:3 when confluent. Use cells of passage 3 to 5 in the following experiments.\nHarvest hMSCs with trypsin and quantify the cell number using a Fuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber and resuspend to a density of 8 x 106 cells/mL in hMSCs growth medium.\nPipette 60 µL hMSCs suspension onto the monolayer of 600 microcryogels with diameter of 400 µm in a 35-mm dish from section 2.1. Cells are automatically absorbed into the porous micro-structures of the microcryogels.\nMaintain in a humidified chamber and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h to allow cells to attach. After 2 h of incubation, add 2 mL culture medium. Change the medium every 2 days. Culture hMSCs-loaded microcryogels for 2 days to form 3D microtissues.",
