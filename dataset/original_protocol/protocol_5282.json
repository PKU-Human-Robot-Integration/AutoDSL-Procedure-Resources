    "Place mice in individual cages in a room with controlled temperature (21 ± 1 °C) and humidity (55 ± 10%).Mice are water deprived 24 h before the first day of the protocol. This water deprivation lasts for the full duration of the protocol and mice weight is also controlled (maintained at around 85-90% of original). All animals receive 1-h access to water (using the drinking bottles, Figure 1). The bottle is weighed before and after this period in order to precisely quantify how much the animals drink in each session. This procedure is repeated during three consecutive days as a habituation period.Notes: If a mouse does not drink more than 1 ml in one hour, it is given access to the bottle for one extra hour. This is particularly important the first day when animals are not yet habituated.The position of the bottle is changed every day (right or left, see Figure 2). The height and angle of the bottles is maintained throughout the protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615000634_3526.jpgFigure 2. Position of the bottles. The position of the bottles is changed during the protocol (see Procedure) in order to habituate the mice to drink from both positions. However, bottles must be maintained at the same height and angle throughout the protocol. Note that food is distributed in both sides of the metal grid.Over the following days, conduct the odor-taste pairing phase (preconditioning, Figure 3) in which animals are exposed to 6 odor-taste pairings. Each pairing consists of two days: the first day, animals are given 1-h access to a flavored water-based solution containing a novel taste (either 5% sucrose or 5% maltodextrin; Taste 1, T1) and a novel odorant (0.05 % Banana or 0.01 % Almond; Odor 1, O1) in order to pair T1 with O1.",
    "On day two, animals are given access to a new taste and odor, neither of which has been presented the previous day, i.e., Taste 2 (T2) and Odor 2 (O2).Notes: Any new mouse strain or genetic mouse model must first be tested using 3 odor-taste pairings (instead of 6) in order to establish whether the mouse line in question is apt to present mediated aversion (Busquets-Garcia et al., 2017). In our recent work, control mice (e.g., C57BL6/N) present clear mediated aversion after 3 pairings. However, when the number of training sessions during preconditioning is increased (6 or 9 pairings), animals no longer present mediated aversion. For this reason, we used the 6 pairing protocol to study the acute effects of psychotogenic drugs (Busquets-Garcia et al., 2017). However, when using a new line (e.g., CB1 knockout mice), it must first be established that the animals are able to show mediated aversion with limited training before they are tested in long training protocols. It is likely that certain mouse models will present impaired development of mediated aversion. Indeed, odor-mediated taste learning has long been used as a learning test wherein different genotypes or mouse models present characteristic performances in mediated aversion. The position of the bottles is changed for each pairing (right or left, see Figure 2).The preference for specific odors or tastes has been demonstrated recently (Busquets-Garcia et al., 2017).The odor-taste solutions are prepared anew every 2-3 days and all bottles are thoroughly cleaned at the end of the preconditioning phase to avoid any residual taste persisting into the following session. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615000926_5065.jpgFigure 3.

    "Before preconditioning, all animals receive 1-h access to water during three consecutive days as water habituation. Next, conduct the odor-taste pairings phase, which consists of 6 odor-taste pairings (Busquets-Garcia et al., 2017). Each pairing lasts two days: the first day, animals receive 1-h access to a flavored solution containing a novel taste (T1) and a novel odorant (O1) in order to pair T1 with O1. On day two, animals receive whichever taste and odor have not been presented the previous day, i.e., T2 and O2. On the following days, animals enter the conditioning (or devaluation) phase where either O1 (top) or T1 (bottom) is devaluated. On days 1, 3 and 5 of this phase, animals receive 1-h access to O2 (top) or T2 (bottom) immediately followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline, whereas on days 2, 4 and 6, they receive 1-h access to O1 (top) or T1 (bottom) immediately followed by an i.p. injection of the visceral malaise-inducing drug lithium chloride (LiCl, 0.3 M, 1% b.w.). After this conditioning, animals are given one day for recovery in which they receive water during 1 h. On the next 2 days, mediated and direct aversions are assessed using a 1-h two-choice test (top and bottom). Mediated aversion is evaluated in Test 1 by means of a choice between the mediated CS+ (mCS+: consisting of the taste [top] or odor [bottom] stimulus which has been previously associated with the LiCl-paired CS odor or taste, respectively) and the mediated CS- (mCS-: consisting of the taste [top] or odor [bottom] stimulus which has been previously associated with the saline-paired CS odor or taste, respectively). If, on the same day, researchers are interested to know the effect of a given drug on the mediated aversion test (Busquets-Garcia et al.",
    ", 2017), acute treatments can be performed just before the test. Then, on the second day, direct aversion is evaluated by means of a choice between the conditioned LiCl-paired stimulus (CS+) and the conditioned saline-paired stimulus (CS-).During the following 6 days, animals undergo the devaluation phase (Figure 3) whereby O1 is devaluated to become the conditioned stimulus (CS+). On days 1, 3 and 5 of this phase, animals receive 1-h access to O2 followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline (CS-), whereas on days 2, 4 and 6, they receive 1-h access to O1 immediately followed by an i.p. injection of the emetic agent LiCl (0.3 M, 1% b.w. i.e., 10 ml/kg) (CS+) in order to induce gastric malaise.Notes: To assess taste-mediated odor aversion, the devaluation phase pairing is performed using the tastes. T2 is associated with a saline injection (CS-) whereas T1 is associated with a LiCl injection (CS+).The position of the bottles is changed for each pairing (right or left, see Figure 2). The height and angle of the bottles is maintained throughout the protocol. The LiCl injection is performed just after removal of the bottles. A few minutes after injection, animals are observed to experience dizziness and greatly reduced locomotion.Odor or taste solutions are prepared anew every 2-3 days and all bottles are thoroughly cleaned at the end of this phase. Animals are given one day for recovery in which they receive water for 1 h.Note: The position of the water bottle is opposite that of the last pairing. On the next day, mediated aversion is assessed using a 1-h two-choice test where two different bottles are presented at the same time (Figure 4). Mediated aversion is always evaluated on the first day of tests with a choice between the mCS+ and the mCS-.",
    "The placement of each bottle is counterbalanced to avoid any position bias in task performance. From our experience, control animals with intermediate training (3 pairings) during preconditioning develop mediated aversion. Notably, if the training sessions are increased (6 or 9 pairings), the animals do not present mediated aversion (see Busquets-Garcia et al., 2017 for further information).Notes: To assess taste-mediated odor aversion, this two-choice test is carried out using the two different odor bottles. At the beginning of this test session, a ‘forced sampling’ procedure is used to ensure that the mice sample both fluids. Both bottles are presented: when the mouse has licked one of the bottles, this bottle is removed until the mouse licks the second bottle. When this has happened, the second bottle is also removed. Finally, both bottles are then presented simultaneously. The order of presentation of the bottles during forced sampling is counterbalanced to avoid any order bias. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615001617_8661.jpgFigure 4. Two-choice test. During the two-choice test two bottles (i.e., tastes or odors) are made available for duration of one hour. In order to make the animal aware of the choice, perform a ’forced sampling’ procedure following these steps: (i) both bottles are presented at the same time, (ii) when the animal drink from one bottle this bottle is removed, (iii) time is allowed for the mouse to drink from the remaining bottle, (iv) the second bottle is removed and, finally, (v) both bottles are re-introduced simultaneously, as seen in this image, in order for the two-choice test to be performed.On the second day, direct aversion is evaluated using a two-choice test between the CS+ and CS- with a procedure identical to that described for the mediated aversion test."
