    "All experiments involving animals were pre-approved by the Cleveland Clinic IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee).\n1. Synthesis of Functionalized SWCNTs\nMix 1 mg of SWCNTs, 5 mg of DSPE-PEG2000-Amine, and 5 mL of sterilized nuclease-free water in a glass scintillation vial (20 mL). Shake it well to dissolve all reagents completely.\nSonicate the vial in a water bath sonicator at a power level of 40 W for 1 h at room temperature (RT, 20 min x 3, change the water every 20 min to avoid overheating). Then, centrifuge it at 24,000 x g for 6 h and collect the supernatant solution. This functional SWCNT solution can be stored at 4 °C for 2 months.\nAdd 1 mL of SWCNT solution from step 1.2 to a 100 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter device, followed by 4 mL of sterilized nuclease-free water. Centrifuge for 10 min at 4,000 x g at RT to remove extra DSPE-PEG2000-amine. Repeat the addition of 4 mL of water and the centrifugation 5x. More than 0.5 mL of leftover SWCNT solution will be left in the filter after each centrifugation.\nMeasure the concentration of the SWCNT solution leftover in the filter using a UV/VIS spectrometer at 808 nm after the final wash. The final concentration is typically about 50 mg/L (calculated according to the method developed by Kam et al.18).\nNOTE: Ensure that DSPE-PEG-functionalized SWCNTs are water-soluble after step 1.4 and are stable in different biological solutions without visible aggregation after a few weeks.\n2. Conjugation of Anti-MALAT1 Gapmer DNA Flanked by 2'-O Modified RNAs to Functionalized SWCNT\nAdd 0.5 mg of Sulfo-LC-SPDP into 450 µL of DSPE-PEG2000-amine functionalized SWCNT. Add 50 µL of 10x PBS and then incubate for 2 h at RT.",
    "To remove extra Sulfo-LC-SPDP, add the reaction from step 2.1 to a 100 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter device, followed by 4 mL of nuclease-free water. Centrifuge for 10 min at 4,000 x g at RT. Repeat the addition of 4 mL of water and the centrifugation 5x.\nAdd 200 nM thiol-modified anti-MALAT1-Cy3 gapmer DNA into 1.5 mL of commercial DTT solution and incubate for 90 min at RT. Purify the product with a NAP-5 column, following the manufacturer's protocol. Elute the anti-MALAT1-Cy3 with 500 µL of sterilized nuclease-free 1x PBS.\nNOTE: The functionalized SWCNT can be stored with added DTT, which might cleave disulfide bonds formed during the storage of the thiolated anti-MALAT1 gapmer DNA. The added DTT can be removed by aNAP-5 column before conjugation with SWCNT.\nCollect the sulfo-LC-SPDP-treated DSPE-PEG2000-amine SWCNT solution left in the filter and dilute it with 500 µL of anti-MALAT1-Cy3 solution. Then, incubate it at 4 °C for 24 h. The conjugated SWCNT-anti-MALAT1 can be stored at 4 °C for 3 weeks. Following the same procedure, the conjugated SWCNT with scramble antisense oligo can be synthesized and used as SWCNT-control.\n3. Tail Vein Injection of SWCNT-Anti-MALAT1\nGenerate an MM disseminated mouse model.\nTo achieve the best results of comparison, randomly arrange 14 NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice (8 weeks old) into trial or control groups (seven in each group) with the same male/female ratio.\nClean the operation bench and sterilize it with 70% alcohol.\nUse a heating lamp to warm the mouse to help the tail vein to appear.Restrain the mouse properly with a tail injection restrainer.\nInject 5 x 106 MM.1S-Luc-mCherry cells in 50 µL of PBS through the tail vein without anesthesia. Press the injection site with an alcohol swab for 30 s. Mark the injected mouse and return it to a clean cage.",
    "Start the treatment on day 7 after the MM.1S cell injection.\nInject 50 µL of PBS containing SWCNT-anti-MALAT1 into the tail vein of the mouse. Use PBS containing SWCNT-control as a control.\nPress the injection site with an alcohol swab for 30 s.\nObserve the local bleeding on the tail and the general behavior of the mouse for 1 min, and then return it to a clean cage. Observe all injected mice again before returning the cage to the rack, to make sure that the injections are tolerated well.\nRepeat the injection every 7 days until the termination of the experiment.\nTerminate the experiment when the general health of the mouse degrades: when not eating or drinking, the appearance of pale paws, any subcutaneous bleeding, a shortness of breath, decreased activity, a paralysis of the lower limbs, and/or a touchable mass in the abdomen is observed.\n4. Evaluation of the Disease Progression\nAssess the general status of the mice every day after the MM.1S-Luc-mCherry cell injection. Pay particular attention if the mice develop paralyzes of lower limbs.\nEvaluate the tumor growth using an in vivo imaging system 1x a week, before the SWCNT-anti-MALAT1 injection.\nPrepare fresh 15 mg/mL D-Luciferin with 1x PBS.\nAnesthetize the mice with an isoflurane vaporizer (3–5% for induction and 1–3% for maintenance, depending on the status of the mice).\nInject 150 mg/kg D-Luciferin in each mouse intraperitoneally, 5 min before imaging; then, image the mice in a prone position with an spectrum imaging system.\nCollect sequential images of the mice every 2 min, until luminescence saturation is reached. Adjust the interval time according to the D-Luciferin uptake/signal.\nUse CO2 to sacrifice the mice once the termination of the experiment is reached.\nSince this is an MM disseminated model, process the mice as follows.",
    "Weigh the mouse before dissection.\nCollect peripheral blood from the heart for a complete blood count (CBC) assay performed by a blood cell counter machine. The counts of white blood cells and red blood cells, as well as the ratio of lymphocytes, are the primary indexes.\nIsolate the spleen and weigh it. Calculate the ratio of spleen/body weight; consider >0.5% as spleen enlargement.\nCollect the tissues of bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, kidney, and the tissue with visible metastasis.\nCollect the spine if the mouse developed a paralysis of the lower limbs.\nExtract RNA and protein from the bone marrow samples.\nFix all remaining tissues in formalin.\nFor decalcification, immerse the bone samples in 0.25 M EDTA solution (pH 8.0) for 5 days after 24 h of fixation.\nImmerse all samples in 75% alcohol for long-term storage.\nCompare the signal strength of luciferase at the same time points in two groups. From both groups, record the sacrifice dates of each mouse and calculate the survival curves of the two groups with software.\nNOTE: All procedures are summarized in Figure 1.\nSubscription Required.
