    "Primers and primer designFor the initial PCR, design gene-specific primers in a way that each primer pair is binding at the beginning and end of each ORF and is yielding an in-frame PCR-product. Primer length should be between 16 and 24 nucleotides (nt).Note: For primer design, a Perl script can be generated to design primers using the ORF table information text file and fasta sequence(s) of the reference genome. Calculate the melting temperature of possible primers of different length with MELTTEMP (http://www.biology.wustl.edu/gcg/melttemp.html[href=http://www.biology.wustl.edu/gcg/melttemp.html]).Note: Other software packages or websites could be used instead. However, this software was found to be useful for calculating melting temperatures of many primers required for whole-proteome projects. Choose the best fitting primers within a range of the melting temperatures of either 45 °C-55 °C or 55 °C-65 °C.Note: Primers used in a single microtiter plate should have a similar melting temperature. If no suitable primers are found that represent the very end of an ORF, consider primer sequences that start one or two triplets downstream of the ATG start codon of the gene of interest. Check and calculate the uniqueness and the product length of the primers with fuzznuc (EMBOSS, http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/emboss/apps/fuzznuc.html[href=http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/emboss/apps/fuzznuc.html]).Note: Again, other software packages could be used instead. As before, this package was found to be rather handy in handling a large number of primers. Add the following 15 nt adaptor sequences to all 5’-ends: forward primers: 5’-atgcaccaaacccaa-3’; reverse primers: 5’-cgcactggcatcatc-3’. Primers should be synthesized in 96-well plates for easy handling; we used oligonucleotides produced by the commercial provider biomers.net (Ulm, Germany).",
    "The common primers for the second PCR contain all sequences necessary for transcription and translation [T7 promoter, untranslated region (UTR), ribosome binding site (RBS), start codon (ATG), T7 terminator], fusion peptide tags (N-terminal 6x-His and C-terminal V5 tag) and the sequences complementary to the adaptor sequences common to the gene-specific primers:Forward expression primer: 5’-gaaattaatacgactcactatagggagaccacaacggtttccctctagaaataattttgtttaagaaggagatatacatatgcatcatcatcatcatcatatgcaccaaacccaa-3’Reverse expression primer: 5’-ctggaattcgcccttttattacgtagaatcgagaccgaggagagggttagggataggcttacccgcactggcatcatc-3'Polymerase chain reactionPerform two successive PCRs for each gene. The first PCR amplifies the gene of interest; the second PCR adds the elements needed for generating expression constructs. For the measurement of DNA concentrations, we use the NanoDrop spectrophotometer, since only small volumes are required. However, any other spectrophotometer could be used instead.Note: Concerning the overall reaction, basically all PCR amplifications were successful up to a size of some 3 kb. For larger molecules, the yield varied although the polymerase used was suitable for synthesizing long fragments. The first PCR is performed using genomic bacterial DNA as template.Note: Genomic DNA can be obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), for example. As already mentioned in the background section above, also cDNA made from RNA preparations, existing ORF-libraries or any other molecule type that can be PCR-amplified could be used as templates. Perform all PCR in 96-well PCR-plates–one well per gene–and group the genes based on the gene length and the melting temperatures of the respective primer pair.Use an annealing temperature (TA) that is 2 °C below the average melting temperature of all primers within each 96-well plate.Calculate the elongation time (timeE) as listed in the following table: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128182542_4921.jpgUse a PCR thermal cycler to perform the amplification.Prepare the PCR-mixture for the first PCR as follows: 10.75 µl nuclease-free H2O, 5.0 µl Q5 High-Fidelity buffer, 5.0 µl Q5 High-Fidelity enhancer, 1.0 µl 10 mM gene-specific forward primer, 1.",
    "0 µl 10 mM gene-specific reverse primer, 1.0 µl 10 mM dNTP-mix, 1.0 µl genomic DNA template (2 ng/µl), 0.25 µl Q5 High-Fidelity polymerase.Use the PCR program listed below, followed by storage at 10 °C: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128182600_8814.jpgUse 1 µl PCR-product of the first PCR as the template for the second PCR; perform the second amplification in 96-well PCR-plates as well.Store the remaining PCR-product of the first, gene-specific amplification frozen at -20 °C.Perform the second PCR with the elongation times used for the first PCR.Prepare the PCR-mixture for the second PCR as follows: 33.5 µl nuclease-free H2O, 5.0 µl 10x PCR buffer (with 10 mM MgCl2), 5.0 µl Q-Solution (QIAGEN), 2.0 µl 25 mM MgCl2, 1.0 µl 10 mM dNTP-mix, 1.0 µl 10 µM forward expression primer, 1.0 µl 10 µM reverse expression primer, 1.0 µl DNA template, 0.5 µl Taq DNA-polymerase (QIAGEN).Note: Using a polymerase of low quality could result in incomplete on-chip protein expression and higher background signals at the spots (for example see Figure 1D). Use the following PCR program: initial denaturation: 95 °C for 5 min; denaturation: 94 °C for 30 s; annealing: 52 °C for 30 s; elongation: 72 °C for calculated timeE; final elongation: 72 °C for 10 min. Repeat denaturation, annealing and elongation 35 times.Store the PCR-products as they are in the microtiter plate at -20 °C for long-term storage or at 4 °C for short-term storage.To check the success of all PCRs on a 1.3% agarose gel, dissolve 2.6 g of agarose in 200 ml 1x TAE buffer by heating, add 10 µl peqGreen and pour the gel.Mix 5 µl of each PCR-product with 1 µl of 6x DNA loading dye and load the mixture onto the gel.Load at least one lane with the GeneRuler 1 kb ladder as a size standard.",
    "Run the gel with an electrophoresis power supply system at about 150 V and 500 mA for 30 min.Analyze the gel with UV-light using a gel documentation system.

Dispense with the Nanoplotter 2.4 nl expression mixture directly on top of each spot of a expression construct.Note: Transfer the expression mixture slide by slide. One piezo element of the spotter can produce a maximum of 800 spots using one sample uptake. If necessary, use multiple piezo elements for spotting the expression mixture or multiple sample uptakes per slide.
