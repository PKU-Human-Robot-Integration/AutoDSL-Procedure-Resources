    "HabituationOne day before the experiment, the animals to be tested are individually exposed to the observational chamber (Figure 1a) for 1 h. Reagents preparationThe day of the experiment, prepare the 2.5% formalin solution (see Recipes) (Figure 1b) and the drug to be tested (not shown). Clean all the material needed.Weighing animalsRemove the mouse from the house cage and measure its body weight using a weighing machine (Figure 1c).Administration of the analgesic drugAdminister (i.e., intraperitoneally, i.p.) the analgesic drug to be tested (i.e., raseglurant; Figure 2) or the same volume of vehicle (physiological saline solution) using an insulin syringe (Figure 1d). Note: The amount (400-500 μl) of drug to be administered should be adjusted according to the dose to be tested (i.e., 10 mg/kg of raseglurant) and the mouse body weight (20-25 g). For example, for a mouse of 20 g of weight we will administer (i.p.) 400 μl of a 500 mg/L raseglurant solution in saline. In addition, all animal experimentation should be carried out by a researcher blind to drug treatments. AcclimationThe animal is placed in the observational chamber for 20 min before recording formalin administration (Figure 2). Note: A coloured plastic surface (i.e., black) could be placed below the observational chamber for contrasting the animal’s hair (i.e., CD-1 mice have white hair) (Figure 1e).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128020157_5712.jpgFigure 2. Treatment schedule depicting the administration regimen of drug, formalin and the behavioural testing (phase I and II) Formalin loadingLoad 20 µl of 2.5% formalin solution directly in the 0.3 ml insulin syringe equipped with a 30 G needle.Note: Optionally, the 20 µl of 2.5% formalin solution could be taken with a 2-20 µl micropipette, placed in a 100 µl Eppendorf tube and then load the insulin syringe with.",
    "Formalin administrationTake the animal from the observational cage and place it carefully inside the restrain module (Figure 1f) with the selected (i.e., right) hind paw exposed outside (Figure 3A). Inject slowly the 20 µl of 2.5% formalin solution using the insulin syringe in the mid-plantar surface of the hind paw (Figure 3B).Notes: The needle should be placed in between toes and ankle and inserted beneath the surface of the skin, thus any tissue damage should be avoided.The injection should be done firmly and time-optimized. Animals could perceive the restrain as stressor stimulus and that can increase the variability of the results.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128020804_9416.jpgFigure 3. Hind paw of a restrained mouse (A) and administration of formalin solution (B)Phase I (0-5 min)Return the injected animal to its observational chamber. Set the timer for 5 min and start it to mark the beginning of the phase I (Figure 2). Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period (5 min) (Video 1). Annotate the result.Notes: If a recording system is used, switch on and off the system accordingly.We strongly recommend the investigator to perform some training at this step to familiarize themselves with the licking/biting behavior.Quiescent period (5-15 min)Stop the timer and leave the animal without disturbing it for 10 min (Figure 2). Phase II (15-30 min)Set the timer for 15 min and start it to mark the beginning of the phase II (Figure 2). Use a chronometer to visually measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during this period (15 min) (Video 1). Annotate the result.FinishingReturn the animal to its home cage. Note: If a recording system is used switch off the camera. Check whether the animal needs any special attention or health care (i.e.",
    ", bleeding, extra tissue damage, etc.).CleaningClean all the material used.Note: Repeat the experiment with another animal if required. If a camera is used, visualize the videos and measure the total time the animal spends licking or biting the injected paw during each period (phase I and II) (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
