    "Chemical inhibition of SPPL2a in PBMCs and EBV-B cellsPlate 106 EBV-B cells or PBMCs (both grown in suspension) in triplicate, in culture medium, at a density of 106 cells/ml in a 24-well plate.Immediately after plating, treat one well with 1 μM of DMSO, a second well with 10 μM DAPT (generic gamma secretase inhibitor used as a negative control because it does not inhibit SPPL2a; on delivery, it should be dissolved in DMSO to yield a 100 mM solution, which is then stored at -20 °C, protected against freeze-thaw cycles cycles) and a third one should be treated with a 1 μM solution of the gamma secretase/SPPL inhibitor L-685,458 (stock solution at 1 mM, storage at -20 °C, protected against freeze-thaw cycles).Incubate the cells at 37 °C, under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2, in a tissue culture incubator for 24 h, without shaking.Western-blot analysis of CD74-NTF accumulation in EBV-B cells After treatment, transfer the EBV-B cells into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge them for 5 min at 300 x g at room temperature.Remove the supernatant. Resuspend the EBV-B cells in 2 ml of PBS and centrifuge them again for 5 min at 300 x g at room temperature.Remove the supernatant.Resuspend the EBV-B cells in 30 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer.Vortex for 30 s. Incubate on ice for 20 min.Centrifuge at 18,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Collect the supernatant containing the protein.Assess protein concentration with the BioRad protein assay according to the kit manufacturer’s instructions (BioRad protein assay[href=http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/LIT33.pdf]).Mix 50 μg of protein with a 1/5 volume of 5x Laemmli loading buffer.Incubate for 5 min at 55 °C.",

The signal should become visible after exposure for five minutes.Strip the membrane with WB stripping buffer at room temperature.Block the membrane by incubation for 1 h in blocking buffer at room temperature.Remove the blocking buffer and wash the membrane with TBS-T at room temperature.Incubate the membrane for 1 h, with shaking, with HRP-conjugated anti-GAPDH antibody diluted 1:5,000 in 1% BSA in TBS-T at room temperature.Wash the membrane five times by incubating with TBS-T, for five minutes per wash, on an orbital shaker at room temperature.Develop the membrane with ECL substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions  (PierceTM ECL Western Blotting Substrate[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/32106]).
