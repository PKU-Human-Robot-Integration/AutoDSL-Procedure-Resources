    "1. Prior to Starting Surgical Procedure\nNote: Prior to beginning any animal procedures ensure that you have obtained the appropriate permission through your institution/organization. As with all survival surgeries, make sure that the surgery is performed under sterile conditions and the appropriate pain medication and antibiotics needed are used for a successful outcome.\nPrior to beginning the catheterization procedure evaluate the catheters by flushing them with sterile saline to ensure they are patent.\nAnesthetize the rat.\nPrepare the rat for the surgical procedure.\n\t\nShave the fur from the surgical regions, which include the back of the neck (between the shoulder blades) and the inner leg region.\nUsing Betadine and a 70% ethanol scrub respectively, scrub the shaved surgical regions starting in the center and making a circular sweep outwards. Repeat this 3 times for each region, finishing with a final cleansing with 70% ethanol.\nPlace the animal on a sterile surface and place sterile drape over surgical areas. (The use of Press-n-Seal is an ideal surgical draping allowing the investigator to monitor the animal throughout the procedure.)\nEnsure all surgical tools for the surgical procedure have been sterilized.\n2. Preparation of Surgical Areas for Catheter Placement\nWith the rat laying prone (on its stomach), make approximately a ½ inch (12 mm) horizontal incision on the back of the neck at the level of the shoulder blades with scissors or a scalpel, then blunt dissect a subcutaneous \"pocket\" in the back approximately the size of a quarter. This will be used as an area to place a small amount of tubing that will compensate for animal growth and/or movement, i.e. so that the catheter isn't pulled on and thus removed from the artery it was placed in. (Alternatively this step can be performed immediately prior to tunneling the catheter.)",
    "Place the rat onto its back (supine position) and make an incision in the inguinal area [approximate ½ inch (12 mm) incision along the natural angle of the hind leg.\nBlunt dissect to separate the connective tissue (Figure 1) (can use blunt-tip scissors, hemostats, cotton swabs, etc.) (typically by holding your blunt tipped scissors and/or cotton swabs at a 45 degree angle this ensures the easier localization of the region of interest) until the femoral artery and vein are exposed.\n\t\nThe vein is dark red in color and the artery is clearer and brighter than the vein. The nerve that runs along the artery is whitish in tone.\nBlunt dissect in the leg region to make a small open region below the skin (i.e. pocket, approximately the size of a quarter) along the inside of the leg for placement of a small section of the catheter (again to take into account animal movement and growth of the animal if chronic placement).\nPlace the retractors into the incision area so that you can fully view the artery and vein.\nUsing fine tip forceps gently separate the nerve (whitish in color) that is along the femoral artery away from the artery and vein. (Figure 2) Be careful to not cut or damage the nerve.\nSeparate the artery and vein as one unit, trying to expose an approximately ¼ inch (5-7 mm) length section of artery/vein.",
    "Repeat the process in separating the vein from the artery. Keep your surgical instruments (i.e. fine tip forceps) perpendicular to the vessels and separate the vessels in parallel. This assists in avoiding tearing, pricking or damaging the vessels. By placing the fine tip forceps gently between the artery and vein from underneath and slowly opening the forceps and repeating this, you will slowly separate the vessels. Note: if you do tear or observe some bleeding use a sterile cotton swab and/or 2 x 2 gauze and place pressure on the area until the bleeding has stopped, then continue with the surgery.\n3. Tunneling the Catheter\nPlace sterile saline soaked 2 x 2 gauze over the incision and turn the animal to its stomach.\nPlace the Rochester Pean forceps (long straight forceps) into the incision on the back that was made previously and guide the forceps subcutaneously down the back to the level of the hips [ensure the tips of the hemostats are pointed up, (not towards the spine) to avoid injuring the spinal cord]. At approximately the hip region turn the hemostat tip towards the incision that was made in the leg region and push the tip of the hemostats out of the prepared leg incision.\nGently grasp the end of the catheters (not the end that will be inserted into the artery/vein) with the forceps and gently pull the catheters through the cavity that was made and ultimately out the neck incision.",
    "Place the appropriate blunted-tip needle syringe filled with 20 U/ml Heparin/saline on the end of the respective catheters and fill the catheters (ensure that there are no air bubbles) with the heparinized/saline. Once again check that the catheters are patent and no damage has come to the catheters. Leave the syringes attached to the end of the catheter lines to ensure no air is able to get into the catheter lines and turn the rat onto its back once again.\n4. Inserting the Catheters into the Femoral Vein and Artery (Figure 3)\nPlace a folded piece of sterile 4.0 silk/thread under the femoral vein and then cut the silk at the folded end. There will now be two pieces of silk under the vein. Or alternatively, place 2 pieces of 4.0 silk under the vein individually.\nSeparate the silk that you placed under the vein, one piece towards the leg (distal end) and the other towards the body. Tie a loose ligature on the side closest to the body, then using small hemostats, grasp the silk and pull taught but do not tighten the knot. Pull the other piece of silk as far as possible towards the leg (distal end) and tie this into a triple knot, grasp the silk with small hemostats and pull taught. This method will allow the vein to fill with blood, making it easier to make the the incision that is required for inserting the catheter (step 4).\nPlace 1-2 drops of lidocaine onto the vein.\nUsing the Vanna micro-dissecting scissors, make a small incision in the vein approximately ¼ thru and at a 45 degree angle.",
    "Place fine-tipped forceps (45 forceps) into the incision and using another pair of forceps; carefully feed in the vein catheter. Gently open the forceps that are placed into the vein, as this will allow the researcher to gently place the venous catheter under the forceps and into the vein.\nWhen the catheter is fully inserted (approx. 6-7 cm) (when making the catheter a mark is placed on the catheter to assist the surgeon in identifying when the catheter is fully inserted) (this places the venous catheter in the abdominal vena cava), tighten the anterior ligature around the vein and catheter, tying a triple knot (ensure that it isn't occluding the vein). Use the silk suture near the leg (posterior ligature) to again secure the catheter (triple knot) and ensure placement. Slowly draw back the syringe until there is a little blood visible in the catheter, which helps to ensure that the suture knots are not too tight and that the catheter is functional. After checking, depress the plunger until the blood is no longer visible in the catheter.\n\tNote: it is possible to insert 2 catheters into the femoral vein if needed.\nRepeat steps 9-13 to place a femoral artery catheter with the following exceptions:\n\t\nTie the silk nearest to the leg (posterior) with a triple knot and pull taught before tying the loose ligature near the body (anterior) prior to making the incision for the catheter placement. This will allow the artery to fill with blood making it easier to cut. Ensure the proximal suture is pulled taught to occlude the artery prior to cutting the artery. This will avoid blood loss when the cut is made.\nInsert the arterial catheter approximately 5 cm from the femoral artery (this places the catheter in the abdominal aorta).",
    "When securing the catheter with the suture, make sure the suture is not too tight and occluding the catheter.\n5. Surgical Wrap-up\nMake a dime to quarter sized loop in the catheters and place on the inside of the leg (the loop should fit in the area that was blunt dissected earlier). After placing both catheters, secure them with 1-2 stitches of 5.0 surgical suture into the muscle layer.\nClose the incision with 4.0 Ethilon with non-continuous sutures.\nTurn the rat onto its stomach and make another loop in the catheters about the size of a quarter and place in the pocket dissected in the back. Close the incision with suture.\nUsing a drop of vetbond, secure the catheters in the back.\nClamp the catheters near the back incision with padded hemostats and remove the syringes from the ends.\nFit the rat with a tether-type jacket, cap the catheters (to maintain the heparin lock), and remove the padded hemostats.\n--For long-term maintenance replace catheter saline solution with 20 U/ml heparin/saline.\n6. Maintenance of Catheter (Sterile gloves should be worn during procedure)\nClamp the catheter with padded forceps.\nRemove the catheter plug.\nPlace a blunt tipped syringe with lock solution onto the catheter.\nUnclamp the forceps.\nFill the catheter with the lock solution (volume is pre-determined-typically 0.3 ml).\nClamp the catheter while flushing to prevent any backflow of blood into the catheter tip and remove the syringe.\nReplace the catheter plug.\nUnclamp the forceps and gently push the plug in slightly to ensure no blood is in the tip of the catheter.\n7. Blood Sampling (Sterile gloves should be worn during procedure)\nClamp the catheter with padded forceps.\nRemove the catheter plug.\nSlowly withdraw lock solution using a blunt tipped syringe and discard.",
    "Attach sampling syringe to the catheter and slowly withdraw the sample.\nClamp the catheter with padded forceps and place a syringe with lock solution onto the catheter and re-fill the catheter with the lock solution.\nClamp the catheter while re-filling the catheter with the solution.\nRe-insert the catheter plug.\nRemove the padded forceps and gently push the plug in slightly further.\n8. Drug Infusion\nClamp the catheter with padded forceps.\nRemove the catheter plug.\nSlowly withdraw lock solution using a blunt tipped syringe and discard.\nAttach drug filled syringe to the catheter and infuse the substance into the animal.\n\t\none can use a 3 way stopcock as well as an intermediate if multiple injections are required, thus requiring less fluid infusion into the animal.\none can also attach a constant infusion syringe pump with a sterile filter for continuous infusions.\nClamp with padded forceps and place a syringe with lock solution onto the catheter and re-fill the catheter with the lock solution.\nClamp the catheter while re-filling the catheter with the solution.\nRe-insert the catheter plug.\nRemove the padded forceps and gently push the plug in slightly further.\n9. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Sampling\nClamp the arterial catheter with padded forceps and remove the catheter plug.\nAttach the arterial line to the pressure transducer.\nFollow manufacture instructions for using the software for the blood pressure collection.\nAt the conclusion of the blood pressure monitoring period, using padded forceps clamp the catheter and disconnect from the transducer.\nFlush the catheter with the lock solution and replace the catheter plug as described above.\n10. Representative Results",
    "A representative blood pressure measure was taken from a conscious freely moving animal and is presented in Figure 4. Phenylephrine (3 ug/kg, iv), an alpha 1 adrenergic receptor agonist, was administered into the femoral vein line to increase blood pressure, while simultaneously measuring blood pressure from the femoral arterial line. Phentolamine (4 mg/kg, iv), a nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist, was then administered to lower blood pressure.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3496/3496fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Blunt dissection of tissue. With the rat on his back, you will have made approximately a ½ inch (12 mm) incision on the angle of the hind leg and using blunt scissors or hemostats you will blunt dissect the connective tissue to expose the femoral artery and vein.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3496/3496fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
