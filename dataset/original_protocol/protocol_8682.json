    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Regierungspraesidium Tübingen, State of Baden-Württemberg, Germany, and by the Austrian Animal Experimentation Ethics Board, and were in accordance with the EU directive on the use of animals in research.\n1. Stereotactic Injections of AAV-Channelrhodopsin2-YFP\nNOTE: Stereotactic injections were carried out according to a previously published protocol 20.\nPrepare sterile tools by heating them at 180 ºC for 1.5 hr.\nPull sharp (~50 µm diameter) glass pipettes for injections using a horizontal microelectrode puller set with the following parameters: Heat = Ramp value - 20, Pull = 0, Velocity = 100, Time = 200, Pressure = 200.\n\tNOTE: Ramp value needs to be determined for each lot of purchased glass pipettes according to the instructions provided by the micropipette puller manufacturer.\nPremix 1 µl of virus solution and 0.2 µl of 0.1% fast green solution (for better visibility of the solution in the glass pipette) in sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS; 25 mM, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Fill the glass pipette by using a 10 µl pipette and gel-fil tips. For the viral construct, use rAAV-hSyn-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP (serotype 2/9).\nAnesthetize mouse using a small animal anesthesia device (3% isoflurane in oxygen for induction). Use. For this study, use 3 wild-type mice aged ~6 weeks.\nShave head between ears and eyes and disinfect with a povidone-iodine based solution.\nApply an eye ointment to prevent drying of eyes during anesthesia. Subcutaneously inject mouse with analgesic (meloxicam-based, 0.1 ml of a 5 mg/ml solution).\nPlace mouse in stereotactic frame and maintain anesthesia via a gas anesthesia device (2% isoflurane in oxygen for maintenance). Check anesthesia depth by lack of a limb withdrawal reflex before continuing.\nMaintain sterile conditions as best as possible during the entire surgical procedure. Wear a disposable face-mask, a surgical gown and gloves.",
    "Make a skin incision of approximately 1 cm on top of the head using scissors 20. Gently pull skin to the side using blunt forceps, fix with clamps to expose skull surface and clean skull with H2O2.\nMark injection sites on the skull using a fine tip permanent marker. Drill a small hole (approximately 1 mm in diameter) into the skull at the marked site. For unilateral PIN/MGn injection in this stud, use the following coordinates: from bregma (mm): posterior 3.0, lateral ±1.8, ventral 3.8.\nMount filled glass pipette onto stereotactic frame connected to a pressure injection device and bring the pipette to bregma position.\nBreak off the tip of the glass pipette using fine straight tip forceps. Make sure the pipette tip is open by applying a few pressure pulses and observing extrusion of drops of virus solution.\nGo to the desired injection coordinates and inject half of the pipette content (~0.5 µl) using the following settings on the pressure injection device: pressure 20 psi, average pulse length 30 ms, average number of pulses 50.\nLeave pipette in place for ~1 min before slowly (1 mm/min) retracting it.\nClean skull with PBS (pH 7.4) and remove clamps. Gently pull the skin together, and suture the incision (3 - 4 knots). Apply disinfectant (povidone-iodine based) around the wound.\nStop the anesthesia and do not leave the mouse unattended until fully awake. Keep mice single-housed. Postoperatively, continue to monitor the health status; if necessary administer analgesic.\nKeep animals for 4 weeks before brain fixation to ensure appropriate levels of viral expression.\n2. Specimen Preparation\nBrain fixation\nPreparation of the fixative\nFor 1 L of fixative, weigh 10 g of paraformaldehyde and add it to 300 ml of deionized H2O. Heat to 55 - 60 ºC for ~10 min with continuous stirring.",
    "Switch off the heat and add 7 - 8 drops of 4 N NaOH. The solution should become clear in ~10 min.\nLet it cool down to RT, add 150 ml of a saturated solution of Picric acid and bring it to 500 ml with deionized H2O.\nAdd 500 ml of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (PB). Filter with filter paper. Adjust pH to 7.4 with NaOH.\nCool the fixative to 6 ºC, store it in dark glass bottles for not more than one day at 6 ºC.\nTranscardiac perfusion\nAnesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal injection of thiopental (120 mg/kg body weight). Make sure the animal is deeply anesthetized by checking the pedal withdrawal reflex, which should be absent. Place the animal on its back on a perfusion table with the four extremities tied down.\nOpen the abdominal wall longitudinally with blunt-end scissors and make two additional cuts laterally along the caudal border of the rib cage, to expose the diaphragm. Cut away the diaphragm and cut the thoracic wall at the osteocartilageneous border on both sides. Lift the caudal end of the central slab of thoracic wall containing the sternum to expose the heart.\nRemove the pericardium, make a small precise cut in the tip of the left ventricle to admit the cannula of the perfusion apparatus. Use a blunt cannula with an internal diameter of 0.6 mm. Pass the cannula gently through the ventricle till the tip appears into the ascending aorta and secure the cannula with a clamp. To allow the blood and perfusates to exit from the blood stream, make a cut in the right atrium.",
    "Perfuse mice transcardially using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 5 ml/min at first with PBS (25 mM, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) for approximately 1 min, followed by ice-chilled fixative for 7 min.\nAfter fixation, sever the mouse head with a pair of scissors and then cut the skin through the midline from neck to nose. Remove the muscle to fully expose the skull.\nUsing sharp scissors, make a longitudinal cut through the occipital and interparietal bones starting from the foramen magnum. Using fine tweezers remove these bones to expose the whole cerebellum. Then make another longitudinal cut through the parietal and frontal bones till the nasal bone and remove them with tweezers to expose the whole brain.\nUsing a spatula remove the brain without damaging it, and place it in ice-cold 0.1 M PB.\nSectioning and trimming of the specimens\nCut a coronal block of approximately 5 - 6 mm with razor blades containing the area of interest. Glue it onto the holder of the vibroslicer with a cyanoacrylate glue. Orient the tissue block so that the neocortex faces the vibrating blade. Slice coronal sections, containing the amygdala, at 140 µm with the vibroslicer (Figure 1A) in ice-cold 0.1 M PB, and collect them in a 6-well dish in the same buffer.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, trim out the region of interest (here, the medio-dorsal paracapsular cluster of the ITC, see Figure 1B) from the slice. Do this in a Petri dish coated with silicone elastomer and filled with 0.1 M PB, using an ophthalmic scalpel. Make sure that the trimmed blocks fit into the hole of the spacer (approximately 1.5 mm) (Figure 1B).\nMove the trimmed blocks into cryoprotection solution (30% glycerol in 0.1 M PB) O/N at 6 ºC.\n3. High Pressure Freezing",
    "NOTE: The FRIL consists of 6 essential steps (Figure 2): 1) Rapid freezing with high pressure (at 2,300 - 2,600 bar) of the specimen. 2) Fracturing of the specimen. The fracture plane generally follows the central hydrophobic core of frozen membranes, splitting them into two half-membrane leaflets: a half that lies adjacent to the protoplasm (P-face) and a half that lies adjacent to the extracellular or exoplasmic space (E-face). 3) Replication of the specimen by vacuum-deposition of platinum and carbon. 4) Detergent-digestion of the tissue. 5) Immunogold labeling. 6) Analysis of the replica using a transmission electron microscope.\nPreparation of copper carriers\n\tNOTE: To be handled through the successive stages of the FRIL procedure, specimens need to be mounted onto metal (gold or copper) carriers. These carriers vary in size and design according to the mode of fracturing and type of machines used. Here we used copper carriers (Figure 1B,E) and a hinged \"double replica table\" (see Figure 3B), which when opened produces a tensile fracture through the frozen specimen (Figure 2). This allows to retain and replicate both sides of the fractured specimen.\n\t\nPolish copper carriers with a tarnish remover using a sheet of chamois skin.\nPlace carriers in a glass pot and clean twice with a non-ionic detergent (pH ~1.5) in a sonicating water bath, then extensively wash in tap water followed by deionized water and then rinse twice with ethanol.\nSonicate the copper carriers in acetone for 15 min.\nPlace the carriers on filter paper to dry.\nAttach a ring of double-sided tape to a copper carrier (Figure 1C), which will serve as the holding well for the trimmed block (holding carrier).\nFreezing of the specimen\n\tNOTE: Handle liquid nitrogen with care and wearing appropriate goggles.",
    "Turn on the high pressure freezing unit (Figure 1F) at least 1.5 hr before starting with the specimen freezing.\nStart heating by pressing the \"AIR HEATER\" button, and bake out for 50 min. Set air temperature to 80 °C.\nConnect the nitrogen tank to the high pressure freezing unit and press the \"NITROGEN\" button to fill the inside Dewar with liquid nitrogen. The \"NITROGEN LEVEL\" lamp lights up. Start cooling by pressing the \"Cooling\" button.\nPress the \"DRIVE IN\" button when the \"NITROGEN LEVEL\" goes out. Check that the hydraulic system moves the piston back and forth 3 times.\nPress the \"AUTO\" button, and the \"NITROGEN\" button. As soon as \"READY\" lights up, the high pressure freezing unit is ready for high pressure freezing.\nPlace a trimmed block in the hole of the double-sided tape (Figure 1B) using a platinum wire loop which has been melted into a glass pipette.\nRemove the excess of the cryoprotectant solution using filter paper or a brush.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure is also important to remove air bubbles that may form around the tissue and which could cause distortion of the tissue shape and/or ultrastructure.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, cover the holding carrier with another carrier, so that the tissue block is sandwiched between the two carriers.\nInsert the carrier-sandwich into the specimen holder of the high pressure freezing unit (Figure 1D). Insert the specimen holder into the high pressure freezing unit (tip down) and secure it by screwing in the specimen holder.\nInitiate the freezing cycle by pressing the \"Jet-Auto\" button. Working as quickly as possible, remove the specimen holder and submerge the tip with liquid nitrogen into an insulated box. Immerse the tips of two pairs of forceps in the liquid nitrogen to cool them.",
    "Carefully remove the carrier-sandwich from the specimen holder and place it in a pre-chilled cryovial. Make sure that the carriers are only handled with liquid nitrogen-cooled forceps. Cryovials should be perforated to allow the nitrogen to flow out from the vial (Figure 1G).\nRepeat steps 3.2.6 to 3.2.11 until all desired samples have been frozen. Multiple carrier-sandwiches containing the same type of sample can be stored in the same vial.\nStore the cryovials containing the carriers in a cryotank until replication (Figure 1H).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53853/53853fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Freeze-fracture and Replication\nPreparation of the electron beam guns",
    "Before inserting the electron beam guns, remove the shield with the \"deflector plate\". Place the \"setting gauge\" for centering the filament into the collet chuck through the lower cathode cover.\n\t\tNOTE: The larger diameter end of the setting gauge is used for the carbon gun whereas the smaller diameter end is for the platinum gun.\nSlide the new filament over the gauge until \"the pressure laminae\" can clamp the ends of the filament, ensuring that the filament coil does not lie at an angle.\nRemove the setting gauge and insert the carbon rod. Fix it by tightening the collet chuck of the evaporator rod holder, ensuring that the height of the end of the rod is at the middle of the second coil from the bottom. For the platinum gun, the height of the end of the platinum rod should be at the middle of the second filament coil from the top.\nReplace the deflector plate and insert guns into the freeze fracture unit. Clean the guns with a sand-blaster after usage.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53853/53853fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration of the Key Steps of the FRIL Technique.",
    "Outline of the different steps required for preparation and analysis of replica. (1) High pressure freezing of tissue. (2) Fracturing. During fracturing of frozen tissue, the lipid bilayer of plasma membranes is split into two halves at the hydrophobic interface. Proteins in the plasma membrane are allocated onto either the exoplasmic (E-face) or protoplasmic membranes (P-face). (3) Replication. The evaporation of carbon (C) traps lipids and proteins on the surface of the fractured tissue. The material is coated with 2 nm platinum/carbon for shadowing at a 60° angle, and then with another 15 nm carbon layer which strengthens the structure of the replica (C-layer, Pt-shadowing). (4) Solubilization. The tissue not trapped by the replica membrane is then solubilized with SDS-solution. (5) Labeling. Proteins of interest can be visualized on replica using a complex made of specific primary antibodies (Primary Ab) and secondary antibodies (Secondary Ab) conjugated with a gold particle (Au). The use of different sizes of gold particles allows detection of more than one protein on the same replica. (6) After immunolabeling, replicas are collected onto copper mesh grids and analyzed with a transmission electron microscope at 80 - 100 kV.

For a detailed description of the freeze-fracture and replication procedures, see operating instructions provided by the manufacturer.\nPrior to cooling the freeze-fracture device, bake out the entire cooling system of the unit with warm air. Press the \"Thawing\" button in the MTC 010 device (temperature control unit) (Figure 3A) and let the bake out process run for 45 min.\nActivate the vacuum station. The freeze fracture unit usually operates in a vacuum range of ~10-6 - 10-7 mbar.",
    "Fill nitrogen tank and connect it to the freeze fracture unit. Check that the valve holder is dry and also clean the entry of the tank before insertion of the valve holder (humidity can interfere with vacuum and indication of N2 filling of the tank).\nStart cooling by setting the temperature to -115 °C. Cooling takes about 45 min.\nInsert the electron beam guns and adjust current and voltage to reach the following parameters for evaporation:\n\t\tCarbon gun: rotation on, position 90°, rate of carbon accumulation 0.1 - 0.2 nm/sec\n\t\tCarbon-platinum gun: rotation off, position 60°, rate of accumulation 0.06 - 0.1 nm/sec\n\t\tNOTE: If a gun is used for the first time after exchange of the carbon or platinum rod, degas for 3 min before usage.\nFracturing and replication\nInsert frozen carrier-sandwiches into double replica table making sure all manipulations are done in liquid nitrogen.\nTransfer double replica table to a Dewar vessel and fix it to the specimen stage receiver at an angle of 45°. The liquid nitrogen level should always be above the double replica table.\nPick up the double replica table with the table manipulator and insert it into the freeze fracture unit onto the cold stage. Wait approximately 20 min to allow the temperature of the double replica table to adjust to -115 °C.\nCheck that the vacuum is below 10-6 mbar and the temperature is -115 °C.\nFracture the tissue by manual counter clockwise rotation of the wheel connected to the shroud placed above the double replica table. When the shroud turns, it forces the double replica table to open, fracturing the tissue.\nPress the \"High tension\" button in the EVM 030 device (electron beam evaporation control unit) of the freeze fracture unit (Figure 3A).",
    "Replicate the exposed surfaces of the fractured tissue (Figure 3C) by evaporation of carbon (rotating) by means of an electron beam gun positioned at a 90° angle to a thickness of 5 nm, followed by a unidirectional shadowing with platinum-carbon at a 60° angle to a thickness of 2 nm. Finally, apply a 15 nm thick layer of carbon from a 90° angle (rotating).\nUse the following parameters for evaporation:\n\t\t1st carbon: rotation on, position 90°; speed 0.1 - 0.2 nm/sec; 5 nm\n\t\t2nd carbon-platinum: position 60°; speed 0.06 - 0.1 nm/sec; 2 nm\n\t\t3rd carbon: rotation on, position 90°; speed 0.3 - 0.5 nm/sec; 15 nm\nRemove the replicated specimens from the freeze fracture unit and transfer them to a ceramic 12-well plate (Figure 4A) filled with TBS (Tris buffered saline, pH 7.4).\nUsing a platinum loop wire rod, remove the replicated tissue from the specimen carrier (Figure 4A).\nRepeat steps 4.3.1 to 4.3.10 until all samples have been replicated.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53853/53853fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Digest for 18 hr at 80 °C with shaking (45 stroke/min).\nTransfer replicas to a new tube filled with SDS-digestion buffer and store at RT.\n5. Immunolabeling\nNOTE: All incubations are performed at RT with gentle shaking, except for incubations with antibodies.\nWash the replica for 10 min in fresh SDS-digestion buffer.\nWash the replica once with 2.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in TBS for 5 min, and then 3 x 10 min with 0.1% BSA in TBS.\nBlock non-specific binding sites in TBS with 5% BSA for 1 hr.\nApply primary antibodies diluted in 2% BSA-TBS. Perform incubations in a 30 µl drop (Figure 4B) in a humid chamber at 15 °C for 72 hr (Figure 4C).",
    "For this study, process both replicas from the fractured tissue. Incubate one replica with a guinea pig polyclonal antibody raised against the amino acids 717 - 754 of the mouse GluR1 common to all AMPA-R subunits (dilution: 1:200) or a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against a recombinant fusion protein covering amino acids 660 - 811 of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA-R (dilution: 1:500), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the green fluorescent protein (dilution: 1:300).\nIncubate the other replica with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 384 - 398 of the rat µ-opioid receptor (dilution: 1:500).\nWash in TBS with 0.05% BSA (3 x 5 min.).\nApply secondary antibodies. For this study use gold (5 nm for ionotropic glutamate receptors, 10 for µ-opioid receptors and/or 15 nm for ChR2-YFP) conjugated antibodies diluted in TBS with 2% BSA. Dilute secondary antibodies 1:30 and incubate in a 30 µl drop at 15 °C O/N.\nWash 3 x 5 min in 0.05% BSA-TBS at RT.\nWash 2 x 5 min in ultrapure water.\nMount replica on formvar-coated 100-line parallel bar grid (Figure 4D).\n6. Replica Analysis\nImage replicas with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 80 or 100 kV. Acquire digital images through a CCD (charged coupled device) camera.\nOffline, find corresponding regions on images from both replicas using landmarks (Figure 4E). Analyze digital images using Image J. Determine postsynaptic area and the number of immunogold-labeled particles directed against the receptor analyzed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53853/53853fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
