    "Obtaining the bile from patients by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) requires the approval of a human subjects study protocol by the Institutional Review Board. All work presented here was approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board.\n1. Exosome Isolation from Bile\nPerform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Place the patient in the supine position and intubate.\n\t\nPass a duodenoscope through the mouth of the patient and insert it into the second part of the duodenum and identify the major papilla.\nSelectively cannulate the common bile duct by inserting a triple lumen sphincterotome pre-loaded with a 0.035 inch (0.9 mm) hydrophilic guidewire.\nAdvance the guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance to the left hepatic duct since on occasion it can be difficult to differentiate the cystic duct from the right hepatic duct, then advance the sphincterotome 5 cm into the bile duct to acquire a stable position.\nRemove the guidewire, attach a 10 ml syringe to the guidewire port through the Luer lock and aspirate the bile using 10 ml of negative pressure.\nRemove the syringe containing the bile to proceed with the ERCP by reinserting the guidewire and injecting contrast agent through the injection port to opacify the biliary tree.\nTransfer the collected bile into a 15 ml tube on ice and keep on ice until ready to proceed with the centrifugation step.\n\t\tCaution: Wear gloves to protect yourself and the samples! Treat the bile as a potential source of infection as it can contain Hepatitis A viral particles!\nKeep the sample(s) on ice. Either proceed with step 1.2 or centrifuge at 500 x g at 4 °C for 10 min and then freeze at -80 °C until further use.\n\t\tNote: Samples stored this way for several years have routinely been used with good results19.",
    "Transfer 400 µl of bile into a microcentrifuge tube and collect cells and cell debris by centrifugation at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant by pipetting, transfer to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge the sample(s) at 16,500 x g for another 20 min at 4 °C to clear the supernatant of further debris. Discard the tubes in the biohazard waste. Alternatively, spin the samples in an ultracentrifuge instead.\nCollect the supernatant and filter it in a biosafety cabinet with a syringe through a 0.2 µm polyethersulfone (PES) membrane filter which has good flow rates and low protein binding to remove any particles larger than 200 nm left.\nPipet the filtered supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes and add PBS so that the tubes are more than 2/3 full. If the tubes contain less liquid than that, the tubes will collapse during centrifugation! Tubes can be washed, autoclaved and reused several times.\nPellet the exosomes through ultracentrifugation at 120,000 x g for 70 min at 4 °C. After the centrifugation look at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube to sometimes see small yellow pellets; these are the exosomes.\nDiscard the supernatant by carefully decanting it and disinfect the waste by adding bleach to a final concentration of 10% v/v and let it stand for 20 min.\nFor downstream experiments, either process the pellet(s) in a small volume of the appropriate solution (i.e., radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer for protein isolation, RNA lysis buffer for miR isolation) or resuspend it in 50-150 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) which can be either stored at -80 °C for future use (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or protein extraction etc.) or used for characterization of the exosome preparation by TEM or nanoparticle optical analysis.",
    "2. Exosome Identification by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) or CryoEM\nResuspend extracellular vesicles in 100 µl of PBS by pipetting. Ideally, use exosomes that have not been stored at -20 °C or -80 °C, especially when performing the isolation for the first time.\nAdsorb a 20 µl aliquot (about 2 µg) to 400 mesh carbon-coated Parlodion copper grids for 2 min and allow to dry at RT.\nFix the exosome in 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (EM-grade) for 5 min at RT by placing drops carefully on the dried preparation.\nWash the grids twice with water for 5 min and then contrast stain EVs with 1% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) for 30 sec.\nAcquire images with an electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 80 kilovolts starting at magnifications of 20,000X and increasing to 100,000X when determining the size of the particles.\n\tNote: Other preps like layering onto Formvar carbon-coated 200 mesh copper or nickel grids and contrast staining like 1% or 2% uranyl acetate for 10-15 min are also possible.\nFor CryoEM, mix a 20 µl aliquot (about 2 µg) with 60 µl Protein G gold 10 nm (1:3 ratio). This will help to determine the exosome diameter.\nTransfer the samples onto glow-discharged C-flat holey carbon grids and remove excess liquid by blotting. Freeze the grids by dipping them immediately into liquid ethane.\nMount the grids in a cryoholder in liquid nitrogen.\nAcquire the images at 200 kV with magnifications of 20,000X and 100,000X.\n3. Exosome Identification by Multi-parameter Nanoparticle Optical Analysis\nResuspend the isolated exosomes in 100 µl of PBS by pipetting.\nDilute exosomes in 600 µl PBS at several different ratios (like 1:50, 1:100, 1:300, 1:600 and 1:1,200).\nVisualize the exosomes by laser light scattering with the appropriate instrument and software in real-time according to manufacturer's protocol20.",
    "Increase the level of the camera in capture mode until particles become visible, then adjust the focus to make the particles look smooth.\nWhile in standard mode, decrease the camera to the lowest level that the particles can still be seen, if necessary adjust camera shutter and gain to achieve this.\nVisually check to ensure 20-100 particles are visible on the screen, if not flush the unit and adjust the dilution in PBS.\nThen adjust the capture duration to between 30-60 sec. After the video is captured, adjust the processing parameters until all particles are identified on the screen and process the video file.\n4. Exosome Characterization by Western Blot\nLyse exosome pellets from 2-5 ml of bile in 100 µl of ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with a protease inhibitor by pipetting up and down thoroughly and mix lysates vigorously for 30 sec on a vortex to solubilize the proteins effectively.\nWhile most of the time not necessary, use pulse-sonication of the samples on ice with 2 pulses for 10 sec each to ensure full lysis.\nPellet insoluble material by centrifugation at 15,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and transfer supernatant to a clean tube.\nDetermine the protein concentration with a method of choice (i.e., bicinchoninic acid (BCA), Coomassie, modified Lowry, 660 nm Protein Assay, etc.) according to manufacturer's protocol. The method is not as important as long as the same method is used consistently to achieve results that can be compared across experiments.\nLoad 50 µg of protein per sample in Laemmli buffer after heating the sample at 95 °C for 5 min into a well of a polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis (PAGE).\nElectrophorese the samples on the PAGE gels for 1.5 hr and transfer the separated proteins on to a nylon membrane.",
    "Block the membrane(s) with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 hr, then incubate with exosome-specific antibodies like anti-CD63 and anti-TSG-101 at a dilution of 1:500 preferably O/N at 4 °C.\nWash the membranes with TBS-T 3 x 10 min, then incubate with an appropriate, matching HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T for 1-2 hr at RT.\nWash the membrane(s) 3 x 5 min with TBS-T and detect the specific proteins with chemiluminescence reagents according to manufacturer's protocol.\nImage the membranes with film or a digital imaging system according to manufacturer's protocol.\n5. MicroRNA Isolation from the Isolated Exosomes\nNote: Isolation of miRNA from bile exosomes is carried out using a modified miRNA isolation based on a commercially available kit, but any other RNA isolation method can be used or adapted.\nAdd 300 µl lysis/building buffer to the exosome pellet (isolated from 400 µl bile), vortex, pipet or pass through a needle/syringe to completely lyse the exosomes to obtain a homogenous lysate.\nAdd 1/10 (30 µl) volume of miRNA Homogenate Additive, and mix well by vortexing or inverting the tube several time.\nIncubate the mix for 10 min on ice.\nAdd a volume of acid-phenol:chloroform equal to the initial homogenate (300 µl).\nAdd 5 µl of 5 fmol/µl cel-miR 39 and vortex for 30-60 sec.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 10,000 x g at RT to separate the aqueous (upper) and organic (lower) phases.\nCarefully aspirate the upper phase by pipetting and transfer to a fresh tube while noting the volume transferred. Discard the organic phase in the appropriate organic waste container.\nTo enrich for small RNAs add 1/3 volume of 100% ethanol to the recovered aqueous phase and mix by thoroughly vortexing or inverting the tube several times.",
    "Pipet the lysate/ethanol mixture onto the filter cartridge, up to 700 µl at a time.\nCentrifuge the cartridges for 15 sec at a maximum of 10,000 x g or apply vacuum to pass the mixture through the filter.\nCollect the filtrate and if the lysate/ethanol mixture exceeds 700 µl, transfer the flow-through to a fresh tube and repeat the procedure to collect all the filtrates. These filter contains RNA fractions devoid of small RNAs and can be used to recover these larger RNAs.\nAdd 2/3 volume of RT 100% ethanol to the total filtrate and mix thoroughly by vortexing.\nPipet the filtrate/ethanol mixture onto a second filter cartridge. Like before the maximum volume that can be applied at once is 700 µl.\nCentrifuge for 15 sec at 10,000 x g or apply vacuum as described in step 5.10.\nDiscard the flow-through, and repeat until all of filtrate/ethanol mixture has been filtered.\nApply 700 µl miRNA Wash Solution 1 to the filter cartridge, centrifuge for 5-10 sec or apply vacuum and discard the flow-through.\nWash the filter with 500 µl wash solution 2/3 as done in step 5.16.\nRepeat the wash a second time with 500 µl of wash solution 2/3 as in step 5.16, discard the flow-through and place the filter back in the collection tube.\nSpin the filter cartridge for 1 min at 10,000 x g to remove all residual fluid from the filter.\nTransfer the filter cartridge into a fresh collection tube and apply 100 µl of hot (95 °C) nuclease free water to the center of the filter.\nSpin the assemblies for 20-30 sec at maximum speed to recover the RNA.\nCollect the eluate and use immediately or store at -80 °C.\nSubscription Required.
