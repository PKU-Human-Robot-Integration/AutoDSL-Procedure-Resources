    "The institutional research ethics committee from Centro Médico Nacional “20 de Noviembre” ISSSTE approved this prospective protocol, all enrolled patients provided written informed consent.\n1. Evaluation of vascular block of lower limb, blood sampling and balloon angioplasty\nNOTE: The study sample used for this experiment comprised of 20 diabetic patients, aged 68 years old and 10 out of 20 were males. Half of the sample were smokers and most prevalent co-morbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension and/or dyslipidemia. The sample was intended to be standardized for age-, sex- and co-morbidities. Possible bias due to clinical-demographic influence on the relation between MPCs and CLI could not be ruled out.\nEvaluate clinical severity of limb ischemia according to the Rutherford classification13 (see Supplementary Table 1).\nPerform lower limb angiography, blood sampling and balloon angioplasty.\n\t\nUse anticoagulant and anesthetic drugs before surgery.\nPlace an 18 G needle into the blood vessel at the groin site selected.\nPlace an introducer and advance a flexible guide wire. Then, the initial guide is further changed for a 6 Fr introducer.\nUse periodic injection of contrast media or CO2 under fluoroscopic guide to identify artery trajectory and vascular blocked sites (Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Use contrast media 40 cc, diluted 1:1 in 0.9% saline, or CO2 at 10 to 20 mL per shot at a pressure of 12 psi.\nIntroduce two 0.014 Fr navigation guide wires and two 0.014 Fr support guide wires into the vessel and advance them up to the blocked site.\n\t\tNOTE: Two 0.014 Fr guide wires (260 cm long) are used for navigation and two 0.014 Fr guide wires (260 cm long) are used for support, during a single procedure.",
    "Introduce 5 Fr and 3 Fr catheters sequentially and collect 10 mL of blood from the closest site to the vascular obstruction. Maintain blood samples on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Catheters sizes may be 5 Fr and 3 Fr, and they are changed during the procedure.\nAdvance a guide wire again. Then, introduce an angioplasty balloon catheter, which contains an inflatable balloon located at the end of the catheter. Advance the angioplasty balloon catheter and place the balloon right at the site of lesion. Perform the angioplasty by inflating the balloon against the blocking plaque located at the vascular wall. Verify blood flow restoration.\n\t\tNOTE: A stent may be placed in the blocked area to help keep the artery open after the procedure.\nIntroduce a catheter and advance up to the closest site to the vascular block. Collect 10 mL of blood at 30 min time interval after angioplasty. Maintain blood samples on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Collection of blood samples before and after the angioplasty is recommended to further evaluate the influence of the angioplasty on the number of MPCs.\nRemove all the wires under fluoroscopic guidance.\nProvide post-operative care procedures, including anti-coagulation therapy using enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h, aspirin 100 mg, statin, and analgesia. Compress at the site of vascular puncture during 24 h.\n2. Quantification of circulating mononuclear progenitor cells (MPCs) (Figure 2)\nTo a fresh 15 mL conical tube, transfer 6 mL of the collected blood and dilute 1:1 (v/v) with PBS.\n\tNOTE: Process the blood within 1 h from collection.\nPrepare for density gradient separation, by adding 2 mL of the density gradient medium to 3 test tubes each. Then, add 3 equal volume aliquots of the diluted blood into each test tube.\n\tNOTE: Do not exceed three-fourths of the test tube maximal capacity.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,800 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Collect the interface layer present as a ring using a pipette, and transfer into a new tube. Add 2 mL of PBS and spin at 1,800 x g for 6 min at 4 °C. Save the pellet as this will contain MPCs.\nWash the pellet containing MPCs with PBS by centrifugation as described in step 2.3. Use fresh PBS for each wash and spin at 1,800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Repeat the process for 6 times.\nAfter the last wash, use 1 mL of PBS to resuspend the cell pellet. Dilute 20 µL of the cell suspension with 20 µL of 0.4% trypan blue, 1:1 (v/v). Use 10 µL of this cell suspension for cell counting using hemocytometer and a light microscope.\nAliquot 1 x 106 MPCs in previously labeled 5 mL flow cytometry tubes.\n\tNOTE: Prepare corresponding isotype-matched control antibodies.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1,800 x g for 6 min at 4 °C. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.\nDilute primary antibody in 100 µL of antibody incubation solution [1x PBS, pH 7.4, EDTA 2 mM, BSA 0.05%] and add to the tube. Resuspend for 10 s and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C, in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Final concentrations of primary antibodies used in the present protocol were CD45 1:50, CD34 1:20, KDR 1:50, CD184 1:20, CD133 1:50. Protocol may be stopped at this step by fixing lymphocytes in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and storing samples up to 24 h at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge at 1,800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Resuspend in 500 µL of 1x PBS, pH 7.4, EDTA 2 mM.\nPerform flow cytometry analysis.",
    "Set up the background with isotype-matched control antibodies. Then, at the FSC/SSC plot select lymphocytes spread, trying to exclude cellular debris, residual granulocytes, and other particles. Such distribution is considered as 100%.\n\t\tNOTE: Lymphocytes usually spread in the lower-left region of the plot.\nUse a gate with common immunophenotype containing high number of cells CD45+ and CD34+. Then, select for double positive immunophenotypes using gate which previously identified CD45+, CD34+, and adding either KDR (VEGFR-2)+, CD133+ or CD184+. Identify MPCs subpopulations by their specific cell surface markers. Report as the percentage of gated events.\nIdentify main subpopulations of MPCs. In the present study the immunophenotypes analyzed were CD45+CD34+CD133+; CD45+CD34+CD184+; CD45+CD34+CD133+CD184+; CD45+CD34+KDR+; CD45+CD34+KDR+CD133+ and CD45+CD34+KDR+CD1847,17.\n\tNOTE: These cell surface markers were used for the study: CD45 (lymphocytes), CD34 (endothelial and/or vascular cells), KDR (VEGFR-2) (membrane marker of endothelial cells), CD133 (endothelial progenitor cells) and CD184 (hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial cells).\n3. Relation of MPCs with modification of endothelial function and hemodynamic test (FMD)\nDetermine flow-mediated dilation (FMD), pre- and post-angioplasty.\n\t\nUse a vascular linear transducer to measure the diameter of the brachial artery.\nPlace the cuff of the sphygmomanometer above the measurement site in the forearm and insufflate at 50 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure for 5 min and deflate.\nDetermine again the diameter of the brachial artery within the next 60 s. Use the equation below to estimate FMD.\n\t\tNOTE: Calculate the degree of dilatation using the equation (%) = (maximum diameter after transient ischemia - basal diameter) × 100 / basal diameter.\nCorrelate the number of MPCs with the baseline FMD value and post-angioplasty delta of FMD.\n4. Prognostic ability of MPCs for limb amputation\nSchedule periodic medical appointments after balloon angioplasty and patient discharge, to evaluate the quality of blood flow to the lower limb.",
    "Evaluate clinical severity of limb ischemia at 2 weeks after angioplasty. Evaluate resolving rest pain, lower ischemia, and preservation of a functional foot, according to the Rutherford classification13.\nCompare clinical severity of limb ischemia, at baseline versus follow up. Identify those cases requiring major amputation due to unfavorable outcome.\nCorrelate the number of MPCs with the proportion of patients requiring major amputation of the lower limb.\nSubscription Required.
