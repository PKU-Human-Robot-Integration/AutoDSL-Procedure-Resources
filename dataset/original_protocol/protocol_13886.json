    "All animals received humane care in compliance with the ‘‘Principles of Laboratory Animal Care’’ formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the ‘‘Guide for the Care of Laboratory Animals’’ published by the National Institute of Health, Ontario, Canada. The Animal Care Committee of the Toronto General Research Institute approved all studies. The research involved human subjects was approved by the Bioethical Committee at Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun.\nNOTE: Obtain approval from appropriate ethical boards. Remember to always wear safety gloves. Do not touch the extraction phase of SPME probes. The use of deactivated glass vials is recommended for lipidomic analyses.\n1. Preparation of probes\nPrepare titanium-nickel alloy probes (40 mm length; 0.2 mm diameter) coated with 7 mm mix-mode sorbent. The number of probes depends on the time points targeted during the entire procedure and the number of replicates (3 is recommended per time point).\n\tNOTE: The length and type of extraction phase may be adjusted based on the mode of study, the polarity of metabolites, and the sample matrix.\nPrepare a cleaning mixture composed of 2:1 chloroform:methanol (v/v). Pipet 1.0 mL of the solution to each 2.0 mL glass vial and place one probe, previously pierced through the cap, in each vial.\n\tNOTE: Before use, clean all probes to remove contaminating particles.\nPut the vials on the agitator and set the agitation speed at 1,200 rpm. After 45 min, stop the device and rinse the coatings with LC-MS grade water.\nAs coatings must undergo a preconditioning step to activate them, prepare a preconditioning mixture composed of 1:1 methanol:water (v/v). Pipet 1.0 mL of the solution to each 2.0 mL glass vial and place one probe, previously pierced through the cap, in each vial.",
    "Put the vials on the vortex agitator and set the agitation speed at 1,200 rpm.\nAfter 60 min, stop the agitator and rinse the coatings with LC-MS grade water.\nSterilize probes according to the standard surgical equipment sterilization protocol.\n2. Extraction\nOpen the sterile package right before sampling to ensure a sterile environment.\nInsert two probes directly into the kidney cortex for 10 min at each time point. The entire length of the coating must be covered by the tissue matrix; no specific angle is required, but ca. 90 deg is usually used.\n\tNOTE: The entire medical procedure follows standard protocols in given institution. No modification concerning SPME sampling is considered. The procedure involves the six following sampling time points:\n\ta) before kidney resection, in vivo from donor;\n\tb)-e) after 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, 7 h of kidney perfusion, ex vivo in organ chamber;\n\tf) after reperfusion, in vivo from recipient.\nRetract the probes by pulling it out from the tissue and then rinse coatings with LC-MS grade water to clear any remaining blood from the coating surface. Rinse away from the surgical site, and immediately after removal of the probes.\n3. Transport and storage\nPlace probes in separate vials and close them.\nPlace vials in a Styrofoam box filled with dry ice or in liquid nitrogen for transport.\nStore samples in a freezer (-80 °C), or immediately commence the desorption step.\n4. Desorption\nPrepare desorption solutions composed of 80:20 acetonitrile:water (v/v) for metabolomic analysis, and 1:1 isopropanol:methanol (v/v) for lipidomic analysis.\nPipet 100 μL of the solution to inserts placed into 2.0 mL labeled vials and place one probe, previously pierced through the cap, in each vial.\nPut the vials on the vortex agitator and set the agitation speed at 1,200 rpm for 120 min.",
    "Remove probes from the vials. Obtained extracts are now ready for instrumental analysis.\n5. LC-MS analysis\nPlace vials containing extracts in the autosampler of the LC-MS system.\n\tNOTE: Liquid chromatography (RP, HILIC) coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry and an orbitrap mass analyzer were used for this study. For metabolomic analysis parameters, go to step 5.2. For lipidomic analysis parameters, go to step 5.6.\nUse a pentafluorophenyl (PFP) column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 3 μm) for reversed phase separation.\n\t\nSet the flow rate to 300 µL/min, and autosampler and column temperatures to 4 °C and 25 °C, respectively.\nPrepare mobile phases according to the following proportions: mobile phase A: water:formic acid (99.9:0.1, v/v), and mobile phase B: acetonitrile:formic acid (99.9:0.1, v/v). Set the mobile phase flow according to the following parameters: starting mobile phase flow (0-3 min): 100% A followed by a linear gradient to 10% A (3-25 min), ending with isocratic flow of 10% A until 34 min, followed by 6 min of column re-equilibrium time.\nFor HILIC separation, use a HILIC column (2.0 mm x 100 mm, 3 μm, 200A). Set the flow rate to 400 μL/min.\n\t\nPrepare mobile phases according to the following proportions: mobile phase A: acetonitrile:ammonium acetate buffer (9:1, v/v, effective salt concentration 20 mM), mobile phase B: acetonitrile:ammonium acetate buffer (1:1, v/v, effective salt concentration 20 mM).\nSet the mobile phase flow according to the following parameters: starting mobile phase flow (0-3 min) at 100% A, hold for 3.0 min and then ramp to 100% B within 5 min. Hold with 100% B until 12 min, followed by 8 min of column re-equilibrium time.",
