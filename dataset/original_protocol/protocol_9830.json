    "1. Fabricate and assemble the urinalysis device\nFabricate the base plate (Figure 1A).\n\t\nUse a computer-aided design (CAD) software to draw a rectangular area with dimensions 2.1641 in x 0.0547 in x 6.3828 in (W x H x L) using the polyline tool.\nMeasure the test area (rectangular area encompassing the distance between the first and last pad and the width of the pads) on the dipstick.\n\t\tNOTE: This information is needed to draw the through-holes that hold the dipstick in place and separate the liquid in between the pads (to prevent cross-contamination).\nAdd through-holes that mimic the size and position of each test pad in the test area.\nDraw two raised side ledges that measure 2.1641 in x 0.6797 in (W x L).\nDraw a stop (0.1172 in by 0.2109 in (W x L)) using the polyline tool to facilitate alignment between the base plate and the slide. The stop should be perpendicular to the ledges and physically stops the slide from moving passed the urine dipstick pads.\nSelect the lines for the stop and ledge to make one region using the Region command. Use the Extrude command to raise the region up to a height of 0.0703 in. Repeat this step on the other side of the device.\nCreate a notch (0.1895 in by 0.3500 in (W x L)) on both ledges to facilitate alignment with the box. Position it 0.466 in from the bottom edge of the ledge. Use the Region command to create a rectangle and make the extrusion height 0.1250 in.\nUse the Solid Subtract command, select device, press Enter, select the notch region and press Enter. Repeat on the other side of the device.\n\t\tNOTE: The shape will be removed from the device.",
    "Print the base plate on a 3D printer and sand the top face area between the ledges with sandpaper to roughen the surface.\n\t\tNOTE: Sanding is important so that the hydrophobic coating can adhere to the base plate securely.\nTape the ledges with adhesive tape (to avoid spraying the ledges) and spray the base plate with a hydrophobic spray. Apply several (4-8) coats of the basecoat to the base plate. Hold the can approximately 8-12 inches away from the base plate when spraying. The device should have a milky white appearance upon drying.\n\t\tCAUTION: Follow manufacturer instructions for appropriate location and PPE for spraying.\nWait 30 minutes before applying the topcoat several times (6-8x). Allow the base plate to dry for 12 hours before use. Remove the tape from the ledges.\nFabricate the top plate (Figure 1B).\n\t\nDraw a rectangular area to measure 2.05 in x 5.470 in (W x L) in a CAD software using the polyline tool.\nAdd a rectangular through-hole (the “viewing through-hole”) slightly larger than the size of the test area of the dipstick (e.g., 0.230 in x 3.147 in (W x L)). Place it 0.921 in from the top, 1.165 in from the left, and 1.165 in from the right edges of the top plate.\nDraw a second through-hole (the “Inlet-hole”) sized 0.075 in x 3.146 in (W x L). Place it 0.236 in from the bottom edge, 1.737 in from the top edge, and 1.162 in from the left and right edges of the top plate.\nCut the top plate from a piece of clear acrylic with a laser cutter. Wipe off any remaining dust or debris.\nFabricate the inlet cover (Figure 1B).",
    "Draw a rectangular area with dimensions 0.247 in x 3.3378 in (W x L) in a CAD software using the polyline tool. Add two circular through-holes with a diameter of 0.127 in approximately 0.073 in from the two edges of the inlet cover, one on either side.\nCut the inlet cover from a piece of clear acrylic with a laser cutter.\nFabricate the slide (Figure 1C)\n\t\nDraw a rectangular area in CAD software that measures measure 2.771 in x 0.0625 in x 5.000 in (W x H x L) using the polyline tool.\nAdd through-holes that match the position of each test pad in the test area. Draw the first 0.105 in square through-hole to overlap with the placement of the first test pad: 1.096 in from the left and right edges of the slide, 0.960 in from the top edge, and 1.681 in from the bottom edge. Add more through-holes as needed (usually 10 total) for the selected dipstick brand of choice. Space each next through-hole by measuring the distance between test pads on the dipstick.\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the through-holes is important in order to deposit the correct volume of liquid onto the dipstick pad. For our brand of dipstick, we created holes which deposit 15 ul onto each dipstick pad.\nCut the slide from a piece of clear acrylic using a laser cutter. Wipe off any remaining dust or debris.\nSpray the front of the slide with a hydrophobic spray. Apply several coats (6-8x) of basecoat to the slide. Hold the can approximately 8 -12 in away from the slide when spraying.\nWait 30 minutes before applying the topcoat several times (8-12x). Allow the slide to dry for 12 hours before use.",
    "Download a QR code from an online QR code generator and print the desired code on paper with sticky adhesive backing. Place the QR code 0.17 in from the right of the first through-hole along the same row as all the through-holes.\n\t\tNOTE: As long as the QR code is adjacent to the through-holes, accurate placement is not important.\nUse clear tape to cover the QR code and secure it to the slide.\nAssemble the inlet and plate sleeve (Figure 1D).\n\t\nFabricate the inlet by using acrylic cement to glue the inlet cover onto the top plate where the inlet-hole is located. Wait 24-48 hours to securely bond the pieces.\nSpray the back of the top plate with a hydrophobic spray once the inlet cover is securely bonded to the top plate. Place the top plate upside down. Apply the first basecoat several times (4-8x).\nHold the spray 8-12 inches away from the top plate and wait 30 minutes for it to dry. Apply the topcoat several times (6-8x). Allow the top plate to dry for 12 hours before use.\nAssemble the plate sleeve (combined top plate and base plate) by gluing the completed top plate to the ledges of the base plate with acrylic cement. The two pieces are easy to align by visual inspection, as the bottom edge of the top plate will align with that of the base plate. Apply a clamp to the base plate ledges to secure it during drying and wait 24-48 hours before use, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.\nCreate the chart sticker.\n\t\nDownload the color chart for the brand of dipstick from the manufacturer’s website.\nOpen the downloaded file in a graphics editor software.",
    "Open the digital file for the top plate template previously used for the laser cutter (Step 1.2 of this protocol) in a graphics editor software.\nCreate the color boxes for the chart sticker by matching color boxes from the manufacturer color chart. Select the first block of color on the manufacturer’s chart with the dropper tool in the graphics editor software and then use the box shape tool to make a box shape in the same color on the top plate template, in the same row where the dipstick pad will be located. Repeat this for each color block corresponding to each pad row.\nDelete the layers associated with the top plate template.\nPrint the chart sticker as a vinyl sticker with an online sticker print service. Place the chart sticker onto the plate sleeve and align it with each through-hole.\nFabricate the box (Figure 1E).\n\t\nDraw the two long-sided box pieces (parts “a” and “b”) in the CAD software as rectangles with dimensions of 4.92 in x 6.63 in (W x L). Add a cut-out to part “a” centered on the bottom edge measuring 0.2 in x 6.11 in (W x L).\nDraw the two narrow-sided box pieces (parts “d” and “e”) in the CAD software as rectangles with dimensions measuring 1.805 in x 6.63 in (W x L).\nDraw the box top (part “c”) as a rectangle with dimensions 1.805 in x 6.63 (W x L). Draw the “imaging through-hole” on the top: 0.74 in x 0.910 in (W x L), positioned 3.17 in from the bottom, 2.53 in from the top, 0.65 in from the right edge, and 0.42 in from the left edge.",
    "NOTE: The exact position of the imaging through-hole should be selected on the basis of the cell phones that will be used for the analysis.\nDraw each box piece to feature a pattern of interlocking edges that will allow all the box sides to snap together on each edge as described in Figure 1D. To make an interlock edge pattern, alternate an extrusion/intrusion pattern on the long edge with 0.135 in by 1.17 in (W x L) protrusions. Draw two extrusions on each long edge for every side of the box. Use the same extrusion/intrusion pattern for the short edge, but with intrusions measuring 0.135 in by 0.460 in (W x L).\nCut the five pieces with a laser cutter or print them with a 3D printer.\n\t\tNOTE: A laser-cut component using acrylic pieces will be cheap to manufacture and can be flattened for easy shipping. Use black acrylic as it is helpful to absorb scattered light during testing.\nAdd black color construction paper to the box interior to prevent scatter from the flash during image analysis if the box material has a gloss finish.\n2. Prepare the test\nDownload the UrineTest mobile application from GitHub (https://github.com/Iftak/UrineTestApp). \nInstall the app onto a mobile phone. \n\tNOTE: This step only has to be done once for all future uses of a given phone. If needed, enable developer status on the phone to do this. \nLaunch the UrineTest application in the phone (Figure 2A).\nRead the instructions to change the analyte names and reading timings (Figure 2B) to match those for the dipstick of interest (based on the manufacturer’s specifications) and insert new input via the text holder window on the screen (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: The necessary readout time for each dipstick pad will depend on the brand of the dipstick used.",
    "Assemble the various components together and insert the dipstick into the through-holes underneath the plate sleeve (Figure 1F). \nPlace the plate sleeve inside the box so that its notch is aligned with the box gap. \nPlace the slide inside the plate sleeve so that its through-holes align with the inlet.\nPlace the phone on the top of the box with the back-camera lens facing the viewing through-hole to enable imaging. Ensure the camera visibility is not occluded by checking for the image on the phone screen prior to testing. The app will enable the flashlight on the phone automatically.\nRead the instruction for phone alignment (Figure 2D) and align the phone accordingly so that the dipstick coincides with the boundaries of the black rectangular overlay on screen (Figure 2E).\nClick the Start button on the app window to begin the test.\n\tNOTE: This will open the phone camera to read the QR code once in view (Figure 2F).\n3. Conduct the test\nDeposit urine into the inlet hole with a disposable polyethylene transfer pipet containing approximately 0.5 mL of urine (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: The exact amount of liquid is not important, but it should be at least 0.5 mL to ensure that all the through-holes receive sufficient urine. Upon adding the liquid, observe that it moves across inlet and is deposited in each through-hole of the slide.\nInitiate the test by pushing the slide into the plate sleeve until it is stopped by the base plate stop.\n\tNOTE: Urine should make contact with dipstick pad when the QR code is in the field of view of the cell phone. After reading the QR code, the application will open a window to analyze the color changes (Figure 2G) and show the results automatically within the same window (Figure 2H).",
    "Discard the urine appropriately and clean the plate sleeve and slide with 10% bleach solution and rinse again with de-ionized water. Allow it to dry before additional use.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
