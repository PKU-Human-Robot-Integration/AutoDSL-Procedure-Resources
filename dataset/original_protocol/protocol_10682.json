    "1. Cell Culture\nHuman promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells\n\t\nCulture HL-60 cells in 75 cm2 flasks with 15 ml of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) L-Glutamine and 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin.\nChange media every 3 days by aspirating half of the cell suspension volume and replacing it with complete IMDM media.\nFor carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining, centrifuge HL-60 cell suspension (400 x g, 5 min), resuspend in a 1 μM CFSE solution (prepared in prewarmed PBS) and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Then centrifuge cells, aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in fresh prewarmed medium for 30 min. Wash cells in PBS and then use for rolling experiments (see Figure 1B for representative image of CFSE-stained HL-60 cells on P-sel-coated surface).\nNote: CFSE staining is optional, and is presented here to demonstrate the rolling phenomenon in the microfluidic channel. Analysis of rolling parameters presented in this manuscript was performed on unstained cells using standard brightfield imaging.\nLung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs)\n\t\nCoat 100 mm Petri dishes with 0.1% gelatin solution (v/v in PBS) and incubate at 37 °C for at least 30 min.\nCulture LMVECs on gelatin-coated 100 mm Petri dishes in complete endothelial growth medium (endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2)), supplemented with a specific growth supplement kit, see REAGENTS). Change media every other day and sub-culture cells upon reaching 80-90% confluence.",
    "For sub-culture, wash cells with PBS and then detach cells with 4 ml of 1x Trypsin-EDTA for 3 min at 37 °C and neutralize in an equal volume of complete EBM-2 media. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge (400 x g, 5 min). Following centrifugation, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of complete endothelial media and count cells with a hemocytometer. Do not over-passage the cells, as this affects their morphology and function- use only cells under passage 7 for all experiments.\nChinese Hamster Ovary-P-selectin (CHO-P) Cells\n\t\nCHO-P cells, which are CHO cells stably transfected to express human P-sel, were provided by collaborators (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School)11,12.\nCulture CHO-P cells in T175 cm2 flasks in 25 ml of F-12 media.\nFor passaging, wash cells with 10 ml of PBS for 4-5 sec and then trypsinize in 10 ml of 1x Trypsin-EDTA for 3 min at 37 °C, followed by neutralization in full media.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension (400 x g, 5 min), carefully aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of full media and count the cells with a hemocytometer.\n2. Operation of the Integrated Multi-well Plate Microfluidic System\nMake sure all the equipment is properly connected and turn on the different modules: computer, controller, inverted microscope, and CCD camera.\nOpen the imaging software; make sure the multi-well plate module and the imaging module are properly presented on the screen.\nConnect the tubes to the vapor trap (connected to the controller) and also connect them to the Pressure Interface.\nPlace the multi-well plate in the plate heater/adaptor. Add reagents to wells (described below) and attach interface on top of the plate. Place plate for imaging on automated stage.",
    "The interface attaches to the top of the plate and applies a pneumatic pressure from the controller to the top of the wells, driving the fluid through the microfluidic channels at the defined flow rate, easily controlled using the multi-well plate module screen under Manual mode.\nReagents in the channel flow across an observation area, located between the wells. Microfluidic channel dimensions are 350 μm wide x 70 μm tall. The length of the linear channel is 1 mm and the bottom of the channels comprises a 180 μm coverslip glass, which is compatible with brightfield, phase, fluorescence and confocal microscopy.\nAcquire videos using a CCD camera (stream acquisition, 11 frames/sec) and analyze via compatible software.\n3. Coating of Microfluidic Channels with a Protein Substrate or a Cell Monolayer\nCoating microfluidic channel with fibronectin or P-/E-selectin\n\t\nPrepare 1 ml of 20 μg/ml fibronectin solution in PBS. Alter volume based on the number of channels to be coated (use 25-50 μl of fibronectin per channel).\nAdd 25-50 μl of fibronectin solution to each inlet well. Apply shear force of 2 dyn/cm2 for 5 min to perfuse the channel. Please note the bead of liquid appearing in the outlet well. Incubate for 30-45 min at R.T.\nAspirate the solution from wells (do not aspirate directly from the middle circle that feeds the channel)1,13. Add 200-500 μl of PBS into outlet well and wash channel with PBS by applying shear flow of 2 dyn/cm2 for 5 min. The channel is now properly coated with fibronectin and ready to be used.\nTo coat with P- or E-sel, prepare a 5 μg/ml solution of the desired human recombinant protein in PBS, and coat the channels as described above, with 1 hr incubation at 37 °C to allow surface coating.",
    "Creation of CHO-P or LMVEC monolayer inside the microfluidic channel\n\t\nGently trypsinize cells from culture dishes for 3 min, quench using a 2-fold volume of full media and centrifuge (5 min at 400 x g). Resuspend cells with 10 ml of full media and centrifuge (5 min at 400 x g) again.\nCount the cells to determine cell concentration in the suspension. To ensure the formation of a confluent LMVEC monolayer inside the channel, bring cell concentration to 15-20 million cells/ml. For a confluent CHO-P cell monolayer, use 50-60 million cells/ml. Use 25-50 μl of cell suspension for each channel - determine initial cell number used for the experiment accordingly.\nAdd 25-50 μl of cell suspension in the appropriate concentration to the inlet well. Place the plate on the microscope stage and introduce cells into the channel (2 dyn/cm2) until cells are observed on the screen filling the entire channels, and then stop the flow.\nFill both outlet and inlet with 200 μl of either full LMVEC or CHO media. Let the cells settle and adhere for 3 hr in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nFollowing the 3 hr incubation, wash the channel with full media (2 dyn/cm2, 10-15 min) to remove unattached cells. Cells should now appear completely confluent and the channel is now ready for use. Depending on initial cell seeding density, additional 2-3 hr of settling time may be required to ensure complete coverage of the surface with the cells.\n4. LMVEC Pro-inflammatory Activation and Antibody Blocking of P-/E-selectin\nPrepare a TNF-α solution (10 ng/ml) in LMVEC basal media.",
    "To induce inflammatory activation of LMVEC in the channels, add 100 μl of the TNF-α solution to the inlet well and introduce the solution into the channel by applying shear flow of 2 dyn/cm2 for 5 min. For control channels (nonactivated ECs), add 100 μl of LMVEC basal media to the inlet well and introduce into the channel (2 dyn/cm2 for 5 min). Channel is now ready for a rolling assay.\nTo block P-sel and E-sel on LMVECs and CHO-P cells, introduce neutralizing P-sel (clone AK4, 5 μg/ml in basal media) or E-sel (clone P2H3, 5 μg/ml in basal media) antibodies into the channel and incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C. Next, wash channels with basal media (2 dyn/cm2 for 5 min). Channels are now ready for a rolling assay.\n5. HL-60 Rolling Assay on Substrate/Cell Monolayer-Coated Microfluidic Channels\nCarefully examine the channels under the microscope to confirm that channels are properly coated (in the case of coating with cells, a fully confluent cell monolayer should be observed).\nTo prepare HL-60 cell suspension for the rolling experiments, centrifuge HL-60 cell suspension (5 min at 400 x g) and wash once with basal media. Count the cells and resuspend in IMDM (basal media, containing Ca2+ and Mg2+) to create a HL-60 cell suspension with 5 million cells/ml. Use 25-50 μl of cell suspension for each channel to perform the rolling assay.\nAdd 25-50 μl of the cell suspension to outlet well, place plate inside the temperature-controlled plate holder (37 °C) and place on the microscope stage. Next, introduce cells into the channel by applying shear force of 2 dyn/cm2 (cells should be observed within 10-15 sec flowing from outlet to inlet).",
    "To examine the rolling response as a function of shear stress, reduce shear to 0.25 dyn/cm2 and acquire 20-30 sec videos (using \"stream acquisition\" function) in each desired shear (increase shear gradually from 0.25 up to 5 dyn/cm2. It is also possible to use higher shears).\nAcquire videos using a CCD camera (stream acquisition, 11 frames/sec) and analyze rolling paths and rolling velocities via compatible software.\n6. Flow Cytometry to Detect Expression Of Surface Molecules\nFollowing trypsinization, prepare a cell suspension (using 1-2 x 105 cells/sample) of desired cell type (HL-60, CHO-P or LMVECs) in PBS (-/-), supplemented with 2% FBS. Wash cells twice and bring sample volume to 50 μl (using the same buffer).\nIncubate each sample with the desired fluorophore-conjugated Ab (see attached table for detailed information) at 4 °C for 20 min (cover with aluminum foil).\nWash the cells twice (same buffer) and bring final volume of stained cell suspension to 200 μl. Analyze samples using a flow cytometer to detect expression of surface molecules.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
