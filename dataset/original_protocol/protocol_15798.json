    "1. Determination of the structure of the DD dendritic spines\nCreate transgenic worms to label DD spines\n\t\nUse the flp-13 promoter to build an expression vector for the label of interest (e.g., cytoplasmic mCherry, MYR::mRuby, LifeAct::GFP, GFP::utrophin) (Figure 1). See the complete list of plasmids in Supplementary File 1.\nUse established methods to generate a transgenic line labeling DD spines8,9.\nPrepare the sealant\n\t\nMake ﻿a 1:1 mixture of paraffin-based embedding medium10 (see Table of Materials).\nHeat the medium at 60 °C until melting, then aliquot in 1.5 mL capped microcentrifuge tubes and maintain a heating block at 60-70 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Sealant can last for 4 weeks in the heating block.\nPrepare an anesthetic.\n\t\nMake stock solutions in distilled H2O of 1% Tricaine and 1 M levamisole (see Table of Materials). Store at -20 °C.\nPrepare a working solution of 0.05% Tricaine and 15 mM levamisole anesthetic, as described in steps 1.3.3-1.3.511.\nMix 75 µL of 1% Tricaine stock and 22.5 µL of 1 M levamisole.\nAdd M9 buffer to a final volume of 1.5 mL.\nAliquot 10 µL of 0.05% Tricaine, 15 mM levamisole into 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The anesthetic mixture is sensitive to temperature, and individual aliquots of the working solution should not be refrozen after thawing for each experiment. See Supplementary File 2 for a recipe for M9 buffer.\nAcquire high-resolution images\n\t\nPrepare 10% agarose and maintain it in the water bath at 60 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: See the report by Monica Driscoll in WormBook12.\nMount 15-20 young adults on 10% agarose pads and add 3 µL of anesthetic (see step 3).\nApply coverslip (worms are immobilized within 5 min).\nSeal the edges of the coverslip with melted adhesive sealant mixture (see Table of Materials).\nAcquire images\n\t\t\nSuper-resolution acquisition",
    "Use a laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped for super-resolution microscopy with a 63x/1.40 Plan-Apochromat oil objective lens to achieve a small pixel size (e.g., < 50 nm). Acquire Z-stacks using the step size recommended by the manufacturer's software (see Table of Materials).\nCollect a series of optical sections that span the total volume of the DD ventral process (e.g., 15-20 slices at 0.19 µm step size or 2- 3µm thick). Submit Z-stacks for image processing using the manufacturer's software and analyze images with a score higher than 7 (Figure 1B, Figure 2 and Figure 3).\nNyquist acquisition\n\t\t\t\nUse a laser scanning confocal microscope to select the optimal pixel size for the wavelength of light and numerical aperture of the objective lens in use (e. g., 40x/1.4 Plan Fluor oil objective).\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The smaller pixel size will reveal the fine structure of DD spines.\nSubmit stack for 3D deconvolution using Automatic algorithm (see Table of Materials) (Figure 3).\nUse the smallest Z-step possible (e.g., determined by Piezo stage) because oversampling in Z can yield sharper images after 3D deconvolution13.\nImage analysis\n\t\nUse appropriate image processing software (see Table of Materials) to create maximum intensity projections of the Z-stacks14.\nManually count the protrusions on the DD dendrite.\n\t\tNOTE: Protrusions are perpendicular extensions from the main shaft (Figure 1B, arrowheads).\nDetermine the length of the DD dendrite scored to calculate the density of spines per 10 µm of DD dendrite (Figure 1C).\nClassify spines as thin/mushroom, filopodial, stubby or branched (Figure 2A).\n\t\tNOTE: Thin/mushroom spines exhibit a narrow base (neck) and a broader tip (head). Filopodial spines do not display a constricted base (no neck) but have a constant width. Stubby spines have a wide base and tip. Branched spines are protrusions with more than one tip.",
    "2. Assessing activation of DD dendritic spines by presynaptic cholinergic signaling\nCreate transgenic worms using conventional techniques (e.g., microinjection)8,9\nUse the flp-13 promoter to drive expression of the Ca++ sensor, GCaMP6s, in DD neurons and the unc-4 promoter to drive expression of Chrimson, a red-shifted channelrhodopsin, in presynaptic VA neurons (Figure 4A). See the list of plasmids in Supplementary File 1.\nPrepare All-trans Retinal (ATR) and control plates.\n\tNOTE: ATR is a required cofactor for Chrimson to function as an optogenetically activated ion channel.\n\t\nPrepare 100 mM ATR stock solution in ethanol (100%). Store at -20 °C in 1 mL aliquots.\nUnder a laminar flow hood, add 300 µL of overnight OP50 bacterial culture and 0.25 µL of ATR to each 60 mm NGM (Nematode Growth Medium) nutrient agar plate and spread with a sterile glass rod.\nFor controls, add 300 µL of OP50 bacteria and 0.25 µL of ethanol (100%) to a separate group of NGM plates.\nLet plates sit in hood at room temperature for 24 h (protected from ambient light) to allow bacterial growth.\n\t\tNOTE: Plates can be used after the initial 24 h incubation or maintained at 4 °C to use within 5 days.\nSetting-up the experiment\n\t\nPlace five NC3569 L4-stage larvae on OP50-seeded ATR or control plates that lack ATR and grow in darkness at 23°C.\nThree days later, use a stereo dissecting microscope to confirm vulva development to pick L4 stage progeny from ATR and control plates for imaging as described in steps 2.4.1-2.4.3.\nOn a microscope slide, place 2 µL of 0.05 µm polybeads (2.5% solids w/v) (see Table of Materials).",
    "Use a platinum wire (\"worm pick\") to add a small globule of super glue to the solution and swirl gently to generate filamentous \"strands\" of glue. Then add 3 µL of M9 buffer (Figure 4B).\nPlace approximately ten L4 larvae in the solution and apply a coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: Glue fibers will randomly contact worms and immobilize them after the coverslip is applied. Worms that are embedded in large globules of glue appear desiccated and should not be imaged.\nSeal edges of coverslip as mentioned in step 1.4.4.\nRecording of evoked Ca++ transients in dendritic spines.\n\t\nUse a spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a sensitive CCD camera, a 100x TIRF oil objective lens, and 488 nm and 561 nm laser lines (see Table of Materials).\nAdjust microscope stage to position DD spines in the focal plane.\nSet-up time-lapse acquisition to illuminate the sample with 488 nm laser line every frame (for detecting GCaMP6s fluorescence) and the 561 nm laser line at periodic intervals (for Chrimson excitation).\n\t\tNOTE: For example, use 488 nm light to capture consecutive snapshots (200 ms) of GCaMP6s signal coupled with a 200 ms pulse of 561 nm light every 5th frame (Figure 4C-E). With this configuration, GCaMP levels before and after each 561 nm pulse are detected ~1 s apart (200 ms of 488 nm laser to detect GCaMP before VA activation, 200 ms of 561 nm pulse to activate VA and ~600 ms to switch between laser lines and emission filters. With this set-up, VA neurons are activated every 2.5 s.\nAnalysis of in vivo Ca++ imaging\n\t\nUse 2D-deconvolution and image alignment to correct minor deviations arising from the worm movement during acquisition (see Table of Materials).\nDefine the DD dendritic spine as the Region Of Interest (ROI in Figures 4C-D).",
    "Duplicate the ROI and relocate to a neighboring region inside the worm to collect background signal (i.e., noise).\nUse appropriate software (see Table of Materials) to export GCaMP6s intensities to excel for each time point. Subtract background fluorescence from spine ROI fluorescence.\nDetermine the change in fluorescence by subtracting the GCaMP6s fluorescence in the frame immediately before 561 nm excitation (F0) from each time-point after excitation (ΔF), then dividing by F0 to determine ΔF/F0 (Figure 4E).\nGraph the normalized traces (See Table of Materials).\nPerform a paired statistical test for each measurement of GCaMP6s fluorescence before and after each pulse of 561 nm light.\n\t\tNOTE: This approach effectively excludes random fluctuations in GCaMP6s fluorescence that otherwise reduce the statistical power of comparing the mean GCaMP6s signal from all measurements before and after 561 nm excitation (Figure 4F).\nFor measurements that show a normal or Gaussian distribution, use a paired parametric ANOVA test and correct for multiple comparisons for each of the two groups (ATR before vs. after, no ATR before vs. after). Alternatively, for data that are not normally distributed, use a non-parametric ANOVA with posthoc correction for multiple testing.\n\t\tNOTE: Worms grown on plates that lack ATR (\"no ATR\") are necessary controls and should not show 561 nm-activated Ca++ transients because ATR is required for Chrimson function."
