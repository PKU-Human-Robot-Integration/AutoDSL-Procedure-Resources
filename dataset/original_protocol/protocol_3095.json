Harvesting and processing of normal pancreatic tissue\n            \n              (A) The normal pancreas is harvested during pancreatic surgeries.\n            \n              (B) Fascia, fats, and necrotic and scorched parts are removed\n              carefully from the tissue.\n            \n        Remove any blood, fascia, necrotic of scorched areas from the tissue.\n      \nNote: A tissue size of 15 mm × 15 mm×5 mm\n      generates a single-cell suspension of 100 μL with 1000/μL live cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\n    \n        Place the tissue in approximately 10 mL of Preservation Buffer in a\n        50-mL tube and transport it on ice to the laboratory within 30 min.\n      \nTissue dissection\nTiming: 5 min\n        Transfer the tissue to a 50-mL tube and add approximately 10 mL of cold\n        1×PBS. Gently invert the tube several times.\n      \nCritical: Repeat step 4 twice to wash\n      off any residual blood and pancreatic enzymes released on the tissue’s\n      surface.\n    \n        Transfer the tissue to a 5-mL conical tube and add approximately 1 mL of\n        Digestion Buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2869-Fig2.jpg\n              Figure 2. Schema for pancreatic tissue dissection\n            \n              (A) Processed tissue is placed in a tube perfused with 1 mL\n              digestion buffer.\n            \n(B) The tissue is minced with a scissor into a paste mixture.\n(C) The mixture is transferred to a round dish.\n              (D) The mixture is resuspended with digestion buffer until the\n              total volume is 10 mL.\n            \n        Using sterile ophthalmic straight scissor, mince the tissue on ice into\n        tiny pieces smaller than 1 mm × 1 mm within 5 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\n      \n        For normal human pancreas, transfer the mixture to a 100 mm × 20 mm",
    "round culture dish using a sterile Pasteur pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Add enough Digestion Buffer to reach a maximum volume of 10 mL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). For neoplastic human pancreas, transfer the mixture to a 50-mL tube\n        and add enough Digestion Buffer to reach a maximum volume of 15 mL.\n      \nNote: There are no significant differences\n      in the types of cells detected from normal and neoplastic pancreas,\n      referring to Peng et al. (2019).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nTissue dissociation\n      The process for dissociating normal pancreatic tissue differs from that\n      for neoplastic pancreatic tissue dissociation, so the steps are described\n      separately.\n    \nTo dissociate normal pancreatic tissue\nTiming: 15 min\n        Incubate the mixture in a 100 mm × 20 mm round culture dish at 37°C for\n        5 min in a constant temperature\n        \nC O\n2\n        incubator.\n      \n        Pipette the mixture gently about 20 times, and incubate the mixture at\n        37°C for another 5 min.\n      \nCritical: Before each new incubation,\n      a microscopic examination to evaluate the tissue’s dissociation state is\n      necessary (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2869-Fig3.jpg\n          Figure 3. Microscopic examination of stepwise tissue dissociation\n        \n          (A) tissue state after the first round of dissociation, with few cell\n          clusters detached from major tissues.\n        \n          (B–D) tissue state after the second to fourth round of dissociation,\n          with more cell clusters dissociated from major tissues. Scale bar:\n          50 μm.\n        \n        After incubation, transfer the mixture to a new 50-mL tube and let it\n        stand for 30 s until tissue pieces settle down. Then, filter the\n        supernatant through a 40-μm strainer into another tube. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2869-Fig4.jpg\n              Figure 4. Schema for cell suspension harvesting\n            \n              (A) The dissociated mixture is transferred into a 50-mL tube and\n              allowed to stand still until all tissue pieces settle down.\n            \n              (B) The supernatant is transferred from the old tube (tube i) into",
    "a new tube (tube ii) and the sediment proceeds with next round of\n              dissociation.\n            \n              (C) The supernatant is filtrated with a 40-μm strainer and visible\n              un-dissociated tissues remain.\n            \n        Resuspend the sediment with 10 mL Digestion Buffer, transfer the mixture\n        into a new 100 mm × 20 mm round culture dish for another round of Steps\n        8–10 until the fourth time.\n      \nCritical: Process each supernatant\n      from every round of tissue dissociation in the Cell purification part\n      separately, as it is critical for high cell viability.\n    \nTo dissociate neoplastic pancreatic tissue\nTiming: 1 h\n        Incubate the mixture in a 50-mL tube at 37°C for 5 min at a shaking\n        speed of 50 r.p.m.\n      \n        Using a clean Pasteur pipette, pipette the mixture gently for about 20\n        times, and incubate for another 5 min under the same conditions as Step\n        12.\n      \nCritical: Practically, after the first\n      5 min of incubation, the minced tissue will form a viscous mass suspending\n      in the Digestion Buffer, pipette gently in Step 13 to disperse the mass,\n      and facilitate further dissociation. Pipette again in Step 14 to reinforce\n      the effect (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and\n      troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2869-Fig5.jpg\n          Figure 5. Schema for neoplastic pancreas dissociation\n        \n          (A) The minced tissue in a viscous mass form will restrict further\n          dissociation.\n        \n          (B) The tissue is resuspended after pipetting with a Pasteur pipette.\n        \n        Pipette the mixture gently for about 20 times, and continue incubation\n        for 20 min in the same condition of Step 12.\n      \n        After incubation, gently pipette the solution, and then let it stand for\n        30 s until most tissue pieces settle down before continuing with the\n        next step.\n      \n        Filter the supernatant through a 40-μm strainer, keep the filtrate on\n        ice.\n      \n        Resuspend the sediment with 15 mL Digestion Buffer and continue",
    "incubating the mixture at 37°C for 30 min at a shaking speed of 50\n        r.p.m.\n      \nAfter incubation, filter the mixture through a 40-μm strainer.\nCollect the filtrates from Step 16 and Step 18.\nCell purification\nTiming: 30 min\n      Purification improves sample purity and viability, by removing red blood\n      cells, cell debris and other impurities, and further singularizes cells by\n      intermittent gentle pipette. For single-cell omics, Cell purification\n      eliminates the DNase I in the final single cell suspension, ensuring the\n      subsequent library construction.\n    \nCentrifuge the filtrate at 800 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\n        Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in at least 5 mL freshly\n        prepared Lysis Buffer and incubate at room temperature for 5 min,\n        avoiding light.\n      \nCritical: Make sure the 1×RBC lysis\n      buffer is kept on ice and the DNase I is not added to the buffer until\n      Step 21.\n    \nCritical: It is important to resuspend\n      the pellet completely and filter the suspension through a 40-μm strainer\n      to remove the minute impurities.\n    \n        Transfer the suspension into a 15-mL tube, centrifuge it at 800 × g\n        for 4 min at 4°C (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and\n        troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2869-Fig6.jpg\n              Figure 6. Comparison of the pellet before and after the RBC lysis\n              step\n            \n              (A) The pellet before the RBC lysis step appears with visible red\n              part.\n            \n(B) The pellet shows the satisfying result of RBC lysis.\n        Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet with 1 mL Wash Buffer with\n        the wide-bore pipette tips, transfer it into a new 15-mL tube, add\n        excess 4 mL Wash Buffer.\n      \nCentrifuge the suspension at 600 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCritical: It is critical to transfer\n      the suspension into a new clean tube before centrifugation to prevent low\n      cell yield caused by tiny invisible impurities adhering to the tube wall\n      during subsequent steps.",
    "Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet with 1 mL Wash Buffer with\n        the wide-bore pipette tips, transfer it into a new 15-mL tube, add\n        excess 4 mL Wash Buffer (see\n        troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\n      \nCentrifuge the suspension at 400 × g for 6 min at 4°C.\nNote: Steps 23–26 are flexible washing\n      steps designed to remove impurities, digestion enzymes, and Dnase I.\n      Adjusting the centrifugation speed and time can help wash off impurities\n      smaller than cells, avoiding excessive cell loss. If necessary, an\n      additional washing step can be performed to remove any remaining\n      impurities.\n    \n        Resuspend the pellet with an appropriate volume (40–200 μL) of Wash\n        Buffer with the wide-bore pipette tips.\n      \nPause point: The resuspended cell\n      sample can be kept on ice for up to an hour.\n    \nNote: The volume of Wash Buffer varies\n      according to the subsequent experiments. For single cell sequencing based\n      on 10× Genomics platform, 100 μL cell suspension with 1000 cells/μL would\n      be adequate.\n    \n        Mix 10 μL of the suspension with 10 μL of 0.4% Trypan blue stain and\n        assess the viability and concentration of cells by Countess II and\n        microscopy (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] and\n        troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2869-Fig7.jpg\n              Figure 7.
