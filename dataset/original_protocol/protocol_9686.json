    "1. Synthesis of JBNts\nPrepare the JBNt monomer utilizing previously published methods, involving the synthesis of a variety of compounds12.\nPurify crude JBNt monomer after it has been synthesized with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a reverse-phase column. Use solvent A: 100% water, solvent B: 100% acetonitrile, and solvent C: HCl water solution with pH = 1. Use a flow rate of 3 mL/min. Collect the largest peak obtained in the HPLC at 7.2 min.\n2. Fabrication for JBNt/Matn1/TGF-β1 (Video 1)\nNOTE: Video 1 shows that the JBNm is an injectable solid formed in a physiological environment (water solution, no UV light, no chemical additives, and no heating), which is also biologically inspired.\nAdd 8 µL of 1 mg/mL TGF-β1 suspended in H2O to 32 µL of 1 mg/mL matrilin-3 suspended in H2O. Pipette to ensure proper mixing of these proteins.\nAdd 80 µL of 1 mg/mL JBNts suspended in H2O to the TGF-β1/matrilin-3 solution. Pipette repeatedly to ensure proper blending. The presence of white floccules can be observed immediately after the addition of JBNts, indicating the formation of the JBNm (Video 1).\n3. Observation of specimens with ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption\nNOTE: The UV-Vis absorption spectra were studied to characterize the assembly of the JBNm. This measurement was analyzed for four categories: JBNts alone, matrilin-3 alone, TGF-β1 alone, and the full layer-by-layer JBNm, comprised of all three parts. All initial concentrations are suspended in H2O.\nFor the JBNt group, add 5 µL of 1 mg/mL JBNts to 50 µL of H2O to make a 90.9 µg/mL solution.\nFor the matrilin-3 group, add 40 µL of 10 µg/mL matrilin-3 to 15 µL of H2O to make a 7.3 µg/mL solution.",

Agitate to ensure proper mixing, and then add 5 µL of 1 mg/mL JBNts to the solution, pipetting repeatedly to mix the sample.\nUsing a spectrophotometer, measure the absorption spectrum of each group.\n4. Zeta-potential measurement of specimens\nNOTE: The zeta-potential was analyzed to better predict how the JBNm would interact with in vivo tissue. Three groups were measured: matrilin-3 alone, matrilin-3 with TGF-β1, and the full layer-by-layer JBNm.\nFor the matrilin-3 group, add 160 µL of 10 mg/mL matrilin-3 to 640 µL of H2O to make an 800 µL solution.\nFor the matrilin-3/TGF-β1 compound, add 160 µL of 10 µg/mL matrilin-3 to 40 µL of 10 µg/mL TGF-β1. Pipette repeatedly to ensure proper homogeneity. Then, add it to 600 µL of H2O resulting in an 800 µL solution.\nFor the JBNm group, add 160 µL of 10 µg/mL matrilin-3 to 40 µL of 10 µg/mL TGF-β1. Pipette multiple times to mix the proteins. Then, add 20 µL of 1 mg/mL JBNts to the solution and pipette to ensure homogeneity. Finally, add the JBNm solution to 580 µL of H2O to produce an 800 µL solution.\nMeasure the zeta-potential values for the three groups.\n5. Preparation of JBNt/matrilin-3 nano-matrix for transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nNOTE: TEM characterization is performed to characterize the morphology of JBNts and JBNm.\nInsert two grids into a plasma cleaner to properly clean the grids before the negative staining of the JBNts and JBNm according to the published protocols and manufacturer's protocols12.",

Add 10 µL of 1 mg/mL JBNts to the matrilin-3/TGF-β1 mixture to prepare the JBNm sample. Again, pipette repeatedly.\nAdd 3 µL of the JBNt solution (200 µg/mL) and 3 µL of the JBNm solution on separate grids, and leave them for 2 min.\nRinse each grid with 100 µL of uranyl acetate solution (0.5%). Use filter papers to remove the excess solution and allow the grids to air dry.\nOperate a transmission electron microscope to properly observe and characterize the samples, as published previously11,12.\n6. Absorption spectra measurement of fluorescent-labeled proteins\nNOTE: The structure of JBNm is verified by observing the structures of the JBNm with absorption spectral analysis.\nLabel the TGF-β1 by using a protein labeling kit following the manufacturer's instructions.
