    "Fixation and permeabilization of oocytesWash isolated oocytes in 400 µl isolation buffer PVA and then transfer oocytes into 400 µl of 4% PFA for 25 min room temperature.Transfer oocytes into a 24-well dish with 500 µl/well of 2% Triton X-100 with 1x ProtectRNA RNase Inhibitor for 10 min at room temperature.Instead of step A2, permeabilize oocytes at room temperature with 70% ethanol for 20 min.Note: Perform hybridization directly after fixation. Preparing probe and hybridizationNotes: For the first use of Stellaris probes, it is recommended to start 4 separate hybridization reactions by adding 1 μl each of 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:400 working dilutions of probes to see which one is optimal. Negative control eGFP, no probe, Malat 1 (Figure 1). Warm hybridization buffer to room temperature and mix well. Spin 25 µM working stock probes and dilute to 100 nM 200x times to final concentration into hybridization buffer. 500 µl of 37 °C preheated wash buffer with 1x protect RNA RNase inhibitor used for rehydration cells for 15 min.Transfer oocytes into 96 well plate with 100 µl/per well hybridization buffer and add probe.Protect 96 well plate from light by aluminum foil, incubate in thermostat incubator overnight at 37 °C.Note: Shaking is not an essential step, it might be omitted. Post hybridization washes and mountingWash 1 time in 150 µl 2x SSC for 5 min, shake 30 RPM and turning angle 360° at 30 sec of 96 well plate.Transfer oocytes into 96 well plate with 125 µl/per well of warm wash buffer. Incubate at least 50 min at 37 °C.Note: Shaking is not an essential step, it might be omitted.Rinse 1 time in 150 µl of 2x SSC for 2 min at room temperature.Put oocytes with 0.",
    "5 µl of SSC liquid on glass slide with 20 µl of Vectashiled-hardening mounting medium with DAPI, wait 1 min then cover with cover slip.Image sampleLeave the slide in the dark chamber for 2 h at 4 °C. Next, scan with confocal laser scanning microscope. Take images in the same day to avoid sample drying and fluorophore fading.Imaging setupTypical settings for oocytes have two channels (red, blue) and objective HCX PL APO lambda 63.0 x 1.25 OIL UV. Another setup: For visualization of Cal flour 635 labeled probes used 633 laser the 618 nm excitation and emission 635 nm wavelength, laser power set at 10%, scan speed 100 Hz, format of image 512 x 512, pine hole 110 μm, Z-stack thickness: 10 μm and image analysis and merging by LAS AF.Note: To be able to compare images, make sure settings are identical between different experiments (e.g., laser intensity, gain, offset, scan speed, etc.).
