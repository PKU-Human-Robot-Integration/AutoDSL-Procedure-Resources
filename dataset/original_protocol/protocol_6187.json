    "Theory: For the estimation of LD fusion ability, we measure a lipid-exchange rate as an alternative indicator of potential pore size between two contacted LDs. During LD fusion, the lipids constantly exchange between the two LDs. For the measurement of the lipid-exchange rates between the LDs in live cells, the small (donor) LD of each LD pair pre-stained with BODIPY-C12 was photobleached. The fluorescence-labeled lipids in the large (acceptor) LD diffused into the small LD, and the photobleached lipids went into the large LD. The images of the small and large (acceptor) LDs, before and after photobleaching, were recorded and their fluorescent intensities were normalized to the initial fluorescent intensity of the large LD at time 0 s after photobleaching, giving rise to the initial intensity ratio of 1 for the large LD. The ratio of fluorescent intensity of the photobleached small LD to the large LD at time 0 s is denoted as G0. At any time after photobleaching, the time-dependent ratios of the fluorescent intensities of the large and small LDs are denoted as G1 (t) and G2 (t), respectively. Therefore, a time-invariable exchange rate (∅e) of the neutral lipid molecules between an LD pair is calculated from the measurement of the fluorescence recovering rate in the LD pair according to the ordinary differential equation as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065305_0761.jpgwhere V1 and V2 represent the volumes of the large and small LDs, respectively. The unit of the lipid-exchange rate is μm3/s. The detailed equation derivation is shown in Supplementary Information[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20190709/3309 Supplementary Information.docx].Overall procedureThe procedure for the lipid-exchange rate assay of LDs in live cells is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065422_4495.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Schematics of LD lipid-exchange rate measurement in live cellsCell preparationCulture 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes in 10 cm plastic dish in 10 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin.At 80% confluence, trypsinize the cells using 2 ml 0.25% trypsin solution. Terminate the process using 5 ml DMEM. Transfer the cells with DMEM into a 15 ml tube and centrifuge at 150 x g for 3 min, discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cell using 1 ml PBS.Count cells using a cell counting chamber.Centrifuge at 150 x g for 3 min, discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cells with appropriate electroporation buffer to reach a cell density of 2-3 x 106/ml.Aspirate 100 μl of cells, mix with 0.5-1 μg plasmid (Cidec-GFP) in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Transfer the cell-DNA mix into a genepulser, place the genepulser into Nucleofector II, choose the program A-033, which is optimized for 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes transfection, execute the electroporation step.Add 100 μl of DMEM into the genepulser, aspirate out the mixture into a 15 ml centrifuge tube with 2 ml DMEM medium.Add BODIPY-C12 558/568 into the medium to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml.Add sodium oleate solution into the medium to a final concentration of 200 μM to provide lipids for LD formation and growth in cells.After the addition of the above reagents, aspirate the mixture into a 35 mm glass bottom culture dish and incubate for 18-20 h in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Change the culture medium with 2 ml fresh DMEM for two reasons: 1) for the removal of BODIPY-C12 dye from the medium to eliminate background fluorescence; 2) for the removal of sodium oleate to reduce the influence of triglycerides synthesis on LD fusion.",
    "Next, place the culture dish with the cells in the incubator for 1 h before FRAP experiments to help the cells accommodate to the changed medium.Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) image acquisitionThe module of FRAP is conventional in most commercial confocal microscopes. Here, we used a Nikon A1 confocal microscope to perform FRAP measurements as an example. This following procedures can also be used for FRAP experiments when using the other confocal microscopes.Turn on the live cell station, set the temperature to 37 °C, switch on the 5% CO2, add an appropriate amount of double distilled water in a heating trough.Turn on the confocal microscope, laser generator, microscope controller, mercury lamp, electric automatic stage, z-axis piezoelectric stage, and computer workstation. Turn on the perfect focus system (PFS). Launch the Nis-element software. Choose the 100x oil-immersion objective (Numerical aperture 1.45). Add objective oil dropwise onto the objective, place the 35 mm glass bottom culture dish onto the sample holder, and adjust the height of the objective to immerse the culture dish in the oil. Allow the cells to accommodate for 1 h if possible, or at least 0.5 h to ensure the stability of the following measurement.Set the parameters of the microscope as shown in Figure 2. Click on the channel button, select “Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)” and “Tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)” channels. Choose “none” in Channel series. To capture the fluorescent images, fine settings of the optimized laser power and the gain and sensitivity of detector are critical. There are several commercial microscopes but their definitions of the setting parameters are different.",
    "Here, we used Nikon A1 confocal microscope as an example to show our settings, in which “Laser power” indicates the level of real laser power, “HV” indicates the gain of detector (brightness of images), and “Offset” indicates the sensitivity of detector (contrast of images). Thus, set the FITC laser power to “6.0”, HV “60-120”, off set “0”; the TRITC laser “0.3”, HV “60-120”, off set “0”. Set pinhole as home under the wavelength of 561 nm. Set scan size to “512 x 512 pixels”, scan speed “1 frame/s”, zoom “3.0”, and line average “none”.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065536_1085.jpgFigure 2. NIS-element settings of images acquisition. The image shows the settings of the laser channel, laser power, HV, Offset, pinhole size, scan size, scan speed, and other detailed parameters for image acquisition.Set the photobleaching parameters:Switch on the photoactivation interface as shown in Figure 3. Set the photobleaching laser as the wavelength of 561 nm, power of 100%. Set the stimulation scanning speed as 0.25 sec/frame.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065631_7200.jpgFigure 3. NIS-element settings of photobleaching. The image shows the settings of laser power and scan speed for photobleaching.Go to the N-dimensional (ND) Stimulation Interface as shown in Figure 4, in which we could set the XYZ locations of a few images captured and the time schedule options. Create three phases corresponding to the three-steps in time-sequential operations. In Phase 1, choose “Acquisition” in Acq/Stim, “No delay” in Interval, a duration of 1.06 s and 1 loop to capture one image, which shows the initial fluorescent intensities of an LD pair before photobleaching. In Phase 2 and Phase 3, set 3x in Group option. In addition, in Phase 2, set “Stimulation” in Acq/Sim, “S1” in ROIs and 1 loop to perform photobleaching. The stimulation duration will be automatically set according to the setting of stimulation scanning speed in Figure 3.",
    "In Phase 3, choose “Acquisition” in Acq/Stim, “1.06 s” in time Interval, and 30 (fast exchange rate) or 50 (slow exchange rate) loops to capture time-lapse images with a time interval of 1.06 s, which record the change in the fluorescent intensities of the LD pair after photobleaching. Subsequently, the duration is automatically calculated. Choose “Perform Time Measurement”. Check “Save to File”, input the path and name the file.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065712_7779.jpgFigure 4. NIS-element settings of ND Stimulation. The image shows three phases corresponding to the three-step time-sequential operations in the ND stimulation setting.Click on the button “Time measurement” in the menu to stick the time measurement interface in front of all interfaces. The interface is used to monitor the change in fluorescent signals of the selected regions-of-interest over time.Find target LD pairs:Click on the FITC or GFP button in the interface of the NIS-element software and switch to the microscope control mode. Using the mercury lamp illumination, select an LD pair with GFP signal enriched at the LD-LD contact site (LDCS) as shown in Figure 5. Adjust the focus plane of the objective to get a clear image of the LD pair. The diameters of the selected donor LDs are preferred to be in the range of 3-6 μm to reduce variation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065754_0028.jpgFigure 5. An example image of a suitable LDCS. The image shows the red signal of BODIPY-C12 stained LD pairs and the green signal of Cidec-GFP enriched at the LDCS. Scale bar, 5 μm.Switch to the computer control mode by clicking on the button “A1”. Click on the button “Laser interlocked” to stimulate the laser. Click on the button “Live” to preview the LD pair.",
    "Move the cursor on the interface of the software to the LDCS, right click on the mouse, choose “move the point to the center of the image” to place the LD pair at the center of the vision. Scroll the mouse to adjust the focus plane of the objective once the LD pair went out of focus. Adjust HV in GFP and TRITC channels to achieve the highest fluorescent intensity without overexposure as the photograph taken by detector. Press the button “PFS” on the microscope front panel to lock the imaging plane during the acquisition process.Click on the ROI button as shown in Figure 6, select the round circle, draw a circle covering about 70% area of the donor LD at its center, and denote as S1 (stimulation ROI). The reason for photobleaching donor LDs is described in the Notes section below. Next, draw another circle at the center of the donor LD that covers about 70% area of the donor LD; Draw a third circle at the center of the acceptor LD that covers about 70% area of the acceptor LD. The reason for selecting 70% area is dependent on our experience with the optimal HV value and bleaching laser power used. It is possible to adjust the percentage area on case by case basis. In addition, the ROIs selection here was only used to preview the real-time fluorescent intensities of the BODIPY-C12 dyes in LDs and to pre-check the fluorescence recovery data.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065838_2860.jpgFigure 6. ROI settings. The image shows the ROIs and the schematic diagram of circles on LDs. S1, a photobleaching region on the donor LD of an LD pair; Circle 2, the monitoring ROI on the photobleaching donor LD; Circle 3, the monitoring ROI on the acceptor LD.Execute the photobleaching process.",
    "Before the process, make sure the LD pair is ready on the imaging plane and all the parameters are set correctly. Click on the button “run now” in the ND stimulation interface and allow the program to complete.Look for next LD pairs and repeat Steps C5 and C6 to acquire FRAP data for a series of LD pairs."
