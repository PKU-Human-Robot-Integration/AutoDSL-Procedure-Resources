    "\"Injury\" procedureFill a 0.5 cc syringe with 22 gauge needle with 0.2 ml air “chaser” then “injury” solution (rat: 1 cc syringe with 14 gauge needle with 0.5 ml air, rabbit: 5 cc syringe with 14 gauge needle with 2 ml air).Induce anesthesia in a chamber with 3-4% isoflurane in oxygen delivered at 1-2 L/min (rabbit: 30 mg/kg ketamine intramuscularly prior to 2% isoflurane) (Figures 1 and 2). Suspend mouse by its front teeth with a 1-0 suture strand on a 60° incline dissection board and maintain anesthesia with 2-2.5% isoflurane administration with nose cone.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114050814_9595.jpgFigure 1. Lab bench set-up for surgical procedures. Procedures are performed in a fume hood with charcoal filtering for anesthetic gas scavenging that contains: small animal anesthetic gas exposure chamber (front right), lamps, and the plexiglass 60° incline dissection board (middle of hood). On the left of the picture, on a floor stand outside the hood, is the anesthetic vaporizer for delivering the isoflurane vapor.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114050917_8276.jpgFigure 2. Instruments used for aspiration injury procedure. Plexiglass 60° incline dissection board is shown with nose cone setup to deliver isoflurane during the procedure. The green hose delivers the isoflurane in 100% oxygen to an inner nose cone, whereas the larger bore blue hose provides vacuum for scavenging the anesthetic through the outer nose cone. Also shown are (left to right): a 5 cc syringe with 26 gauge needle containing 1.5 ml normal saline for the subcutaneous fluid injection, a 0.5 cc syringe with 22 gauge needle containing the injury solution and 0.2 ml air “chaser”, 3 curved dissecting forceps (2 serrated and 1 “toothed”), curved dissecting scissors, a vial of antiseptic antimicrobial solution with cotton-tipped applicator, and a 6” strand of 1-0 braided silk suture material.

    "Shave ventral neck, paint with topical antiseptic prep solution and remove excess with gauze.Infiltrate future incision site with 100 μl 0.5% bupivacaine (provides local post-operative analgesia).Cut a 2 cm longitudinal incision in the skin with scissors (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114051022_1621.jpgFigure 3. Neck incision. After suspending the mouse by its front incisors with a suture such that its nose is within the inner isoflurane nose cone (step A2), prepping the surgical site (steps A3 & A4), a 2 cm longitudinal incision is made with scissors and tissue forceps (step A5).Expose trachea by blunt dissection with 2 curved toothless forceps (Figures 4, 5 and 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114051114_7030.jpgFigure 4. Tracheal exposure by blunt dissection. The fascia membrane is teased away with curved serrated forceps and the salivary glands are pulled to the side in order to expose the trachea (faint white vertical between the forceps) that is surrounded by paratracheal musculature (step A6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114051200_2863.jpgFigure 5. Tracheal exposure by blunt dissection, continued. Grasp one side of the paratracheal musculature and pull it to the side while rubbing along the muscle longitudinally. This will result in a separation of the muscle fiber bundles and allow the muscle to be reflected to the side (step A6). Notice the inner and outer nose cone configuration for delivering the anesthetic and scavenging. Mouse’s nose has been positioned lower than usual for clarity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114051246_4467.jpgFigure 6. Tracheal exposure by blunt dissection, continued. Use the two curved serrated forceps to reflect the paratracheal musculature, fully exposing the trachea (step A6).Work curved forceps under trachea (Figure 7). and use to pull a 6\" strand of 1-0 silk suture material through (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114051327_1940.jpgFigure 7.

Use forceps to place suture under trachea (step A7)Discontinue isoflurane administration by removing nose cone.",
    "Before instilling injury vehicle by the steps below, allow mouse’s plane of anesthesia to rise until it just starts reacting to a forceps toe pinch then instigate instillation steps quickly. Especially for the acid-containing injury vehicles, if the plane of anesthesia is too deep the animal will not begin to breathe spontaneously after the injury vehicle is instilled.Lift trachea up with suture to facilitate inserting injury syringe needle into the trachea (2-3 cartilage rings below the larynx) with bevel facing surgeon (advance until bevel of needle is just past the trachea insertion point) (Figure 9). It is important that the needle be as parallel with the trachea as possible, otherwise, the needle can easily pierce the other side of the trachea. This will result in the injury vehicle not being injected into the lungs and a high probability that the animal will not survive.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114052246_5174.jpgFigure 9. Use suture to facilitate injecting injury solution into trachea. Remove nose cone apparatus from incline board to provide unrestricted access to upper section of trachea. Lift trachea up with suture to facilitate inserting injury syringe needle into the trachea (2-3 cartilage rings below the larynx). Notice bevel of needle facing surgeon. Advance needle until bevel of needle is just past the trachea insertion point (step A9). It is important that the needle be as parallel with the trachea as possible, otherwise, the needle can easily pierce the other side of the trachea. This will result in the injury vehicle not being injected into the lungs and a high probability that the animal will not survive. While assistant squeezes rib cage (to expel most of vital capacity), quickly instill syringe contents. Release chest just before the injection begins.",
    "This maneuver, along with the air “chaser” assures deposition of the injury vehicle into the distal lung (step A10).While assistant squeezes rib cage (to expel most of vital capacity), quickly instill syringe contents. Release chest just before the injection begins. This maneuver, along with the air “chaser” assures deposition of the injury vehicle into the distal lung.Leave animal on incline board until breathing commences and close incision with 2 staples (for rats and rabbits: trachea needle wound needs to be repaired with one 6-0 suture) (Figure 10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114052332_5999.jpgFigure 10. Close neck skin incision with surgical staples (step A11) Inject 1 ml (rat: 10 ml, rabbit: 20 ml) sterile NS subcutaneously into the scruff of the neck for fluid resuscitation. There is virtually no fluid loss during the procedure, but the animal will not drink for a while after the procedure and can dehydrate (Figure 11).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114052429_3060.jpgFigure 11.

Collect blood. Expose vena cava and abdominal aorta using gauze sponges to reflect abdominal organs and collect blood using a 1 cc syringe with 26 gauge needle from either vessel (steps B4 & B5).Harvest blood by (used to assess systemic inflammatory responses (e.g. serum or plasma cytokine levels)):Collect blood from abdominal aorta using 27 gauge needle on a 1 cc syringe (if plasma is to be isolated syringe must contain appropriate anticoagulant) (Figure 15).The vena cava can be used to collect blood, but generally, not as much blood can be collected as from the aorta (Figure 15).Dispense blood into 1.8 ml μ-fuge tube.",
    "Until blood can be processed, keep on ice if plasma will be prepared, or keep at room temperature if serum will be prepared. Process blood, as described below.Transect vena cava/abdominal aorta to euthanize by exsanquination.Flush pulmonary vasculature by (performed to remove the blood from the pulmonary circulation so measurements of compounds in the processed lung tissue reflect only values from the pulmonary compartment that do not include a systemic contribution):Grasp xyphoid process with forceps, puncture diaphragm with tips of scissors to deflate lungs and carefully cut away ventral aspect of diaphragm (Figure 16).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114053058_3863.jpgFigure 16.

Perform sternotomy. Continue the longitudinal incision up the sternum and through the neck. Cut away sternum to expose lungs (be careful not to puncture lungs) (steps B6b-c).Grasp apex of heart with toothless forceps and inject 5 ml (rat: 20 ml) 1x HBSS with Ca2+, Mg2+ (at 37 °C) into right ventricle (it will be on the left side of the heart since the animal is on its back) with 5 cc (rat: 20 cc) syringe + 26 gauge needle (Figure 18). The rate of injection should be fast enough to keep the heart “inflated”, but not so fast as to force the fluid out through the injection site. The calcium in the buffer, and its being at 37 °C, aids the heart to keep beating to facilitate flushing the pulmonary vasculature.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131114/20131114053250_4256.jpgFigure 18. Flush pulmonary vasculature.",
