    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1 HITS-CLIP analysis of RBP complexes\n      The protocol begins with isolation of primary hepatocytes. However, the\n      method can be adapted to whole tissue with modifications regarding lysate\n      preparation (see note in cell lysis section). Here, we use primary\n      hepatocytes isolated from transgenic mice expressing FLAG-tagged protein\n      which allows the utilization of commercially available FLAG antibody and\n      minimizes non-specific pull down of proteins. One advantage of this\n      approach, modified from earlier descriptions,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] is that\n      all purification steps to enrich RBP complexes are performed directly on\n      the magnetic beads used during immunoprecipitation which minimizes\n      incidental loss.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] The success of HITS-CLIP relies on\n      an efficient interaction between the antibody and its target protein.\n      Prior to immunoprecipitation check by Western blot that the antibody\n      recognizes the protein of interest with minimal non-specific protein\n      detection. As a negative control test the antibody on cells that do not\n      express the targeted protein.\n    \nPrimary hepatocyte isolation\nLiver perfusion\nTiming: ∼20 min per mouse\n    \nNote: The procedure is similar to the STAR\n      protocol5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] published in 2020 and we detail\n      modifications to the procedure with our specifications.\n    \nSet up a peristaltic pump at 3.5 mL/min as perfusion flow rate.\n        Wash the tubing of pump with 70% Ethanol, PBS and then perfusion medium.\n      \n        Place Perfusion medium and Digest medium in a water bath set at 37°C.\n      \n        Keep the Leibovitz’s L-15 medium in ice until receiving the dissected\n        perfused liver.\n      \n        After anesthesia, the mouse is positioned on a dissecting board, belly\n        up and the abdomen is sanitized with 70% ethanol.\n      \n        Perform a midline ventral incision with large blade scissors.\n        \nPull aside the flap of the skin to expose the body wall.\n            Make an incision into the peritoneum with fine blade scissors to\n            expose the liver.",
    "Cannulate the vena cava with a 22-gauge iv catheter and perfuse the\n        liver with perfusion medium for 10 min.\n      \nNote: This step chelates calcium and\n      flushes blood out of the liver which becomes pale.\n    \n        Perfuse the liver with Digest medium containing 0.05% Collagenase in\n        perfusion medium.\n      \nNote: this allows dissociation of\n      extracellular matrix. After 6–7 minutes of digestion, the liver appears\n      very soft and fragile.\n    \n        Isolate the liver.\n        \nRemove the gall bladder.\n            Using fine blade scissors dissociate the liver from the diaphragm,\n            the esophagus, stomach, kidney and small intestine.\n          \n            Place the liver in a 15 mL plastic conical tube containing 15 mL of\n            Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% of a mix of\n            penicillin and streptomycin solution.\n          \nCritical: The perfused liver is kept\n      on ice. To minimize loss of viability, we limit the number of isolations\n      to 3 mice at a time.\n    \nNote: for more details, refer to video\n      presentation in (Chami-Natan and Goldstein, 20205[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\n    \nHepatocyte isolation\nTiming: 30–45 min\n    \n      All the following steps are performed in sterile environment in a tissue\n      culture hood.\n    \n        Manually disrupt the liver in the 50 mL tube using a rubber cell\n        scraper, keeping the 50 mL tube in ice.\n      \nNote: All liver lobes should be\n      dissociated and completely disaggregated into a slurry. To complete the\n      tissue disruption and reduce tissue clumps, pipet up and down through a\n      25 mL serological pipet followed by 2–3 passages through a 10 mL pipet.\n    \n        Filter the 15 mL suspension through a 100 μm nylon cell strainer into a\n        new 50 mL tube on ice.\n      \n        Spin at 50 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The hepatocytes are contained in\n        the pellet.\n      \n        Wash the pellet twice with 30 mL hepatocyte wash medium, with a 5 min\n        spin at 50 × g between each wash.",
    "After the final spin, the hepatocytes are resuspended in 10 mL\n        hepatocyte wash medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 1%\n        Penicillin-Streptomycin.\n      \nCount cell number and determine viability using Trypan blue.\nNote: Usually a 1:3 or 1:4 dilution allows\n      accurate determination with expected 80%–90% viability.\n    \n        Plate cells on 10 mm collagen-coated dishes at a density of 5- to\n        100 × 106. Place the dishes in a humidified 5% CO2\n        incubator set a 37°C until the next day.\n      \nCrosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)\nTiming: ∼ 24 h\n      Our method takes advantage of the observation that UV irradiation\n      generates covalent bonds between RNA-protein complexes at contact sites.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\n      The RBP of interest bound to its RNA targets can then be purified using\n      stringent conditions. The co-purified RNAs are then partially digested\n      with RNases, the protein compound of the complex is eliminated by\n      treatment with proteinase K and the RNA purified after addition of RNA\n      linkers allowing cDNA synthesis and deep sequencing (HIT).\n    \nUV-irradiation\n        Wash the monolayer of primary hepatocytes twice with 4 mL ice-cold PBS.\n      \n        Remove the liquid and place the dishes without their cover on a layer of\n        ice in a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) and irradiate with 400 mj/cm2\n        of 254 nm UV light.\n      \nScrape the hepatocytes in 1 mL NP-40 complete lysis buffer.\nIncubate 5 min on ice.\nFreeze cells at −80°C to promote lysis.\nNote: An alternative to these previous\n      steps is to scrape the cells in 2 mL ice cold PBS containing protease and\n      phosphatase inhibitors after irradiation. Spin at 300 × g for 5 min\n      at 4°C, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL cold PBS and transfer into a\n      1.5 mL Eppendorf. Tube kept on ice. Spin at 300 × g for 5 min,\n      aspirate the supernatant leaving a thin layer of liquid to prevent the",
    "cell pellet to dry and store at −80°C until further processing.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\n      This allows preparation of more cells in order to perform large-scale\n      immunoprecipitation. The energy of irradiation may be adjusted according\n      to the affinity of the RBP to its targets. One can use 100 to 400 mj/cm2\n      or perform several irradiations at a given energy level. Use the condition\n      that yield to maximum signal upon Western blot.\n    \nCell lysis\n        Thaw lysates on ice and complete the lysis by homogenizing with a glass\n        Dounce and Pestle B (tight). Perform 20 strokes (up and down).\n      \nNote: Check efficiency of lysis under\n      microscope. If unbroken cells remain perform two additional strokes and\n      check again. When starting from frozen cell pellets, thaw pellet on ice,\n      wash once with cold PBS, spin at 300 × g, remove PBS, resuspend\n      cells in Complete NP-40 Lysis buffer and proceed with Dounce\n      homogenization.\n    \nAlternative: Rather than using\n      isolated hepatocytes, one can use whole liver as starting material.\n      Freshly harvested livers are washed twice with 10 mL chilled PBS and\n      minced with a razor blade. Minced pieces of liver are covered with 1–2 mL\n      chilled PBS, placed on a petri dish on a layer of ice and exposed to 400\n      mj/cm2 of 254 nm UV irradiation in a Stratalinker 2400.\n      Following three cycles of irradiation, the minced pieces of liver are\n      collected by centrifugation at 380 × g and resuspended in complete\n      NP-40 Lysis buffer. Prepare the lysate by homogenizing using a glass\n      Dounce and Pestle A (loose) (20 strokes) followed by 20 strokes with\n      Pestle B (tight). Clear the lysate by centrifugation at 13,000 × g\n      for 15 min at 4°C and proceed with immunoprecipitation.\n    \n        Clear the lysates by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at\n        4°C.",
    "Incubate lysates with RNaseOUT (3 μL/mL lysate) for 5 min on ice.\n        Treat Lysates with RQ1 DNAse (30 μL/mL lysate) for 5 min at 37°C, gently\n        mixing every 2 min.\n      \nNote: DNAse treatment is important to\n      eliminate contamination with genomic DNA. Make sure to add RNase inhibitor\n      in lysis buffer. It does not inhibit RNase T1 used downstream.\n    \nImmunoprecipitation\n        Add 0.5M EDTA (4 μL/mL lysate, i.e., 2 mM final concentration) to\n        chelate Mg2+ which inhibits RNase T1 and add RNase T1\n        (0.3 μL/mL lysate) (0.3 Units/μL final concentration) for partial\n        digestion of the bound RNA. Incubate at 24°C for 15 min and then place\n        on ice.\n      \n        Dilute lysate 1:1 with NDE buffer containing proteases and phosphatases\n        inhibitors. Keep on ice until immunoprecipitation is undertaken.\n        \n            Preparation of ChIP-Grade Protein G Magnetic beads\n            \nNote: Use a magnetic tube rack to\n              wash and handle magnetic beads. Once a tube containing the\n              magnetic beads is placed on the rack, the beads migrate towards\n              the magnet allowing removal of liquid without disturbing the\n              beads. Make sure all the beads have moved towards the magnet\n              before removing any liquid. All the washes are conducted by mixing\n              the beads in solution by inversion 3 times. Following the washes,\n              tubes containing beads are placed back on the magnet and wash\n              solution is carefully aspirated.\n            \nResuspend the beads by gentle inversion.\n                Wash appropriate volume of beads (50 μL of beads per mL lysate)\n                twice with 10 volumes of NT2 buffer.\n              \n                Resuspend beads in 5 volumes of NT2 buffer supplemented with\n                5 mg/mL BSA and 0.2 mg/mL yeast tRNA and incubate at 4°C for 1\n                h. This allows the blocking of the beads minimizing further\n                a-specific binding.\n              \n                Wash the beads twice with 10–20 volumes of NT2 buffer and\n                resuspend in 10 volumes of 1× NDE buffer.",

Make an\n            incision with fine blade scissor to expose the internal abdominal\n            organs.\n          \n            Unfold the small intestine and carefully displace outside the\n            ventral cavity.\n            \nNote: this allows the dissection\n              of the entire small intestine from the gastro-duodenal junction\n              proximally to the ileo-cecal junction and colon at its distal end.\n            \n            Place the entire small intestine on a petri dish containing 5 mL\n            ice-cold PBS.",
    "Open the intestine longitudinally along the antimesenteric border.\n          \nWash twice with 5 mL cold PBS.\n            Incubate in 5 mL PBS supplemented with 100 μg/mL cycloheximide for\n            5 min on ice.\n          \n            Scrape the mucosa with gentle compression using a glass slide.\n          \n            Resuspend the scraped mucosa in 1 mL cold polysome lysis buffer\n            (PLB).\n          \n            Keep into a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube on ice for 5–15 min.\n            \nNote: while the tissue is\n              incubating in lysis buffer, another small intestine isolation can\n              be performed from a different animal.\n            \nLiver\n        Follow the same steps as above 71 to 74a to identify and remove the five\n        liver lobes.\n        \nRemove the gallbladder and dissect out the liver.\n            Place the liver in a petri dish on ice and wash twice in 10 mL cold\n            PBS.\n          \n            Cut the liver lobes in 0.5 cm pieces with fine blade scissors and\n            incubate in 10 mL ice-cold PBS supplemented with 100 μg/mL\n            cycloheximide for 5 min on ice.\n          \nMince the liver pieces with a razor blade.\nTransfer the finely minced liver into a 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nIncubate in 1.2 mL cold PLB on ice for 5–15 min.\nNote: the volume of PLB can be adjusted to\n      the size of the tissue.\n    \nExtract preparation\nTiming: 30–45 min\n    \n        Disrupt the tissue in a chilled 2 mL Dounce glass tissue grinder.\n        \nCritical: To prepare extract from\n          scraped intestinal mucosa, 20 strokes with pestle B is usually\n          sufficient to achieve more than 90% cell disruption. A stroke is\n          defined as a single down and up movement of the pestle inside the\n          Dounce. To prepare extract from minced liver, 20 stokes with pestle A\n          followed by 20 strokes of pestle B are required.\n        \nNote: Depending on the intrinsic\n          fibrous nature of the tissue the type of pestle (A i.e. “loose” or B",
    "i.e. “tight’) and the number of strokes can be adjusted to obtain\n          maximum cell disruption. To generate extract from adipocytes or\n          primary hepatocytes, we perform 20 strokes with pestle B. By contrast,\n          to generate an extract from muscle 30 strokes with pestle A followed\n          by 20 strokes with pestle B was required. Verify complete cell\n          disruption by examining an aliquot of the extract under a light\n          microscope. Avoid excessive foaming.

By moving the tube slowly, the interphase between the\n                  two solutions can be observed. The ultracentrifugation tube is\n                  closed by a capillary cap and secured with parafilm before\n                  being positioned on the Magnabase Tube holder of the\n                  gradient maker.

None of these procedures affect the quality of the\n      tubes. Once the 50% sucrose layer is frozen, 2.4 mL of 40% sucrose is\n      added and frozen.
