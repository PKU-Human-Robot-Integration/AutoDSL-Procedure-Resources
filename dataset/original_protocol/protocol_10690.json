    "1. Development of LabView Program\nA mass flow controller (MKS M100B Mass-Flo Controller) is attached to the helium gas line to ensure a precise gas flow rate. This unit is controlled by an input voltage, ranging between 0 and 5 V. A control loop in the LabView program determines the required voltage at any given time. Interfacing between the computer and the mass flow controller is performed by a data acquisition device (NI USB-6009), and a 12 V power supply provides power to the mass flow controller.\nTwo positioning linear slides are used to control the movement of the 6-well plate, one for each direction. Each assembly consists of a MA15-series Velmex Unislide Assembly coupled with a stepping motor, and both assemblies are controlled by a single Velmex VXM Stepping Motor Controller. The controller allows for manual jogging of each motor or accepts a string of external serial commands, the combination of which allow for specific movement patterns. Several patterns can be programmed into the LabView program, requiring the user to provide only the desired torch speed as well as the path dimensions.\n2. Preparation of Equipment\nOpen both the helium cylinder and regulator.\nTurn on the motor controller.\nOpen the LabView program and verify all conditions.\nMake sure the platform is centered. To check, look at each motor stage and verify that each carriage is not near either stage end. Either have the program center the carriages or manually adjust by using the jogging controls on the front of the motor controller.\nIf this is the first run of the day, it is recommended to run the program once without cells, to ensure the setup is working correctly.\n3. Preparation of the Gas Jet Capillary Nozzle Height\nRemove the capillary from the holder and zero the height dial.",
    "Place the 6-well plate on the platform.\nReplace and lower the gas jet capillary to the bottom of the well until it hits the cover slip. Secure the capillary in the holder.\nUsing the height dial, raise the capillary 3 mm. Mark this height on the capillary base.\nRaise the capillary to a safe height and then remove the 6-well plate.\n4. Cell Permeabilization Protocol\nCulture adherent cell line to confluence on glass cover slips in a 6-well plate using standard culturing techniques. For HeLa cells, seed 6-well plates with 2 x 105 cells per well and incubate for 48 hr before treatment.\nPrepare appropriate volume of solution containing the desired vector. For hrGFPII-1, a concentration of 50 ng/μl in 1x PBS provides a strong fluorescent signal in HeLa cells 24 hr after transfection. For dextran studies, 80 μg/ml of 10 kDa green fluorescent dextran is recommended. Henceforth, this solution will be referred to as \"vector solution\".\nRemove cell culture media from well and rinse three times with 1x PBS.\nPipette 1,370 μl of vector solution prepared in step 4.2 into well. This should result in a liquid depth of approximately 1.3 mm.\nPlace the well containing the vector solution in the center of the platform. Lower the gas jet nozzle to the previously marked level indicating a nozzle height of 3 mm above the slide.",
    "Set helium flow rate in the LabView program and select the desired movement pattern to be used. Select \"Run\" when ready to begin the permeabilization protocol. There will be an initial lag period during which the mass flow controller is preparing to provide the necessary flow rate. Once the appropriate flow rate has been reached, the LabView program will activate the stepper motors to move the well in the desired permeabilization pattern. Once the platform has stopped, wait approximately 30 sec and remove the vector solution. Note: Optimal permeabilization occurs near a dynamic pressure of 100 to 200 Pa at the nozzle outlet, depending on the capillary diameter.\nWash well three times with 1x PBS.\nFill well with fresh culture media.\nRepeat steps 4.3 - 4.6 for desired number of experiments. Note: Be sure to include control samples which consist of wells being filled with the vector solution without the gas jet being run over them. Leave the solution in the control wells for approximately 1 min then proceed to steps 4.5 and 4.6.\nIf running an hrGFP transfection experiment, return 6-well plate to incubator for 24 hr to allow transfected material to be transcribed by the cells. If running a dextran permeabilization experiment, return 6-well plate to incubator for 15 min.\n5. Cell Imaging\nIf desired, immediately before imaging, counterstain with appropriate live/dead stain to evaluate cell death.\nImage cells with appropriate microscope to investigate transfection/ permeabilization efficacy.\nSubscription Required.
