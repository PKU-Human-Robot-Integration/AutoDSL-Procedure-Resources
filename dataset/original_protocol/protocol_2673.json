For our experiments, we perform 45 min of occlusion resulting in cortical and striatal lesions and 5%–10% mortality, as well as a clear shift in microbiota composition.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2328-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the surgical procedure of transient filament occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery\n(A) The filament is inserted between the first tight suture (1) and the second loose knot (2). The filament is redirected into the ICA and advanced until reaching the MCA origin.\n(B) Laser Doppler flowmetry graph of blood flow before, during and after occlusion. An acute reduction in the blood flow is observed when the filament occludes the MCA origin. There is a restoration of the blood flow to steady-state level after filament removal.\n(C) Infarct volume analysis and representative cresyl-violet staining of brain sections.\nAnalgesia/Anesthesia:\nInject the animal with analgesic (4 mg/kg Carprofen and 0,1 mg/kg Buprenorphine) intraperitoneally, 30 min prior to surgery.\nAnesthetize the animal with isoflurane.\nPlace the mouse in a chamber, maintaining isoflurane concentration at 3% for a further minute, before reducing to 2%.\nSurgical preparation:\nPlace the mouse in a prone position over a heating pad with the nose in the anesthetic cone (2% isoflurane)\nMonitor and maintain body temperature at 37°C with a rectal probe taped underneath the animal.",
    "Note: Be careful not to insert the temperature monitoring probe beyond the rectum to avoid any damage of the GI tract and contamination of the animal’s microbiota.\nTo protect the ocular surface of the animal during surgery and prevent drying out, apply dexpanthenol eye-drops to both eyes.\nDisinfect the area surrounding the left part of the animal’s head with a 70% ethanol solution, and make a 1 cm long excision, revealing the skull underneath.\nLaser doppler probe:\nAttach the laser Doppler probe to the left MCA territory to the parietal bone 2 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to bregma with a drop of glue, apply a drop of accelerator to harden the glue and secure the probe. Wait 1 min until the probe is firmly attached.\nTurn the animal over into a supine position and fix paws with tape.\nFix the fiberoptic probe to the probe holder connected to the laser Doppler flowmeter to measure cortical perfusion (Periflux System 5010, Perimed, Sweden).\nWrite down the value of the steady state cerebral blood flow.\nNote: If the value on the laser Doppler flowmeter is < 100, carefully detach and re-position the probe, before taking another reading.\ntMCAO – Arterial ligation:\nDisinfect the area surrounding the neck and chest and make a 2 cm incision in the neck.\nUsing a pair of forceps, gently separate the skin and submandibular glands.\nFix the sternomastoid muscle using retractors allowing the common carotid artery (CCA) to be visualized underneath.\nDissect the external carotid artery (ECA) and make a permanent knot at the most distal visible section.\nMake another suture on the ECA, close to the bifurcation with the CCA, and tie an additional loose knot for later use.",
    "Free the CCA from the surrounding connective tissue and nerves and perform a transient ligation immediately before the bifurcation.\nDissect the internal carotid artery (ICA), removing surrounding fat and connective tissue and place a microvascular clip, 5 mm beyond the bifurcation, making sure not to damage the vagal nerve.\nUsing spring scissors, make a small incision in the ECA between the tight and the loose ligations, being careful not to cut through the ECA.\nIntroduce the filament into the lumen of the ECA and move it towards the CCA.\nTighten the previously made loose ligation on the ECA to secure the filament in that position and avoid bleeding while removing the microvascular clip.\nRemove the microvascular clip and redirect the filament into the ICA until the origin of the MCA is reached. This is determined by the observation of a stark reduction (>80%) in cerebral blood flow.\nSecure the filament in this position by further tightening the loose ligation around the ECA.\nConfirmation of occlusion:\nRecord laser Doppler values before (steady state) and after filament insertion (start of occlusion).\nRemove the retractors and return the sternomastoid muscle and the submandibular glands to their original position before suturing the wound.\nDetach the Doppler probe from the holder.\nPlace the animal in a recovery chamber at 37°C for 45 min (until filament removal).\ntMCAO – Reperfusion:\n5 min before the filament is removed, anesthetize the animal in the anesthetic chamber with isoflurane as above.\nLay the animal in a prone position in the surgical area and place the snout into the anesthesia mask, maintaining isoflurane concentration at 2%.\nApply dexpanthenol eye-drops to both eyes and again fix the paws with tape.\nPlace the laser Doppler probe into the holder to allow reperfusion to be monitored.",
    "Remove the wound suture, using forceps to pull the skin and the submandibular glands apart. Gently pull the sternomastoid muscle and expose the surgical field, using retractors.\nLoosen the ECA suture securing the filament in place, and gently pull on the filament, being careful to avoid damage to the silicone-rubber coating during removal.\nTie the ECA suture tightly.\nConfirm the increase in the cerebral blood flow in the laser Doppler device (>80% of the initial value before reperfusion).\nRecord laser Doppler values before and after filament removal.\nOpen the transient ligation before the bifurcation from the CCA.\nRecovery:\nRemove the retractor and relocate the sternomastoid muscle and the submandibular glands before suturing the neck and head wounds. Place the animal in a recovery chamber, maintained at a constant temperature of 37°C for 1 h to recover. Afterward, return the mice to their cages.\nHouse stroke and sham mice separately, with a minimum of two mice and a maximum of 5 mice per cage, according to the regulations of the responsible governmental department.\nCritical: The total operation time should not exceed 20 min. Be careful not to disturb the vagal nerve and avoid excessive bleeding. If after several attempts cerebral blood flow is not reduced below 20%, the experiment should be terminated.\nSham Surgery.\nFor sham surgery, conduct the procedures as above, including the ligation of arteries without inserting the filament, and keeping the animal under anesthesia for a similar amount of time as stroke mice (35 min in total). Sham mice are not awakened during this procedure.\nSuture the wound and place the animal in a chamber at 37°C for 1 h to recover from anesthesia.\nAfter recovery, return the mice to new cages in a temperature-controlled room.",
    "Note: Sham mice should be housed in a different cage than stroke mice. Because sham surgery alone can influence the composition of the gut microbiota,9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] the use of naïve mice as a control group is not recommended, except as an additional control if desired/warranted by a different experimental design.\nAftercare:\nProvide analgesia every 12 h for 3 days post-surgery.\nAnimals must be closely monitored after surgery. Record weight every day, monitor for signs of sickness such as poor grooming and test neurological deficit using the Neuroscore scale.25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25],26[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26] Perform the Neuroscore at the same time of the day and use surgical scrubs to maintain a neutral scent. Additionally, the same investigator should examine each set of animals. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: After surgery mice may consume less food and liquid. This can be partially alleviated by moistening food pellets placed in the cage floor, providing hydrogel to the mice and by daily subcutaneous injections of saline, if needed. Food consumption and weight loss can also be monitored to control for any potential effects on microbiota composition.\nStool Sample collection, 3 days post-surgery.\nOn day 3 collect a fecal sample in sterile Eppendorf tubes from each mouse in the experiment and immediately snap-freeze on dry ice. Store at −80°C until DNA extraction. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSample collection and intracardiac perfusion, 3 days post-surgery:\nPrepare a 20 mL syringe containing phosphate-buffered saline and heparin (2 U/mL) and fix 1 m above the bench to facilitate gravity-dependent perfusion.\nInject 100 μL of ketamine and xylazine (120 and 16 mg/kg body weight, respectively) intraperitoneally to euthanize the animal. After 5 min, confirm cessation of spontaneous body movement.\nFix the animal in a supine position with tape and disinfect the abdomen with 70% ethanol.",
    "Make a 3 cm-long incision, cutting through the diaphragm, ribs, and sternum to visualize the heart.\nMake a small incision in the right atrium and insert a cannula into the left ventricle.\nPerfuse with 20 mL of PBS-heparin.\nDecapitate the mouse and remove the entire brain for infarct volumetry.\nFreeze brain on dry ice and store at −80°C until further use.\nBrain coronal sectioning\nTiming: 30 min per brain\nFor each animal in the experiment, cut 20 μm brain coronal sections every 400 μm using a cryotome (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Scientific).\nSet the blade and specimen head at −20°C (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Scientific)\nMount the brain on the specimen chuck using O.C.T.Compound (Tissue Tek, Sakura) and freeze using the quick-freeze function of the Cryobar.\nTrim at 50 μm until the infarct area appears and cut 20 μm of brain coronal sections every 400 μm until the infarct area is not visible anymore.\nCollect the brain sections on Superfrost Plus Adhesion (Menzel GmbH) microscope slides and store at −80°C until further use.\nCresyl-violet staining of brain sections\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nCresyl-violet staining is used here to stain serial sections of brain tissue from mice subjected to tMCAO, enabling measurement of the infarct size.27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]\nThaw the brain sections at room temperature for 30 min.\nPlace slides into a slide holder.\nImmerse slides in a descending series of ethanol solutions to remove lipids and fixatives from the tissue:\n95% ethanol for 15 min.\n70% ethanol for 1 min.\n50% ethanol for 1 min.\nWash slides in distilled water twice, for 2 min and then for 1 min.\nStain with cresyl-violet solution (pre-heated to 65°C) for 15 min.\nWash slides in distilled water twice, 1 min each.\nDehydrate sections before mounting:\n95% ethanol for 2 min.",
    "100% ethanol twice (5 min then 2 min).\nMount sections by adding 85 μL Eukitt Quick-hardening mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich) to the section and gently placing a coverslip on top. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Cresyl-violet acetate solution and Eukitt mounting medium are potentially hazardous, therefore these steps should be performed in a fume-hood with appropriate laboratory PPE.\nInfarct volumetry\nTiming: Approximately 30 min per brain\nInfarct volumetry is performed here using the Swanson method, allowing the indirect infarct volume to be determined accounting for swelling.28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28],29[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]\nScan slides using a scanner set at 600 dpi. Open the .jpg file with ImageJ and set the scale in the settings (Analyze -> Set Scale) to 23.62 pixels/mm and check the “global” option.\nAdjust the contrast and/or brightness settings so infarcts are clearly visible (Image -> Adjust -> Brightness/Contrast -> Auto -> Apply).\nFor each brain section, using the polygon tool, draw an outline around the infarct area.\nMeasure and record the area (Analyze -> Measure).\nRepeat the above steps for the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere.\nCopy all the mean area values (three per section) and paste them into the provided excel template[href=https://github.com/adamsorbie/Stroke_Microbiota_reproducibility/raw/main/data/Infarct_Volume_template.xlsx].\nQuantify the infarct volume by multiplying individual areas by the intersection distance (400 μm). Infarct volume is corrected for edema (swelling) by subtracting the difference between the total ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere volumes from the measured infarct volume.\nDNA extraction from fecal samples\nTiming: Approximately 2 h for 20 samples\nWeigh up to 250 mg stool (∼5–10 fecal pellets) samples and transfer to QIAGEN PowerBead Tubes. Include at least one blank extraction control, with no sample added.\nLet the stool samples thaw in tubes at room temperature.\nAdd 750 μL PowerBead Solution and 60 μL Solution 1 to each sample, vortex.",
    "Place the tubes in a PowerLyser LT(Qiagen) for 6 min at 50 oscillations per second.\nCheck the homogenization of the samples, if necessary, repeat for a further 2 min.\nProceed with DNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nMeasure and record DNA concentration and purity on a Nanodrop or similar instrument. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOptional: Most DNA extraction kit protocols already include a drying step after washing, where the column is centrifuged once more before elution, without the addition of any solution/buffer. This step is not necessary for all kit protocols, however, it can improve DNA purity in some cases, as any additional alcohol contamination is removed.\nPause point: Extracted genomic DNA can be stored at −20°C (weeks to months) for short-term storage or −80°C for long-term (months to years).\nPCR and sequencing\nTiming: Approximately 1 week to 1 month\nHere we provide a brief overview of the PCR and sequencing steps. In our laboratory and indeed many others in the stroke-microbiota field, these steps are outsourced to a core facility or commercial vendor, thus it is not within the scope of this protocol to describe these steps in detail here. Nevertheless, a basic comprehension of these steps is crucial for understanding downstream data processing. This overview only pertains to Illumina based sequencing (MiSeq™ and HiSeq™), however, as these machines are the most commonly used for 16S rRNA sequencing. For researchers who have the means to conduct the PCR and sequencing in house, we refer them to Reitmeier et al.30[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30] for a full protocol detailing these steps.\nAfter arrival at the sequencing facility, samples are diluted to an equal concentration and subjected to two rounds of PCR.",
    "The first PCR amplifies genomic DNA using locus-specific primers targeting a particular hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene e.g., V4 region, using the 515f and 806r primer pair.\nThe second PCR step adds adapter/index sequences. This allow large numbers of samples to be pooled and sequenced simultaneously in a single run. These index sequences act as a barcode allowing reads from a given sample to be identified.\nPCR products are then pooled and cleaned up using magnetic beads, leaving the purified amplicon sequences.\nPurified DNA is then diluted to equimolar concentration and denatured before being spiked with PhiX control.\nNote: The PhiX control is a DNA library derived from PhiX bacteriophage genome, which is used for calibration/quality control in Illumina sequencing, as well as adding base diversity which is useful for amplicons low base diversity targets like 16S.\nThe DNA is then loaded onto the sequencer cartridge and sequenced.\nSamples can be sequenced in either single-end or paired-end mode. In single-end mode reads are sequenced in a single direction, whereas in paired-end mode reads are sequenced in both directions, generating overlapping reads which can later be merged. Paired-end mode is currently the most commonly used option for 16S rRNA sequencing.\nDifferent sequencing platforms also have differing capabilities regarding read length. Illumina recommends 2 × 301 bp if using a MiSeq™ and 2 × 151 bp for HiSeq™ or other machines. Regardless, when using paired-end sequencing, the total read length should be long enough to allow significant overlap between the forward and reverse reads, to allow them to be successfully merged during data processing.\nOutput files are converted into demultiplexed (per sample) FASTQ files using the Illumina software bcl2fastq. Data is usually delivered in this format.",
    "Note: This protocol assumes raw FASTQ files are returned demultiplexed, i.e., two files (forward and reverse reads), or in the case of single-end sequencing a single file per sample. This is usually the case; however, some facilities may still provide reads in multiplexed format, along with an index file(s) containing the barcode sequences. If FASTQ files are returned in multiplexed format, cutadapt16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] can be used to be demultiplex reads."
