    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section describes how to collect FNA samples from cutaneous cancers and cryopreserve using a slow-freezing procedure, as well as preprocess the cryopreserved or freshly sampled FNA sample for single cell RNA-seq processing and single-cell data analysis tools.\nFNA sampling\nTiming: 20 min\nFNA is a minimally invasive procedure that allows repetitive sample collection from the same lesion. This enables the profiling of changes in cell composition over time, e.g., before and during the therapy.\nFNA procedure\nDisinfect the surface of the lesion with ethanol pads\nFix the skin lesion between the thumb and index finger of the non-dominant hand to stabilize and prevent slipping of the lesion and accidental pre-mature syringe withdrawal (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/699-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative image of a skin lesion (on the left) and the lesion fixation followed by insertion of a needle (on the right)\nAt the edge of the lesion, aiming toward the center, insert the needle on a syringe (empty) fixed in the syringe holder (Pistomed) at approx. 90° angle in bigger tumors and ca 45° angle in superficial lesions, such as plaques (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). In case of accidental piercing through the lesion, pull the syringe back to keep the needle tip within the lesion proceed to the next step\nPull the plunger to apply negative pressure once the lesion is penetrated. If the lesion is necrotic and you cannot create negative pressure, move the syringe within the lesion until it reaches a solid part and you feel resistance (creation of negative pressure) while pulling the plunger\nTo sample as many parts of the lesion as possible, move the syringe in and out within the lesion in a fan-shaped manner for at least 10 times without taking the needle out of the lesion",
    "Once tissue material (reddish or yellowish, depending on the tumor type and erythrocyte content) appears in the syringe hub, release the plunger to remove negative pressure and slowly withdraw the needle from the lesion. If the syringe hub does not fill, move the syringe to other areas of the lesion or troubleshoot for needle clogging (see below), if the whole lesion area was penetrated\nPut a bandage on the needle insertion site\nTransferring the sample to the slow-freezing medium\nAspirate the slow freezing medium to the syringe, which contains the collected sample and put it back to the cryovial\nKeep the needle in the fluid and move the plunger in and out of the syringe to suspend the remaining cells in the syringe hub until most cells are transferred\nClose the cryovial and keep it on ice until biobanking.\nAlternatives: FNA samples can be processed fresh. When planning to process the samples freshly without cryopreservation, collect the samples in 1 mL 100% FCS. After collection, transfer into a 5 mL Eppendorf or 15 mL centrifuge tubes and top up with 4 mL or 9 mL of any medium (RPMI or DMEM), respectively. Keep on ice and process as soon as possible, we have processed freshly collected FNAs within 2 h after collection.\nFNA live-cell biobanking\nTiming: 30 min\nKeep the collected FNA sample on ice at all times. Place the cryovial with the FNA sample in pre-chilled Corning® CoolCell® Containers (432001) and put into −80° fridges within 30 min after collection.\nLeave the Corning® CoolCell® Containers at −80° for at least 4 h and after the sample is fully frozen, transfer the samples to liquid nitrogen for prolonged storage.",
    "Pause Point: After the FNA sample is cryopreserved, it could be stored until convenient for processing. The samples could be stored in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 years. We recommend collecting at least eight samples to process simultaneously.\nPreprocessing FNA samples for single-cell droplet generation\nTiming: 60–90 min\nWithin this step, a cryopreserved FNA sample is thawed, assessed for quality and preprocessed for single cell droplet generation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/699-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preprocessing of freshly collected and live-cell biobanked FNA samples\nMain steps and troubleshooting are outlined.\nThawing the frozen FNA sample (work in the BSL2 hood for human primary material). When processing freshly collected FNA sample go directly to step 7.\nPrepare a 5 mL Eppendorf or 15 mL centrifuge tube and put 1 mL of cold PBS (Ca2+/Mg2+ free) with 0.04% BSA. A 5 mL Eppendorf allows better pellet visualization when the cellular content in the sample is low.\nTake frozen cryovials with FNA samples out of the freezer/dry icebox and submerge (not fully; only until the cup line) into a water bath pre-warmed to 37°C. Keep in the water bath until almost thawed. When a small frozen part (around 20% of the total volume) is left, take the cryovial with almost thawed FNA out, open, gently transfer the thawed FNA samples into a 5 mL Eppendorf or 15 mL centrifuge tube, and slowly pipette up and down several times.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS with 0.04% BSA onto a remaining frozen FNA sample and pipette up and down. This should melt what remains of the FNA sample.",
    "Transfer the rest of the FNA sample into a 5 mL Eppendorf or 15 mL centrifuge tube and bring the total volume to 10 mL with PBS with 0.04% BSA. Do not use big serological pipettes as this might result in loss of the cells on the inner surface of the pipette.\nLeave on ice for 10 min. This should allow the remaining DMSO to diffuse from the cells.\nSpin down at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant and re-suspend in 100–500 μL of PBS with 0.04% BSA. The resuspension volume depends on the pellet size.\nCounting cells and viability\nTake an appropriate volume of the acridine orange propidium iodide stain (AOPI, e.g., Logos Biosystems Inc., cat.#F23001) mix with cells, load on the counting slide (Photon slides, Ultra-low fluorescence counting slides, cat.# L12005) and count on the available live/dead counting machine (e.g., Luna-FLTM Dual Fluorescence Cell counter). E.g., To save cellular content we used 5 μL of AOPI stain, 5 μL of single cell suspension, and set the cell counter to 1:2 dilution.\nCritical: We highly recommend using live-dead cell staining; our best practice was AOPI as it allows quick viability and cell count determination. Check the sample images for clumps and debris. At least one filtering step is needed to obtain a single cell suspension free of debris. Sometimes it might improve the viability and cell number accuracy as the cell counter might count debris as cells (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for optimal, suboptimal and dropout examples images).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/699-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Examples of the good, suboptimal quality and clear dropouts from fine needle aspirate samples during preprocessing prior to single cell droplet generation",
    "(A) FNA_Sample1 – Good quality sample, good cell concentration, good viability, clear single cell suspension. Total cell concentration: 3.78 × 106 cells/mL; Live cell concentration: 3.10 × 106 cells/mL; Dead cell concentration: 6.76 × 105 cells/mL; Viability: 82.1%.\n(B) FNA_Sample2 – Suboptimal sample: good cell concentration, but poor viability, clear single cell suspension. Total cell concentration: 1.07 × 106 cells/mL; Live cell concentration: 5.55 × 105 cells/mL; Dead cell concentration: 5.11 × 105 cells/mL; Viability: 52.1%.\n(C) FNA_Sample3 – Suboptimal sample: acceptable cell concentration, good viability, visible fibers and cell clumps in single cell suspension. Total cell concentration: 4.15 × 105 cells/mL; Live cell concentration: 3.42 × 105 cells/mL; Dead cell concentration: 7.24 × 104 cells/mL; Viability: 82.5%.\n(D) FNA_Sample4 – Clear drop out: low cell concentration, poor viability. Total cell concentration: 2.01 × 105 cells/mL; Live cell concentration: 4.02 × 104 cells/mL; Dead cell concentration: 1.61 × 105 cells/mL; Viability: 20.0%. All image magnifications: 1.4×, taken by Luna cell counter. Labeled in green alive cells, in red dead cells.\nAlternatives: e.g., Cellometer K2 Fluorescent (Nexcelom) or any cell counter that supports AOPI dual-fluorescence imaging.\nIt is highly recommended to filter the cell suspension through a 35 μM cell strainer. E.g., FACS tubes with blue filter caps. If debris and clumps are present (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, FNA_Sample3 for debris and fibers present in single cell suspension), more than one filtering step might be required to achieve a fine single cell suspension.\nCritical: Wash the filter cap with 2−3 mL of PBS to reduce cell loss during the filtering step. Usually 10–30% of cell loss is expected.\nTransfer the filtered cell suspension into a new 5 mL Eppendorf tube (to reduce carryover of debris and fibers) and spin down at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Resuspend cells in 50–500 μL of PBS with 0.04% BSA and count with AOPI live/dead staining. For single cell droplet generation the cell concentration was brought to 700–1200 cells/μL. Good example shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, FNA_Sample1, good cell concentration, good viability, clear single cell suspension.\nProcessing cells for single cell droplet generation and sequencing library construction should be done according to the 10× protocol for Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ Reagent Kits v3.1 or Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits User Guide.\nPause Point: After the single cell droplet generation, the sample is processed for a reverse transcription reaction according to the 10× Genomics protocol and could be stored for 72 h at 4°C. See the 10× Genomics protocol for more possible pause points.\nOptional Steps:\nDead cell removal: If the viability is below 50% and cell number allows (>0.5 × 105), we recommend performing dead cell removal, following manufacturer instructions, using the EasySep™ Dead Cell Removal (Annexin V) kit (StemCell Technologies, Cat#17899) and EasySepTM Magnet (StemCell Technologies, cat. #18000) designed to deplete apoptotic (Annexin V+) cells by immunomagnetic negative selection. Manufacturer instructions: https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/DX21956-PIS_1_0_1.pdf?_ga=2.34218465.1547447083.1547219505%E2%80%93776976877.1534951026[href=https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/DX21956-PIS_1_0_1.pdf?_ga=2.34218465.1547447083.1547219505%E2%80%93776976877.1534951026]. To avoid complete loss of sample, we recommend putting aside 104 cells and performing dead cell removal on the rest of the sample.\nSlow spin to remove dead cells and cell debris: If cell number is below 0.5 × 105 a slow spin at 250 × g for 10 min could be performed to increase the viability. After the slow spin, it is important to check for cell pellet presence before discarding the supernatant.",
    "Red blood cell lysis: When the pellet appears red, a simple quick red blood lysis step could be performed using a red blood cell lysis buffer (RBCL, ROCHE, cat.#11814389001). Spin down the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min. Resuspend in 500 μL of RBCL buffer and shake at around 22°C for 3–5 min. Top up with PBS with 0.04% BSA (to 5 mL in 5 mL Eppendorf or 10 mL in 15 mL centrifuge tubes) and spin down at 300 × g for 5 min. If the pellet still appears red, repeat the step up to 3 times."
