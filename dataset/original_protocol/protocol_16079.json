    "In this protocol, we describe the procedure for enzymatic digestion of isolated mouse heart tissue to obtain cardiac interstitial cell populations for applications such as single-cell analysis and fibroblast culture. In addition, this protocol is utilized to obtain fibroblasts used in downstream applications such as fibroblast activation, wound healing, scratch assays, drug testing, and RNA sequencing.\nMaterials\nFreshly isolated mouse heart tissues\nBrilliant Violet 421 anti-mouse CD31 [390] (BioLegend, cat. no. 102424)\nPE anti-mouse CD45 Antibody Biolegend (BioLegend, cat. no. 103106)\nCalcein-AM (Biolegend, cat. no. 425201)\nZombie NIR Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend, cat. no. 423105)\nTruStain FcX PLUS (anti-mouse CD16/32) (Biolegend, cat. no. 156604)\nDMEM (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 88287)\nFetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, cat. no. 26140097)\nMagnesium chloride hexahydrate (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 413415000)\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Gibco, cat. no. 20012-027)\nPenicillin–streptomycin (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 30-002-CI)\n2 mg/ml collagenase type IV (Worthington, 270 U/mg, cat. no.

    "Staining Buffer/FACS buffer: 1× PBS + 2% serum + 1% BSA + 2mM EDTA\nCollection Buffer: DMEM + 2% FBS. Prepare 2 ml/sample.\nTissue collection and cleaning\n1. Sacrifice the adult mice according to approved animal protocols, open the chest to expose the heart, and displace the organs to locate the vena cava.\n2. Quickly perfuse the heart with ice-cold perfusion buffer by inserting a 25G needle into the left ventricle through the apex.\nThe needle is connected to a variable-speed mini pump, which drives a 4 ml/min perfusion buffer flow for a total of 10-15 ml.\n3. Once perfusion flow is initiated, cut the vena cava for faster perfusion.\n4. Excise the heart and rinse twice in ice-cold perfusion buffer.\n5. Weigh the heart (atria and ventricles), then remove the atria and weigh and isolate the ventricles (in our experiments, we usually utilize ventricular fibroblasts). Tissue collection is maintained on ice throughout the procedure. Immediately proceed to the next step.\nTissue digestion\n6. Mince the ventricles into small pieces using sterile micro scissors (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.840#cpz1840-fig-0001]). Add 50 μl digestion buffer to facilitate mincing.\nThe minced tissues should be easily triturated with the 10-ml serological pipette at this point. Avoid keeping larger tissue chunks for more efficient digestion and better fibroblast isolation yield (Video 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.840#cpz1577-fig-0004a]).\nThis video cannot be streamed at this time, please download the video instead.[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fef25dc4-15d2-4d09-9648-11f607c3cbc2/cpz1840-vid-0001.mp4]\nVideo\nThis video demonstrates the heart tissue cleaning and mincing steps.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ed46111c-e070-430b-9f21-7f98a3ffbfa8/cpz1840-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "(A) Mouse heart perfused and washed of red blood cells. (B) The heart is wetted with a small volume (50 μl) of digestion buffer and mechanically cut with scissors into small pieces. (C and D) The heart pieces are minced finely and made into a fine slurry. (E) After each round of 20-minutes digestion, the minced heart tissue is filtered through a 40-mm filter and incubated on ice in a 50-ml conical tube with the digestion buffer throughout the procedure. (F) At the end of the digestion protocol, dissociated cells (pellets) are ready for resuspension and analysis with flow cytometry or plating.\n7. Transfer the minced heart tissue fragments into a 15-ml falcon tube containing digestion buffer (2 ml per heart).\nIf desired, multiple hearts can be digested together. In that case, adjust the digestion buffer volume.\n8. Incubate the tissue fragments/digestion buffer mix at 37°C for 20 min with gentle rotation followed by manual trituration 12-15 times with a 10-ml serological pipette so all the tissue pieces can pass through the pipette.\n9. Allow the tissues to settle by sedimentation for 5 min, transfer the supernatant, and pass through a 40-μm cell strainer into a 50-ml falcon tube stored on ice.\n10. Wash the cell strainer with 1 ml digestion buffer to ensure most cells pass through.\nDense undigested fragments, debris, and cardiomyocytes settle during sedimentation, while the supernatant contains interstitial cells and cardiac fibroblasts.\n11. Repeat this process three times until all the tissue is adequately digested.\nFor each round, add 2 ml fresh digestion buffer to the pellets for a 20-min incubation, triturate, and replace the supernatant with 2 ml fresh digestion buffer. Note that trituration is performed with a 5-ml serological pipette for better digestion in rounds 2 and 3.\nPrimary cells cleanup",
    "12. Centrifuge the pooled supernatant (from step 11) from the three rounds of digestion at 400 × g and 4°C for 10 min in a swinging bucket rotor centrifuge without brakes.\n13. Resuspend the pellets by pipetting up and down with 10 ml of ice-cold sterile PBS.\n14. Spin cell suspensions at 30 × g and 4°C for 10 min.\nThis step removes most of the cardiomyocytes and large fragments of undigested heart tissue.\n15. Transfer the supernatant to a new 15-ml Falcon tube.\n16. Centrifuge the supernatant at 400 × g and 4°C for 10 min to pellet the fibroblasts.\n17. At this point, the cells are ready to be cultured. Approximately 200,000 fibroblasts are obtained from a heart using this protocol.\nFibroblast cell culture\n18. Resuspend the final cell pellet containing cardiac fibroblasts in 10 ml DMEM + 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and pre-incubate on a 0.1% gelatin-coated 10-cm plate for 2 hr to allow fibroblast adherence.\n19. Without disturbing the adhered cells, wash once gently and replenish the adhered fibroblasts with prewarmed (37°C) DMEM serum-containing medium (DMEM + 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin). Images of cultured fibroblasts collected every 24 hr over the first 120 hr are presented in Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.840#cpz1840-fig-0002]. TGFβ-treated fibroblasts (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.840#cpz1840-fig-0002]) show a distinctive differentiation state as evidenced by their increased cell size.",
    "On average, cells obtained from the digestion of three mouse hearts are seeded on a 10-cm plate or one heart per 6-cm plate. Change the culture medium after 24 hr. Before treatment, count the cells (within 48-72 hr after initial plating) and seed 100,000-120,000 cells per 6-cm plate. To minimize spontaneous differentiation of cultured primary fibroblasts, avoiding seeding these cells at a confluency level lower than 40% is crucial. It is also recommended not to allow these cells to reach 100% confluency for extended periods.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6694c065-d1b0-4dff-81d5-d1103e579383/cpz1840-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\n(A) Images of cardiac fibroblasts during the first 5 days after isolation. Approximately 200,000 to 250,000 cells are obtained from a single mouse heart. After 96 hr, the proliferating fibroblasts will number around 1.2 million. (B) Images of cardiac fibroblasts plated for 96 hr. The cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of TGF-β for 48 hr. Activated/differentiated fibroblasts are bigger, and stress fibers are evident at a higher resolution. Scale bars: 100 μm.\nInterstitial cardiac cell staining and FACS\nIf the cells are to be antibody-stained (an example of anti-CD31 and anti-Cd45 is detailed below) and then FAC-sorted, it is always critical to verify that cell viability is not less than 80% (Calcein AM/Zombie staining).",
    "A panel of controls is needed for precise setup of the gates during FACS, including unstained cells and individually stained Calcein-AM, Zombie NIR, Brilliant Violet 421 anti-mouse CD31 antibody, and APC anti-mouse CD45 antibody (an example is shown in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.840#cpz1840-fig-0003]). Collection tubes are rinsed with FBS before adding the collection medium; this will provide a coating that prevents sorted cells from sticking to the walls of the collection tube, reducing the number of drying and dying cells. The cell populations were sorted on a Beckman Coulter 5-laser MoFlo XDP cell sorter using a 100-um nozzle. The current protocol does not discuss the technical aspects and setup of the flow cytometry.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/46a44f4f-e088-41bd-a1ed-bbd8b4f3d2ca/cpz1840-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\n(A) Experimental schematic. Hearts are digested, the interstitial single-cell suspension is prepared, and live cells are FAC-sorted and ready for single-cell analysis. (B) Representative flow cytometry plots of isolated interstitial cells. Initially, gating aims to isolate alive (Calcein+/Zombie-) interstitial cells. The cardiac fibroblast enriched population (CD31/CD45 double negative, indicated by the green arrow), endothelial cells (CD31+), and leukocytes (CD45+) were collected. (C) Viability of the FAC-sorted fibroblast population is evaluated with a trypan blue staining assay read by Countess II prior to single-cell analysis. At least 80% viability is strictly required for single-cell analysis experiments.\n20. Resuspend the pelleted cells from step 5 with 1 ml of red blood cell lysis (RBC) buffer. Allow to sit for 3 min at room temperature. Add 9 ml FACS buffer and mix well.\n21. Centrifuge this mixture at 400 × g and 4°C for 10 min.\n22. Resuspend the pellets in 1 ml FACS buffer containing true-stain blocking antibody (1:1500 dilution). Incubate on ice while rocking (or on a tube rocker in a cold room) for 10 min.",
    "23. Centrifuge the pooled supernatant at 400 × g and 4°C for 10 min, then wash with 10 ml ice-cold 1× PBS, then resuspend the pellets with 1 ml PBS.\nIt is recommended to perform the viability stain (an example is described below) in a serum-free setup at room temperature. Therefore, we perform the staining procedure in two steps.\n24. First step: resuspend RBC-free cells in 1 ml of 1× PBS containing a mix of Calcein-AM (1:200 dilution) and Zombie NIR (1:200 dilution). Incubate in the dark at 37°C on a rocker with gentle rotation for 20 min, then add 10 ml washing buffer and centrifuge the supernatant at 400 × g and 4°C for 10 min.\n25. Second step: Resuspend cells in 500 μl staining buffer containing the antibody mix Brilliant Violet 421 anti-mouse CD31 antibody (1:100 dilution) and APC anti-mouse CD45 antibody (1:100 dilution). Incubate in the dark for 30 min at 4°C. Mix with 10 ml washing buffer and spin cells at 400 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Repeat the wash one more time. Next, resuspend the pellet in 500 μl FACS buffer and filter the cells through a 5-ml sterile round-bottom FACS tube with a 40-µm filter. Finally, wash the filter with 250 μl FACS buffer. Heart interstitial cells are ready to be analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.840#cpz1840-fig-0001]).\nDead cells release DNA into the sorting medium, which might cause cells to clump together. To overcome this complication:\n         \nWash the cells with 10 ml of 1× PBS to eliminate any EDTA.\nIncubate the cells with DNAse I (100 µg/ml) and MgCl2 (5 mM) in 1× PBS at room temperature for 30 min.\nWash the cells once with 10 ml 1× PBS containing 5 mM MgCl2.",
    "Maintain the cell suspension in 20 µg/ml DNAse I and 5 mM MgCl2 throughout the FACS protocol.\nDNAse I requires at least 1 mM magnesium to work effectively; 5 mM is optimal to minimize cell aggregation, so washing and eliminating any EDTA is important. In our hands, using 2 mM EDTA only was enough to avoid clumping in the cardiac interstitial cell preps described without using DNAse and MgCl2.\n26. Collect FAC-sorted cells in 2 ml DMEM with 2% FBS serum.\n27. Centrifuge the sorted cells at 400 × g and room temperature for 10 min and resuspend them in 100 μl FACS buffer.\n28. Perform a viability stain with Countess II to verify that the viability percentage is acceptable before proceeding with the single-cell RNA sequencing procedure (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.840#cpz1840-fig-0003]).\nIf you plan to perform RNA-Seq on these cells, resuspend the pellets in an RNA isolation reagent such as TRIzol before storing them at −80°C to maximize the maintenance of RNA integrity.\nWe previously utilized this protocol to isolate primary fibroblasts for RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) profiling (Khalil et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.840#cpz1840-bib-0011])."
