    "Growth AssayCollect spores from 3 to 4 weeks old Piriformospora indica plate cultures (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130617/20130617072321_9979.jpgFigure 1. Four-week-old P. Indica agar platePour approximately 5 ml sterile 0.002% Tween water 20 on 3-4 weeks old P. indica plate under sterile condition at room temperature (RT).Scratch plate with sterile Drigalski spatula and/or scalpel and mix.Pour spore solution through miracloth filter and collect flow through in 50 ml Falcon tube.Centrifuge for 7 min at 3,500 rpm discard supernatant.Wash pellet with 5-10 ml 0.002% Tween water 20.Centrifuge for 7 min at 3,500 rpm, discard supernatant.Wash pellet with 5-10 ml 0.002% Tween water 20.Centrifuge for 7 min at 3,500 rpm, discard supernatant.Resuspend spore pellet in 10 ml 0.002% Tween water 20, count spores with counting chamber (e.g. Neubauer improved) and dilute to requested spore concentration (e.g. 500,000 spores/ml)Inoculate 50 ml CM medium (Pham et al., 2004) supplemented with appropriate indole derivative (e.g. 2.5 mM TRP; 250 μM IAD or 1, 10, 100 μM IAA) with 400 μl chlamydospores solution (500,000 spores/ml) and cultivate for 7 days at 28 °C in the dark (alternatively wrap flasks with aluminium foil). Use mock inoculated flask as a negative control.Separate supernatant from mycelium using miracloth filter (check the mass of each filter before).Wash mycelium with 0.9% NaCl and let the whole miracloth filter with fungal biomass dry overnight in oven (85 °C).Measure the dry fungal biomass (= mass of miracloth filter with dried fungal biomass – mass of empty miracloth filter).Place 5 mm agar plugs from the 3 to 4 weeks old Piriformospora indica plate culture in the middle of a CM agar plate supplemented with the appropriate indole derivative (2.5 mM TRP, 250 μM IAD or 1, 10, 100 μM IAA). Use CM agar plate as control.",
    "Use ruler to measure colony diameter after 14 days of cultivation at 28 °C in the dark.  Detection of tryptophan and indole derivatives in culture supernatant by LC-MS/MSUse a 15 μl aliquot of P. indica culture supernatant obtained from section I point 2 of the procedure.Add 1 ml of 90% methanol.Vortex briefly and dilute an aliquot 1:10 in 90% methanol into a 0.3 ml polypropylene snap ring microvial.Analyze 10 μl of the 1:10 dilution by LC-MS/MS. IAA and ILA are separated on an ICS3000 HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex Luna 250 x 4.6 mm C18 RP-HPLC column with the following gradient0 to 5 min                 hold at 80% buffer A, 20% buffer B5 to 26 min               hold at 54% buffer A, 46% buffer B26 to 27 min             ramp to 10% buffer A, 90% buffer B32 to 34 min             ramp to 80% buffer A, 20% buffer B32 to 34 min             ramp to 80% buffer A, 20% buffer B34 to 45 min             equilibrate with 80% buffer A, 20% buffer BSubject the HPLC eluate to coupled electrospray ionization in the negative ionization mode and to subsequent tandem MS analysis on the QTrap 3200 mass spectrometer with the following settings:dwell time                                             75 msdeclustering potential (DP)                   -22 V (IAA), -30 V (ILA)entrance potential (EP)                         -7 V (IAA), -55 V (ILA)collision energy (CE)                            -15 V (IAA), -18 V (ILA)collision energy (CE)                            -15 V (IAA), -18 V (ILA)collision cell exit potential (CXP)           0 V (IAA),  -4 V (ILA)Quantitate IAA using the m/z transitions 174/130 and 174/128.Quantitate ILA using the m/z transitions 204/128 and 204/158.Employ commercially available authentic substances as references."
