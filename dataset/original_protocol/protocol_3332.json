    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nMADR Plasmid Cloning: Primer Design for Cloning of Sequences of Interest\nTiming: 1–5 days (contingent on time necessary for some of the steps)\nThis step describes the specific steps for primer design.\nDetermine the order of the sequences to be cloned together in MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/310-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. pDonor Cloning Strategy\n(A) MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE schematic representation.\n(B) Cloning strategy for fusion and sequential proteins.\n(C) Final MADR pDonor plasmid resultant of the cloning process\nNote: Different IRES elements can promote different ratios of translation of the proteins in the bicistronic mRNA (Koh et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). On the other hand, 2A elements while maintaining a similar ratio of translation add a 19 amino acid tag in the C-terminal region of the 5′ protein and a proline residue in the N-terminal region of the 3′ protein (Liu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Therefore, possible artifacts resulting from the 19 amino acid tag, N-terminal proline, or the effects of a differential ratio must be case by case studied to determine the best sequences order and selection of 2A/IRES elements. This is often a key consideration when choosing ordering of elements in tandem. For example, proteins recalcitrant to effects of the addition of 19 amino acids on the C-terminus should be first in a P2A-linked series, while sensitive proteins should be last as the additional proline is often cleaved without altering function.\nDesign primers for the 5′ sequence to be cloned in the MADR pDonor plasmid:\nForward primer (Fw1) should add an overhang which overlap with the MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE sequence immediately upstream of EcoRI restriction enzyme sequence (CTTATCGATACCGTCGACCTCGAGGGGGGG) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Reverse primer should add an overhang homologous to the 5′ sequence of the downstream sequence (the following fusion protein (Rv1) or the 2A/IRES element (Rv1′)) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCritical: In case of cloning fusion protein or using 2A elements with protein-coding sequences, the 5′ cloned sequence must lack the stop codon to allow for the translation of downstream sequences. On the other hand, while using IRES elements, stop codons must be maintained in place to ensure proper translation.\nDesign primers for the following 3′ sequence to be cloned in the MADR pDonor plasmid:\nForward primer should add an overhang which overlap with the upstream sequence (5′ sequence to clone in the MADR pDonor plasmid (Fw2) or 3′ sequence of the 2A/IRES element (Fw2′)) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nReverse primer (Rv2) should add an overhang which overlap with the MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE sequence immediately downstream of EagI/NotI restriction enzymes targets sequence (GAGGTTGATTAGCACCTGAGGAGTGCGGCC) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Rv1 and Fw2 primer can be complementary sequences in case of fusion protein cloning.\nDesign primers for amplifying 2A/IRES elements, 2A and IRES sequences can be synthetized or subcloned from other plasmids using overlapping primers with each sequence to be included:\nForward primer (Fw3) must be comprised of an overhang of ∼15 bp corresponding to the 3′ end of the upstream sequence to be cloned (not including the stop codon in case of using 2A elements) followed by the sequence corresponding to the 5′ region of the 2A or IRES element (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nReverse primer (Rv3) must have an overhang of ∼15 bp homologous to the 5′ region of the downstream sequence ending to be cloned followed by the complementary sequence to the 3′ region of the 2A or IRES element (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Note: Fw3 and Rv1′ as well as Rv3 and Fw2′ primers can be complementary sequences. Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] contains primer designed to amplify 2A and IRES elements with a Tm of ∼50°C. This sequences can be combined with specific overhangs to generate Fw3 and Rv3 primers.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_310_4.csv\nThese sequences can be combined with specific overhangs to design the primers Fw3 and Rv3.\nNote: Differences in cleavage efficiency between P2A and T2A elements have been noted in the bibliography. In our hands, P2A sequences showed higher cleavage efficiency as reported by others (Kim et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). However, these results are inconsistent with findings in other laboratories (Liu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Moreover, it is important to note that in case of using more than one P2A element in the cloning design (e.g., cloning three or more protein sequentially), codon alternated variants should be employed to avoid recombination (Szymczak-Workman et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Within the suggested source for P2A elements (Addgene #131462), two P2A sequences with codon alternation can be found.\nCritical: Cloned sequences must be promoter-less since MADR technology relies in an endogenous promoter to induce the expression in only recombined cells avoiding episomal expression. Fusion proteins and 2A elements must be in frame to ensure expression of downstream proteins.\nPCR of Sequences of Interest from cDNA or Commercially Available Plasmids\nTiming: >3 h (time depends on the PCR fragments sizes to be amplified)\nUsing a cDNA as a template, reverse transcription of an RNA extraction of a sample expressing the sequence of interest, or a plasmid containing the sequences of interest (mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, 2A, or IRES elements, etc.) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) prepare each PCR reaction in 200 μL tubes as follows:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/310-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. pDonor Plasmid Generation and General Schematic",
    "Protocol steps schematic: MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3Flag (cyto) WPRE plasmid can be opened by EcoRI and NotI digestion and used as a backbone to clone the sequences of interest which can be obtain by PCR from a cDNA from a source of expression of the sequence of interest or from a plasmid where the sequence was already cloned. By NEB assembly the new MADR pDonor containing the sequences of interest can be generated and validated both in vitro and in vivo\n12.5 μL of KAPA HiFi Mastermix in each PCR reaction\n1 μL of each primer (10 μM stock)\n5–100 ng of sequence template\nComplete the volume with nuclease free water until 25 μL\nSetup the PCR reaction in the thermocycler using as general guidelines the following scheme:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_310_5.csv\n∗35–40 cycles.\nConfirm by agarose gel electrophoresis the presence of the bands at the specific sizes.\nPurify bands with NucleoSpin Gel & PCR Clean-up kit following manufacturer instructions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nNote: Overhangs in the primers can interfere with PCR reaction; to avoid inefficient reactions, annealing temperature must be carefully set (usually by increasing the annealing temperature 1°C–5°C).The setting of this temperature is especially important when amplifying from cDNA samples where similar sequences can promote unspecific amplifications. In these cases, a two-step PCR reaction can be tried to correct PCR amplification. Alternatively, in highly complex sequence structures or complex gene rearrangements it would be advisable to turn to commercial services of DNA synthesis to sped up the generation of those fragments.\nDigestion of MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE\nTiming: 2 h\nDigest 3 μg of MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE with EcoRI and NotI/EagI at 37°C for 1.5 h.\nConfirm by agarose gel electrophoresis the proper digestion. Two distinct bands should appear\nTagBFP digested sequence band of 805 bp",
    "MADR pDonor plasmid of 5,107 bp\nIsolate and purify MADR pDonor band (5,107 bp) with NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up following manufacturer instructions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Alternative restriction enzymes can be used to linearize the MADR pDonor plasmid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), but to simplify the protocol we have focused on EcoRI and EagI/NotI restriction enzyme sites which flank the TagBFP sequence. In case of using other restriction enzymes, overhangs in the primers Fw1 and Rv2 must be modified to ensure the proper overlap with the digested MADR pDonor plasmid.\nHiFi Assembly and Transformation of MADR pDonor Plasmid\nTiming: 2–3 days\nAlternatives: While a number of different cloning methods can be applied, this protocol recommends the use of HiFi DNA Assembly or Gibson assembly technologies to avoid problems derived from the use of other classical methods (such as restriction enzymes directed cloning), where only restriction enzymes present in the plasmid poly-linkers that do not cut the sequences of interest can be used while digesting both the plasmid and the sequences of interest. Moreover, using restriction enzymes becomes increasingly difficult when building fusion proteins or including a high number of sequences within the same plasmid. Gibson assembly technology simplifies the process of cloning and is highly recommended in this case.\nFollowing manufacturer instruction, perform HiFi DNA Assembly of the digested plasmid and PCRs of the sequences to be cloned together with the sequences of IRES or 2A elements. In brief:\nPrepare assembly reaction in a 200 μL tube:\n10 μL of HiFi DNA assembly mastermix\n50–100 ng of purified MADR pDonor band\n1:2 molar ratio of each of the sequences to clone (or a 1:5 ratio if there are more than 5 sequence to insert in the plasmid at the same time)\nComplete volume with nuclease free water to 20 μL",
    "Note: To calculate the quantity of PCRs sequences to use you must consider the size of each fragment compared with the plasmid to clone into. For example, our digested plasmid has a size of ∼5,000 bp, if the sequence to be inserted has a size of ∼100 bp, to fit a ratio of 1:2 plasmid:sequence, you must add 4 ng of your PCR sequence for each 100 ng of digested plasmid. See following equation:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/310-Si1.jpg\nIncubate the assembly reaction at 50°C for 1 h and store at 4°C until use\nTransform competent bacteria with the assembly:\nThaw one aliquot of Stellar competent bacteria on ice\nMix 50 μL of stellar competent bacteria with 2 μL of the assembly reaction and incubate 20 min on ice\nHeat shock at 42°C for 45 s\nIncubate 2 min on ice\nDilute transformation with 500 μL of SOC media and incubate with shaking for 45 min at 37°C\nSeed 100 μL of bacteria culture in an ampicillin-agar plate and incubate O/N at 37°C\nSelect two or more colonies of the agar plate avoiding overgrowth or mixed colonies and miniprep following manufacturer instructions or validate by PCR the presence of the inserts in the plasmid and then miniprep (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nValidate the cloned sequence integrity with specific primers for the inserted sequences (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nRMCE-F primer (TCGACCTGCAGCCCAAGCTA) can be used to validate the inserted sequences from the 5′-end (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAddgene WPRE-R primer (CATAGCGTAAAAGGAGCAACA) can be used to validate the inserted sequences from the 3′ end (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIn case the inserted sequences cannot be completely validated with RCMEseq-F and Addgene WPRE-R primers internal primers must be designed to complete the sequencing.",
    "Validation of the proper expression of the cloned sequences can be done in vitro in MADR acceptor cell lines by lipofection or nucleofection or in vivo by electroporation.\nMADR Reaction In Vitro in a Primary Cell Culture\nTiming: 3–7 days\nIncubate the neural stem cells primary culture until reach 90% confluence in a T25 CELLstart CST coated flask.\nNote: Alternatively, proxy cell lines can be used. Primary cell cultures are especially refractory to lipofection, therefore nucleofection is recommended to achieve a successful MADR reaction. Original MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE plasmid can be used in parallel as positive control of MADR reaction.\nCollect cells:\nRemove media and incubate cell culture with 1.5 mL of Tryp-LE solution until detachment.\nAdd 6 mL of PBS and wash flask surface collecting the cells in a 15 mL conical tube\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 4 min.\nDiscard supernatant.\nCreate a plasmid mix with 2–5 μg of the cloned MADR pDonor plasmid and pCAG FlpO-2A-Cre EV with a ratio of 1:0.1.\nNucleofect neural stem cells with the plasmid mix using the Lonza mouse neural stem cell nucleofector kit in a Lonza nucleofector with the program A-033 (“Mouse NSC”) following manufacturer instruction.\nAfter nucleofection add 0.5 mL of cell culture media to the nucleofection cuvette and incubate at 20-25°C for 30 min\nSeed nucleofected cells in a freshly CELLstart CST coated T25 flask and incubate cells for 48 h.\nNote: Nucleofection can induce strong cell death; it is recommended to change the media after 24 h if there is a significant cell death to avoid a second wave of death in the cell culture.",
    "Depending of the MADR pDonor plasmid cloned, confirm recombination by the expression of new fluorescent markers and the lack of TdTomato and EGFP membrane fluorescence in recombining cells (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nPurify recombined cells by FAC sort against red and green fluorescence and/or by the fluorescent protein cloned in the MADR pDonor plasmid. Alternatively, antibiotic resistance cassettes can be included in the MADR pDonor plasmid cloning for culture selection.\nNote: MADR reaction with MADR pDonor plasmids which codify for green or red fluorescent reporters can be validated in TagBFP2 or dark proxy cell lines which have been engineered to lack both TdTomato and EGFP expression (Ayala-Sarmiento et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nQuantitative and/or real time PCR and/or Western blot, as well as any other quantitative or semiquantitative technique such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), single cell western blot or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), can be used to validate and quantify proper expression levels of the cloned proteins. While western blot or IHC must rely on antibodies against the specific cloned proteins, RNA based detections can be directed against the WPRE sequence, which would be common to any cloning following the present guidelines.\nMADR Reaction In Vivo through Brain Electroporation\nTiming: 20–60 min (depending on the number of mice and efficiency)\nMouse Pups Preparation for Electroporation\nTiming: 5–10 min\nMouse pups need to be properly anesthetized on ice\nPlace the number of P0-P2 mice you would like to electroporate in a small box on ice. Placing them prone on their stomachs speeds up the anesthesia process.\nMice will be fully anesthetized when tail tip pinch elicits no response.\nCritical: Avoid maintaining the pups for extended periods of time on ice. No more than 10 min should be necessary to ensure pup anesthesia.\nPrepare Glass Pipette for Injection\nTiming: 1–5 min",
    "Using the pulled needle fitted into the microinjector system, lay PCR tube with EP mix on side and guide the needle into the tube taking care to fully immerse the tip into solution, but not allowing the tip to touch the end of the tube (which causes needle breakage). Note: Tips should be trimmed (see Before You Begin In Vivo Electroporation) to guarantee enough pressure for successful injection. The closer the tip is trimmed to the base, the lower pressure needed to inject (see Troubleshooting). A representative trimmed tip is showed in Figure 4A[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/310-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. In Vivo Electroporation Strategy\n(A) Tip should be trimmed with sufficient length to allow access to ventricle, but not so long that you risk it breaking during injection.\n(B) 1 μL of plasmid preparation mixture should fit within the circular part of the “6” or “9” on a segment of Parafilm “M.” (Creating a reference drop by pipetting this volume of the DNA mix with a P2 Pipette is recommended.)\n(C) During injection, tip should be injected lateral to the skull.\n(D) When setting EP paddles, paddles should rest slightly behind eyes in order to access the whole ventricle.\nAspirate EP mix into tip slowly by turning the pressure gauge (right-most) so the numbers become more negative (range will be −10 to −75 depending on how viscous EP mix is). Using your eyes as guidance, monitor the mix being aspirated up into the pulled needle, making sure it does not go past the needle into the microinjector.\nBe careful not to include any bubbles as those can damage the microinjector, and can be fatal for pups being injected",
    "Check that one microinjection pulse emits 1 μL. This can be done by injecting a small amount of liquid into the negative space of a “6” or “9” on a piece of parafilm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Change pressure in iterations of 20 hPA on injector until 1 μL of solution is ejected.\nCritical: If using this moment as a pause point, it is important to make sure the tip does not dry out, causing blockage in injection later on. This can be done by either swirling the tip of the glass needle in the EP mix periodically, or periodically injecting. If you have waited a significant period of time (>10 min) check there is no blockage in the tip by test-injecting onto parafilm.\nPause Point: This moment can be a pause point in case the mice are still not anesthetized\nInject Mice with Pulled Pipette Tip\nTiming: 1–3 min\nInsert needle targeting one of the two lateral ventricles, using lambda as a guideline for injection, and keeping needle perpendicular to skull, penetrate skull with needle ∼2.5 mm, until there is little resistance (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C)\nInject EP mix into the ventricle by pressing the corresponding foot paddle.\nCheck ventricle under light to see that there is fast green that can be seen in the ventricle.\nElectroporate Mice\nTiming: 1–3 min\nSet Signa gel coated paddles on the outside of the pup’s skull, sitting just behind its eyes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D), make sure the positive electrode is on the outside of the ventricle you are electroporating (IE if you are electroporating the outside of the left ventricle, the positive electrode should be on the left side of the mouse).",
    "Critical: Make sure to keep your hands clear of the electrode, as well as keep the pup’s paws clear of its face. This prevents any short circuit in the electrical pulse for the user as well as the pup.\nPress corresponding foot paddle to start the electroporation, sweeping the positive paddle laterally along the skull (or in the direction desired to capture the region of interest). Continue to sweep paddle(s) until the pulses have completed.\nNote: You will feel slight pulsing in the mouse’s body as you are electroporating, this guarantees that you are getting current to the region of interest.\nRecover Mice\nTiming: 5–10 min\nMove pups under a heat lamp for recovery\nPups are ready to be returned to their cage when their coloring has returned back to a healthy pink, and there is reaction to tail tip pinching."
