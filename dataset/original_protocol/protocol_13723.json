  "procedures": [
    "Procedures outlined in this protocol were approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board.\n1. CT arthrogram imaging\nArthrogram18\nSchedule a trained musculoskeletal radiologist to perform the arthrogram directly prior to the scheduled CT imaging.\nPosition the participant on the table with the hip of interest in the field of view of a clinical fluoroscope. Place sandbags on either side of the ankle to prevent rotation of the leg and hip.\nPrepare the skin to create a sterile environment. Mark the location where the needle will be inserted (femoral head-neck junction) and anesthetize the soft tissue at the injection site with 2-5 mL of 1% lidocaine.\nPrepare a solution of 20 mL of 1% lidocaine, 10 mL of iohexol injection, and 0.1 mL of 1 mg/mL (1:1000) epinephrine in a 30 mL luer lock syringe.\nTwo to five minutes after the lidocaine injection, insert a spinal needle just until it contacts the femoral neck; verify the location of the needle by fluoroscopy. Inject a small amount of the prepared solution (<5 mL) and ensure that the injected fluid is contained within the joint capsule with an image from fluoroscopy.\nInject 20-30 mL of the contrast mixture. When additional resistance to the injection is observed, have a study team member manually apply traction to the hip by pulling on the participant's ankle while the participant grasps the headboard of the table to resist upper body movement. Inject the remaining contrast mixture, as appropriate.\nVerify by fluoroscopy that the contrast agent fills the joint space and covers the femoral head when traction is applied.\nTransfer the patient to the CT scanner in a wheelchair or bed to minimize the loss of contrast within the joint capsule.\nTraction and CT imaging\n\t\nHelp the participant into a supine position on the CT gantry.",
    "Place the hare traction splint device under the leg of interest, ensuring that the proximal padded bar rests just distal to the ischium. Attach the hook and loop straps around the thigh and ankle of the participant and apply light traction.\nAcquire a scout image and set the field of view to include the entire pelvis and proximal femurs to just below the lesser trochanter for the hips. Set a separate field of view to include the distal femurs and proximal tibias for the knees.\nApply additional traction (have one member of the research team pull on the ankle while another tightens the strap of the hare traction splint) to ensure separation of the joint space. Acquire images at 120 kVp, 1.0 mm slice thickness, 200 - 400 mAs for the hip and 120 kVp, 3.0 mm slice thickness, and 150 mAs for the knees. Use CARE Dose, an automated exposure control that modulates tube current according to image quality, to minimize the radiation burden to the participant.\nRelease and remove the hare traction splint device. Assist the participant to a standing position and ensure they feel comfortable putting weight and being mobile on the limb before allowing them to leave.\n2. Dual fluoroscopy imaging\nSystem setup\n\t\nApply anthropometrics19 to estimate the height of the hip joint based on the participant's reported height and use this measurement to estimate the desired height of the center of the field of view of the system.\nPosition the image intensifiers approximately 50° from one another on the side of the instrumented treadmill corresponding to the hip of interest (Figure 1).\nPosition the X-ray emitters to be pointed towards the image intensifiers. Ensure that the distance between the emitter source and the face of the image intensifiers is approximately 100-110 cm.",
    "NOTE: The recommended distance between the emitter source and the face of the image intensifiers will vary based on system specification and the collimator in the X-ray emitter.\nConnect the center of the face of the image intensifier and the corresponding X-ray emitter of each fluoroscope pair using strings or measuring tapes. Verify that the strings (or tapes) cross at the desired location (i.e., in the expected location of the hip joint).\nAffix the plate with three lasers to the emitter and the mirror to the image intensifier. Turn on the lasers and refine the alignment of each emitter and image intensifier based on the reflection of the lasers back to the laser source.\nCalibration images\n\t\nPrepare for the use of radiation by donning lead and placing signage on the entrances to the room. Minimize exposure by having staff wear protection that includes a leaded vest, skirt, gloves, and glasses. Turn on the fluoroscopes and allow the systems to warm up, as necessary.\nFor all calibration images, set the fluoroscopes to 64 kVp and 1.4-1.6 mA, or as otherwise desired.\nOpen the camera control software on the computer and select the appropriate cameras as slave and master. Use external syncing to the master camera from the slave camera to sync the two cameras.\n\t\tNOTE: For all recorded activities, save the same frames from both dual fluoroscopy cameras; frames are identified with a number representing the number of frames prior to the electronic trigger signal.\nVerify the alignment of the system by affixing a circular metal washer to the center of the image intensifier and attaching the crosshair fixture to the emitter.\n\t\t​NOTE: Once alignment is verified, it is important to avoid contacting the system.",
    "Attach the plexiglass grid to one of the image intensifiers using screws; minimize the force applied in this process to avoid altering the alignment. Acquire fluoroscopy images and save 100 image frames from each dual fluoroscopy camera of the grid. Remove the grid, and repeat the process for the other image intensifier.\nPlace the 3D calibration cube within the combined field of view of the two fluoroscopes. To do this, place the cube on a stool or platform that is radio-translucent and visually verify that most or all of the cube is within the field of view. Orient the cube such that the calibration beads do not overlap for either dual fluoroscopy camera view. Acquire images and save 100 image frames of the cube.\nBefore moving the cube, measure and record the approximate location of the cube's origin from each emitter using the coordinate system of the cube. Remove the cube and any associated platform.\nMeasure and record the distance between the emitter source and the face of the image intensifier for each fluoroscope.\nAttach the beaded plexiglass to a long rod or ruler with a rubber band and move it randomly to provide movements ranging the entire field of view of the system. Ensure that the research staff is mindful of the path of radiation and wear protection to minimize exposure (see step 2.2.1). Save 100 image frames of the motion.\nReset the imaging clock used to track exposure time.\nStatic trial and adjustment of parameters\n\t\nMeasure the height of the greater trochanter to ensure that the system height is appropriate for the participant.\n\t\t\nPalpate the thigh to find the bony prominence of the greater trochanter and locate the most superior point, as is possible.",
    "As the superior greater trochanter is approximately at the same height as the hip joint, measure the height from the floor to this point and compare it to the height estimation used to set up the dual fluoroscopy system.\nIf necessary, adjust the system height and recalibrate while the participant is being prepped for data capture.\nFamiliarize the participant with the fluoroscopy system and inform them that they must notify the research team if they come into contact with any of the equipment during the imaging session, as contact with the system negatively affects the accuracy of their data.\nHave the participant step onto the treadmill and stand within the field of view of the dual fluoroscopy system. Check participant alignment from the perspective of each emitter and take note of this position from the perspective of where each member of the research team will be standing or sitting during imaging.\nEstimate the imaging parameters (kVp and mA of each emitter and the exposure of the dual fluoroscopy cameras) based on the body mass index (BMI) of the participant and set each fluoroscope accordingly.\n\t\tNOTE: For the referenced cohort, fluoroscopy settings ranged from 78 to 104 kVp and 1.9-3.2 mA with camera exposures of 4.5-7.0 ms.\nAcquire images of the participant during standing and assess the images for contrast and field of view.\n\t\t​NOTE: Increased kVp is associated with increased X-ray scatter (increases noise and reduces contrast), lower image resolution, and lower contrast.\nAdjust the parameters and/or participant alignment and repeat image acquisition, as necessary.\nSave 100 frames of the final images to use as a static trial.\nDynamic trials (Figure 2)",
    "Prior to the start of the dual fluoroscopy imaging, have the participant walk a known distance while being timed. Use this to determine the self-selected walking speed for both level and incline walking on the treadmill.\nHave the participant don a leaded thyroid collar to protect the thyroid.\nDuring dynamic acquisitions, have the researcher manning the dual fluoroscopy camera control at the dual fluoroscopy workstation step behind the lead shield and watch the participant through the viewing window of the shield (Figure 3).\nFor the performance of all walking trials:\n\t\t\nInform the participant prior to starting the belt of the treadmill. Ramp the speed of the treadmill up to the appropriate walking speed and let the participant's gait normalize prior to collecting images.\nFor each walking activity, acquire and save at least two full gait cycles.\nFor the inclined walking activity, have the participant step off the treadmill. Unlock the treadmill, set the incline to 5°, and relock the treadmill before having the participant step back onto the treadmill to perform the activity.\nRepeat the imaging, such that the activity is recorded twice.\nRepeat the same process (step 2.4.4.3) to lower the treadmill upon completion of the activity.\nFor the pivot activities:\n\t\t\nHave the participant rotate their body position and feet approximately 45° from the front of the treadmill opposite of the direction of the pivot. If desired, ensure that each foot is placed entirely on a single belt of the dual-belt treadmill to allow straightforward processing of the force plate data.\nHave the participant perform several pivots to and from their end range of motion while watching for the alignment of the pelvis at the end range of motion. Ensure that the motion is performed smoothly as the pivot does not require acceleration to achieve the final position.",
    "Based on the position of the pelvis at the end range of motion, have the participant rotate and/or translate their feet such that the pelvis is facing forward on the treadmill and the hip of interest is in the middle of the combined field of view of the fluoroscopes at the end of the pivot.\nOnce the position is optimized, have the participant perform the pivot during dual fluoroscopy imaging and save all frames where the femur and pelvis are visible in both dual fluoroscopy camera views (approximately 200-400 frames) centered about the end range of motion, capturing as much of the pivot as possible.\nRepeat the imaging, such that the activity is recorded twice.\nFor the abduction-adduction activity:\n\t\t\nHave the participant stand in the field of view of the fluoroscopes and raise the leg of interest approximately 45° out to their side. Remind the participant to avoid torso motion and reduce the range of motion, if necessary.\nAcquire and save all frames where the femur and pelvis are visible in both dual fluoroscopy camera views (approximately 200-400 frames).\nRepeat the imaging, such that the activity is recorded twice.\nFor the dynamic hip joint center or star-arc activity20\nHave the participant stand in the field of view of the dual fluoroscopy system and raise and lower their leg anteriorly and at 45° increments of 180°, ending with a posterior raise and lower of their leg. Prior to placing their leg back down onto the ground, have the participant circumduct their leg and return to a standing position.\nOnce the participant is comfortable with the motion and can complete it in approximately 6-8 s, acquire and save images of the activity.\n\t\tNOTE: Only one activity is captured with dual fluoroscopy due to the length of the trial.\nAdditional calibration images",
    "If at any point during the data collection, the participant believes they may have come into contact with any part of the fluoroscopic equipment, image the grids and cube and save all the files for calibration.\nUpon completion of the data collection, image the grids and cube and save all files for calibration to serve as a backup if any issues arise with the initial calibration.\n3. Skin marker motion capture and instrumented treadmill\nSystem setup\n\t\nFocus the optical motion capture system on the treadmill (Figure 3). Due to the potential issues with visualizing the participant while in the field of view of the dual fluoroscopy system, be prepared to precisely position the infrared cameras to ensure accurate visualization (Figure 2).\nTurn on the system and use a set of markers to ensure that the dual fluoroscopy system does not prevent visualization of the desired field of view.\nCheck that the markers are clear and circular and adjust the focus of the infrared cameras, as necessary.\nEnsure that the fluoroscopes are covered to reduce any reflective surfaces. Review each infrared camera and mask the camera view if the reflective objects cannot be covered.\nSet up the motion capture software to read in an external 5 V signal from the electronic trigger used to end camera acquisition of the dual fluoroscopy system. Use this trigger to temporally sync the data from the two systems.\nCalibration\n\t\nOnce the system is on and ready, use the active calibration wand to simultaneously calibrate the optical and infrared motion capture cameras. Ensure that the entire region within the dual fluoroscopy system is thoroughly captured during the calibration while avoiding contact with any equipment.\n\t\tNOTE: Wand motions resembling tossing food in a frying pan have worked well.",
    "Due to the obstructions caused by the dual fluoroscopy system, calibration values may be worse than usually observed for optical motion capture. Perform the calibration so that all the infrared cameras have image errors less than 0.2.\n\t\tNOTE: The image error for the video camera will be higher, although still less than 0.5. The video camera is not specifically used for any quantification of motion, only for visual recording of the motion capture.\nDuring the acquisition of the cube trial for dual fluoroscopy, also capture the cube with the motion capture infrared cameras. Ensure that the cube has reflective markers affixed to it for the position to be imaged with cameras from both the motion capture and dual fluoroscopy systems.\nMarker set and placement\n\t\nBefore the arrival of the participant, cut and apply double-sided tape (toupee tape) to the base of 21 spherical reflective skin markers. To ensure the longevity of the markers, ensure that the tape or any skin does not come in contact with the reflective markers.\nFor each of the five marker plates (two on the shank, two on the thigh, one on the back; Figure 4), apply spray glue to the skin side of the fabric strap and wrap it tightly around the participant. Check with the participant that the straps feel tight (but are not uncomfortable). Clean hands of any excess spray glue before adhering the rest of the marker set.\nApply five markers, used only for calibration, to the clavicle, medial knees, and medial malleoli, respectively.\nApply the remaining 16 markers to the anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS), posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS), greater trochanter of the femur being imaged, shoulders, sternum, lateral knees, lateral malleoli, and feet (Figure 4).",
    "Ask the participant to inform the study team if any markers or straps become loose during the data capture.\nStatic trial\n\t\nIn conjunction with the static standing trial from dual fluoroscopy, capture a standing trial for motion capture.\nLabel all markers. If any markers are not visible by at least three infrared cameras during the acquired static activity, reacquire a static image to ensure that all markers are visible.\nRemove the calibration-only markers and have the participant don a thyroid collar to provide radiation protection during the remainder of the data collection.\nDynamic trials\n\t\nFor each of the dynamic trials captured with the dual fluoroscopy system, acquire motion capture video, ensuring that the entirety of each dual fluoroscopy video is within the bounds of the motion capture acquisition.\nEnsure that the break in the 5 V signal from the electronic trigger of the dual fluoroscopy system is captured within each trial.\n4. Image preprocessing\nCT-based model\n\t\nSegment the proximal and distal femur of the side of interest and the entire pelvis, as these bones are used for tracking and/or coordinate system generation.\nEnsure that the segmentations are representative of the bone shape in all three imaging planes and appear relatively smooth.\n\t\tNOTE: The ability to analyze arthrokinematics is dependent on obtaining high-quality reconstructions through careful segmentation.\nConvert the image data to Unsigned char (8 bit) and adjust as necessary with offset and scaling to produce an image with a range of 0 to 255.\nIsolate only the bone region in the converted image and crop around the bounds of the bone. Record the dimensions of the cropped images.\nSave as 2D TIFF format.\nOpen the image, change the type to 16-bit, and save it as a single 3D TIFF file.\nSurface reconstruction",
    "Generate surfaces from the segmentation labels, smooth and decimate the surfaces iteratively, ensuring that the faces are never reduced by more than half in any single iteration.\n\t\tNOTE: Using the described process, the target number of faces is approximately 30,000 for each proximal and distal femur surface and 70,000 for each hemi-pelvis surface.\nExport each surface as a surface mesh in *.vtk format for use as a model file for landmark identification.\nLandmark identification for the coordinate system\n\t\nIdentify landmarks of the femur for generation of the femoral coordinate system (Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: The parameters provided below are specific to the referenced dataset and imaging protocols; values may need to be altered to select the landmarks appropriately.\n\t\t\nOpen the proximal femur as a model file. Open the Post toolbar and Data panel to add a standard field of 1-Princ Curvature, select a smoothness of 10 and then visualize the result. Over-select the faces of the femoral head and use the select range option from the Edit panel to include only negative curvature. Unselect any selected faces that do not belong to the femoral head. Export this femoral head surface as a surface mesh in *.k format for a sphere fit to determine the center of the femoral head.\nUsing a similar process, apply 1-Princ Curvature to the distal femur with the smoothness of 5 and again select range to include only the faces with negative curvature. Export this femoral condyle surface for a cylinder fit to determine the medial-lateral axis.\nApply 2-Princ Curvature to the distal femur, using a smoothness of 3. Highlight the ridges of the epicondyles and select range using an upper cut-off of -0.1. Export these faces to generate a plane and use it to isolate the faces of the posterior condyles for the cylinder fit.",
    "Identify landmarks of the pelvis for generation of the pelvic coordinate system (Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: The parameters provided below are specific to the referenced dataset and imaging protocols; values may need to be altered to select the landmarks appropriately.\n\t\t\nFor each hemi-pelvis, apply 2-Princ Curvature with a smoothness of 5 and select range to include only positive faces to isolate the lunate surface of the acetabulum. Export the lunate surface and use a sphere fit to determine the center of the acetabulum.\nRe-apply 2-Princ Curvature with a smoothness of 2 and select all faces with curvature less than -0.15 to highlight the spines of the pelvis. Choose points on the edge of these spines that best represent the ASIS and PSIS as landmarks and record them.\n5. Bone motion tracking\nCalibration\n\t\nIdentify 12 beads within each of the cube images from the dual fluoroscopy cameras (collected in step 2.2.6). Based on the calibrated distances between each of the beads of the cube and the measurements of the location of the cube within the dual fluoroscopy system, determine the spatial orientation of each fluoroscope through minimization of the sum-of-squares projection error between the projected and known bead locations.\nUse the grid images to correct for image distortion and apply the correction to all images associated with that grid image.\nUse the motion images to quantify the dynamic accuracy of the system and use marker-based tracking to track it.\nMarkerless tracking\n\t\nAdd the location of the selected landmarks to the bone-specific parameters file and collect the dynamic position of these landmarks in the dual fluoroscopy system as output for all tracked frames.\nDetermine the frames that will be tracked (based on the kinematic data from motion capture, see step 6.1.2) and open the markerless tracking software with the associated bone-specific parameters file.",
    "Select a frame within the desired range with good visualization of the bone, and manually orient the CT-based digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) of the bone of interest (either the proximal femur or hemi-pelvis) using the six degrees of freedom available in the software (Figure 6).\n\t\tNOTE: As most trials begin in a position similar to standing, this initial position can likely be used as an initial starting point for all trials.\nOnce the DRR of the bone appears well-aligned in both views, save the solution by clicking the Manual button in the Solutions panel.\n\t\tNOTE: Every time a solution is saved, the orientation parameters and the normalized cross-correlation coefficient are plotted for reference. The normalized cross-correlation coefficient is calculated based on all pixels with non-zero values for both the fluoroscope and bone DRRs.\nApply the Diagonal Hessian Search (DHS) optimization step by clicking the DHS button within the Solutions panel and review the result. If the optimized result is preferred, move onto the next frame; otherwise, make any necessary adjustments, and resave by clicking the Manual button within the Solutions panel. Repeat this step until a satisfactory solution is found.\n\t\tNOTE: In the case of poor image contrast, the optimization algorithm may not always produce a satisfactory result.\nFor every fifth frame, repeat this process, using the solution for the previous frame as a starting point. Use the DHS optimization to automate the process.\nTo complete the first pass of tracking, use another tool that interpolates via linear projection (LP) and optimizes solutions between the tracked frames by clicking the Range of LP + DHS button within the Solutions panel. In the window, enter the set of frames to be tracked and the two frames to be used for reference.",
    "NOTE: The two reference frames can be any frames within the identified set of frames. However, the use of the first and last frames provides bounds for the orientation of the bones within the frame range, which can be beneficial when contrast is low.\nReview and refine each frame of the trial, using both Manual and DHS-based solutions. Use the plot of parameters to ensure that the correlation coefficient is sufficiently high and that the orientation of the bone does not have sudden jumps in any parameter.\nTo ensure accurate tracking, have another researcher review the solution for each frame and make any necessary modifications to the solutions.\nRepeat steps 5.2.1-5.2.9 for each bone.\nVisualization of motion\n\t\nOpen the femur and pelvis surfaces in the software for kinematic visualization. If necessary, convert the surfaces to meshes using the convert to mesh function. Select both surfaces and export as a surface mesh in *.k format.\nUsing the output from tracking, generate a text file with the coordinate transformations for each bone and frame.\n\t\tNOTE: The order of the surfaces must match the order of the transformations.\nFor visualization of kinematics, use the kinemat tool and the above two files from steps 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 to animate the kinematics. Verify that the animated kinematics look reasonable and that the surfaces have appropriate distance between them using either a semi-transparent surface or the surface distance tool. If necessary, return to step 5.2.8.\n6. Data analysis\nSkin marker kinematics\n\t\nWithin the motion capture software, batch-process all files to apply the static model and label markers. Once the trial is complete, remove any unlabeled trajectories.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the obstructions of the dual fluoroscopy system, more manual gap filling than usual may be required.",
    "Use the kinematic and force plate data to identify dynamic events, such as toe-off or heel-strike during gait or maximum range of motion for pivoting activities. Determine the frames of interest for tracking of dual fluoroscopy data.\nExport all trial data for kinematic processing in *.c3d format, including both analog data (i.e., trigger and force plate data) and marker trajectories.\nApply the desired model template file (saved as *.mdh file format) to the static trial, then assign this model to the motion files.\n\t\tNOTE: For analysis, a lower limb model with a generalized International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) head-abdomen-thorax (HAT) segment and the CODA pelvis, a pelvis segment model defined by the two ASIS and the center of the PSIS landmarks, was used.\nDual fluoroscopy kinematics\n\t\nIsolate frames of interest, ensuring that only contiguous frames that are tracked for both the femur and pelvis are included.\nFilter landmark positions using a lowpass Butterworth filter (0.12 normalized cut-off frequency from residual analysis and 4th order filter).\nUse the filtered positions of the landmarks throughout each motion trial to track the dynamic position of the femoral coordinate system (Figure 5).\n\t\t\nDefine the femur origin as the sphere-fit center of the femoral head.\nDefine the femur z-axis (inferior-superior axis) between the center of the knee and the origin, pointing superiorly.\nDefine the femur x-axis (medial-lateral axis) as the long axis of a cylinder fitted to the femoral condyles, pointing to the left. To isolate the region of the condyles to be represented with a cylinder, fit a plane to the epicondyle surfaces and isolate the posterior portion of the femoral condyles.\nDefine the femur y-axis (anterior-posterior) as the cross-product of the defined z- and x-axes, pointing posteriorly. Correct the orientation of the x-axis to create an orthogonal coordinate system.",
    "Use the filtered positions of the landmarks throughout each motion trial to track the dynamic position of the pelvic coordinate system (Figure 5).\n\t\t\nDefine the pelvis origin as the center of the two ASIS landmarks.\nDefine the pelvis y-axis (anterior-posterior axis) between the center of the two PSIS landmarks and the origin, pointing anteriorly.\nDefine the pelvis x-axis (medial-lateral axis) between the origin and the right-side ASIS landmark, pointing to the right.\nDefine the pelvis z-axis (inferior-superior axis) as the cross-product of the defined x- and y-axes, pointing superiorly. Correct the orientation of the x-axis to create an orthogonal coordinate system.\nGenerate the rotation matrix between the coordinate systems and calculate joint kinematics per MacWilliams and colleagues' Equation 11 (Figure 7)21.\nCalculate joint translations by transforming the vector distance between the sphere fit centers of the femoral head and the lunate surface of the acetabulum into the pelvis coordinate system.\n\t\tNOTE: This provides a single vector to represent joint translation for each image frame.\nArthrokinematics\n\t\nVisualize the kinematics as described in step 5.3 to animate subject-specific arthrokinematics (Figure 8).\nApply the surface distance data field to measure distances between the femur and pelvis surfaces during each dynamic activity (Figure 8).\n\t\tNOTE: These data also provide quantification of the relative distance between joint surfaces but require interpretation to quantify joint translation.\nExport surface-to-surface distances using the surface distance tool to quantify data across all participants.\nComparison with skin marker motion capture\n\t\nUsing the cube images and trigger from each motion trial, spatially and temporally sync the dual fluoroscopy and motion capture systems.\nTransform the landmark locations used for skin marker motion capture (i.e., ASIS, PSIS, condyles) from the markerless tracking coordinate system to the motion capture coordinate system.",
    "Combine these data with the marker locations from skin marker motion capture and import for kinematic and kinetic analysis and reporting. Adjust the analysis to utilize either dual fluoroscopy or skin marker locations for each landmark and compare landmark locations and kinematics between the two systems.\nSubscription Required.
