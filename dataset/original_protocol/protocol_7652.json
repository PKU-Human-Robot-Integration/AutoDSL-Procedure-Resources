    "Headplate installation Anaesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (~0.8 L/min, 5%).Once unconscious, remove mouse from incubation chamber and put under face mask and on a heating pad.Switch to ~0.8 L/min, 2% isoflurane, and adjust as necessary throughout the surgery.Apply eye ointment.Inject carprofen (5 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously.When placing a cranial window: Inject 15% D-mannitol (2,000 mg/kg) intraperitoneally.Straighten the head by supporting the neck with a roll of paper tissue or by using ear bars.Wet the fur on the scalp using lidocaine spray and shave the scalp with a scalpel.Note: Be careful to keep the lidocaine from flowing to the nose of the animal, which will block its airway. Use 70% ethanol to sterilize skin, spray lidocaine on clean scalpel, and cut open the skin from 1–2 mm caudal to the occipital ridge to the middle of two eyes.Spray additional lidocaine on the incision site and exposed periosteum.Pull skin laterally to expose the skull; cut the periosteum between the skin and the skull following the perimeter of the incision (see Figure 2A).Locate the anatomical landmarks Bregma and Lambda on the exposed skull.Make a small incision caudally along the midline to separate the thin membranous muscles at the dorsal neck region. Push away the muscles laterally to expose the caudal edge of the skull (occipital ridge) and the attached muscles (splenius capitis and semispinalis capitis muscles).Detach the muscles from the occipital bone by cutting with the fine scissors or scrapping with forceps (see Figure 2B). Avoid damaging the muscle by keeping the incisions as close to the occipital bone as possible.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4902/bioprotoc-13-24-4902-g002.jpgFigure 2. Headplate installation. Images show procedure steps corresponding to (A) exposure of the skull, (B) detachment of the muscles, and (C) preparation of the skull surface for (D) headplate placement roughly over lambda.",
    "Scratch the bones with a curette or the tip of a scalpel to remove periosteum and residual attached muscle. The exposed area should cover the dorsal surface of the skull from the rostral side to Bregma and the caudal edge of the skull and extend laterally.Clean the surface with 70% ethanol. Let the bone air dry briefly.Insert four paper points between the occipital bone and skin and underneath the muscle on the interparietal bone. This makes the area accessible for etching and prevents damage to skin and muscles (see Figure 2C).Apply etching gel on the skull and let it sit for 15–30 s until the bone surface becomes lighter and turns matte. Wipe away the etching gel with a cotton swab wet with saline until no etching gel is left on the surface of the skull.Apply bonding primer (OptiBond prime) to the skull using a micro applicator and let it air dry.Note: Make sure no excess amount of primer remains on the surface, i.e., it should not look too watery but can be a bit shiny. However, a desiccated over-dried surface will also hamper proper bonding in the next steps. Apply bonding adhesive (OptiBond adhesive) to the entire exposed skull with a micro applicator or a paper point in a scratching motion while applying some pressure.Note: The scratching action ensures that the adhesive gets into small pores of the bone and prevents these pores from closing up. Cure adhesive with UV light (see General note 1).Apply bonding adhesive (OptiBond adhesive) to the headplate using the same micro applicator.Position the headplate on the skull, so that the opening is slightly caudal to Lambda. Make sure the headplate is as close to the skull as possible.",
    "Too much adhesive between the headplate and the skull may prevent short working distance objectives from reaching the brain.Note: Positioning depends on the dimensions of the headplate and the purpose of experiments. A well-centered (lateral) headplate eases head fixation for chronic measurements and helps with standardization of position. Cure the headplate to the skull with UV light. Ensure that the headplate does not change position while curing.Secure the headplate with dental composite (see General notes 2 and 3). Make sure all gaps between the headplate and the skull are filled (see Figure 2D).Ensure the dental composite has solid contact with the back part of the skull (occipital bone) in addition to the top parts of the skull (parietal and interparietal bones). This gives extra strength to the skull, prevents accidental breaking during head fixation, and helps reduce relative motion between the skull and the brain during recordings.Fill up the rostral part of the skull with dental composite, with a bit grabbing onto the headplate. Be careful not to overdo it as this will increase the imaging distance from the objective.Close up the opening by attaching any loose skin to the caudal side of the headplate with the superglue. Pause point:  If desired, the craniotomy steps (sections B–D) can be done in a second surgery at a later date. In that case, apply and cure a thin layer of flowable dental composite on the exposed skull to protect the bone and then proceed to section E for recovery.Craniotomy Use landmarks or atlas coordinates to locate the skull region underneath which the IC is expected to be.Using a fine drill, sequentially thin away the skull (see General notes 4 and 5). Remove any bone debris.Once the vascularized middle layer has been excavated, apply a bit of saline to the bone.",
    "At this point, the bone should be transparent and mildly flexible once pressured with forceps or the drill tip.At this point, the IC is roughly visible. Use the cerebellum and transverse sinus as landmarks. The cerebellum tends to have small blood vessels running in the sagittal direction.For cranial window installation (e.g., steel ring constructs): check the position of the IC and extend the size of the craniotomy around it to accommodate the window. This is best done by first marking the intended extent of the craniotomy by drilling with the aid of a glass coverslip glued to a paper point. Because of the skull thickness, add an extra margin of approximately 0.3 mm at the skull surface to ensure the bottom of the craniotomy will fit the cranial window.Continue to thin the bone above the IC until it becomes membranous. The created funnel should extend rostro-laterally towards the sinus and a bit caudo-medially towards the cerebellum.Once the intended area is thinned, remove the debris and rinse the surface with saline. Make sure that at this point any bleeding has been stopped to ensure a blood-free brain surface when the bone is removed.Apply saline on the bone. Using a pair of fine forceps, very carefully chip away the bone above the brain starting from the cerebellum side (see General note 6).The IC should be rather white and have a shiny surface, compared to the more gray/dark tone of the cerebellum. The dura mater should be intact at this point, forming a continuous surface on top of the IC and the cerebellum.Note: Continue to either section C or D; the protocol is not compatible to combine both. Variant 1: cranial window for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging For pre-prepared cranial window constructs (e.g.",
    ", steel ring constructs), the craniotomy should already fit the size of the cranial window. If necessary, expand the craniotomy and avoid debris and bone shards on the brain surface.Fit the cranial window within the craniotomy (see General note 7).Apply pressure and hold the window in place. Apply a tiny drop of superglue with the tip of a paper point to 2–3 contact points between the rim of the window and the bone.Proceed to secure the cranial window with dental adhesive or cement (see Figure 3). Applying pressure to the cranial window is important to prevent growth of connective tissue between the glass window and the brain. Rule of thumb: if you think you have pressed too much, you are good. Alternatively, the whole window can be fastened with superglue for a removable window.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4902/bioprotoc-13-24-4902-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Gently slide the wire in-between the brain and the skull (see General note 9).Fill the well with the silicone gel. Remove bubbles and debris from the gel using fine forceps.",
    "Allow the silicone gel to set for 30 min.Secure the ground construct with dental composite, leaving the pin opening exposed. Form a sheet of dental composite that covers the ground construct and the rest of the exposed skull (see General note 2, Figure 4A).Make a cover by looping wire around the wings of the headplate (see Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4902/bioprotoc-13-24-4902-g004.jpgFigure 4.Craniotomy for in vivo electrophysiology recordings.

The secured chlorinated silver wire is placed at the edge of the craniotomy and slipped in between the skull and the brain. Scale bars correspond to 1 mm.Recovery from surgery When using D-mannitol, inject saline intraperitoneally at a volume equal to previously injected D-mannitol.Stop isoflurane and allow the mouse to wake up.Wait for the first sign of spontaneous movements and transfer the animal to its cage under a heat lamp or on a heating pad.For electrophysiological recordings, allow animals to recover for 3–4 days before performing subsequent awake experiments (Figure 5). For in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, imaging can start after 3–4 days of recovery. However, for stable, repeated long-term recordings, it is advisable to wait for two weeks after the surgery before imaging to allow the brain tissue to adapt and stabilize mechanically.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4902/bioprotoc-13-24-4902-g005.jpgFigure 5.
