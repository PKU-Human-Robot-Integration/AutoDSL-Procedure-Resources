    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGradient separation of mononuclear cells\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nIn this step, the components of a BM aspirate will be separated on the basis of their density to allow the isolation of the MNCs. After centrifugation of the BM aspirate with Ficoll medium, a density gradient will have formed, and the components of the BM aspirate will be separated into layers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). A cloudy white layer containing the MNCs (the “white blood cell [WBC] ring”) should be seen in the interphase, around the center of the tube, and collected.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2077-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Before and after gradient separation of a BM aspirate\nA diluted BM aspirate is loaded onto the Ficoll medium (left) forming a flat and smooth interphase (center). After centrifugation, BM components are separated into layers on the basis of their density (right).\nDilute the BM sample 1:1 in DPBS in a 15 mL or 50 mL centrifuge tube, depending on the final sample volume, and note the volume.\nAdd the same volume of Ficoll medium into a clean centrifuge tube.\nNote: Make sure that there is enough space for the diluted BM aspirate; if not, split the Ficoll into as many tubes as needed.\nLoad the diluted BM aspirate onto the Ficoll:\nTilt the tube containing the Ficoll at an angle of approximately 45°.\nLoad the pipette with the diluted BM aspirate and position the tip on a 90° angle against the wall of the tube containing the Ficoll.\nSlowly let the sample go down the walls of the tube and start forming a layer on top of the Ficoll.",
    "Critical: Be careful to not disturb the interface between the Ficoll and the BM aspirate. Pipetting the diluted BM aspirate directly into the bottom of the tube or using too much pressure will cause the sample and the Ficoll to mix and therefore no gradient will form, and the sample will be irrecoverable.\nRemove the accelerator and/or brake functions of the centrifuge and spin down the tube(s) for 30 min at 685 × g and +18°C–22°C.\nCritical: It is crucial that the accelerator and/or brake of the centrifuge are off during the first centrifugation step, and that investigators avoid shaking the tube, as any perturbance in the interphase or gradient may result in the loss of the WBC ring.\nCarefully aspirate the upper phase (plasma) without perturbing the WBC ring. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nIn a clean centrifuge tube, add approximately twice the volume of Washing buffer as the volume of the diluted BM aspirate.\nCollect the WBC ring with a pipette by bringing the tip to the surface of the ring and slowly aspirating while moving it in circular motion along the walls of the tube.\nTransfer the cells into the tube containing the Washing buffer.\nActivate the accelerator and/or brake functions of the centrifuge and spin down for 10 min at 685 × g and +18°C–22°C.\nAspirate the supernatant, wash the sample and count the cells:\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of Washing buffer by repeatedly pipetting up and down until there are no clumps.\nIf the sample had been split in several tubes, or if the pellet was in a 50 mL tube, transfer each of the 1 mL cell suspensions to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and bring them to a volume of 10 mL with Washing buffer.",
    "Take a small aliquot (e.g., 20 μL) and dilute it 1:1 with modified Turk’s solution for counting.\nMix briefly with the micropipette and add 2 volumes of DPBS or Working solution to achieve a 1/4 dilution.\nNote: If the cell density is too high for counting, further dilute the suspension as needed.\nCount the nuclei in a hemocytometer and calculate the total number of MNCs in the sample.\nConsidering cell counts, take an aliquot containing 0.5–2 million cells for flow cytometry analysis and transfer it to a microcentrifuge tube.\nFixate the MNCs in the aliquot for future use by adding 1:1 volume of Streck™ cell preservative and store the aliquot following the equipment-specific manufacturer’s specifications[href=https://www.streck.com/wp-content/uploads/sync/Flow_Cytometry/Streck_Cell_Preservative/01_Instructions_(IFU)/01_Streck_Cell_Preservative_IFU.pdf].\nNote: The MNCs will be analyzed by flow cytometry alongside the cultured cells and be used as a reference of the HSPCs in their native BM frequencies in order to confidently set the flow cytometry gates for data analysis, as the cellularity in the cultured samples will be significantly lower.\nCritical: Do not store fixated samples for longer than 1 week (less than 5 days is preferable).\nOptional: Instead of fixating the MNCs, investigators may choose to preserve the aliquot on ice until the HSPCs have been isolated and cultured (after step 32), and then prepare the MNCs for flow cytometry and analyze them fresh on the same day. The recorded sample will later need to be included in the data analysis along with the cultured cells (step 47).\nCentrifuge the rest of the cell suspension for 5 min at 475 × g and 4°C and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of Washing solution and transfer the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube.\nMagnetic enrichment of the MNC fraction\nTiming: 1–1.5 h",
    "To minimize sample processing times and avoid subjecting the cells to high mechanic stress such as the one inherent to fluorescent-activated cell sorting, CD34+ HSPCs will be isolated by magnetic enrichment. BM MNCs will be labeled cells with an anti-CD34 antibody conjugated with magnetic beads and subsequently eluted through a magnetic column which will selectively retain CD34+ cells. This step can be performed following manufacturer’s specifications[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001498.PDF], but here we offer an optimized protocol for working with low cell numbers and preserving their viability.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 300 × g in a tabletop centrifuge at 4°C and aspirate the supernatant using a micropipette.\nStain the sample using the CD34 MicroBead Kit:\nResuspend the pellet in 300 μL of 1× MACS Rinsing solution.\nAdd 100 μL of FcR block and 100 μL of anti-CD34 beads.\nMix by lightly pipetting up and down.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min.\nNote: Volumes provided in step 16 are for cell numbers below 100 million. If a sample yielded more cells, investigators would need to adjust the volumes accordingly.\nDuring incubation, prepare a magnetic column by placing it on the separator and condition it by adding 3 mL of 1× MACS Rinsing solution and letting it elute into a tube or tray (discard).\nAfter incubation, wash the cell suspension by adding 500 μL of Washing solution into the tube and mix by pipetting up and down.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g and 4°C and aspirate the supernatant using a micropipette.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of 1× MACS Rinsing solution for every 100 million cells and load the suspension into the column.",
    "Optional: If you would like to isolate other cell types from the same sample, place a 15 mL centrifuge tube under the column and on ice to collect the cell fraction enriched in CD34- cells. In step 23 and onwards, proceed in parallel with the CD34+ cells.\nElute the CD34- cell fraction:\nLet the cell suspension go through the column entirely (until the upper part is completely dry).\nAdd 2 mL of 1× MACS Rinsing solution to wash and let it elute entirely.\nRepeat step b.\nElute the CD34+ cell fraction:\nPlace a clean 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 1 mL of Washing solution under the column and on ice and remove the column from the separator.\nCritical: If using the QuadroMACS™ Separator, do not remove or add any columns while a cell suspension or wash is eluting, as a perturbance in the magnetic field may release the retained positive cells. When working with more than one column, wait until all have finished eluting before removing any of them.\nAdd 5 mL of 1× MACS Rinsing solution to the column.\nUse the provided plunger to apply gentle pressure to the column and quickly elute the cells that had been retained.\nAdd 5 mL of Washing buffer to the tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 475 × g and 4°C to pellet the cells.\nDiscard the supernatant by aspiration or decantation and remove any leftovers with a micropipette.\nResuspend the CD34+ pellet with 0.5–1 mL (depending on its size) of pre-warmed HSPC Culture medium (or Washing buffer for the CD34- fraction) and transfer the cells to a microcentrifuge tube.\nCulturing and treatment of HSPCs\nTiming: 20–30 min + culture time (1–3 days)",
    "In this step, isolated CD34+ cells will be cultured and treated with the drugs of choice of the investigator. To preserve cell viability in culture, isolated CD34+ HSPCs will be seeded over a layer of previously-plated healthy MSCs. Cells will be cultured in a cytokine-free medium to prevent expansion and differentiation of the cells, which should preserve their original hierarchy for the duration of this step. Thus, the readout of this experiment will be the quantification of the surviving HSPCs in distinct differentiation states by flow cytometry.\nCritical: After magnetic purification, CD34+ cells will be very sensitive to stress. This is a time-sensitive step that should be completed as quickly as possible. Isolated cells should be kept on ice until plating and investigators should avoid performing additional centrifugations.\nImmediately after homogenizing and transferring the cell suspension, take a 10 μL aliquot and combine it with Trypan blue (1:1).\nCount the number of live cells and calculate the number of wells that can be plated and/or the final cell density per well, as well as the volume of cell suspension and of fresh medium needed in each well (final volume = 0.5 mL/well in 48-well plates or 1 mL/well in 24-well plates). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: Between 10,000–100,000 cells can be plated per well in 48-well plates; twice as many per well can be plated in 24-well plates. If lower cell numbers are obtained, investigators can also scale down and use 96-well plates seeded with a proportional number of MSCs.",
    "Note: When planning the number of cultured wells per sample, investigators should account for the corresponding controls (solvent, negative controls, inhibitory controls) pertinent to their experiment. Whenever possible, technical replicates should be cultured. Duplicates are sufficient, but triplicates may be plated if enough cells are available. However, we recommend prioritizing on culturing the highest possible number of cells per well instead of many wells per condition. If the number of cells obtained is low, it is preferable to plate single wells per condition and later combine the results with those of biological replicates (other patients’ samples) during the statistical analysis.\nPrepare the culture plates:\nUsing a micropipette, remove the medium from the MSC cultures without touching the bottom of the well.\nCarefully add 0.5–1 mL of pre-warmed DPBS to each well by placing the tip of the micropipette on the walls.\nSwirl the plate and aspirate the DPBS with the micropipette to remove any dead cells left.\nAdd the corresponding volume of pre-warmed HSPC Culture medium calculated in step 27 to each well.\nSplit the cells into the wells as needed.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 2–16 h before treating them.\nNote: De visu assessment of cellularity and viability under the microscope before treating the cells is recommended.\nAdd the corresponding drug and solvent solutions to each well and mix well by moving the plate horizontally in several directions in a cross-like pattern. Avoid mixing by pipetting to prevent cell loss.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24–72 h (or up to 5 days) as needed before proceeding to assessing the results by flow cytometry analysis.\nFlow cytometry preparation\nTiming: 1.5–2 h",
    "This step involves the staining of the MNCs aliquoted after gradient separation (step 12) and the cultured CD34+ cell fraction for flow cytometry analysis of the immunophenotypic HSPC subpopulations (Will et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Pang et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Counting beads will be added to each of the cultured cell tubes and used as internal standards to normalize the number of cells recorded per sample, which will allow a more precise calculation of the absolute number of live cells per well.\nNote: De visu assessment of cellularity and viability under the microscope before beginning for comparison with the pre-treatment status is recommended. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nUsing a micropipette, briefly mix the contents of each well by pipetting up and down 2–3 times and transfer the cell suspensions to microcentrifuge tubes.\nWash the wells:\nAdd 250–500 μL of pre-warmed Washing solution to each well.\nGently pipette up and down 2–3 times.\nTransfer the content of each well to the corresponding tube, combining it with the previously collected cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the tubes, as well as the MNCs fixated in step 12, at 300 × g and 4°C for 10 min.\nOptional: If an unstained flow cytometry control is needed, collect a small aliquot (10%–20% v/v) of the MNCs before proceeding to step 35 and centrifuge them along with the rest of the MNCs and the CD34+ cells; then, keep them on ice until step 42. Proceed as with single color controls.\nDuring centrifugation, prepare enough volume of the HSPC Staining cocktail indicated in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment], considering that cultured samples require half of the volume of a fresh/fixated sample.",
    "Note: Some of the antigens included in the “dump gate” of the flow cytometry panel (CD7, CD10) are sometimes expressed at low levels by normal HSPCs. Therefore, if investigators are using healthy donor samples as controls in this protocol, a separate antibody staining cocktail without anti-CD7 and anti-CD10 should be used with those samples.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatants using a micropipette.\nCritical: After centrifugation, CD34+ cell pellets will be very small, so a marginal volume of supernatant can be left in the tube to avoid touching the pellet with the tip.\nAdd 100 μL of HSPC Staining cocktail to the MNCs sample, or 50 μL to each cultured sample, and mix briefly with the tip.\nIncubate samples for 30–45 min at 4°C and protected from light.\nDuring incubation, prepare single-color controls:\nVortex OneComp eBeads thoroughly and aliquot 500 μL in a microcentrifuge tube.\nPipette 50 μL of beads into microcentrifuge tubes pre-labeled with the names of the 6 fluorochromes used in this panel.\nAdd 50 μL of Working solution to each tube, for a final volume of 100 μL.\nIn each tube, add the following volumes of the corresponding antibodies and mix by vortexing.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2077_10.csv\nIncubate for 15–30 min at 4°C and protected from light and proceed to step 42 in parallel with the MNCs and CD34+-enriched cells.\nDuring incubation, prepare flow cytometry tubes for the cultured CD34+ samples by adding 5 μL of counting beads, thoroughly mixed for 1 min, to each tube using reverse pipetting (see manufacturer’s specifications[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FPCB100_accucheck_beads_man.pdf]). If using strainer caps, remove the caps prior to adding the beads and then recap the tubes. Keep tubes at 4°C and protected from light.\nNote: Do not add counting beads to unstained and single-color control tubes.",
    "Critical: Precise pipetting is essential for the calculation of absolute cell numbers using counting beads. Investigators should make sure to use well calibrated pipettes.\nAfter incubation, add 100 μL of Washing solution to each tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g and 4°C.\nDuring centrifugation, prepare enough volume of the SYTOX Green solution indicated in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nNote: The SYTOX Green solution will only be needed to stain the MNCs and CD34+ cells but not the unstained and single-color controls.\nAspirate the supernatants with a micropipette. A marginal volume can be left in CD34+ cell tubes.\nResuspend cell pellets, except for the unstained control, in 250–500 μL (CD34+ cells, in 250–300 μL; MNCs, in 350–500 μL) of SYTOX Green solution, and bead pellets, as well as the unstained control, in 350–500 μL of Working solution and transfer the corresponding suspensions into pre-labeled flow cytometry tubes.\nCritical: Keep flow cytometry tubes at 4°C and protected from light until analysis.\nProceed to flow cytometry analysis following instrument-specific instructions.\nNote: Set the recording limit to 200,000–500,000 events (or the entire sample) in order to ensure the recording of enough cells in each HSPC gate, particularly in cultured samples.\nCritical: Use the total BM MNCs fixated in step 12 and stained in parallel with the cultured samples to set up or adjust the flow cytometry template, not the cultured samples containing counting beads. Record cultured samples entirely. To record counting beads, set a low value for threshold or discriminator in the FSC channel. To ensure accuracy in cell number quantification, make sure to collect a minimum of 1,000 beads while recording each sample.\nFlow cytometry data analysis\nTiming: 1–3 h",
    "This step involves setting up the gates for analysis and quantification of the HSPC hierarchies in fresh and cultured MDS BM samples. Information on how to set up a flow cytometry template or manipulate the equipment for recording are not detailed here as steps will vary with the instrument and user-specific circumstances.\nOur flow cytometry panel contains 5 antibodies against HSPC-specific markers and 12 antibodies against lineage markers, all of which are conjugated with FITC and will serve to discriminate all lineage-positive (Lin+) cells from the Lin- HSPCs. A green viability dye, SYTOX Green, will be detected in the same channel as FITC to simultaneously exclude dead cells (we refer to the FITC+ gate as the “dump gate”). Therefore, this particular staining is not useful for the analysis of mature BM cell populations. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nUse the MNCs sample to set the gates as follows (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]): troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2077-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
