    "1. Animals\nAll rats are treated in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and approval for all the experimental procedures was granted by the Concordia University Animal Research Ethics Committee.\nObtain rats at 275-300 g (males) or 225-250 g (females). House rats in pairs until surgery in standard plastic cages containing corncob bedding and shredded paper.\nMaintain rats on a reversed light-dark cycle (light off at 9:30 AM).\nMake sure food and water are available ad libitum, except during the abstinence period. We use a regular rat chow (20.9% protein, 67.2% carbohydrates and 11.8% fat).\n2. Catheters and Connectors\nMake catheters in bulk and use as needed over a long period of time following autoclave sterilization.\nCut the Silastic tubing to 12 cm long pieces.\n\t\nUse a toothpick, to place a small drop of silicon around the catheter, 3 cm from the tip.\nLet the silicon dry for 24 hr and then autoclave and store the catheters.\nBend the long tube of the \"5-up\" cannula, that will serve as a connector, in a right angle to the plastic pedestal, then autoclave and store.\nAssemble, aseptically, the catheters on the day of the surgery, by pushing the \"long\" side of the Silastic tube over the bent metal tube of the \"5-up\" cannula, about half way to the plastic pedestal.\n\t\nConnect the \"5-up\" tube via Tygon tubing and a blunted 22 G needle to a 1 ml syringe filled with sterile saline.\nFlush saline through the catheter to ensure unobstructed flow.\n3. Intravenous Catheterization Surgery\nAllow the rats one week of acclimatization in the animal care facility (ACF) before surgery. Do not perform the surgery on rats with body weights lower than 300-325 g (males) or 250-275 g (females).",
    "Before surgery weigh and anesthetize the rats with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (90/13 mg/kg; i.p.).\n\t\nShave, and then clean the head and the area on the right shoulder (close to base of the neck) with alcohol and surgical scrub.\nInject penicillin (450,000 IU/rat, s.c.) to protect against infection, and 2 ml of saline (s.c.) for hydration. Apply tear gel to the rat's eyes to prevent dryness induced by anesthesia.\nPlace the rat on its abdomen and make an incision, using a scalpel, at the top of the head, between the eyes, and caudally towards the ears of the rat.\nPlace the rat on its back with the forearms taped to the surface. Lift the skin in the incision area, just rostral to the clavicle, with forceps and make a 1 cm longitudinal cut with small scissors.\nUsing two straight forceps, separate the fat and other tissue until the external jugular vein is exposed.\nPush the tips of straight forceps under the vein to lift and separate the vein from surrounding tissue. Carefully clean the vein from any adhering tissue and then insert curved forceps under the vein to keep it lifted and slightly stretched.\nMake a small, v-shaped, cut on the upper surface of the vein using small spring scissors.\n\t\nHold the cut open using a vessel dilator, and advance the \"short\", 3 cm tip of the catheter into the vein towards the heart until the silicone drop is at the incision point.\nTie the catheter to the vein with 3 sutures: one as far caudal as possible, one just rostral to the silicone drop and the third one as far rostral as possible.\nPass saline through the catheter following each suture to ensure that it remains unobstructed and that the sutures are not too tight.",
    "Remove the tape around the arms and place the rat ventral side down.\n\t\nInsert a hemostat through the caudal side of the head incision and push to separate the skin from the underlying tissue to create a subcutaneous \"pocket\".\nGuide the hemostat under the skin towards the opening on the shoulders where the catheter was inserted.\nBreak through the connective tissue using the hemostat, and tightly clamp the catheter at the most rostral point, below the base of the \"5-up.\"\nDetach the \"5-up\" and thread the long end of the catheter under the skin and out the incision located at the top of the rat's head.\n\t\nUse scissors to cut the catheter below where the hemostat was clamped and reattach the long end of the \"5-up.\"\nPull the catheter along the metal shaft of the \"5-up\" all the way to the plastic pedestal. Pass saline through to ensure free flow.\nPlace the rat on its back, and suture only the incision near the clavicle. The head incision should remain open. \nPlace the rat in a stereotaxic apparatus. Pull the skin away at the incision at the top of the head using bulldog clamps and clean and dry the surface of the skull.\nUse a manual drill bit, to drill four to five holes into the skull and insert machine screws into the holes to act as scaffolding for the head-cap.\n\t\nPlace the \"5-up\" connector between the screws and tuck the excess length of the catheter into the subcutaneous \"pocket\" previously made using the hemostat.\nUse dental cement to affix the \"5-up\" to the top of the skull. Remove the rat from the stereotaxic apparatus after the cement is fully dried.",
    "Give the rat post-operative care, which consists of ketoprofen (analgesic; 5 mg/kg, s.c.) and 2 ml of saline (s.c.). Administer ketoprofen for an additional 2 days following surgery to aid with pain management.\nBeginning 48 hr following surgery, flush rats daily with a mixture of heparin and gentamicin in sterile saline (7.5 IU + 12 µg; 0.2 - 0.3 ml) throughout the recovery period of ~2 days and through the heroin self-administration phase.\n4. Behavioral Procedure\nThe timeline for the procedure of food restriction-induced augmentation of heroin seeking is presented in Figure 1.\nOperant conditioning chambers.\n\t\nHouse rats individually in operant conditioning chambers enclosed in sound attenuating wooden compartments equipped with a fan.\nEach chamber consists of a stainless steel metal grid floor, a front and back Plexiglas wall and two metal panel sidewalls. Mount two retractable levers 9 cm above the floor of the right sidewall, and locate a cue-light above each lever. Responding on the drug-paired (active) lever activates an infusion pump while responding on the nondrug-paired (inactive) lever has no programmable consequences.\nLocate a tone module (2.9 kHz) above the active lever, and position a red house-light at the top-center of the left sidewall.\nConnect the drug pump to the catheter via a liquid swivel and Tygon tubing protected with a metal spring. In addition, equip each chamber with a food hopper and a water bottle allowing unrestricted access to food and water.\nHabituation day:\n\t\nFollowing recovery from surgery move the rats to the operant training chambers and allow for a 24 hr habituation period.\nDo not connect the rats to the metal spring and do not activate the cue-light/tone complex.\nMake sure that the active lever remains retracted, but ensure the inactive lever is extended to help with the discrimination between the two levers during training.",
    "Heroin self-administration:\n\t\nConnect the 5-up connector to the Tygon tube and attach the metal spring.\nAllow the rats to self-administer heroin (0.1 mg/kg/infusion) for 10 days during three 3 hr sessions separated by 3 hr intervals.\nBegin each session following the onset of the dark phase (around 9:30 AM in our laboratory) with the extension of the active and inactive levers, as well as illumination of the house-light and activation of the cue-light/tone complex for 30 sec.\nResponses on the active lever result in activation of the drug pump (5 sec, 0.13 ml / infusion) and initiation of a 20 sec timeout period during which the house-light is turned off and the cue light/tone complex above the active lever is activated (FR-1, 20 sec timeout). During the timeout period, active lever responses are recorded but not reinforced. Inactive lever responses are recorded but have no programmable consequences.\nFollowing each 3 hr session, the active lever is retracted whereas the inactive lever remains extended until 1 hr before the first session of the following day.\nAbstinence and food restriction:\n\t\nFollowing self-administration training, remove the rats from the operant conditioning chambers and individually house them in the ACF, and give unrestricted access to food and water for one drug-washout day.\nDivide the rats into two groups: food restricted (FDR) or sated, matched according to body weight, number of infusions and active lever responses across the last 5 days of training.\nFollowing the drug-washout day, remove the FDR rats' food, and feed them approximately 15 g of rat chow at 1:30 PM. Adjust the amount of food across 14 days of abstinence to maintain the FDR rats' body weight (BW) to approximately 90% of their own baseline BW.",
    "Drug-seeking test: On the morning of abstinence day 14, return the rats to the operant conditioning chambers and attach them to the metal spring. Use a 1 hr or 3 hr session during which active and inactive lever responses have the same consequences as in self-administration training, excluding the availability of the drug (i.e. under extinction conditions).\nSubscription Required.
