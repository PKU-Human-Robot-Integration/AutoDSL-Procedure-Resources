    "NOTE: The protocol describes the western blotting method to detect specific proteins of interest.\n1. Cell culture and transfection\nWarm all the reagents in the bead bath (37 ˚C) before the cell culture procedure. Prepare culture medium, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% each of 2mM L-glutamine, 100x non-essential amino acid, 100 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin.\nThaw stably transfected rat KCC2b human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293rnKCC2b)18 completely in the bead bath (37 ˚C). Transfer the cells from the cryovial tube into a centrifuge tube containing 5 mL of fresh media. Spin the cell at 1200 ×g for 3-5 min.\nUse an aspirator pipette (fixed to a vacuum pump) to aspirate the supernatant and add 10 mL of fresh media to re-suspend the cells. Transfer the cell suspension to a 10 cm dish plate.\nPlace the dish into the incubator and allow it to grow for 48 h at 37 °С in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Monitor the incubation period to ensure healthy cell growth. Further split the cells when they have attained over 90% confluence after the incubation period.\nAspirate the old media out from the cells dish and gently rinse cells with 2 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Add 2 mL of trypsin and incubate for about 1-2 min at room temperature.\nUse 2 mL of complete media to gently wash the trypsinized cells in the dish. Add 9 mL of fresh media to new dishes and add 1 mL solution from the old dish to each of the new ones. Transfer the split cell dishes back to the incubator for 48 h to attain ≥ 90% confluency.",
    "Treat the cells with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as control, 8 µM staurosporine, or 0.5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 15 min before harvesting the cells in lysis buffer.\n2. Preparation of cell lysates and loading samples\nAspirate the media on the culture dish (from transfection procedures). Place the cell culture on ice and wash the cells with ice-cold PBS.\nAspirate the PBS, then add 1.0 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium-β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.27 M sucrose, 1 mM benzamine, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) to the dish.\n\tNOTE: The volume of lysis buffer during cell harvest varies with dish sizes, for example, 1 mL of lysis buffer is suitable per 1 x 107 cells/100 mm dish/150 cm2 flask, while 0.5 mL is suitable per 5 x 106 cells/60 mm dish/75 cm2 flask.\nUse a cold plastic cell scraper to scrape the cells off the bottom of the dish, then gently use a pipette to transfer the cell suspension into a micro-centrifuge tube already on ice. Constantly agitate the tube for 30 min at 4 °C.\nSpin the cell lysates in a cold centrifuge (4 °C) at 16,000 x g for 20 min, remove the tube gently from the centrifuge, and place it on ice. Collect the supernatant into a pre-cooled fresh tube and discard the pellet.",
    "NOTE: It may be necessary to vary the centrifugation force and time depending on the cell type. Though, general guidelines encourage centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 20 min. However, this must be determined for every experiment. For instance, delicate cells like leukocytes need a very light centrifugation speed.\n3. Preparation of immunoprecipitants from cell lysates\nPipette 300 µL of protein-G-sepharose into a microcentrifuge tube. Spin the solution at 500 x g for 2 min and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 500 µL of PBS and vortex the solution well. Spin the solution at 500 x g for 2 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step.\nMix 1 mg of anti-KCC2 Thr906 and anti-KCC2 Thr1007 antibodies with 200 µL of protein G-sepharose beads and make up the volume to 500 µL with PBS. Shake on a vibrating platform or rotating wheel for 2 h at 4 °C. Wash 2x with PBS.\nCarry out protein quantification on the whole cell lysates and add 1 mg of the cell lysate to the washed beads. Gently incubate in an end-to-end rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. Spin down the beads and wash them 3x with PBS containing 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl).\nWash immunoprecipitants (beads) 3x with 200 µL of PBS. Resuspend the final pellet in 100 μL of 1x lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer.\nShake the tubes in a rotor shaker at room temperature for 5 min and incubate them in a heating block at 75 °C for 10 min. Centrifuge the loading sample at 11,000 x g for 2 min and use the supernatant for gel loading.\n4. Performing the western blot",
    "Assemble the casting apparatus and pour freshly prepared 8% separating gel (see Table 1 for recipe/preparation) to cast the gel allowing about 2 cm of space from the top of the casting glass. Add 200 µL of absolute isopropanol to the setup and allow it to stand at room temperature for 60 min.\n\tNOTE: The polyacrylamide gel recipe for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) depends on the size of the protein of interest (Table 2). Hence, make a note of the protein size before determining the desired gel percentage.\nUse a pipette to remove the isopropanol and carefully rinse the gel with about 200 µL of distilled water. Add freshly prepared 6% stacking gel (see Table 1 for recipe/preparation) to fill up the approximately 2 cm space on the casting setup. Gently fit in the well comb and allow to stand at room temperature for 30 min.\nFix the casted gel into the electrophoresis tank.\nDissolve 30.3 g of Tris base, 144.1 g of glycine, and 10 g of SDS in 1000 mL of distilled water to prepare 10x transfer buffer. Prepare 1x running buffer by adding 10 mL of 10% SDS and 100 mL of 10x transfer buffer to 890 mL of distilled water.\nPour 1x running buffer into the tank. Load 5 µL of molecular weight marker into the first well and an equal amount of protein into each well of the SDS-PAGE gel (between 18-30 µL, depending on the comb size used). Fill up empty wells with 1x LDS and run the gel for about 90-120 min at 120 V.",
    "Dissolve 58.2 g of Tris base and 29.3 g of glycine in 1000 mL of distilled water to prepare 10x transfer buffer. Activate nitrocellulose membrane with 1x transfer buffer containing 20% methanol. Rinse the gel and membrane with the transfer buffer and gently spread them out on the preparing stack.\n\tNOTE: There is no need to adjust the pH of the running and transfer buffers as they should be at the optimum pH required. Also, it is advisable to prepare these buffers and store them at room temperature before the experiment to save time.\nArrange the sandwich to be transferred in this order: negative electrode (black frame/end) - sandwich foam - filter paper - rinsed SDS-PAGE gel - rinsed nitrocellulose membrane - filter paper - sandwich foam - positive electrode (red frame). Stack the assembled sandwich in the transfer tank and run at 90 V for 90 min or 30 V for 360 min.\n5. Antibody staining and image development\nRemove the membrane and let it dry. Block the membrane for 1 h at room temperature using a blocking buffer made from 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% 1x Tween 20 (1x TBS-T).\nIncubate the membranes with appropriate dilutions of primary antibody8,15,19 and beta-actin (loading control) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Wash the membrane in three washes of 1x TBS-T for 5 min each.\n\tNOTE: The incubation of the separate membrane with loading controls such as beta-actin, alpha-tubulin, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies is to normalize the other western blotting results during subsequent quantification. The recommended dilution for each primary antibody is available in the manufacturer's manual.",
    "Incubate the washed membrane with secondary antibody diluted 5000-fold in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature. Again, wash the membrane 3x in 1x TBS-T for 5 min each.\n\tNOTE: It is highly recommended that the secondary antibody must be raised against the species in which the primary antibody is raised. For example, if the primary antibody of total KCC2 is mouse anti-KCC2, then the secondary antibody for anti-mouse must be used.\nPlace the washed membrane on the imaging board. Mix equal volumes of each enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent and gently spread the mixed solution on the membrane to develop signals.\n6. Image acquisition using an imaging system and data quantification\nTransfer the imaging board to the appropriate compartment on the imaging system for imaging. Open the imaging software on the computer for image processing.\nOn the toolbar, click New Protocol and choose Single Channel. Click Select under gel imaging/application dialog box, scroll to Blot and select either Chemi Hi Sensitivity or Chemi Hi Resolution. Then click on Signal Accumulation Setup to set the duration and number of images to acquire.\nClick Position Gel under protocol setup and adjust the gel in the imaging system if necessary. Click Run Protocol to acquire the images.\nRight-click on one of the acquired images under the imaging catalog box to save the images on the computer. Navigate to the desired image and click on Select Image and Continue under the run dialog box.\nClick on the Image Transform icon to adjust the contrast and the pixel saturation of the image. Click on the Screenshot icon on the general toolbar to save the image to the computer depending on the desired image format.\nMeasure the band densities using ImageJ software and analyze using appropriate statistical tools.",
