    "The following procedure is performed under the stereoscope in 2 steps, the first step involves loading the islets into the cannula and the second step is the actual transplantation into the ACE.  All procedures performed on animals were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) of the University of Miami.\n1. Loading Islets in Cannula for Transplantation\nCenter the islets in culture dish by spinning the dish in narrowing circles.\nDisconnect the cannula from the \"reservoir\" and place the cannula and connecting tubing on a clean surface.  The reservoir can be made out of a 300 Î¼l disposable plastic pipette tip without filter (Figure 1a).\nFlush air bubbles out of the reservoir to ensure continuous stream of islets when aspirating into reservoir.  Flushing the reservoir is done by driving forward the hands-free motorized syringe-driver using the foot pedal (Figure 1b, c).  This will also make space in the syringe to allow aspiration of the islets into the reservoir (pre-loaded with sterile solution such as saline, PBS or culture media). \nGently aspirate desired amount of islets into the reservoir.  Islets will tend to swirl as they enter the reservoir and will remain together towards the bottom.  Aspiration is done by driving backward the motorized syringe-driver using the foot pedal. \nReconnect the cannula to the reservoir via the connecting tubing.",
    "Place the cannula tip back in the culture dish and flush the islets out of the reservoir into the tubing then into the cannula.  Ensure that islets remain together as you back-fill the tubing/cannula by gently \"flicking\" (tapping) the tubing (Figure 1d).  Stop either before or after all air bubbles ahead of the islets are flushed out the cannula.  If not sure, stop as islets enter the back of the cannula as remaining air bubbles ahead of islets can help prevent reflux (backflow) of islets out of the ACE.   Will dissipate overnight.\n  \nAt this stage, you are ready to inject the islets into the ACE (please see next steps). \n2. Islet Transplantation into the Anterior Chamber of the Eye\nPosition the anesthetized mouse on a warm pad under stereoscope.\nPlace the snout of the mouse into anesthesia \"mask\" connected to oxygen/isoflurane anesthesia machine.  The mask is made out of a 1 ml disposable plastic pipette tip (without filter) and connected to anesthesia tubing through the narrow end (Figure 2a,b).\nGently retract the eye lids of the eye to be transplanted using the index finger and thumb of your free hand and \"pop\" the eye out for better exposure and easy access (Figure 2c).  This will require some practice to perfect without impeding breathing of the mouse by excessive pressure on the neck or blocking blood flow to the head.    \nUsing a disposable insulin syringe (29 - 31G) as scalpel, carefully penetrate only the tip in the cornea and make a single lateral incision.  Make the incision at midpoint between the apex of the cornea and limbus to minimize reflux of the islets during injection out of the ACE (Figure 2d).    \nCarefully insert the cannula (preloaded with islets) through the incision.",
    "Slowly eject islets out of the cannula and deposit them on top of the iris.  To avoid islet reflux due to excessive pressure buildup in the ACE, eject the islets in brief thrusts in as little volume(s) as possible in the quadrant opposite to the incision.  This can be further ensured by compacting islets in the tubing while loading the cannula (please see step 1.6).\nSlowly retract the cannula out of the ACE.  This is a critical step, especially, if a large volume of islets was injected as islet reflux due to pressure build up inside the ACE may be inevitable.  To eliminate/minimize islet reflux, gently rotate the cannula while inside the ACE to release excess pressure through the incision around the cannula.  Check for signs of reflux as you attempt to retract the cannula and, if needed, wait until pressure subsides before completely retracting the cannula out of the ACE. \nRinse the transplanted eye with sterile PBS or saline.\nInject buprenorphine for post-operative analgesia (0.05-0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) for the first 48 hr.\nApply erythromycin ophthalmic antibiotic ointment to the transplanted eye immediately after transplantation.\nPlace the animal back in a warmed cage to allow recovery from anesthesia.\nSubscription Required.
