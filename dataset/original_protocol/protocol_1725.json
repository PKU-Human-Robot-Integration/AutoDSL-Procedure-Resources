    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis micro-CT procedure includes the following steps: sample preparation and mounting, scanner setup and parameter selection, scanning procedure, 3D image reconstruction, and 3D image analysis and visualization.\nIsolation and fixation of infarcted mouse hearts\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes isolation and fixation of hearts from mice at 28 days post-MI.\nHarvest hearts at 28 days post-MI as described in Janbandhu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nFixation: Transfer each heart to a 15 mL falcon tube filled with fixative solution (4% PFA+1% glutaraldehyde in 1× PBS pH 7.4) and place tube on a rocker at 4°C for 1 day.\nCritical: (1) Ensure the heart is immersed in the fixative solution while on the rocker. (2) Use at least 10–15 tissue volumes of fixative solution to achieve adequate fixation.\nHydrogel stabilization of hearts\nTiming: 3 days\nCross-linking of tissue is achieved by PFA fixation followed by binding of hydrogel monomers to biomolecules which supports tissue structure and preserves tissue conformation. Hydrogel stabilization also substantially reduces inter-sample anatomical variation (Wong et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nRemove the fixative and fill the tube with hydrogel solution and continue rocking at 4°C for 3 days.\nCritical: To allow complete tissue penetration of hydrogel, hearts must be incubated in the hydrogel solution for at least 3 days at 4°C.\nInitiation of acrylamide polymerization:\nImmerse the heart in hydrogel in a 12-well tissue culture plate.\nPlace the plate in the X-Clarity Polymerization System without the lid and initiate polymerization using the following settings: Pressure: −90 kPa; temperature: 37°C; time: 3 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1313-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Processing and loading of the sample\n(A) X-Clarity Polymerization System used for hydrogel polymerization.\n(B) Heart after hydrogel stabilization. Scale bar = 1 mm.\n(C) Lugol’s-stained hearts mounted on the sample holder.",
    "(D) Sample holders loaded on the sample changer.\nNote: Alternative methods: hydrogel polymerization that does not require the X-Clarity Polymerization system can be found in a handbook published by The University of Newcastle, Australia in association with NSW government: https://openspim.org/documents/3D_Tissue_Clearing_Handbook_3rd_Ed.pdf[href=https://openspim.org/documents/3D_Tissue_Clearing_Handbook_3rd_Ed.pdf].\nCritical: Air bubbles can form during hydrogel polymerization under reduced pressure, causing the sample to float and consequently dry out. Allowing the sample to stand under ambient conditions (without rocking) for 1 h prior to polymerization will reduce the likelihood of bubble formation.\nSeparate hearts from the encasing gel and remove any extraneous gel carefully (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Rinse hearts in 1× PBS and keep in PBS for at least 10–15 min to ensure complete removal of hydrogel pieces and PFA traces from the sample (see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nPause point: Keep hearts in PBS at 4°C for up to 1 month.\nIodine staining\nTiming: 3 days\nMyocardium is rich in lipids and glycogen, and scar tissue is mainly composed of collagen-rich ECM. The ability of Lugol’s solution (Lugol’s iodine) to preferentially bind lipids and glycogen generates an overall staining contrast difference between viable myocardium and scar.\nStaining of the hearts:\nRemove PBS and place hearts in a 15 mL falcon tube containing 15 mL of Lugol’s solution\nWrap the tube with aluminum foil to exclude light and place on the rocker at RT for 3 days to ensure penetration of iodine throughout the hydrogel mesh.\nReplace Lugol’s solution after 2 days (see troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nCritical: (1) Light exposure causes triiodide/iodide (I3–/I–) redox reactions in Lugol’s solution which may affect staining quality (Gignac et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). (2) Incubation times longer than 3 days in Lugol’s solution may cause significant tissue shrinkage. Therefore, it is important that the hearts are imaged on the same day when staining is completed.\nMicro-CT imaging",
    "Timing: ∼2 h per sample with SkyScan 1272\nThis section describes the steps for acquiring 3D datasets for each specimen using Bruker/SkyScan 1272 high resolution micro-CT imaging system, fitted with a sample changer capable of holding multiple samples that allows high-throughput batch scanning.\nNote: The micro-CT scanners produce large amounts of data; roughly 7–8 gb of data per sample using this protocol. Therefore, sufficient data storage and backup capacity is required.\nMounting and loading of the sample:\nRemove the heart from the staining solution and place on lint-free tissue paper to remove excess liquid (see troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nPlace the heart in 1.5 mL tube in a vertical position.\nGently tap 3–4 times to ensure the heart has settled at the bottom of the tube so that the heart does not move during scanning. We find that the heart is not deformed by the tube wall if mounted in this way. Softer organs or tissues that may be deformed by this mounting technique should be mounted in agarose or with support from plastic gauze.\nSeal the tube with parafilm to keep the sample moist during the scanning procedure (see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nFix the tube on the sample holder using dental wax (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) and load the samples mounted on the specimen holder in the sample changer so that the heart is positioned directly over the axis of rotation, thereby the heart rotates around the central apical-basal axis when the mount is rotated (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) (see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1313-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(D) “Scanning modes” window to set up exposure for updating flat-field reference. Red box indicates the exposure value corresponding to the determined imaging parameters.\n(E) “Scanning protocol” window to set up scanning parameters.\nNote: (1) Loading of the samples inside the specimen chamber can be controlled by the “Sample changer” control panel of the SkyScan1272 software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-4). (2) Samples should be mounted centrally along the apical-basal axis to avoid orbiting and also to avoid the sample rotating out of the field of view.\nCritical: It is important to load the sample correctly to avoid movement during scanning. If the sample is not properly secured, or if the sample dries out, the resulting movement of the sample will inevitably result in a dataset that cannot be properly reconstructed. Such data will not be suitable for analysis.\nImage acquisition:\nStart SkyScan1272 software. This will open the main screen (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) with the main menu (1), toolbar menu (2), display window (3), sample changer control panel (4) and the status bar at the bottom (5).\nWarm-up the X-ray:\nClick on the “X-ray” icon in the toolbar menu (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-2) to switch on X-ray. Indicator and progress bar then appear on the screen. Warm-up generally takes ∼15–30 min.\nClick on the “X-ray” icon to switch off X-ray.\nInsert the sample inside the specimen chamber using the “Sample changer” control panel by:\nClick on the “Insert” button in the “Sample changer” control panel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-4). This will insert the first sample inside the specimen chamber.\nOnce the robotic arm returns back to starting position after inserting the sample in the chamber, click on “Door” icon in the toolbar menu to close the specimen chamber.\nNote: Progress of sample loading inside the chamber can be tracked in the Sample Changer window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-4).",
    "Critical: Do not click on the “Door” icon to close the specimen chamber (Step 8d) until the robotic arm returns to a complete rest at the starting position.\nPosition the sample in the center of the field of view (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B):\nClick on the “X-ray” and “Grab” icon in the toolbar menu to visualize the X-ray image in the display window continuously.\nMove the sample in a vertical direction by pressing the “Ctrl” button on the keyboard and “left mouse button” simultaneously and dragging the mouse pointer in the desired direction. Alternatively, use arrows in the status bar to position the sample in the center of the field of view (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-5e). Setting the correct parameters is very critical in order to determine optimal transmission of the X-ray and is achieved by adjusting the filter, resolution, voltage and pixel size. To assess transmission, activate the profile line by right clicking on the sample image in the display window. Transmission values will appear on the screen. The minimum transmission should be between 10 and 50% (30% is ideal).\nNote: The following section provides parameters for analyzing infarcted mouse hearts. Settings will need to be adjusted for different micro-CT instruments and sample types.\nTo set up the parameters, in the status bar (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-5):\nSelect resolution: 2452 × 1640 pixels (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-5a).\nUse slider to achieve 5 μm pixel size (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-5b).\nSelect the filter: 0.5 mm aluminium + Cu 0.038 and note down camera position (e.g., close) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-5c). Here, an X-ray voltage of 73 kV and current of 133 μA is used (see note).\nUse the slider to rotate the sample and make sure the sample is not out of field of view at any point of rotation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-5d).\nNote down the vertical position of the sample (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-5e).",
    "Note: (1) Visualize all samples one-by-one and note down the vertical position for each sample (step 9e). (2) Each energy filter is associated with its own X-ray voltage and current settings. We recommend optimizing voltage/current to achieve optimal transmission.\nA flat-field correction procedure is applied to every image to deal with non-linear X-ray attenuation and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for optimal transmission, which can significantly improve image quality.\nOnce the correct parameters have been determined, a flat-field correction must be performed using the same settings. The flat-field correction ensures an even grey level background that will flatten out any pixel intensity abnormalities that could cause ring artefacts. Perform flat-field correction:\nRemove the sample from the specimen chamber by clicking the “Remove” button on the “Sample changer” control panel.\nClick on the “Door” icon from the main toolbar menu to close the door.\nClick on “X-ray” and “Grab” icon on the toolbar menu, and enter the exact values of all the parameters set for the sample at step 9 in the status bar.\nMake sure the field of view is completely empty and the background is homogeneous.\nDouble click on “ff” displayed at the upper left corner of the screen to switch off flat-field correction. “flat-field correction OFF” will appear on the screen (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nClick the right mouse button in the imaging area to show a signal intensity profile along the line where the mouse pointer is situated (a second right-click will remove the profile from the image) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Average transmission in air should be around 60%.",
    "To adjust the signal intensity value, “Scanning modes” window can be displayed by clicking on “Option” > “Scanning modes” from the main menu (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). If the “Scanning modes” option is greyed, this option can be made accessible by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S on the keyboard.\nAdjust the exposure time in the correct box (2452 × 1640) in “Exposure (ms) for camera position close to the “source” panel in “Scanning modes” window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). The correct box will be highlighted by default (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D-red box). Leave the box ticked next to “Do not update flat-field references” and click on “OK” button (see note).\nCheck the signal intensity value, if it is not around 60%, repeat step 10f–g. Once the desired signal intensity value is achieved, open the “Scanning modes” window and tick the box next to “Update flat-fields for marked modes and modes with modified exposure” and click on the “OK” button (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). This new flat-field configuration will be applied to all subsequent scans.\nDouble click on “flat-field correction OFF” displayed at the upper left corner of the display window to switch on flat-field correction. “ff” will appear on the screen.\nClick on the “X-ray” icon in the toolbar menu to turn off X-ray and proceed to acquisition.\nNote: Alternatively, adjusting exposure can be done automatically by selecting ‘adjust exposure automatically’ when updating the flat-field.",
    "Critical: (1) If any of the acquisition parameters are changed, the flat-field corrections must be performed using the revised setting. (2) If the exposure is changed, then the dark field flat-field correction should also be performed. Dark field flat-field is acquired with X-ray turned off. It contains the distribution of thermal current in every pixel of the image accumulated by the X-ray detector during the selected exposure time. Dark field flat-field corrections can be achieved by- ticking the box next to “Update flat-fields for marked modes and modes with modified exposure” in the “Scanning modes” window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) to make the listed options available; unticking the box next to “Update only bright flat-field reference” and clicking on “OK” button. Re-insert the sample and proceed further.\nFor acquisition of images, in the “Sample changer” control panel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-4), select the “Manual” option under “Protocol”. This will open the “Scanning Protocol” dialog that contains a number of scanning parameters (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E):\nEnter “Filename prefix” for the sample. This prefix will appear in the file name of each image acquired for the specific sample.\nData directory: Click on “browse” button to select a destination folder.\nRotation step (deg): 0.4.\nAveraging (frames): OFF (No tick).\nRandom movement (pix): OFF (No tick).\nTick the box next to “360 deg scanning”.\nEnergy filter: select filter determined in step 9c.\nPixel size (μm): select value determined in step 9b.\nImage format: select value determined in step 9a.\nVertical position: type the value determined for this sample in step 9e.",
    "Partial width: 100%. A lower percentage (typically 70%–80%) reduces output file size but can only be used if the sample stays within the new boundary at all angles. Validate this by setting the partial width and rotating the sample 0/90/180 degrees to make sure it stays within the new boundary.\nTick the box next to “standard scan in central camera position”.\nOversize scan: OFF (No tick).\nClick on the “OK” button.\nCritical: Vertical position must be set and noted down for each sample (step 9c) and the exact same value must be entered in the acquisition parameters (step 11j) prior to the start of the scan.\nNote: (1) If multiple samples are being scanned using a sample changer, “Scanning Protocol” window is called every time and the “Manual” option under “Protocol” needs to be selected in the “Sample changer” control panel for each sample. After entering the values of these parameters for all the samples one-by-one, click on the “Start scanning” button in the “Sample changer” control panel. (2) All acquisition parameters are saved and can be visualized in the log file saved as a text file in the destination folder.\n3D data reconstruction\nTiming: ∼1–2 h per file with NRecon\nThe SkyScan NRecon package is used for 3D reconstruction from tomography projection images. Reconstruction parameters: misalignment compensation (post-alignment), ring artifacts reduction, smoothing and beam hardening correction should be adjusted manually to get an optimum image quality.\nStart NRecon software:\nClick on the “Open data” icon in the toolbar menu (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A-1).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1313-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. 3D reconstruction using NRecon\n(A) Home screen of NRecon displaying different toolbars and options.\n(B) Setting tab in the “Reconstruction” window.\n(C) Display window showing the selection of the region of interest.\n(D) Pop-up window showing options for fine-tuning.",
    "(E) Display screen showing the results of the trials.\n(F) Batch manager window showing the list of jobs.\nBrowse and select 1 file from the selected folder and click “Open” to load the data. This will display the scanned image in the display window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A-2) and open the “Reconstruction” window on the right side of the screen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A-3).\nNote: If the “Reconstruction” window is not displayed automatically, it can be visualized from the “View” option in the main menu.\nEstablish initial settings by selecting the “Setting” tab in the “Reconstruction” window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nTick the box next to “Smoothing” and use an initial value of “1”.\nTick the box next to “Misalignment compensation” and use the default value. The software provides an estimate of this value, which is then fine-tuned in step 14a–e.\nTick the box next to “Ring artifacts reduction” and use an initial value of “1”.\nTick the box next to “Beam-hardening correction” and set it to an initial value of 10%.\nSelect the “Start” tab in the “Reconstruction” window. Image of the heart and 3 lines will be displayed in the main window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Move the outer 2 red lines closer to the heart image to crop as much empty space as possible and keep the middle green line in the center of the heart image.\nSelect “Fine tuning” in the “Start” tab to adjust/improve the above-mentioned settings.\nA pop-up window will appear on the main screen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Select “Post-alignment” in the option menu. Post-Alignment or Misalignment compensation refers to the number of pixels the projected rotation axis is outside the camera midline (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).",
    "Set “Number of trials” to “5” and “Parameter step” to “1.0” and click on the “Start” button. Progress bar will appear showing progress of 5 trials of selected parameters i.e., “Post-alignment”.\nThis will generate 5 preview reconstructions for the “Post-alignment” parameter with one of the images displayed in the main window resulting from a trial and the “Output” tab will be opened in the “Reconstruction” window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nTo associate the parameters with the results, the slice number (e.g., Prv 1000) is shown in the toolbar menu (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E, red box). Click on the arrow buttons to the left and right of the slice number to view the different trial images.\nScroll through 5 trial images and select the best image showing the proper alignment (no doubling or blurring in the reconstructed image) (see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]). The software will remember the value of the parameter associated with the displayed image (so no need to confirm). Make sure the preferred slice number and corresponding preview image is displayed on the screen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) before moving to the next step as the value is copied to the settings.\nSelect the “Start” tab in the “Reconstruction” window and click on “Fine tuning”. In the pop-up window, select “Ring-artifacts reduction”. Ring artefacts can appear due to a heterogenous background image taken by the X-ray camera (for example a dust particle on the camera). During reconstruction, this particle remains in the same place while projection images are taken from the rotating sample giving the appearance of a ring (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). Set “Number of trials” to “5” and “Parameter step” to “1.0” and “Start”. Repeat steps 14c–14e and select the lowest value that removes ring-artifacts.",
    "Select the “Start” tab in the “Reconstruction” window and click on “Fine tuning”. In the pop-up window, select “Smoothing”. Smoothing or blurring reduces the image noise. Note that too much smoothing can result in a reduction of image detail (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E and 6F). Set “Number of trials” to “5” and “Parameter step” to “1.0” and “Start”. Repeat steps 14c–14e and choose the image/value that removes the most noise without overly blurring the image (see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nSelect “Start” tab in the “Reconstruction” window and click on “Fine tuning”. In the pop-up window, select “Beam hardening correction”. Beam hardening refers to the attenuation of low energy X-rays, causing the resulting reconstruction of an object to have reduced internal signal compared to its surface. Set “Number of trials” to “10” and “Parameter step” “10” and “Start”. Repeat, steps 14c–14e and select the best image. Beam hardening correction will increase the overall brightness of your scan and improve contrast (Orhan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: We find that the adult mouse heart can be scanned at an acceptable resolution with one field of view. If two or more fields of view are required (oversize scan), misalignment compensation should be carried out separately for all fields of view by moving the green line (step 13e) to each field of view. Once the reconstruction parameters are adjusted manually in a trial-and-error fashion using the preview function, data is now ready for reconstruction.\nIn the “Output” tab in the “Reconstruction” window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E):\nA histogram of the preview slice will be displayed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E-a). Drag the left vertical line in the middle of the first peak and drag the right vertical line just outside the right peak adjusting for voxel intensity.\nSelect the destination folder after clicking the “Browse” button (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E-b).",
    "Select the file format: Select PNG file format (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E-c).\nSelect the “Start” tab in the “Reconstruction” window, and click on the “Add to batch” button. This will open the “Batch manager” window automatically and the selected data file will appear in the “Batch manager” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nNote: (1) If the “Batch manager” window is not displayed automatically, it can be visualized from the “View” option in the main menu. (2) Optional: To reduce the size of the dataset, ROI (region of interest) can be selected by ticking the box next to “Use ROI” in the Output tab (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) (see troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nRepeat the steps 12a–15d for each sample.\nClick on “Start Batch” in the “Batch Manager” to initiate 3D reconstruction.\nNote: For each of the data files, the reconstructed data will be saved in the destination folder, selected in step 15b.\nAnalysis\nTiming: ∼3–6 h per sample with Amira\nThe Watershed algorithm is a powerful method developed for automated object segmentation or separation based on voxel intensity values. Differential contrast after staining with Lugol’s solution allows automated segmentation of scar and myocardium based on voxel grey value thresholds. In this section, step-by-step protocol of initial voxel intensity-based automated segmentation of scar and myocardium by Watershed algorithm and manual curation of minor inaccuracies using Amira software is described.\nTo seed materials for the use of Watershed segmentation tool, start Amira:\nClick on “Open Data”, select all image files of the reconstructed data and click on “Open” button.\nA pop-up window will appear. Enter the correct voxel size in x, y and z (5 μm, set at step 9b) and click on “OK” button. The “Project” view will open along with “Ortho slice” module (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1313-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

This will automatically launch the Segmentation workroom and create a new “Label field” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-2) in the Segmentation editor.\nOptional: rename the “Label Field” (e.g., Heart_Segmentation) by clicking on the “Rename” button.\nNote: “Materials” and “Selection” panels in the Segmentation editor (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-3 and 4) and 2D viewer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-6) will be displayed on the left and right side of the screen, respectively. Orientation can be changed to cycle through different 2D views (XY, XZ, and YZ) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-6) and 3D view (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-7) can be displayed by clicking on icons in the viewer toolbar (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-5).\nCreate 2 new materials by clicking on the “Add” button in the “Materials” panel, rename materials as “Myocardium” and “Scar” by double-clicking and tick the boxes next to “2D” and “3D” options (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nClick on the brush icon in the “Selection” panel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-4) and adjust the brush size with the size slider, as required.",
    "Use the mouse pointer to mark the myocardial area in the 2D (XY) view mode (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C), select the “Myocardium” material in the “Materials” panel and add the selected voxel by clicking the “+” button in the “Selection” panel. The selected voxels are now assigned to “Myocardium” material and are shown by a colored line in 2D mode and the same color patch in 3D mode (red in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nIn a similar fashion, mark the scar area in the same slice and add selected voxels to “Scar” material. The selected voxels are now assigned to “Scar” material and are shown by colored line in 2D mode and same color patch in 3D mode (blue in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nSlide through different slices (2D mode) using a slider (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-6), and select voxels throughout the heart and add selected voxels to the respective material as mentioned above (step 17e–f). Visualize all selected voxels in the chosen “Material” in 2D and 3D mode (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). We recommend seeding “Materials” in at least 15–20 slices across the entire heart (between apex to base).\nNote: Selection of voxels with a brush does not have to be precise but caution should be taken not to select voxels in “unintended” regions while adding in the desired “Material”. If the aim is to quantify ventricular volume, do not select and add atria to “Myocardium” material.\nIf satisfied with the selected voxels in the “Myocardium” and “Scar” material, proceed with segmentation using the Watershed tool:\nClick on the “Watershed” icon in the “Selection” panel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F, red box). This will open the “Watershed” panel.\nClick on the “Create new gradient image” button. Progress bar will appear at the bottom.",
    "Click on “Apply and create a new label field” button (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F). This will create a new label field (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-2) with the Watershed results and progress bar will appear at the bottom.\nAfter the Watershed algorithm run is finished, automated segmentation of the scar and myocardium is displayed in 2D/3D mode based on assigned voxels (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nNote: Slide through all the slices in the 2D/3D view of the segmented heart, generated after the Watershed algorithm. If Watershed works properly and segmentation of scar and myocardium material is mostly satisfactory, minor errors should be corrected by manual curation. However, if seeding of the “Materials” is not adequate for the Watershed algorithm to segment the heart properly, more seeding of materials is required. To achieve this, toggle back to the “Label Field” file (Heart_Segmentation) from drop-down menu in the Segmentation editor tab (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-2), and seed the materials with additional voxels in the different 2D views (YZ and XZ) as mentioned in step 8 and 9 and run Watershed algorithm again.\nTypically, segmentation by Watershed algorithm is not perfect and minor inaccuracies will occur- e.g., exclusion of specific voxels or inclusion of non-specific voxels in the desired material (scar/myocardium). Such minor imperfections will have to be corrected by manual curation using tools in the Segmentation editor.\nExamine all the slices in the 2D view:\nIdentify the non-specific inclusion/exclusion of voxels.\nClick the brush icon in the tools in the “Selection” panel, adjust the brush size with the slider and mark the non-specific voxels in the 2D (XY) view mode.",
    "Add or subtract selected voxels from intended material by selecting the material and clicking “+” or “-” button in the “Selection” panel, respectively. The selected voxels are now assigned or omitted from the intended material, and can be tracked and visualized in 2D/3D mode.\nNote: Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A shows an example of inclusion of non-specific voxels in the myocardium material (shown by arrow in the left panel). These voxels were selected by the brush tool (middle panel) and omitted from “Myocardium” material (right panel). Similarly, exclusion of specific voxels can be selected and added in the desired material.\nOnce all mistakes are corrected and the heart is accurately segmented, material statistics can be obtained by selecting “Segmentation” > “Material statistics” in the main menu. A table appears in a dialog box listing the volume of each material (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). The data can be imported in most of the commonly used data analysis software such as Excel or GraphPad Prism. The user can also select other parameters of interest for further comparison and statistical analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1313-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Multiple files will be displayed in the “Project view” (1).\nCreate the “Volume rendering” module by right clicking on the “.labels” file and click on “Display” > “Volume rendering” > “Create”. This will generate a 3D impression of the segmented heart highlighting “Myocardium” and “Scar” in selected colors in the 3D view panel (2).",
