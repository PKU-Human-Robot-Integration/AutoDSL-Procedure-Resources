    "Thaw PBMC   Warm complete medium to 37 °C in water bath. Each sample will require 22 ml of medium with benzonase. Calculate the amount needed to thaw all samples, and prepare a separate aliquot of warm medium with 1:10,000 benzonase (final concentration: 25 U/ml). Thaw no more than 3 samples at a time.  Note: Run one control PBMC with each batch of samples if doing a large longitudnal study split over sevral batches.   Remove samples from liquid nitrogen and transport to lab on dry ice.   Place 10 ml of warmed benzonase medium into a 15 ml tube, making a separate tube for each sample.    Thaw frozen vials in 37 °C water bath.   When cells are nearly completely thawed, carry to hood.    Add 1 ml of warm benzonase medium from appropriately labeled centrifuge tube slowly to the cells, then transfer the cells to the centrifuge tube. Rinse vial with more medium from centrifuge tube to retrieve all cells.   Continue with the rest of the samples as quickly as possible.   Centrifuge cells at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473), 10 min at room temperature.   Decant or aspirate supernatant from the cells and resuspend the pellet by tapping the tube.   Gently resuspend the pellet in 1 ml warmed benzonase medium. Filter cells through a 70 μm cell strainer if needed. Add 9 ml more warmed benzonase medium to the tube.   Centrifuge cells at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473), 10 min at room temperature. Decant or aspirate supernatant from the cells and resuspend the pellet by tapping the tube.   Resuspend cells in 1 ml warm medium.   Count cells with Vicell (or hemocytometer if necessary). To count, take 20 µl cells and dilute with 480 µl PBS in vicell counting chamber. Load onto Vicell as PBMC with a 1:25 dilution factor.",
    "Adjust the cell concentration to 5-10 x 106 cells/ml with warm medium (no more benzonase at this point).    Using a multichannel pipette, add 200 µl cells (1 x 106 cells) into each well of a 96-well deep well plate. Split each sample into two or more wells keeping one as an unstimulated control and the others for different types of stimulation.   Rest overnight (6-18 h) at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. Note: The percentage of both CD4+ and CD8+ cytokine producing T cells is increased after an overnight resting prior to stimulation (Horton et al., 2007).      Stimulate cells   After overnight rest at 37 °C, add the activation reagents and secretion inhibitor (Brefeldin A/Monensin) to the well for stimulation. Add only the secretion inhibitor to the unstimulated control well.   Table 1. Protein secretion inhibitors table:",

    "Notes:   It is important to avoid solvent toxicity. Final DMSO + ethanol concentration from all sources (peptides, brefeldin A, monensin) should not exceed 0.5%.   For most cytokines: Use brefeldin A at 10 μg/ml final concentration (see stock preparation table). For CD107 and CD154: Use monensin at 10 μg/ml final concentration (see stock preparation table). For assays combining cytokines and CD107 or CD154: Use brefeldin A and monensin at 5 μg/ml final concentration each.    Fluorochrome-labeled CD107 and CD154 can be added into the culture during the stimulation at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. This allows for staining of target molecules that are re-internalized by cells during the activation process.   Addition of costimulatory antibodies is optional. These can increase the cytokine response to protein antigens, peptides, and SEB by amplifying the signal for low-affinity T cells (Waldrop et al., 1998). Add 1 μg/ml final concentration of CD28 and/or CD49d (labeled antibody can be used if analysis of the marker is desired).     Incubate the cells for 4 h (PMA + Ionomycin stimulation, PHA + Ionomycin stimulation) or 6-8 h (SEB, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, peptide stimulation) at 37 °C, in a CO2 incubator.  Note: For most cytokines 6-12 h incubation at 37 °C is sufficient; for IL-10 and TGF optimal incubation time is 12-24 h.   Add EDTA to a final concentration of 2 mM and incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Note: If Dynabeads have been used for stimulation, use the I Mag for removal of beads during this step.    Wash the cells with PBS at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473), 8 min at room temperature.      Staining   Repeat PBS wash at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473), 8 min, room temperature and resuspend the cells in 500 μl PBS.    Stain with Red LIVE/DEAD cell viability dye according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Incubate at room temperature for 30 min in dark.   Centrifuge the cells at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473), 10 min, room temperature.   Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant and wash cells with PBS at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473), 10 min, room temperature.   Repeat another wash in FACS buffer, at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473), 10 min, room temperature.    Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant and resuspend cells in residual volume.   Prepare the surface staining cocktail according to titre per test for each antibody (pre-determined/provided by manufacture). See an example below for staining ten tubes/wells. Note: The manufacturer’s recommended dose is a good starting point, but antibody titrations on representative cells can improve results on unsatisfactory stainings.  Table 3.
