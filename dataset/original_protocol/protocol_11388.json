  "procedures": [
    "This protocol describes setting up the task and establishing living and feeding conditions, as well as training animals, testing animals after injury, and analyzing behavior data. The four steps of animal training are described as well: habituation, reward association, counterweight training, and training to criterion turn angle. All animal experiments were approved by the IACUC of Weill Cornell Medicine and University of Texas at Dallas.\n1. Setting Up the Task\nDesign a behavioral box made of clear plastic that measures 150 mm wide by 200 mm long by 250 mm tall.\n\tNOTE: Here, the rectangular aperture is 14.2 mm wide by 25.4 mm high. The knob manipulandum of diameter 9.5 mm is made with methacrylate and has two stops that restrict supination to less than 100°. Each of these parameters have been tested and optimized for the deficits described in the results section. The behavioral box and manipulandum are shown in Figure 1A.\nConnect the microcontroller box to the computer. Up to four microcontroller boxes can be connected to each computer.\nTo begin the task, use the control software (Figure 1C).\nSelect the knob device for control. Input the subject name in the \"Subject\" field. Choose the stage for training under the \"Stage\" dropdown menu.\n\t\tNOTE: The stages dictates three parameters for each trial: the \"Hit Window,\" \"Hit Threshold,\" and \"Initial Threshold.\" A hit is defined as reaching the criterion angle within a defined period of time. \"Hit Window\" refers to the time allotted for an animal to start a trial and reach the criterion angle. \"Hit Threshold\" is the criterion angle for a successful trial. \"Initial Threshold\" is the criterion angle to initiate a trial and hit window; this indicates the start of the turn. More information on Stages can be seen below under the section \"Training Animals.\"",
    "Click \"Start\" to begin the training session. Click \"Feed\" to manually feed the animal and \"Stop\" to stop the training session.\n\t\tNOTE: Manual feeding should be used to maintain interest in the task and is described in detail in section 3. After stopping the session, session data will be saved to the C: drive.\n2. Living and Feeding Conditions\nUse adult female Sprague Dawley rats (175-200 g). House rats together in standard cages with reversed 12 h dark/12 h light cycle. Perform all training and testing during the dark cycle with the lights dimmed.\n\tNOTE: Female rats are used since they are easier to train 21. Here Sprague-Dawley were used because it is a common strain used in motor training, and it is the predominant strain for transgenics. However, given the adjustable nature of the task (counterweight, turn angle criterion, distance to knob, and knob itself) these could easily be adjusted for different strains and larger (e.g. males) or smaller (e.g. Wistar) rats.\nFor the first 5 days of the study, give rats a full trough in addition to nutritionally complete, chocolate flavored pellets for five days. After the fifth day, food-restrict rats to 85% of their normal weight curve.\nAfter food restriction has begun, feed the rats 7.5 g of chocolate pellets (adjust up or down to maintain 85% of age-adjusted weight) throughout the entirety of their training. If rats have not received 7.5 g of chocolate pellets in their training sessions, supplement withstandard chow after the final session.\n\tNOTE: Weekend feeding is ad libitum with standard chow until Sunday evening, then food-deprive overnight. When performing surgeries or other invasive interventions, allow food ad libitum at least three days before and then for three days after the procedure (depending on recovery times) before putting rats on food restriction again.",
    "3. Training Procedure\nNOTE: An overview of the training procedure is shown in Figure 3A. Throughout the protocol, train the rats twice daily, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Wait at least 3 h after the morning session before starting the afternoon session.\nHabituation\n\tNote: The goal of habituation is to familiarize the rat with the testing box and with handling.\n\t\nRetract the knob device fully by pressing the down arrow key on the auto positioner.\nPlace the rat in the behavioral box for 15 min.\nAfter 15 min in the box, handle each rat in the hands for at least five min to familiarize the rat to the experimenter.\nRepeat this for five days.\nReward Association\n\tNOTE: The goal is to train the rat to associate turning of the knob with a food reward. Expect to spend the full session length of 30 min on the task during the reward association stage of training.\n\t\nOpen the software and input the rat Name. Set the Stage to \"K1: Knob Shaping - No Pulley.\"\n\t\tNOTE: This sets the manipulandum distance away from the aperture at 0.0 cm, the \"Init. Thresh.\" at 3°, \"HIT Thresh.\" at 5 degrees, and \"HIT Window\" at 2 s. This allows the rat to be fed as long as the rat turns the knob past 3 degrees. The \"HIT Window\" will remain at 2 s throughout training.\nPut the rat in the behavioral box and press \"Start\" to begin the session.\nFamiliarize the rat to the reward trough by dispensing 2 - 3 pellets at a time and tapping the side of the box where the reward trough is located. Dispense the pellets by using the manual feeder button.",
    "Once the rat knows the location of the reward, manually dispense 1 pellet when the rat is in front of the aperture.\nOnce the rat moves to the aperture in anticipation of a pellet reward, condition the rat to interact with the manipulandum.\n\t\t\nPrompt the rat to engage by placing a 45 mg food pellet near the manipulandum, or by applying pellet dust directly to the manipulandum, allowing it to reach out and grasp it. If the rat moves away from the aperture, tap on the box near the manipulandum to redirect its attention.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the rat has touched the knob with its reaching paw, the program will feed the rat. Any interactions that do not include the use of paws (i.e. biting, nosing the manipulandum) are incorrect and should not be rewarded.\nOnce the rat begins touching the knob with the desired paw and getting rewarded 10 consecutive times at 0.0 cm, use the down arrow key on the auto-positioner (Figure 1A) to retract the manipulandum by 0.25 cm. Repeat this in 0.25 cm increments until the manipulandum is 1.25 cm away from the aperture.\nPress \"Stop\" after 30 min to end the session.\nContinue reward association until the rat supinates the manipulandum with the desired paw at 1.25 cm away from the aperture (Figure 1B).\nOnce the rat has completed 2 consecutive sessions supinating the manipulandum and retrieving the pellet reward, begin counterweight training.\nCounterweight training to train the rats to supinate a 6 g counterweight.\nPlace a 3 g counterweight on the manipulandum by attaching the connector at the end of the counterweight to the L-shaped attachment point on the manipulandum. Feed the counterweight string through the pulley until the counterweight hangs freely.",
    "Open software and input the rat Name. Set the Stage to \"K2: Knob Shaping - Pulley.\"\n\t\tNOTE: This sets the manipulandum distance away from the aperture at 1.25 cm, the \"Init. Thresh.\" at 3°, and the \"HIT Thresh.\" at 5 degrees. The manipulandum distance will remain at 1.25 cm from this point forward.\nPut the rat in the behavioral box and press \"Start\" to begin the session.\nPress \"Stop\" after 100+ successful trials. Once the rat has completed 2 consecutive sessions of 100+ successful trials, increase the weight by 1 g after the end of a session. Increase the weight from 3 g to 6 g, over subsequent sessions.\nProceed to step 3.4 after 2 consecutive sessions of supination at 6 g and 100+ successful trials.\n\t\tNOTE: It takes an average of 6 sessions (3 days) to work up from 3 g to 6 g. Beginning in counterweight training, it is imperative that correct supination movement gets rewarded and incorrect supination movement gets shaped out. For a visual guide and explanation about correct and incorrect supination form, please refer to Figure 2.\nTraining to Baseline\n\tNOTE: Remember to continue to shape correct supination movement. Again, refer to Figure 2 for a visual guide on correct/incorrect supination movement and how to ameliorate incorrect supination. Train the rats to supinate to the baseline criteria; here, this is 75 degrees with a 6 g counterweight at a success rate of 75% or higher.\n\t\nPlace a 6 g counterweight on the manipulandum.\nOpen software and input the rat Name. Set the Stage to \"KSB4: Knob Training Median 75 Max.\"",
    "NOTE: This sets the \"Init. Thresh.\" at 5°, \"HIT Threshold Minimum\" at 15°, and \"HIT Threshold Maximum\" at 75°. This is called an \"adaptive\" training stage, meaning the threshold will increase as the rat's performance improves. For the \"KSB4\" stage, the threshold is first set to the previous session's final threshold. If no previous session was run on this stage, the threshold is set to the threshold minimum of 15 degrees. After the first 10 trials of the session, the threshold is calculated as the median of the peak angles in the previous 10 trials. Thus, the threshold is different for each trial and depends on the rat's performance in the previous trials.\nStop the session after 30 min.\nContinue training using the adaptive stage until the average peak angle is 75 degrees or greater. Then, proceed to step 3.5. This generally occurs after about 10 days or 20 sessions.\nBaseline assessment to record four consecutive baselines\nPlace a 6 g counterweight on the manipulandum.\nOpen software and input the rat Name. Set the Stage to \"K27: 75 degrees.\" This sets the \"Init. Thresh.\" at 5°and \"HIT Threshold at 75°.\nPress \"Stop\" after 30 min or 100 trials, whichever comes first, to end the session.\nContinue until there are four consecutive baselines with a success rate of 75% or higher.\n4. Post-Injury Assessment\nOpen software and input the rat name. Set the Stage to the same static stage as pre-injury baseline testing. This will retain the same parameters used for baseline.\nPress \"Start\" and run session until 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Participation might be low after injury. This can be remedied by using the manual feed button or placing a reward pellet near the manipulandum to entice the rat to engage with the manipulandum.",
    "Repeat testing once a week in weekly intervals until the desired length of post-injury assessment has been reached.\n\tNOTE: Here, we assess post-injury performance each week for six weeks.\n5. Analyze Data\nNOTE: Data are saved to a default location on the C: Drive of a PC. Data are captured at 100 Hz during the hit window and stored in binary format. Here, the data was analyzed using a custom program, called Dexterity. Please email Dr. Jason Carmel for access to this free software.\nOpen Dexterity and click \"Standard.\"\nLocate the directory where rat data is and select the desired folder.\nAfter selecting the directory, select the rats for analysis.\nClick \"Keep\" or \"Discard\" to keep or discard files that are incomplete or contain no data.\n\tNOTE: There are times when sessions are started using the wrong parameters and training stage and while they are immediately stopped, a file is still created. This file needs to be discarded during analysis. There are also instances, especially acutely after injury, when an animal performs no trials because of their injury or very little trials. For these sessions, a file must be kept because it is a representation of their performance. When a file with no successful trials is kept, a NaN is placed in the appropriate place for computed variables.\nChoose whether to annotate the experiment now or later; if \"Annotate Now\" is selected, a new window will open. Type in the \"Experiment Name,\" \"Group Names,\" \"Event Data,\" and \"Total Number of Weeks\" in the experiment.\nAssign subjects to a group.\nInput the number of data sessions in each week or time point. Separate the input sessions by a space and make sure not to put a space after the last number i.e. (1 1 1 1).",
    "Input the time point labels. Separate input labels by a space and make sure not to put a space after the last label i.e. (Pre Wk1 Wk2 Wk3).\nSelect when the event occurred; an option to save the analysis session will appear. Click \"Yes\" to save the analysis session.\nAn overview of the annotated and unannotated data will appear. This gives the option to plot data.\nFor the unannotated data, click \"Graph Subject\" to plot an individual subject or \"Graph Subjects\" to plot all subjects on the same graph.\nFor the annotated analysis, click \"Plot\" to plot the experiment.\nFor both annotated and unannotated, click the dropdown arrow for a list of variables to be plotted. Click the variable to view the plot.\nClick export to export the graph and/or the data associated with the graph."
