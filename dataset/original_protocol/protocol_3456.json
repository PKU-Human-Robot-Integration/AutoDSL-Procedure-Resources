    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTS cell derivation from blastocyst\nTiming: 8–11 days\nTS cell derivation protocol was performed as described by Himeno et al. (2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) with some modifications.\nDay before blastocyst collection, prepare 4- or 24-well plates with γ-irradiated MEFs by seeding 5 × 104 cells/ well in 0.5 mL TS medium.\nOn day 0 collect 3.5 DPC blastocysts from uterus by flushing under sterile conditions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/343-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Flushing blastocysts from the uterus\n(1) The uterus from a 3.5 DPC pregnant mouse is removed by cutting across the cervix and in between each ovary and oviduct. (2) The uterus is cut near the cervix to separate both horns. (3) The needle is inserted into the upper part of uterus to flush blastocysts toward the cervix and collect blastocysts in a 30 mm Petri dish.\nOpen abdominal cavity and take out uterus\nCut across cervix using fine scissors.\nHold cervix with forceps and separate uterine horns by cutting mesometrium.\nCut between oviduct and ovaries. Keep uterotubal junction intact.\nKeep uterus in small volume (0.2 mL) of TS medium in a 60 mm Petri dish.\nInsert a 26-gauge needle in upper part of uterus near oviduct and flush each horn with 1–2 mL of TS + F4H medium toward cervix.\nCollect medium with blastocysts in a 30 mm Petri dish.\nChange medium of 4- or 24-well plates with feeder cells (from step 1) using 0.5 mL of TS + F4H medium.\nUsing a mouth pipet, transfer each blastocyst into a single well of a 4- or 24-well plate containing TS + F4H medium and incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Try to keep the blastocyst in the center of each well to monitor outgrowth properly.",
    "On day 1 monitor the blastocyst for attachment and hatching. Do not change the medium.\nOn day 2 monitor the embryo for outgrowth and carefully remove medium and add fresh 0.5 mL TS + F4H medium.\nNote: If the outgrowth is loosely attached, remove only half of the medium and add 0.25 mL fresh TS + F4H medium.\nOn day 3 to 5 monitor outgrowth for size and once it is around 0.8 mm, disaggregate it in the same well.\nWash the cells two times with 0.5 mL PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and add 100 μL of 0.25% Trypsin.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nThoroughly disaggregate the outgrowth with P200 pipet by mixing up and down.\nNote: Set pipet at 100 μL to avoid generation of air bubbles.\nStop trypsin action by immediate addition of 0.5 mL 70cond + 1.5× F4H medium.\nCulture cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 16 h and replace medium with fresh 70cond + F4H medium.\nHereafter change the 70cond + F4H medium every other day and monitor closely for colony formation.\nCritical: Tight epithelial TS cell colonies will appear 3 - 7 days after step 8 is completed. Embryonic stem cells are very rare in this medium, but appearance of extraembryonic endoderm (XEN cells) is very common (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). After some passage it will be difficult to separate TS cells from XEN cells. So, we opted to pick colonies of TS cells to ensure pure TS cell lines.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/343-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Colony morphology can be used to select TS cells in culture",
    "A small TS cell colony growing with extraembryonic endoderm cells (XEN cells) and MEFs is shown. A TS cell colony grows with a well-defined border. To obtain a pure TS cell population, clones must be picked and separated from XEN cells.\nTS cell colony picking\nTiming: 4–8 days\nTS cell colony picking helps to establish a pure TS cell population quickly.\nOnce TS cell colonies start appearing, prepare 4- or 24-well plates with γ-irradiated MEFs by seeding 5 × 104 cells/ well in 0.5 mL TS medium 1 day prior to colony picking.\nOn the day of TS cell colony picking, change the medium of feeders with 0.5 mL TS + 1.5× F4H medium and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nMove the dissecting microscope into a tissue culture hood.\nAspirate the medium from the plate containing TS cell colonies and wash with PBS two times. Add 0.5 mL PBS to the cells and do not remove this PBS.\nUsing the dissecting microscope pick TS cell colonies with the help of a P20 pipette (White tips and set pipette at 20 μL) and transfer each picked colony along with PBS separately in a single well of a 96 well plate.\nNote: 20 μL white tips have a wide opening which facilitates picking colonies.\nOnce all colonies are picked, add 50 μL of 0.25% trypsin in each well and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 5 min.\nNote: Pick 5 to 10 colonies from each blastocyst.\nCritical: To avoid temperature shock, pick colonies within 10 min and if picking colonies from multiple plates do one at a time.\nAdd 150 μL of TS + 1.5× F4H medium to stop trypsin action and dissociate cells by pipetting up and down in each well.",
    "Transfer each clone of the 96 well plate separately to 4- or 24-well plates prepared in step 9.\nIncubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 16 h and after incubation add fresh 0.5 mL TS + 1.5× F4H medium.\nAfter 2 days, change medium every other day with 0.5 mL of fresh TS + 1× F4H medium until colonies reappear.\nCritical: TS cell colonies should appear in 3–7 days after picking.\nPassaging and removing MEFs from TS cells\nTiming: 15–20 days\nTS cells can be maintained >50 passages in appropriate medium conditions without any chromosomal abnormalities and for many experiments we need TS cells to grow in feeder free condition.\nOnce TS cell culture appears 50%–60% confluent, passage it.\nPrepare 6-well plates with γ-irradiated MEFs by seeding 2 × 105 cells/ well in 2.0 mL TS medium 1 day prior to passaging TS cells and on day of passaging remove TS medium and add 1.5 mL TS + 1.5× F4H medium.\nRemove medium and wash the TS cells (from step 18) once with 0.5 mL PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and add 100 μL of 0.25% Trypsin.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nStop trypsin action by immediate addition of 0.5 mL TS + 1.5× F4H medium and dissociate to single cells using 1.0 mL pipette (set pipette at 400 μL).\nTransfer all cells to 6- well plate containing γ-irradiated MEFs (step 19, a) and culture cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 16 h.\nAfter 16 h add fresh 2.0 mL TS + 1.0× F4H medium to each well.\nKeep changing the medium (TS + 1.0× F4H) every other day until TS cells become 60%–80% confluent.\nPassage each clone 2 to 3 times (1:6 ratio) as mentioned in steps 19, 20 to obtain stable TS cell clones.",
    "Note: Once stable clones are established on γ-irradiated MEFs, a portion of the TS cells can be frozen, and the rest can be maintained in feeder free condition.\nFor feeder free conditions, grow and passage TS cells in 70cond +F4H medium.\nRemove medium from 6-well plate and wash the TS cells (from step 21) once with 2.5 mL PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and add 500 μL of 0.25% Trypsin.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nStop trypsin action by immediate addition of 2.5 mL TS medium and disaggregate cells by pipetting up and down.\nTransfer cell suspension to the 15 mL tube and centrifuge 5 min at 200 × g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 mL 70cond +F4H medium.\nSeed cells in 100 mm dish and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 45 min to attach MEFs.\nNote: MEFs attach faster as compared to TS cells.\nCollect floating TS cells from 100 mm dish, count the cells and seed 1 × 105 cells in 2 mL 70cond +F4H medium in a single well of a tissue culture grade 6-well plate.\nPassage cells 2 to 3 times to obtain a pure TS cell population.\nNote: Once stable clones are established with typical TS cell colony morphology as indicated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], in feeder free conditions, TS cells can be frozen. TS cell identity was validated with the TS cell specific marker CDX2 using immunofluorescence (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/343-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Immunofluorescence can be used to confirm TS cell identity",
    "CDX2 is a marker for trophoblast stem (TS) cells which should be observed in at least 90% of cells. Isolated TS cell clones were grown without MEFs in a 30 mm dish (on glass cover slip) in 70cond + F4H medium for 48 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunofluorescence was performed using anti-CDX2 antibody. DAPI was used to stain DNA. Scale bar, 10 μm.\nFreezing and thawing of TS cells\nTiming: 1–4 days\nStable TS cell clones can be safely frozen and thawed for subsequent experiments.\nFor freezing cells:\nPrepare 1× freezing mix and keep on ice.\nHarvest TS cells from 60%–80% confluent culture (either from step 19 or 22) by trypsinization and pellet cells by centrifugation.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 mL TS medium.\nCount the cells and pellet again by centrifugation.\nDiscard the supernatant (leave 100 μL) and resuspend the pellet by tapping.\nSlowly add 1× freezing mix to the cells (2 × 105 cells per 1 mL freezing mix).\nMix gently and aliquot 0.5 mL of the cell suspension per cryovial.\nTransfer tubes to cryogenic freezing container and place in −80°C freezer for 16–18 h.\nTransfer cryotubes to a liquid nitrogen container for long term storage.\nNote: One vial is sufficient for a 30 mm dish (1 × 105 cells).\nThawing of cells:\nOn the day before thawing TS cells, seed 2 × 105 γ-irradiated MEFs in a 30 mm dish with 2 mL TS medium.\nQuickly thaw a frozen vial of TS cells in a 37°C water bath.\nTransfer thawed TS cells to 10 mL of TS medium and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL TS + 1× F4H medium.",
    "Transfer cells on γ-irradiated MEFs prepared in step 24a and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nChange the medium the next day and keep changing it every other day with TS + 1× F4H medium until confluency reaches 60%–80%.\nMake feeder free as mentioned in step 22 for subsequent experiments.\nNote: A frozen stock of TS cells should be thawed onto MEF feeders to avoid differentiation. Alternatively, TS cells can be thawed in 70cond + 1.5 × F4H medium without feeders but expect some differentiation in the first passage after thawing.\nEffect of genotoxic stress on TS cell differentiation\nTiming: 3–10 days\nThe Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) signaling pathway is the main signaling pathway required for TS cell proliferation and self-renewal (Tanaka et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). In the presence of FGF4, heparin and MEFs, TS cells can be cultured in an undifferentiated state. After removal of FGF4 and heparin, TS cells can be differentiated to various placental types such as trophoblast giant cells (TGCs), spongiotrophoblasts (SpTs) and syncytiotrophoblasts (SyTs) (Natale et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Ullah et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). This is a very useful tool to study trophoblast differentiation, genome maintenance, and factors secreted from these cells.\nHarvest feeder free TS cells from 60%–80% confluent culture by trypsinization and count the cells.\nSeed 1 × 105 cells in 10 mL of 70cond + F4H medium for 100 mm dish (1 × 104 cells for 30 mm dish).\nAfter 24 h remove the medium and wash TS cells twice with 10 mL PBS.\nAdd 10 mL TS medium for differentiation.\nPerform various treatments either just after addition of TS medium (Graphical abstract step 3-A) or after two days of differentiation (Graphical abstract step 3-B) and incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nDNA damage induction:",
    "For inducing DNA damage, seal the plates with parafilm and place the plate inside γ-irradiator and give various doses such as 0 Gy, 0.5 Gy, 10 Gy, or 30 Gy.\nChange TS medium every other day.\nDNA damage response inhibition:\nFor inhibiting the DNA damage response and downstream signaling pathway, add a DNA damage response inhibitor such as caffeine, ATM inhibitor KU55933, or ATR inhibitor VE821.\nChange TS medium with inhibitors every other day.\nKeep one plate as a control without any treatment and keep changing TS medium every other day.\nCollect cells every 2 days after treatment until the 8th day of differentiation, either by disaggregating with TrypLE for RNA/protein analysis or by fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence and colony formation assay.\nFor disaggregating differentiated TS cells, wash the cells with PBS and add 1 mL of TrypLE express enzyme (1×) in a 100 mm dish and incubate for 10–20 min at 37°C, followed by inactivation with 10 mL TS medium.\nDisaggregate cells by pipetting up and down.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nWash cells with PBS twice to remove any remaining medium. Store the pellet at −80°C for further analysis.\nNote: Once TS cells are differentiated, it is difficult to disaggregate them with trypsin. Induction of DNA damage can be monitored by γH2A.X immunofluorescence and western blot analysis.\nCritical: Inducing DNA damage or inhibiting the DNA damage response just prior to TS cell differentiation causes cell death and affects the differentiation process (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Inducing DNA damage or inhibiting the DNA damage response two days after initiating TS cell differentiation induces resistance to DNA damage (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/343-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Various treatments can impact TS cell differentiation",
    "To analyze the effect of DNA damage and DNA damage checkpoint inhibition on the differentiation of TS cells, colony formation assays along with cell type specific markers were analyzed.\n(A and B) (A) DNA damage induction with 10 Gy γ-irradiation and (B) inhibition of the DNA damage response with an ATR inhibitor (ATRin) were performed either just after addition of differentiation TS medium (0D) or 2 days after differentiation (2D). After 8 days of total differentiation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and stained with 0.01% crystal violet for 60 min, washed with water, dried and imaged (the same image is included in the main manuscript as Figure S3E, Singh et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Treatment just after addition of differentiation TS medium (0D) resulted in reduced growth.\n(C) Expression of TS cell differentiation markers such as Pl1 (Prl3d1), Pl2 (Prl3b1), and Plf (Prl2c2) was measured with 18S rRNA acting as a positive control. TS cells irradiated with 10 Gy either just after addition of differentiation TS medium (0D) or 2 days after differentiation (2D) were allowed to differentiate for a total of 8 days. Cells were lysed in TRizol to isolate RNA. RNA was DNase treated to digest any residual genomic DNA and reverse transcription was performed. PCR was performed using specific primers along with a negative “no template” control. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel along with a 100 bp DNA ladder. Treatment just after addition of differentiation TS medium (0D) showed reduced levels of differentiation markers such as Pl1, Pl2, and Plf.\nTS and differentiated TS cell marker analysis\nTiming: 3–10 days",
    "TS cell specific markers such as Cdx2, Eomes, and differentiation markers such Pl1, Pl2, Tpbpa are used to validate TS cell identity. Immunofluorescence is used to validate markers at the protein level and reverse transcription (RT) PCR is used to validate markers at the level of RNA expression.\nFor immunofluorescence, as mentioned in step 22 or 25 to 30, grow the cells in a 30 mm dish with bottom cover slip ( #P35G-0-14-C) and fix for 10 min with 2 mL 4% paraformaldehyde at 22°C–25°C.\nWash cells three times with 2 mL PBS.\nAdd 2 mL permeabilization buffer to the dish for 10 min to permeabilize cells.\nWash cells three times with 2 mL PBS.\nAdd 2 mL 1× PBSTB blocking solution and incubate at 22°C–25°C for 1 h.\nDilute the primary antibody (such as CDX2, 1:500) in 1× PBSTB and add to the cells.\nIncubate primary antibody 16–18 h at 4°C.\nNext morning remove the primary antibody and wash the cells with 2 mL 1× PBSTB three times each for 10 min.\nDilute the secondary antibody (such as anti-rabbit 1:500) in 1× PBSTB and add to the cells.\nIncubate the cells with the secondary antibody for 1 h at 22°C–25°C in the dark and wash the cells with 2 mL 1× PBSTB three times each for 10 min.\nMount the cells with a coverslip using DAPI.\nRecord images using a LSM780 confocal microscope (Zeiss) within 1 week and collect Z-stacks.\nProcess images using Fiji software (NIH; https://imagej.net/Fiji[href=https://imagej.net/Fiji]).\nFor RT-PCR, lyse the cells from step 34 using TRIzol and isolate RNA.\nUse 1 μg of total RNA and digest with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (1 U) for 20 min at 37°C in 1× RQ1 RNase-free DNase reaction buffer.",
    "Stop DNase action by adding RQ1 RNase-free DNase stop solution (Final concentration 1×) and incubate for 10 min at 65°C.\nTo the DNase digested RNA sample add 1 μL each of oligo (dT) and dNTPs and incubate for 5 min at 65°C.\nKeep RNA sample on ice for 2 min and add cDNA synthesis mix which contains buffer, reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitor, and DTT.\nIncubate samples for 60 min at 50°C and inactivate enzymes for 5 min at 85°C.\nAdd 1 μL RNase H and incubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nTake 1 μL of cDNA and perform PCR with TS cell marker primers such as Pl1, Pl2, Plf, and 18S rRNA.\nDetection of cytokines secreted from differentiated TS cells\nTiming: 3–10 days\nPlacental cells express various autocrine and paracrine factors. Differentiated TS cells are a good model to study the effect of genotoxic stress or genetic mutations on factors secreted by these cells.\nTo detect factors secreted by differentiated TS cells in different conditions, grow cells in a 30 mm dish as mentioned in steps 22 or 25 to 30.\nWash TS cells as well as differentiated TS cells with PBS and add fresh 1.2 mL TS medium.\nIncubate the cells for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 and collect the supernatant.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 200 × g for 5 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and discard the pellet consisting of floating cells.\nStore the supernatant at −80°C for further analysis such as measuring secreted cytokines, hormones, and other enzymes.\nAdd 500 μL of TrypLE express enzyme and incubate at 37°C for 10–20 min to disaggregate attached cells from the 30 mm dish (step 58).\nInactivate TrypLE by adding 2 mL of TS medium and pipette up and down to disaggregate all cells.",
    "Transfer the cells to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min.\nWash the pellet two times with PBS and store the pellet at −80°C for further analysis such as measuring non-secreted cytokines and enzymes.\nNote: Gamma irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast cells also secrete several autocrine and paracrine factors. Therefore, we should not measure cytokines using feeder-CM or TS cells growing with MEF feeders. Hence it is possible that growing TS cells in TS medium for 24 h causes some degree of differentiation."
