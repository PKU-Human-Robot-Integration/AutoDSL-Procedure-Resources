    "All animal experimentation was performed in accordance with local ethical committees.\nNOTE: Prox1-cre-ERT2 (Prox1tm3(cre/ERT2)Gco/J, Jax #022075) and Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, Ai9, Jax #007914) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and crossed to obtain the inducible lymphatic reporter mouse line Prox1-cre-ERT2::tdTomato. Mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 background for 10 generations. Six-week-old Prox1-cre-ERT2::tdTomato male mice received tamoxifen diet for 3 weeks. Tamoxifen diet from Envigo Teklad (diet no. TD.130857; 500 mg/kg) was used. Experiments were performed in 12-14-week-old mice. This protocol is applicable to mice of any age, sex or strain.\n1. Material preparation\nSterilize scissors, forceps and dissecting pins using 70% ethanol.\nPrepare two 1 mL syringes with 25 to 27 gauge needles. For subcutaneous injection we recommend using a micro-syringe to inject 10 μL in the upper footpad.\nIn a plastic 1.5 mL tube, prepare 200 µL of DyLight 488-conjugated lectin diluted in sterile PBS at a final concentration of 100 μg/mL.\nIn another plastic, 1.5 mL tube prepare 100 µL of DyLight 649-conjugated lectin diluted in sterile PBS at a final concentration of 100 μg/mL.\nPrepare a 6-well plate containing PBS and keep it on ice.\nPrepare a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 30% sucrose.\n2. Labeling of subcutaneous adipose tissue blood and lymphatic vessels.\nAnesthetize the mouse by inhalation of 5% isoflurane. Assess anesthesia depth by firmly pinching the animal’s paw to ensure that the animal is not harmed during the procedure. Anesthesia should be maintained until the end of the lectin injection steps or until euthanasia.\nInject 100 µL of DyLight 488-conjugated lectin intravenously in the tail vein to label the blood vasculature. Wait 15 minutes before proceeding to tissue harvesting.",
    "Using a different syringe, inject 10 µL of DyLight 649-conjugated lectin subcutaneously on the upper footpad of the animal to label the draining lymphatic vessels. Wait 15 minutes before proceeding to tissue harvesting.\nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation or exposure to CO2 15 minutes post-injection.\n3. Harvesting of subcutaneous adipose tissue\nLay the mouse on its back on a dissection board.\nSterilize the fur of the mouse using 70% ethanol.\nLift the skin of the flank using forceps and make a transversal incision to expose the brachial fat pad.\nGently pull on the skin to dissociate it from the brachial adipose tissue depot, thus revealing the entire subcutaneous brachial adipose tissue containing the lymph node and the lymphatic collector vessel.\nUsing forceps and scissors, gently remove subcutaneous fat depots and transfer them to a dish containing cold PBS. For best results, we recommend removing the fat depots as one single piece.\nFrom here on out, protect the tissue from light.\n4. Tissue fixation\nSubmerge the harvested tissue in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 30% sucrose.\nIncubate the tissue in this solution at least overnight before preparing it for imaging.\n5. Staining and imaging\nFor optimal results, perform tissue clearing and 3D confocal acquisition as described by Gilleron and colleagues20. We recommend using a light sheet microscope for analysis of large tissues. Additional staining can be performed during the clearing process.\nTo achieve best tissue mapping, use of the following antibodies:\n\tFor adipocytes: Perilipin\n\tFor macrophages: CD68 and CD11b staining.\n\tFor dendritic cells: MHC II and CD11b.\n\tFor B cells: B220 (CD45R) staining.\n\tFor T cells: CD3 staining.\n\tNOTE: This method is compatible with the use of genetic models to label immune cells.",
    "For the analysis of the lymphatic collector vessel by intravital 2-photon microscopy, inject the lectin subcutaneously in the lower footpad and visualizing the popliteal lymphatic collecting vessel.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
