  "procedures": [
    "Esophageal biopsies were obtained after informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of the pediatric patients and in accordance with institutional review board (IRB#13-094).\n1. Sterilizing Instruments and Gelatin Solution\nAutoclave forceps, razor blades and scissors prior to handling tissue to prevent contamination.\nTo make 200 mL of 0.1% gelatin solution, combine 200 mL of distilled water with 0.2 g of gelatin. Autoclave and cool prior to use.\n2. Coating Tissue Culture Plates\nApproximately 2 h prior to cell isolation, add enough 0.1 % gelatin to cover a tissue culture dish (100 mm) and incubate at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator.\n\tNOTE: These plates can also be made ahead of time and kept in the incubator before use.\n3. Making Enzyme Solution for Dissociation\nApproximately 30 min prior to cell isolation, weigh out 10 units of dispase on a balance based on the units per milligram concentration on the vial. Place the powder in a 15 mL conical tube with 10 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and place in a 37 °C water bath.\n4. Making Cell Culture Medium\nTo make 50 mL of conditional reprogramming medium, mix the following ingredients into a sterile conical tube: 35 mL of F12 (Ham's Medium), 11.5 mL of DMEM, 0.5 mL of L-glutamine, 0.5 mL of 100x penicillin/streptomycin, 2.5 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS), 250 μg of human insulin, 500 ng of human epidermal growth factor (EGF).\nTo make 500 mL of 3T3 medium, mix 50 mL of FBS, 5 mL of 100x penicillin/streptomycin and 5 mL of L-glutamine with 500 mL of DMEM.",
    "To make 500 mL of keratinocyte serum-free medium, thaw EGF and bovine pituitary extract (BPE) supplements (provided with the media). Add the supplements to the 500 mL bottle of base medium and add 5 mL of 100x penicillin/streptomycin\n5. Culturing and Irradiating 3T3 Cells as a Feeder Source\nPrepare 3T3 medium, comprising DMEM, 10% FBS, 1x penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine.\nCulture 3T3 cells in tissue-treated T-75 flasks at least 3 days before the arrival of patient samples.\nJust prior to the arrival of patient samples, trypsinize 3T3 cells using 5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA per flask and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min or until most cells are floating\nAdd 5 mL of 3T3 medium to stop the reaction. Aspirate the cell suspension and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube. Spin for 5 min at 300 x g.\nAspirate the medium and resuspend the cells in a defined volume of Trypan blue for cell counting. Combine 10 µL of cells with 10 µL of Trypan blue to exclude dead cells. Load 10 µL of this solution on a hemocytometer for cell counting.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, seeding density for irradiated 3T3 cells is 10,900 cells per cm2, which is equal to 600,000 cells per 100 mm plate.\nAliquot the number of cells necessary to plate a 100 mm plate per patient sample and resuspend in 25 mL of 3T3 medium in a 50 mL conical tube and irradiate with 3000 rads.\nFollowing irradiation, spin cells down for 5 min at 300 x g and resuspend in conditional reprogramming medium at 5 mL per 100 mm plate.\nSet the tube aside until the plating of patient cells takes place later in the protocol (see step 7.6).\n6. Obtaining, Preserving and Transporting Pediatric Esophageal Biopsies",
    "Add 5 mL of complete keratinocyte serum-free medium with 100 µg/mL  primocin to 15 mL conical tubes and bring it to the medical facility on ice.\n\tNOTE: These tubes of medium can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months.\nObtain approximately 8 esophageal biopsies at the time of endoscopy and separate as follows:\nPlace six biopsies in the 15 mL conical containing complete keratinocyte serum free medium with 100 µg/mL primocin and place on wet ice.\nPlace one biopsy in 5 mL of buffered formalin and place on wet ice.\nPlace one biopsy in a small biopsy cryomold with optimal cutting temperature compound.\n\t\t\nImmediately drop this mold into a beaker of isopentane placed in liquid nitrogen. Once frozen, place the cryomold in a specimen bag and store on dry ice in a polystyrene foam container.\nPlace the tubes containing biopsies in medium or formalin inside a sealable bag and then into a shipping box containing wet ice. Seal and label the box with a biohazard label and transport it to the laboratory.\n\tNOTE: The container that contains the dry ice and frozen biopsy is also sealed and labeled with a biohazard label.\n7. Processing Patient Tissue for Downstream Culture and Analysis\nUpon arrival at the laboratory, transfer the frozen biopsy on dry ice to -80 °C freezer for downstream sectioning or RNA extraction. Place the sample in formalin. Store in a 4 °C refrigerator and allow to fix overnight.\nSpin the remaining biopsies down at 300 x g, and aspirate the medium. Add 10 mL of dispase solution to the conical tube, seal and allow it to incubate at 37 °C in a water bath for 15 min.",
    "Following the incubation, spin the biopsies down at 300 x g. Aspirate the medium and resuspend biopsies in 5 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.\nTransfer the 5 mL of trypsin-EDTA containing the biopsies to a 100 mm sterile plate and mince the biopsies using 2 sterilized razor blades as fine as possible.\nTransfer the 5 mL of trypsin-EDTA containing minced biopsies to a new 15 mL conical. Rinse the plate twice with an additional 5 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and add to the conical tube. Incubate the tube for 10 min in a 37 °C water bath.\nFollowing the incubation, spin the biopsies down at 300 x g (1.4 RPM) for 5 min and aspirate the medium. Add 5 mL of conditional reprogramming medium to the conical tube as well as the 5 mL of conditional reprogramming medium containing the irradiated feeder cells (see step 5.7).\nAdd ROCK inhibitor (1 μL/mL) to the 10 mL of cell suspension and plate after aspirating the gelatin from the tissue culture dish. Incubate at 37 °C.\n8. Culturing and Expanding Cells\nAfter approximately 5 days of culture, aspirate the initial medium containing the minced-biopsy pieces and rinse the dish 2-3 times with 5 mL sterile PBS. Add new medium to the plate including ROCK inhibitor at 10 μM.\nUpon reaching 70% confluency, expand the cells. Add 5 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the plate and incubate in a 37 °C incubator no more than 2.5 min to remove the feeder cells. Following that incubation, aspirate the trypsin-EDTA and rinse the plate with 5 mL of PBS.",
    "Aspirate the PBS and add 5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA to the plate and incubate for 5-10 min or until the cells are loose from the plate. Add equal amounts of medium to the plate to stop the reaction and transfer all of the fluid to a 50 mL conical tube and spin down at 300 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend cells in a defined volume of conditional reprogramming medium and mix 10 μL of the suspension with 10 μL of trypan blue. Count on a hemocytometer to determine total cell number.\nTo expand cells, add 1 million human esophageal cells to a 150 mm plate along with 1.2 million irradiated 3T3 cells in a total volume of 15 mL. Add fresh ROCK inhibitor at 10μM and add the cell suspension to a gelatin-coated 150 mm dish.\n9. Freeze and Store Human Esophageal Epithelial Cells\nTo make freezing medium, add 10% DMSO to conditional reprogramming medium. After trypsinizing and counting, aliquot the cells to freeze into a new 50 mL conical tube and spin down at 300 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the medium and add freezing medium at a volume of 2 mL per cryovial. Once the cell suspension is homogenous, aliquot 106 cells in pre-labeled cyrovials. Place in a freezing container at -80 °C for at least 24 h prior to moving the vials to long-term liquid nitrogen storage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
