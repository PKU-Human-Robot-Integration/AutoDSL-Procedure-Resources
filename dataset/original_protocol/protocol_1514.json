    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: This protocol has been adapted from the omniATAC version of the ATAC-seq assay, previously described in Corces et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nNote: We advise to perform at least two independent replicates for each condition assayed.\nPreparation of primary mouse cortical neurons\nTiming: ∼3 h plus subsequent culturing.\nIn this step, neurons are harvested from mouse cortices and then transferred onto plates, where they can be subjected to various treatments and manipulations.\nDissociate primary mouse cortical neurons into single-cell suspensions from E16.5 mouse cortices with a papain dissociation system following manufacturer’s recommended protocols (papain dissociation protocol[href=https://www.worthington-biochem.com/PDS/default.html]) with 40 min incubation time in papain solution at 37C.\nPlate neurons onto poly-L-lysine- coated –(add the solution to the plates and incubate for 1 h, then remove it, and rinse three times with H2O) 12-well plates for DNA extraction (450,000 cells/well).\nGrow neurons in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 serum-free supplement, GlutaMAX, and penicillin–streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 370C, with 5% CO2.\nPerform half media changes every 4 or 5 days, or as required.\nDNAse treatment of cells\nTiming: ∼40 min\nNote: DNAse treatment helps improve signal to noise by removing free-floating DNA and digesting DNA from dead cells.\nAdd DNAse at a concentration of 200 U/mL to the media in the plate with the neurons.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nRemove the media with the DNAse from the plate.\nAdd cold 1× PBS to cover the plate and remove the PBS.\nRepeat step 8 three additional times.\nPreparation of nuclei\nTiming: ∼30 min\nIn this step, nuclei are isolated from the rest of cells (thus removing mitochondria and various other debris) and prepared for transposition.",
    "Note: To avoid cell death caused by trypsinization, neurons are directly lysed on the plate, and the nuclei are prepared from the lysate. Carry out all steps on ice and centrifugations at 4°C.\nAdd 1 mL cold ATAC-RSB-Lysis Buffer directly to the neurons on plate.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\nUse cell scraper to collect neurons from the plate and count them on a hemocytometer after staining nucleus with trypan blue.\nCentrifuge ∼50,000 nuclei at 500 g for 5 min in a pre-chilled 4°C fixed-angle centrifuge.\nNote: Nuclei can be counted directly using a cell counter or they can be estimated based on the input number of cells from the previous step.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant in two steps, by first removing most of it, then using the P200 pipette to remove the last ∼100 μL.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ATAC-RSB-Wash Buffer.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 500 g at 4°C.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant in two steps as described above.\nTransposition\nTiming: ∼ 35 min\nIn this step nuclei are incubated with the transposase enzyme, which will insert itself into accessible chromatin regions.\nCarry out transposition as follows:\nImmediately resuspend the pellet in the transposase reaction mix (prepare a master mix for multiple samples in the same proportions):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_5.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min in a Thermomixer with shaking at 1000 RPM.\nDNA purification\nTiming: ∼20 min\nTransposed DNA needs to be purified before it can be amplified.\nNote: Reactions can be cleaned up either with the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator or the Qiagen MinElute Cleanup kits, with equivalent results.\nImmediately stop the reaction using 250 μL (i.e., 5×) of PB buffer (if using MinElute) or DNA Binding Buffer (if using Zymo).\nPurify samples following the kit instructions.",
    "Elute with 10 μL of Elution Buffer.\nPCR amplification and library generation\nTiming: ∼1 h\nTransposed DNA is minuscule in its amount given the low number of input cells, and needs to be amplified sufficiently to be sequenced.\nNote: When amplifying transposed DNA, the initial extension is needed to fill in the gap left from the transposition itself and allow PCR primers to land in subsequent amplification cycles. Hot-start polymerase mixes, in which the polymerase is only activated by exposing it to denaturation temperatures, are therefore not recommended for amplifying ATAC-seq libraries.\nSet up the following PCR reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_6.csv\nOptimize PCR conditions, pre-amplification. Amplify DNA for 5 cycles as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_7.csv\nDetermine additional cycles using qPCR. Use 5 μL of the pre-amplified reaction in a total qPCR reaction of 15 μL as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_8.csv\nDetermine additional cycles using qPCR. Run the qPCR reaction with the following settings in a qPCR machine:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_9.csv\nAssess the amplification profiles and determine the required number of additional cycles to amplify.\nCarry out final amplification by placing the remaining 45 μL in a thermocycler and running the following program:\nNadd cycles of:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_10.csv\nWhere Nadd is the number of additional cycles.\nIn practice, 8–10 total cycles are usually sufficient to amplify a standard ATAC library thus if a large number of samples are being processed at the same time, the following reaction can be run:\nSingle-step PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_11.csv\nPurify the amplified library as described above for the purified ATAC reaction7. Elute in 20 μL Elution Buffer.\nNote: In our experience, primer dimers are efficiently removed from ATAC libraries with simple column purification and size selection with beads is not necessary.\nLibrary size distribution profiling\nTiming: ∼10 min",
    "A highly informative quality control step is to evaluate the distribution of final libraries. i.e., to check whether it shows the typical nucleosomal pattern, or it deviates from it in potentially important ways.\nThere are multiple options for carrying out this step, e.g., the TapeStation and BioAnalyzer instruments. We prefer to use a TapeStation with the D1000 or HS D1000 kits due to its ease of use, flexibility and rapid turnaround time. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions depending on the exact instrument and kit used (TapeStation online protocol[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/ScreenTape_D1000_QG.pdf]).\nLibrary quantification\nTiming: ∼50 min\nBefore they are sequenced, libraries need to be quantified, and this has to be done in terms of molarity, not just mass, as molarity is what is important for accurate loading on the sequencer.\nNote: This step is typically carried out using a Qubit fluorometer for most high-throughput sequencing libraries that exhibit a unimodal fragment length distribution. However, ATAC-seq fragment distribution is usually not unimodal and ATAC-seq libraries often include fragments longer than what can be sequenced on standard Illumina instruments. Effective library concentrations therefore often differ from apparent library concentrations measured using Qubit. The best way to estimate effective library concentration is thus qPCR. Commercial kits such as the NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina or KAPA Library Quantification Kits can also be used, in a similar manner.\nGenerate a standard curve using Illumina PhiX standard (10nM) by first making a 50× dilution to 200 pM, then making additional serial 2× dilutions to 100 pM, 50 pM, 25 pM, 12.5 pM, 6.25 pM, 3.125 pM, and 1.56 pM.\nSet up a 20 μL qPCR reactions as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_12.csv\nRun the qPCR reaction with the following settings in a qPCR machine:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1055_13.csv",
    "Create a standard curve based on the PhiX dilutions and estimate the library’s true molarity based on it.\nSequencing\nThis protocol generates libraries intended to be sequenced on Illumina sequencers.\nNote: Make sure to use optimally compatible index pairs when pooling libraries prior to sequencing.\nNote: Once libraries have been made, the optimal sequencing format needs to be decided on, as there are multiple different Illumina kits, which differ in their output, read length, and cost.\nNote: ATAC-seq libraries should not be sequenced in a single-end format, as the analysis of fragment lengths is important for the quality evaluation of ATAC-seq datasets and for a number of downstream analyses, which are only possible in a paired-end format. In addition, some analytical tasks, (such as transcription factor foot printing) focus on Tn5 insertions rather than read coverage, and paired-end reads produce twice as many such data points for the same cost.\nNote: We also note that the post-sequencing ATAC-seq insert length distribution peaks between 50 and 100 bp (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). It is accordingly most cost-effective to sequence ATAC libraries in 2×36 bp or 2 × 50 bp formats (depending on whether using a NextSeq or some of the higher-throughput Illumina instruments). However, some applications (e.g. analyzing the effects of sequence variation on chromatin accessibility) can benefit from longer reads, and this should be kept in mind depending on the goals of the particular study."
