    "The following protocols are accepted under the University of Maryland's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as well as the Institutional Review Board. The protocols follow federal, state and local standards, and the guidelines set out by the University of Maryland Policy on Biosafety.\n1. Dissection of Eye Sample\nObtain an eye sample from local slaughterhouse or tissue bank. If an entire eye globe is obtained, immediately extract the lens, attached zonules, and vitreous.\n\t​NOTE: The specific details described below pertain to both porcine and human eyes.\n\t\nUsing disinfected surgical scissors and forceps, cut and remove all excess tissue surrounding the sclera.\nFirmly hold the eye on its side and, using a razor blade, make a small incision along the side of the eye 3 mm away from the cornea. Make the cut deep enough to have reached the vitreous inside the eye.\nUsing scissors, carefully cut further along the incision around the circumference of the eye. Avoid puncturing the lens. A representative image is shown in Figure 2A.\nOnce the outside circumference of the eye has been cut, remove the posterior tissue of the eye using forceps. Isolate the lens, zonules, ciliary body, and the attached vitreous with forceps. A representative image is shown in Figure 2B.\nUsing the scissors and forceps, remove excess vitreous so the lens can lay flat on the MLS.\n\t\tNOTE: In cases of corneal transplant, the corneal button is used in surgery and the remainder of the globe is available for research purposes. However, this partial globe can still be used in the tissue preparation of the lens stretcher setup. If only the posterior is obtained, only perform step 1.1.4–1.1.5.\nDisinfect all used equipment post-dissection in 15% bleach solution for 30 min.\n2. Trial Assembly of the Manual Lens Stretcher",
    "Insert the 10 mm shoe bottoms and the corresponding shoe tops into the bottom plate of the MLS so there remains a 5 mm gap between the back wall of the shoe indent and the shoe itself.\nAlign the top and bottom plates, snapping the plates together; the device is now in the unstretched position.\nInsert the plates into the plate case and the stopper screw into the hole located on the side of the bottom plate.\nInsert the plate case into the base and place the wrench into the aligned indents.\nTwist the wrench clockwise until it reaches the stopping screw to contract the shoes, and twist back counter-clockwise to return the shoes to the original unstretched position.\n3. Mounting of the Lens\nInsert the 10 mm shoe bottoms into the bottom plate in the MLS so that a 5 mm gap between remains the back wall of the shoe indent and the shoe itself.\nUsing curved forceps, place the extracted lens face up on the middle of the bottom plate so that the shoes are supporting the lens over the central hole.\nSnap the corresponding top of the shoes into place, clipping only the zonules and the vitreous. Visually ensure that the lens stays as centered as possible on the bottom plate.\nRepeat Steps 2.3–2.4.\n4. Measurement of the Lens\nPlace an imaging system directly above the apparatus in order to capture videos and pictures of the stretching process. Be sure to include a ruler in the frame of the picture to accurately size and scale images in post-processing.\n\tNOTE: Any suitable imaging system is sufficient for this step; here we use a 12 megapixel, autofocusing smartphone one foot from the sample.",
    "Firmly yet smoothly, rotate the wrench in the clockwise direction to stretch the lens. Figure 3 shows representative images at the unstretched and stretched state.\nAfter photographing the stretched lens, rotate the wrench in the counter-clockwise direction to restore the sample to its resting state.\n\tNOTE: It is imperative that the measurement of the lens is performed in a timely manner in order to minimize the dehydration of the lens.\nClearly photograph the final resting state of the lens.\n5. Data Analysis\nUpload the image to ImageJ and, use the \"point\" feature to select at least 40 points around the circumference of the lens as shown in Figure 4A. Use the \"Analyze\" → \"Measure\" option to yield the location of each selected point.\nFit (using software e.g. MATLAB) the location points in order to yield a radius and chi-square of the fit as shown in Figure 4B. Convert the pixel radius and error into metrics using the photographed ruler.\nPerform paired two tailed t-test to comparing an individual lens before and after stretching from the MLS.\nSubscription Required.
