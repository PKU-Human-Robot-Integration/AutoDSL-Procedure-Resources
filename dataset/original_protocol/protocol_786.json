    "The following details the procedure for creating microfluidic masters, devices and running the experiments. Devices can be prepared ahead of time.  \n \n**I. Microfluidic device fabrication:**\n_A. Mold fabrication_ &#x2013; the mold wafers should be fabricated in a Cleanroom environment if possible for a high yield in device fabrication.  Follow Cleanroom protocols and safety precautions. \n&#x2022; Worm loading layer\n1. Spin-coat SU8-2025 on a silicon wafer at 3000 rpm.\n  2. Soft bake the wafer at 95&#xBA;C for 5 min and UV-expose the photoresist with a mask \\(**Fig. 2a**)  for the worm loading layer.\n  3. Hard bake at 95&#xBA;C for 7 min and develop the wafer with SU8 developer.\n  4. Spin-coat AZ50XT on the wafer at 2200 rpm.\n  5. Use a mask \\(**Fig. 2b**) of AZ features for UV exposure.\n  6. After development with AZ 400T developer, heat the wafer at 125 &#xBA;C for 5 min to reflow the AZ photoresist.\n  &#x2022; Control layer\n1. Spin-coat SU8-2050 on a silicon wafer at 3000 rpm.\n  2. Soft bake the wafer at 95&#xBA;C for 5 min and UV exposure with a mask \\(**Fig. 2c**) for the control layer.\n  3. Hard bake at 95&#xBA;C for 7 min and develop the wafer with SU8 developer.\n  &#x2022; Filtering device\n1. Spin-coat SU8-2025 on a silicon wafer at 3000 rpm.\n  2. Soft bake the wafer at 95&#xBA;C for 5 min and UV exposure with a mask \\(**Fig. 3**).\n  3. Hard bake at 95&#xBA;C for 7 min and develop the wafer.\n  &#x2022; Treat the two molds and a blank wafer with tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-trichlorosilane vapor in a vacuum desiccators at room temperature for at least 4hr. This process needs to be done in a hood because the chemical vapor is toxic.   \n_B. PDMS device fabrication_\n&#x2022; Worm imaging device- The fabrication process is described in **Fig. 4**.",
    "1. Prepare Mixture #1 of PDMS \\(A and B in 5:1 ratio) and a mixture #2 of PDMS \\(A and B and Toluene in 20:1:10.5 ratio) in a chemical hood.\n  2. Pour Mixture #1 onto the control-layer master to obtain a 5 mm-thick layer in a 15-mm Petri dish and bake the dish for 20 min at 70 &#xBA;C to make PDMS layer 1.\n  3. Spin-coat Mixture #2 onto the blank wafer to give a  ~20 &#xB5;m-thick layer and bake to cure for 10 min at 70 &#xBA;C .\n  4. Peel off the PDMS layer 1 from the master and place it on the PDMS membrane. \n  5. Fully cure the combined PDMS layer for 2 hours at 70 &#xBA;C for bonding.\n  6. Spin-coat Mixture #1 onto the worm-loading layer master to give a 60 &#xB5;m-thick layer and bake it for 2 hours at 70 &#xBA;C to give PDMS layer 2.\n  7. Peel off the PDMS layer 2 from the master and flip it over.\n  8. Align the combined PDMS layer and bond it onto the flipped PDMS layer 2 using oxygen plasma treatment \\[ref 2].\n  9. Punch holes and bond it onto the cover glass.\n  &#x2022; Filtering device\n1. Prepare mixture of PDMS \\(A and B in 10:1 ratio).\n  2. Pour the mixture onto the filtering device master to obtain a 5 mm-thick layer in a 15-mm Petri dish and bake the dish for 2 hours at 70 &#xBA;C.\n  3. Peel off the PDMS layer, punch holes and bond it onto the cover glass using plasma treatment.\n  \n**II. _C. elegans_ culture and sample preparation**",
    "1. Bleach adults using bleaching solution for ~5 min \\[ref 3].  Watch the adult animals in the solution; as the bodies start to disintegrate, stop the bleaching by diluting and washing with M9 as not to overbleach the embryos.\n  2. Let embryos hatch in M9 buffer for ~12 hr and transfer hatched first larval stage animals on Nematode Growth Medium \\(NGM) plates seeded with _E. coli_ OP50.\n  3. Culture the animals to the stage of interest.\n  4. Wash out animals from the NGM plate using M9 solution containing 0.5 % wt/vol Bovine Serum Albumin \\(BSA). Spin down and wash three times with the M9 solution to remove _E. coli_ from the worm suspension. \n  5. Flow the worm suspension through the filtering device to remove debris.\n  \n**III. System operation**\n1. Connect tubings and pins to the device properly and mount it on the stage of the microscope.\n  2. Prime the device with the buffer solution \\(M9).\n  3. Set up cooling system.  The coolant is pumped through a tubing that is placed adjacent to the Peltier device.  \n  4. Make sure that there is no leakage, and that the valves work properly.  Check the coolant temperature at the cooling inlet using a thermocouple.  The optimal temperature of the coolant is ~3 &#xB0;C before going on the chip.\n  5. Run the Matlab code.  **Fig. 5** shows the valve control configurations and sequences for imaging and sorting.\n  6. Inject worm suspension into the device using pressure driven flow.  We use ~8 to 10 psi but the actual pressure will depend on each system setup \\(e.g. the length of the tubing).  \n  7. After performing imaging/sorting, flush the lines with enough buffer to collect animals and spin down the suspensions in the collection tubes.\n  8. Transfer animals onto NGM plates seeded with _E. coli_ OP50."
