    "The primary hepatocyte isolations for this protocol were performed by the Cell Resource Core (CRC) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The animal protocol (#2011N000111) was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Massachusetts General Hospital.\n1. Bulk droplet vitrification\nPrepare the vitrification solutions.\nAdd 40 mg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to 17.0 mL of University of Wisconsin solution (UW) to make vitrification solution 1 (V1). Sterile filter the V1 solution using a 0.22 µm filter and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: UW is a commonly used organ preservation solution. It contains 50 g/L hydroxyethyl starch, 35.83 g/L lactobionic acid, 3.4 g/L potassium phosphate monobasic, 1.23 g/L magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 17.83 g/L raffinose pentahydrate, 1.34 g/L adenosine, 0.136 g/L allopurinol, 0.992 g/L total glutathione, 5.61 g/L potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to 7.4.\nCombine 7.0 mL of UW, 6.5 mL of DMSO, 6.5 mL of ethylene glycol (EG), 40 mg of BSA, and 5.48 g of sucrose to make vitrification solution 2 (V2). Sterile filter the V2 solution using a 0.22 µm filter. Load 3.5 mL of sterile filtered V2 solution in a 3 mL syringe and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: To facilitate dissolving the CPAs, solutions are prepared in larger quantities than required.\nPrepare the bulk droplet vitrification apparatus.\nTo prepare the mixing needle, first cut along one side of the mixing needle’s outer gray sleeve, and then bend the sleeve open to remove it from the mixing needle.\nSlide two 25 mm silicone tubing sections over the inlets of the mixing needle and secure their position with glue (Figure 1A).\nCut the needle to a length of 20 mm (i.e., the length of the inner mixing helix) as shown in Figure 1A.",
    "NOTE: The mixing needle length is proportional to the volume inside the needle and therefore can be altered to control the exposure time of the hepatocytes to the high CPA concentration solution.\nInsert the cutoff outlet of the mixing needle into a 20 G injection needle (Figure 1B).\n\t\tNOTE: The injection needle size influences the droplet size.\nSterilize the mixing needle assembly by autoclaving.\nFill a sterile Dewar with liquid nitrogen. Sterilize the outside of the Dewar with isopropanol before placing the Dewar in a sterile laminar flow cell culture hood.\n\t\tNOTE: Contamination is an important consideration during direct exposure of the droplets to liquid nitrogen. Although there was no contamination using non-sterilized liquid nitrogen in the current protocol, liquid nitrogen can be filtered or irradiated to assure sterility if needed16.\nInsert a funnel with the same outer diameter as the inner diameter of the liquid nitrogen Dewar into a 50 mL conical tube to create the droplet collection device (Figure 1C−E).\nSubmerge the droplet collection device in the liquid nitrogen by slowly pressing it down in its final vertical position using large forceps. Ensure that the conical tube rests in a vertical position at the bottom of the Dewar (Figure 1D−E).\n\t\tNOTE: The funnel should stay inserted in and resting on the conical tube. The liquid nitrogen level should be 1 cm below the inlet height of the funnel, as shown in Figure 1D.\nMount a syringe pump in a vertical position on the wall of the cell culture hood by tying a string from the syringe pump’s feet to screws protruding from the cell culture hood wall.\nPlace the liquid nitrogen Dewar with the droplet collection device under the vertically mounted syringe pump (Figure 1E).\nPre-incubate with CPAs.",
    "After obtaining freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, count the stock concentration by Trypan blue exclusion and take 40 million viable hepatocytes.\n\t\tNOTE: Gentle handling of hepatocytes in suspension is critical to prevent cell death.\nCentrifuge at 50 x g for 5 min without brake.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the hepatocytes in 3.4 mL of V1 solution.\nIncubate on ice for 3 min.\nAdd 150 µL of DMSO and 150 µL of EG to the hepatocytes and mix gently.\nIncubate on ice for 3 min.\nAgain, add 150 µL of DMSO and 150 µL of EG to the hepatocytes and mix gently.\nLoad 3.5 mL in a 3 mL syringe.\nPerform vitrification.\nInsert the syringe with pre-incubated hepatocytes and the V2 solution syringes onto the syringe pump adapter.\nAttach two female Luer lock hose barb adaptors to the syringes and slide the silicone tubing of the mixing needle assembly over the barb fittings (Figure 1F).\nPlace the entire assembly in the syringe pump (Figure 1E).\nThree min after the last addition of DMSO and EG to the hepatocytes, start the pump at 2 mL/min.\nStop the pump after all hepatocytes have been added to the liquid nitrogen.\n2. Cryogenic storage\nPuncture 10 small holes in the lid of a 50 mL conical tube using a 20 G needle and wrap the outside of the lid with a flexible film, as shown in Figure 1B. This creates a valve that enables the escape of evaporating leftover liquid nitrogen.\nTo collect the vitrified hepatocyte droplets, first remove the funnel from the liquid nitrogen Dewar. Next, use long forceps to take the conical tube that contains the droplets out of the liquid nitrogen and slowly pour out the excess liquid nitrogen from the conical tube.",
    "Close the conical tube with the punctured lid and directly place the closed conical tube with vitrified hepatocyte droplets back in the liquid nitrogen Dewar.\nTransfer the conical tube from the liquid nitrogen into a liquid nitrogen vapor cryotank.\n3. Rewarming of the vitrified hepatocyte droplets\nPrepare the rewarming solution.\nDissolve 17.13 g of sucrose in 100 mL of DMEM hepatocyte culture media to make the rewarming solution. Sterile filter the rewarming solution using a 0.22 µm filter and warm to 37 °C.\nRewarm the hepatocytes.\nTake the conical tube with vitrified hepatocytes from the cryotank and transport it in a liquid nitrogen Dewar to the cell culture hood.\nLightly loosen the cap and put the conical tube back in the liquid nitrogen.\nAdd the vitrified hepatocyte droplets to an empty beaker, instantaneously add the warm (37 °C) rewarming solution, and immediately stir for 10 s.\n\t\tNOTE: It is critical to work quickly to avoid freezing during rewarming. Depending on the study requirements, a few to all vitrified droplets can be rewarmed at once.\nUnload the rewarming solution.\nDivide the rewarming solution with hepatocytes over two 50 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge the two conical tubes for 2 min at 100 x g at 4 °C without brake.\nAspirate the supernatant to leave a total volume of 12.5 mL using the conical tube’s graduation mark as a reference and add 12.5 mL of ice cold DMEM per conical tube to dilute the rewarming solution to 50%.\nResuspend the hepatocytes and incubate on ice for 3 min.\nAdd 25 mL of ice cold DMEM per conical tube to dilute the rewarming solution to 25%.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 50 x g at 4 °C without brake.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the hepatocytes in 2 mL of the desired culture medium for use.\n\t\tNOTE: Density gradient centrifugation can be used to remove dead hepatocytes from the cell suspension if desired.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
