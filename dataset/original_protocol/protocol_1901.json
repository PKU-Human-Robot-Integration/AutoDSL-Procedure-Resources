    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEEG electrode preparation\nTiming: 40 min per electrode assembly\nThe purpose of this step is to construct a multi-channel electrode assembly for EEG recordings in freely moving mice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1496-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Recording channel layout and electrode wiring\n(A) Diagram of the channel layout on a female connector (bottom view) and the wiring of each recording electrode.\n(B) Diagram of a female connector (top view) with wired electrodes. The matched double male connector enables the connection during recordings.\n(C) Diagram of the electrode assembly mounted on the mouse head.\nNote: The EEG electrode assembly consists of three recording channels (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Channel 1 (CH1) and Channel 2 (CH2) record EEG activity from the left frontal cortex and the left parietal cortex, respectively; a shared reference electrode is positioned in the occipital region of the skull. The recording electrodes of these two channels are constructed with Teflon-coated silver wire (127 μm bare diameters). Channel 3 (CH3) uses electrode built with Teflon-coated tungsten wire (50 μm bare diameters) and records local field potentials in the dentate gyrus of the right dorsal hippocampal formation; a reference electrode is positioned in the ipsilateral corpus callosum.\nCut 4 pieces of perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA)-coated silver wire ∼20 mm long.\nUse a razor blade to remove 3–4 mm of the Teflon coating at one end of each wire under a dissection microscope.\nNote: Take care to avoid cutting through the silver wire. One of the 4 wires is for the ground of the recording preamplifier (see below).\nUse a surgical tweezer to entwine the exposed portion of the silver wire around the base of the corresponding pins on the female connector (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nSolder each connection at the wired place of the connector.\nNote: Avoid soldering the connector holes.",
    "Cut two pieces of stainless-steel tubing (30 Gauge) that is ∼5 mm long.\nUse sandpaper to polish both ends to fully open the ends and achieve final tube lengths of ∼4 mm.\nFlush the tubes with Millipore water and dry them. Solder the tubes together (side by side) to make a bundle.\nNote: Use a surgical tweezer to hold the tube while polishing. Remove dust inside the tubes by flicking them occasionally with the tweezer tip; this will avoid blocking the tube ends with dust. Solder briefly in order to bind the two tubes while avoiding blocking them with solder dust.\nCut two pieces of PFA-coated tungsten wire that are ∼25 mm long.\nUnder a dissection microscope, insert the wire into each of the two tubes.\nThen, bend each tungsten wire by ∼90º in the middle and remove 4–5 mm of Teflon coating from the tips not inserted through the tubes.\nVertically attach the tube bundle with tungsten wires on the corresponding pin of the female connector by soldering them briefly (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C).\nUse a surgical tweezer to entwine the Teflon-free portion of the tungsten wire around the base of the corresponding pins on the female connector and solder each connections of the wired place (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: Solder flux can help make the soldering more efficient.\nUnder a scaled dissection microscope, use surgical scissors to cut the two coated tungsten wires that came out of the stainless-steel tubes so that the wires extend past the tube tip by 1.8 mm and 0.9 mm, respectively.\nUse a multimeter to check/verify each wire connection and avoid crosstalk between different channels.\nSurgical implantation of the EEG electrodes\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "This step outlines how to implant electrode probes into mouse brains. All the procedures should be performed under aseptic conditions that include appropriate personal protective equipment, autoclaved instruments, and the use of a glass-bead sterilizer.\nAutoclave all necessary surgical instruments on a stainless-steel tray.\nInject the mouse with Meloxicam (5.0 mg/kg, S.C.) 30 min before administering anesthesia.\nUse an isoflurane vaporizer to anesthetize the 12-week-old mouse with 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen (1.0 L/min) in the induction chamber until it is fully anesthetized (does not respond to tail- or foot-pinch).\nRemove the mouse from the induction chamber and lay it flat on its stomach on a diaper. Carefully shave the top of its head.\nEvenly apply hair remover lotion on the shaved surgical area for ∼10 s to completely remove the fur from the skin.\nPut the mouse back into the induction chamber until it again loses pinch reflexes.\nQuickly mount the anesthetized mouse onto the stereotaxic frame and switch the isoflurane anesthesia to the nose connection of the frame. The mouse should rest comfortably on a heating blanket (see step 23).\nReduce the isoflurane concentration to 1.0%–2.0% to maintain the anesthesia level throughout the procedure.\nUse a feedback-controlled heating blanket to maintain the mouse’s body temperature at 35°C–36°C.\nInsert the temperature sensor probe with a lubricated tip part 7–8 mm into the rectum.\nCover the mouse's eyes with ophthalmic ointment to protect them from dryness and bright light during the surgery.\nDisinfect the surgical region with 75% ethanol followed by betadine, three times.\nInject a 50/50 mix of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine diluted 1:20 in sterile saline (0.04 mL/10 g body weight) subdermally along the incision line.\nWait for 2–3 min before making the incision.",
    "Use a scalpel to make an incision along the midline between the eyes and the occiput (∼15 mm long) and pull the skin to the sides.\nUse a scalpel blade to clear all the connecting tissues and then a cotton swab soaked in 8% hydrogen peroxide to expose the skull surface.\nLet it dry so that the suture lines (bregma, lambda, etc.) on the skull are clearly visible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1496-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Surgical implantation of the electrodes\n(A) The bregma and lambda are identified after the skull is cleaned and dried.\n(B) Electrode assembly mounted on the electrode holder of the stereotaxic arm through a custom-made adaptor.\n(C and D) The sites of the three recording channels, the reference, and the ground are determined on the skull.\n(E) Small openings are made with a high-speed drill.\nAttach the electrode assembly to the electrode holder of the stereotaxic arm with a custom-made adaptor (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nDetermine the coordinates for each recording channel (CH1, left frontal cortex: A1.8L1.8; CH2, left parietal cortex: P0.8L1.5; CH3, dentate gyrus: P2.0R1.0H1.9) (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and mark each point on the skull with a fine black marker (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nUse a surgical high-speed drill (0.7 mm bur tip diameter) to make openings (∼0.8 mm diameter) at each mark on the skull (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nThen, rough the rest of the exposed skull surface with drill mounted with fissure crosscut bur for better cementing contact. All the cortical electrodes should be placed in the subdural space.\nSlowly lower the CH3 electrode to their planned depth (0.2 mm per step).\nNote: Make sure that the bregma and lambda are at the same vertical level before determining the coordinates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "Apply dental cement (C&B Metabond) sequentially at the skull openings with electrode wires, the rest of the skull surface, and the space between the skull and the bottom side of the female connector. Make sure that all of the wires and wire connections on the connector pins are embedded into the cement.\nAfter the cement hardens (∼20 min), suture the incised skin at the rostral and caudal ends. Attach the skin edges at both sides on the cement surface using tissue glue.\nWithdraw the ear bars and loosen the nose piece. Carefully detach the implanted head posts from the connected adaptor.\nTransfer the implanted mouse into a pre-warmed cage that is heated by a heat-therapy pump. After the mouse awakes from the anesthesia, house it individually in the animal facility for 14 days to recover from the surgery.\nAdminister Meloxicam (5.0 mg/kg, S.C.) daily for at least 3 days post-surgery. Carefully observe the post-surgical recovery of the mouse.",
    "Note: Help the mice to begin eating again after surgery by setting drinking-water-softened food in a petri dish on the cage floor for the first few days. Offer fresh softened food each day for at least 2 days, or until the mouse has completely recovered. We gauge recovery by the mouse returning to normal eating and drinking, showing normal activity levels in the home cage, responding as it did before surgery to the experimenter opening the cage, and, very importantly, showing no signs of infection or pain. Obviously, this means the experimenter needs to spend time closely observing the mice and gently handling them prior to surgery and carefully checking on them daily after the surgery. In fact, we recommend weighing the mice after the surgery daily for at least a week, to provide opportunities to gently interact with them and to make sure they don't lose too much body weight from the surgery (2–3 weeks after the surgery their weight is usually within 5% of its value on the surgery day).\nVideo-EEG recording\nTiming: 28 h over 7 days\nThis step describes in detail how to record EEG activities synchronized with behavior in freely moving mice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1496-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Video-EEG recording system and connection between head post and pre-amplifier\n(A) Schematic of equipment wiring for video-EEG monitoring in freely moving mice.\n(B) Illustration of the connection between head post and pre-amplifier via a custom-made adaptor.\n(C) Representative EEG traces adapted from (Gennarino et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) under permission. The knockout mice showed generalized epileptiform spikes typically lasted over 10 s. Wild type littermates do not show neither hyperexcitability discharges nor electrographic seizure.",
    "The EEG recording system requires the following components: Faraday cage, recording chamber, head-mounted preamplifier, commutator, differential AC amplifier, Axon digitizer, and Axon data acquisition software pClamp 10. The behavioral monitoring system consists of an overhead USB camera, ANY-tracking software, and an interface (AMi-2 digital interface). The output signal from the EEG recording system uses AMi-2 to trigger the video tracking system and synchronize the EEG and video recordings. Video and EEG data are stored in the computer for off-line analysis.\nSet up the video-EEG motoring system (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nInside a Faraday cage, prepare the mouse recording chamber (8-inch-high Plexiglass cylinder with a 10-inch diameter) with a water bottle, bedding, and food on the chamber floor\nSet up the overhead camera with proper zoom and focus. Connect the camera to a USB port of the computer.\nConnect the preamplifier to its power supply (± 4.5 V) and to the differential AC amplifier inputs. Use high pass filter at 0.1 Hz and low pass filter at 1 kHz. Set the overall gain (preamplifier and amplifier together) at 100×.\nConnect the outputs of the differential AC amplifier to the analog inputs of the digitizer. Then, connect the USB output of the digitizer to a USB port of the computer.\nConnect a digital output of the digitizer to the input of AMi-2 interface and AMi-2 to a USB port of the computer to synchronize EEG and behavior recordings.\nBuild up the protocol for EEG recording in pClamp software and the protocol for video motoring in ANY-maze tracking system.\nData collection:\nFor each recording session, transfer the mouse to the recording room and wait at least 30 min before recording.\nConnect the head post to the preamplifier through a custom-made adaptor (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and house the animal in the EEG recording chamber (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1496-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Photograph of a freely moving mouse with preamplifier in an EEG recording session\nThe recording chamber locates inside a Faraday cage, with mouse chow and water ad libitum. Therefore, the setup allows 24/7 chronic video-EEG monitoring.\nOpen pCLAMP and ANY-maze software and load corresponding protocols.\nStart the video-EEG recording.\nNote: In this protocol, one of these two pins is used to mechanically hold the CH3 electrode wires only (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and B). Leave the two pins at the caudal head post free when connecting the preamplifier to the head post (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Make sure that the Faraday cage and the recording system are properly grounded to reduce environmental noise.\nSeizure analysis of the video-EEG data\nTiming: 15 h\nThis step details how to use the recorded EEG and behavioral data to identify seizure events.\nOpen the EEG data files using Clampfit (a built-in pCLAMP software program). Open the corresponding mouse-behavior video files using ANY-maze software.\nSeizure events at the EEG or behavioral level are identified visually by experimenters blind to mouse genotype and/or treatment. Electrographic seizure activities were visually identified and matched with the behavioral seizure, if applicable. The continuous field potential recording traces are composed of regular EEG with smaller amplitude fluctuations and superimposed higher amplitude spike discharges, if any (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). To qualify as an electrographic seizure event, the event must show at least 10 s of epileptiform discharges that are positive or negative deflections exceeding twice the baseline activity (Roberson et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])."
