    "Co-transform plasmids encoding HSV-1 UL31 (15-185) or PRV UL31 (1-176), in His6-SUMO-3C-pET24b, and HSV-1 UL34 (51-306) or PRV UL34 (18-271), in pGEX-6P1, into E. coli Rosetta cells using heat shock transformation. Plate on LB-agar plates containing 100 mg/L ampicillin, 50 mg/L kanamycin and 34 mg/L chloramphenicol.Pick a single colony to inoculate a starter culture of 50 ml TB medium containing 1% glucose, 2 mM MgSO4, 34 mg/L chloramphenicol, 100 mg/L ampicillin and 100 mg/L kanamycin. Incubate the culture in a shaker at 37 °C, 200 rpm, for 16 h.Inoculate 3 L of TB containing 0.2% lactose, 2 mM MgSO4, 100 mg/L ampicillin and 100 mg/L kanamycin with 10 ml of the starter culture and grow at 37 °C, 200 rpm, for 4 h. Reduce the temperature to 25 °C and grow the cultures for another 16 h. Typically a final OD600 of 5-6 is reached.Harvest cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Filter and degas all buffers used in purification. Throughout the purification, confirm the presence and quality of the purified proteins by SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie staining (Figure 1). Determine protein concentration by measuring the OD280 [extinction coefficients: 37,360 M-1 cm-1 (HSV-1 NEC) and 34,840 M-1 cm-1 (PRV NEC)] using a spectrophotometer.Wash cell pellets in lysis buffer and centrifuge in 50 ml conical tubes for 5 min at 5,000 x g at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and process pellets immediately or flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.Resuspend cell pellets in lysis buffer supplemented with the cOmplete Protease Inhibitor mix (one tablet/25 ml lysate) and DNase I (one tip of a spatula/50 ml lysate).Lyse cells in a microfluidizer (3 runs, 80 psi). A comparable cell disruptor may be used instead.",
    "Clear the cell lysate by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min. All subsequent steps are to be carried out at 4 °C or on ice.Apply the supernatant onto a Ni-NTA sepharose column (8 ml), equilibrated with lysis buffer, with a flow rate of 2 ml/min and wash with lysis buffer containing 20-40 mM imidazole. Elute bound proteins with lysis buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Pass the eluted proteins over a GSH sepharose column (8 ml), equilibrated with lysis buffer, to remove excess His6-SUMO-UL31. After washing with lysis buffer, use PreScission protease in a 1:30 molar ratio to cleave His6-SUMO and GST tags on the GSH column for 16 h in one column volume lysis buffer circulating at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min.Apply lysis buffer to the GSH sepharose column and collect the flow-through fraction containing untagged NEC and His6-SUMO. Apply this sample onto 2 tandem-coupled 1 ml Talon HiTrap columns to separate His6-SUMO from the NEC. Collect the flow-through fraction, containing the untagged NEC, and concentrate it using a concentrator with a MWCO of 50 kDa. Between different protein preparations, wash the Ni-NTA and GSH columns with one column volume 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.2 M acetic acid. Then wash with 10 column volumes dH2O.To obtain monodisperse NEC, as a final purification step, apply the concentrated sample from step 13 to a Superdex 75 10/300 column equilibrated with gel filtration buffer.Pool NEC-containing fractions from the monodisperse peak and concentrate up to ~10 mg/ml. Aliquot protein samples and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen for subsequent storage at -80 °C. The typical yield is 10 mg monodisperse NEC per L TB culture.Prior to crystallization, dilute proteins to 5 mg/ml and filter through a 0.1 µm membrane to remove aggregates.",
    "Grow HSV-1 NEC crystals by vapor diffusion in hanging drops with 0.5 µl protein and 0.5 µl reservoir solution in 10% PEG 8000, 0.1 M Na citrate, pH 5.6, 5 mM NiCl2 at 22 °C. HSV-1 NEC crystals resembling hexagonal plates appear after 2 days and reach their final size after 1 week (Figure 2A).Soak HSV-1 NEC crystals briefly in the reservoir solution containing 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen.Grow PRV NEC crystals by vapor diffusion in hanging drops with 0.5 µl protein and 0.5 µl reservoir solution in 18% PEG 3350, 0.3 M NaSCN, 0.3 M NaCl at 22 °C. Tetragonal crystals of PRV NEC appear after one day and reach their final size after 2 days (Figure 2B).Soak PRV NEC crystals briefly in the reservoir solution containing 15% meso-erythritol as a cryoprotectant and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen."
