    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollecting and snap-freezing of tissue samples\nTiming: 2–3 h\nBefore PALP analysis, tissue samples are dissected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen and washing buffer (deionized water) are prepared prior to the experiment. In this protocol, we used subcutaneous tumors isolated from 5-week-old female athymic nude mice as described above. However, tissues of interest from different age range and sex can be analyzed by the PALP technique.\nEuthanize the mouse and dissect the tissue of interest for analysis.\nNote: We recommend using cervical dislocation for euthanizing the mouse to minimize perturbations on the metabolic characteristics of the tissue samples (Underwood and Anthony, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: The PALP technique is applicable for analyzing various tissues including brain, kidney, heart, liver, spleen, and muscle.\nRinse the tissue samples briefly with deionized water to remove blood remnants.\nSnap-freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen. (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1522-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic for snap-freezing tissues in liquid nitrogen, related to step 3\nFold a piece of aluminum foil into a boat shape and float on liquid nitrogen.\nPlace tissue inside the foil boat.\nAfter 5 s, use forceps to gently press the foil boat and allow a small volume of liquid nitrogen to flow into the boat. Repeat until the tissue is completely submerged in liquid nitrogen.\nAfter evaporation of liquid nitrogen covering the tissue sample, remove tissue and wrap with aluminum foil.\nFrozen tissue can be stored at −80°C until use.\nNote: To preserve the membrane structure, tissue samples are best snap-frozen without optimal cutting temperature (OCT) as embedding material. To embed fragile or thin tissues such as skin, testis, and ovary, gelatin or 2.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) are recommended as embedding medium (Nelson et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).",
    "Pause point: Frozen tissue samples can be kept in −80°C for long-term storage prior to tissue sectioning while avoiding freeze-thaw cycle. The maximum storage time for the frozen tissue samples is one year.\nCryosectioning of tissues\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThe following steps prepare tissue sections for staining with BODIPY-C11 and PALP imaging.\nTransfer the frozen tissue to −20°C at least 30 min prior to sectioning to equilibrate the temperature of the tissue to that inside the cryostat chamber.\nTransfer the tissue to the cryostat chamber and affix the tissue to the specimen disc using ultrapure water.\nSet the optimal cutting temperature. For tissues that contain higher fat deposition, slightly lower temperature for the cryostat is recommended. The cutting temperature is typically −20 ± 3°C, e.g., −18°C for kidney and −20°C for brain tissues.\nSection the tissue to 10 μm (5–15 μm) and thaw mount sections onto glass slides.\nNote: The thickness of the sections can be adjusted according to the tissue structures and applications. To ensure stable performance of the cryostat, the temperature should be strictly controlled throughout the sectioning process.\nPause point: Mounted tissue section slides can be kept at −80°C for long-term storage without freeze-thaw cycles and exposure to light.\nCritical: During the cryostat process, the tissues should be kept frozen to minimize metabolic changes and the sections should be kept hydrated to facilitate BODIPY-C11 staining.\nPre-staining of tissue sections with BODIPY-C11\nTiming: 40 min\nEven distribution of the BODIPY-C11 dye on the cellular membranes of tissue sections is critical for the success of PALP. The confocal system should be tuned for imaging at this stage. For live-cell imaging, users can start their experiment from this step.",
    "Equilibrate the tissue section slide to room temperature (22 ± 2°C), then add 100 μL BODIPY 581/591 C11 working solution (1×) onto each slide and carefully cover the samples with coverslips.\nOptional: Use brush to gently apply nail polish onto the edge of the coverslip to fix the coverslip.\nOptional: For live-cell imaging, replace the culture medium supernatant with an appropriate amount of the BODIPY 581/591 C11 working solution (1×) prepared with culture medium.\nIncubate the tissue section or cells with BODIPY-C11 for 30 min.\nCritical: Keep the section at room temperature during the pre-staining process, and incubate live cells undergoing staining in a cell culture incubator set at 37°C with 5% CO2. Protect all samples from strong light exposure after BODIPY-C11 addition.\nPALPv1: inducing lipid peroxidation and assess ferroptosis sensitivity in live cells or in tissue\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to perform photochemical activation of membrane lipid peroxidation in tissues in situ or in live cells using a confocal microscope system (PALP version 1, PALPv1). PALPv1 using regular high-power lasers can presumably penetrate all membranes distributed along the z-axis of the analyzed sample.\nTransfer the BODIPY-C11 conjugated tissue slides to the microscope stage and adjust the focal plane.\nNote: The magnification of the objective lens is recommended at 60× to obtain high spatial resolution. This magnification can be adjusted based on the user's preferences.\nAdjust the intensity of 488 nm and 561 nm laser scanning sources and detector voltage to avoid overexposure. Capture fluorescent signals of 488 nm (FITC) and 561 nm (TRITC) channels when they are stable. (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5])\nCritical: Fluorescence from the reduced and oxidized BODIPY-C11 will be captured via the 488 nm (FITC) and 561 nm (TRITC) channels, respectively.\nSelect a small region of interest of around 2–4 μm2. (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3])",
    "Note: The stimulated region is set at this parameter to focus the energy from the laser to enable lipid peroxidation induction.\nUtilize the 405 nm high pulse laser from the confocal microscope light source to stimulate the selected region for 5 repeats of 200-ms interval.\nNote: The stimulation parameter is applicable to live cell and tissue samples using Nikon A1R confocal microscope and Nikon spinning disk confocal microscope.\nCritical: For other fluorescent microscope models, adjust the laser parameters accordingly to induce optimal lipid peroxidation signal. Lasers that are of too weak intensity will not induce lipid peroxidation, whereas too strong lasers can quench the fluorescent dye or kill the cells.\nImmediately acquire images from the 488 nm (FITC) and 561 nm (TRITC) channels. (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9])\nCritical: The fluorescence signal in the targeted area is usually the strongest immediately after photochemical activation of lipid peroxidation. For quantification purposes, we recommend capturing and quantifying the fluorescence signals with no delay after applying laser stimulations.\nPALPv2: inducing lipid peroxidation on a selected membrane along the z-axis in cells\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to induce lipid peroxidation on selected membranes along the cellular z-axis using two-photon excitation microscopes (PALP version 2, PALPv2).\nPlace the glass chamber containing BODIPY-C11 pre-stained cells on the microscope stage and adjust the focal plane.\nNote: For the Zeiss 880 multi-photon microscope, we recommend using 60× objective lens for live cell imaging; however, the users can adjust the magnification for different applications.\nAdjust the intensity of 488 nm and 561 nm laser scanning sources and detector voltage to avoid overexposure. Acquire the pre-laser stimulation fluorescent signals from the 488 nm (FITC) and 561 nm (TRITC) channels. (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5])\nSelect a defined region of interest around 2–4 μm2.",
    "Use multiple 800 nm low-energy photons to excite the same target molecule on the focal plane and induce lipid peroxidation. The laser power output and stimulation time for each microscope model should be adjusted to enable lipid peroxidation induction while avoiding quenching the BODIPY-C11 dye.\nFor image acquisition, immediately acquire fluorescent signals from the 488 nm (FITC) and 561 nm (TRITC) channels. We recommend acquiring the images at 0.4–0.6 μm intervals along the z-axis but this parameter can be adjusted. (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9])\nData analysis: quantify PALP signals on regions of interest\nTiming: 1 h\nAnalyze the fluorescent signal of the stimulated region using image processing softwares.\nImport the region of interest (ROI) to locate laser bleaching regions.\nAnalyze the gray intensity of pre-PALP 488 nm (Oxpre), pre-PALP 561 nm (Repre), and post-PALP 488 nm (Oxpost) channels.\nNote: Post-PALP 561 nm (Repost) channel signal is often lost or very weak due to oxidation of the BODIPY-C11 dye in an lipid hydroperoxide-rich environment after applying high-power lasers to focused regions, hence this signal is not used for normalizing PALP fluorescent signals.\nCritical: Images were acquired by Metamorph software for Andor confocal microscope, Nikon NIS Elements software for Nikon microscope, and ZEN blue edition for Zeiss microscope. Downstream image analysis can be performed using Fiji ImageJ.\nWe recommend using the following parameters to normalize and present the lipid peroxidation signals induced by laser stimulation across different samples:\nOxpost / Repre, i.e., the oxidized BODIPY-C11 intensity post-stimulation divided by the reduced BODIPY-C11 fluorescence pre-stimulation.\n(Oxpost - Oxpre) / Repre, i.e., the difference between the oxidized BODIPY-C11 intensity post-stimulation versus pre-stimulation, and this is divided by the reduced BODIPY-C11 fluorescence pre-stimulation.",
    "Note: To normalize the absorption and integration of BODIPY-C11 with samples, “a” method is recommended. To exclude the pre-PALP background signals of oxidative lipids, “b” method is adopted.\nCritical: We recommend sampling multiple regions of the same tissue to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of the ferroptosis sensitivity on the sample."
