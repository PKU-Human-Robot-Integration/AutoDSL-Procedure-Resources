    "Preparation of liposomesConduct all manipulations at room temperature unless otherwise stated. When using samples containing fluorescent-labeled lipids, protect them from direct light whenever possible throughout the procedure.For preparation of 2x concentrated liposomes consisting of DOPC/SM/cholesterol/Rhod PE in a molar ratio of 8:2:3:0.05, prepare a stock solution of each lipid in organic solvent and then mix an appropriate volume of each stock solution in a round-bottom glass tube to obtain the final amounts: 1.6 μmol DOPC, 0.4 μmol SM, 0.6 μmol cholesterol, and 10 nmol Rhod PE (Figure 1A). For liposomes of other compositions, alter the amounts of lipid put into the glass tube appropriately (Table 1).Table 1. Lipid compositions of 2x concentrated liposomes. Each liposome contains an equal amount of phospholipids. DOPC is used as the matrix phospholipid because phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant type of phospholipid in the plasma membrane. The molar ratio of DOPC/SM/cholesterol of liposome A (8/2/3) is the same as that of the liposomes used in the previous study on sphingomyelin-specific toxin lysenin (Ishitsuka and Kobayashi, 2007). Liposome A and A’ are identical in composition. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180813/20180813193014_2910.jpgadissolved in chloroform/methanol (19/1, v/v); bdissolved in chloroform; cadded at 1 ml per glass tube after evaporation.Evaporate organic solvent completely under nitrogen gas at a bath temperature of 35-40 °C using nitrogen evaporator set up in a fume hood. After at least 20 min of evaporation, lipid film is formed at the bottom of the glass tube (Figure 1B).Rehydrate the resultant lipid film with 1 ml of TBS-Ca (Figure 1C). To prepare liposomes without calcium ions, use TBS instead of TBS-Ca.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180813/20180813192644_7259.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of liposomes. A. Mixture of lipid solution before evaporation; B. Lipid film formed after evaporation; C. Lipid film rehydrated with TBS-Ca; D. Lipid suspension after sonication.",
    "Sonicate the mixture for 20-30 min with a probe-type sonicator with cooling in tap water (without ice). For UP50H ultrasonic processor, set an amplitude at 80% and a duty cycle at 50%.Note: The mixture looks turbid at the onset. After 30 min (for liposome A) or 20 min (for liposomes with other compositions) of sonication, the mixture becomes transparent. Vortex the tube every 10 min of sonication to restore liquid spattered on the inner wall of the tube. Transfer the lipid suspension to a 1.5-ml microfuge tube.Centrifuge the lipid suspension at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 25 °C with a micro refrigerated centrifuge to precipitate the lipid aggregates and debris from sonicator tip.Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microfuge tube and centrifuge again under the same conditions. Repeat centrifugation until no visible pellet is formed.Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microfuge tube and store the fraction as 2x concentrated liposome fraction at 4 °C. Protect from light and use within 3 days.Nycodenz density gradient centrifugationInteraction between RuV antigens and liposomes is assessed using Nycodenz density gradient fractionation. Schematic outline of this experiment is shown in Figure 2. Conduct all manipulations at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Warm all the reagents to room temperature before use. To omit calcium ions from each reaction, use TBS-based reagents instead of TBS-Ca-based ones.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180813/20180813192710_7695.jpgFigure 2. Schematic outline of Nycodenz density gradient fractionationMix the following components in a polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube:42 μl of Water 75 μl of 2x TBS-Ca3 μl of 100x protease inhibitor cocktail30 μl of RuV antigens(Total volume: 150 μl)Notes: RuV antigens must be added at last. Mix well by pipetting before and after the addition of RuV antigens.  RuV antigens contain bovine serum albumin added as an additive by the manufacturer. Its concentration is not disclosed.",
    "Add 150 μl of 2x concentrated liposome fraction prepared in Step A8 to the mixture, and mix well by pipetting.Incubate the mixture for 1 h, protecting from light.Mix the reaction mixture (300 μl) with 300 μl of 80% (w/v) Nycodenz/TBS-Ca by pipetting to obtain homogeneous solution. The resultant solution contains 40% (w/v) Nycodenz.Overlay the 40% (w/v) Nycodenz solution with 300 μl of 30% (w/v) Nycodenz/TBS-Ca, being careful not to mix them up.Overlay the 30% (w/v) Nycodenz solution with 300 μl of TBS-Ca, being careful not to mix them up.Weigh each tube and swinging bucket. Balance weight of two sets of tubes and buckets that will be placed diagonally in TLS-55 rotor in 0.01 g scale by adding TBS-Ca to a tube.Note: Although the weights of the buckets are initially matched by the manufacturer, the buckets need to be balanced in weight because they can become worn over time. Set each tube carefully into a swinging bucket.Hang the bucket into a TLS-55 rotor carefully, then set the rotor in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge.Centrifuge the samples at 55,000 rpm (259,000 x gmax) for 5 h at 25 °C.Remove each tube carefully from the buckets.Collect 50 μl aliquots from the top of the gradient using P-200 micropipette with a 1-200 μl tip. Always set the point of the pipette tip just below the aqueous surface (≤ 1 mm) and draw the solution slowly in a circular motion, being careful not to suction air. Combine two 50 μl aliquots in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube (i.e., ~100 μl/tube). Although 100 μl aliquots can be taken at once with a micropipette, the authors recommend 50 μl aliquots: A short pipetting stroke is easier to control, thereby lowering the risk of disturbing the gradient. Fractionate each sample into 12 fractions.",
    "When the volume of the last fraction is smaller than 100 μl, adjust the volume to ~100 μl with TBS-Ca.Note: Mark ~100 μl line on 1.5-ml tubes for the last fractions by using 100 μl of water in advance. Transfer 30 μl of each fraction into a 1.5-ml microfuge tube, then mix with 15 μl of 3x SDS sample buffer. Store at -30 °C until SDS-PAGE analysis. 15 μl of the resultant solution contains 10% (10 μl) of each collected fraction.Dilute 24 μl of RuV antigens with 56 μl of TBS-Ca, then mix with 40 μl of 3x SDS sample buffer. Store at -30 °C until SDS-PAGE analysis. 15 μl of the resultant solution contains 3 μl of RuV antigens, which corresponds to 10% of those input into each ultracentrifuge tube. Store the residual fractions (~70 μl/tube) at 4 °C until measurement of fluorescence.SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysisDistribution of RuV particles among the collected fractions is analyzed using standard SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis for RuV proteins. Conduct all manipulations at room temperature unless otherwise stated.See a basic protocol for SDS-PAGE (He, 2011). Prepare a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide separating gel using a gel casting device of a protein electrophoresis apparatus according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prepare a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel, similarly.Assemble the gel into an electrophoresis device and pour electrode buffer.Heat samples for SDS-PAGE analysis prepared in Steps B14 and B15 at 95 °C for 5 min using a block heater, then cool to room temperature. Spin at 15,000 x g for ~10 sec at 25 °C.Load 15 μl of the resultant samples per lane of the gel. Load 5 μl of prestained molecular markers similarly.Perform electrophoresis at 100-200 V constant according to the manufacturer’s instruction.",
    "After electrophoresis, place the gel into a clean container and shake it in transfer buffer for 10 min using reciprocal or seesaw shakers. Pre-wet a PVDF membrane with methanol and shake it similarly.Set up a sandwich of layers, including chromatography papers, the gel, and the membrane, soaking in transfer buffer.Place the sandwich in a chamber of a Western blot apparatus filled with transfer buffer.Transfer proteins from the gel to the membrane electrophoretically at 100 V constant for 30 min in a cold room at 4 °C according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Place the membrane in a clean container and soak in 5% (w/v) skim milk/TBS-T for 1 h with shaking.Wash the membranes three times for 5 min each in TBS-T.Place the membrane in a clean container and add the primary antibody (goat anti-RuV polyclonal antibody) diluted 1:4,000 with 2% (w/v) skim milk/TBS-T.Incubate the membrane at 4 °C overnight with shaking.Wash the membranes three times for 5 min each in TBS-T.Place the membrane in a clean container and add the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated mouse anti-goat/sheep IgG) diluted1:4,000 with 2% (w/v) skim milk/TBS-T.Incubate the membrane for 1 h with shaking.Wash the membranes three times for 10 min each in TBS-T.Develop signal by incubating the membrane with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate or an equivalent reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Detect the signal using a WSE-6200H LuminoGraph II image analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Measurement of fluorescenceDistribution of liposomes among the collected fractions is analyzed based on fluorescence intensity of Rho PE. Warm the collected fractions and 2x concentrated liposome fractions to room temperature before measurement.Transfer 50 μl of each collected fraction (which corresponds to 50% of each fraction) and 2x concentrated liposome fraction (which corresponds to 33% of total input) into a well of a 96-well black microplate.",
    "Measure fluorescence intensity of Rhod PE in each well using a FLUOstar Optima microplate reader at 544 nm excitation and 590 nm emission in endpoint mode without shaking function according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Save results in an excel file format."
