    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExtraction of pneumococcal CPS\nTiming: 1–2 day\nThe extraction procedure is adapted from the methods reported previously for S. pneumoniae that is sensitive to deoxycholate-triggered autolysis.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] For capsule purification from Gram-negative and non-autolytic Gram-positive bacteria, the capsule component can be detached by mild detergent, e.g., zwittergent 3–14, according to the method reported elsewhere.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] High-quality pneumococcal CPS with minimal nucleic acid and protein contaminants are generated at a yield about 10–40 mg per 1 L culture. The yield is highly dependent on the capsular serotypes of S. pneumoniae.\nCulture the S. pneumoniae in a 2.5 L flask containing 1 L THY medium at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: Two pneumococcal strains TH2912 (serotype 14) and TH2884 (serotype 8) are used in this protocol. The serotype 14 strain is rapidly captured by liver KCs though the recognition of its capsule, and serotype 8 strain is a negative control with marginal binding on KCs.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nMonitor the optical density at 620 nm (OD620) by a spectrophotometer and harvest the culture at OD620 nm 0.5–0.8.\nCritical: S. pneumoniae is prone to autolysis at the late stationary phase. Do not culture the S. pneumoniae over 12 h or to an OD620 nm > 0.8. Overgrown bacteria may result in lower CPS production.\nCollect the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 20 min at 20°C–25°C using Thermo Scientific centrifuge Sorvall RC6+.\nNote: Thermo Scientific centrifuge Sorvall RC6+ is used in following steps in this protocol for centrifugation at 10,000 g with large volume (i.e., more than 50 mL) of samples.\nResuspend cell pellet in 50 mL 2% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) and incubate at 37°C for 1 h to lyse the bacteria. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].",
    "Critical: Higher concentration (1%–2%) of the DOC is critical to induce complete lysis of S. pneumoniae. The suspension should be clear after the incubation. Lower concentrations (such as 0.1%–0.2%) may require longer incubation time.\nAdjust the pH of the suspension to 3.5 with acetate acid and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.\nNote: Acid precipitation removes most impurities, e.g., soluble proteins.\nRemove any precipitate and collect the supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.22 μm filter and ultracentrifuge the supernatant repeatedly using Eppendorf centrifuge 5810R at 3,220 g for 20 min at 4°C through the 100 kDa cutoff Ultra-centrifugal Filter Unit against 10-fold volume (at least 500 mL) 25 mM sodium acetate.\nCritical: In this step, low molecular weight cell wall polysaccharides (CWPS), ∼ 10 kDa, are removed by repetitive ultracentrifugation. The more times of ultracentrifugation and higher cutoff of the filter, the less residual CWPS are contained.\nAdd the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to a final concentration of 3%, then incubate at RT for 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Collect the pellet (anionic CPS) or supernatant (neutral CPS) according to the serotype of pneumococcal CPS.\nCritical: Negatively charged pneumococcal CPS (most serotypes except 7F, 14, and 33F) precipitate after CTAB treatment; the neutral serotype 7F, 14, and 33F CPS remain in the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 mL 1 M NaCl (for serotype 8 CPS) or add the NaCl into the supernatant (for serotype 14 CPS) to a final concentration of 1 M.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C to remove any precipitated contaminants.\nAdd ethanol to the supernatant to a final concentration of 80% (v/v) and store at 4°C for 2 h.",
    "Collect the precipitates by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 mL 6% sodium acetate and adjust pH to 6.8 by acetate acid.\nAdd ethanol to the supernatant to a final concentration of 33% and store at 4°C for 1 h.\nCollect the supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nAdd ethanol to the supernatant to a final concentration of 80% and store at 4°C for at least 2 h.\nCollect the CPS pellet by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nAir dry the pellet in a fume hood.\nDissolve the CPS in sterile H2O.\nCritical: Dissolved CPS can be stored at −20°C for at least 1 year. Alternatively, air dried CPS can be stored at −80°C for more than 5 years.\nPreparation of CPS-coated latex beads\nTiming: 1 day\nThe purified bacterial CPS can be fixed on biologically inert platform for subsequent screening of potential CPS-binding proteins. In this protocol, the pneumococcal CPS are modified by DMTMM and then covalently conjugated to latex microspheres with carboxyl functional groups.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Latex beads are conjugated with different types of CPS and used parallelly in affinity screening to identify serotype-specific CPS-binding proteins/receptors.\nDissolve 2.5 mg CPS in 2.5 mL distilled water in a 5 mL tube.\nAdd 200 μL of 200 mg/mL DMTMM and mix thoroughly.\nIncubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C on a Thermo Scientific Digital Waving Rotator (60 rpm).\nRemove free DMTMM by ultracentrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C through a 10 kDa cutoff unit against 3.5 mL PBS.\nAdjust the final volume with PBS to 2.5 mL.\nAdd 109 carboxyl microspheres (2 μm in diameter) and vortex briefly.\nIncubate on a rotator (60 rpm) overnight at RT.",
    "Wash the CPS-coated microspheres with 5 mL PBST and centrifuge at 10,000 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C to remove noncovalently bound CPS, and repeat once.\nResuspend the CPS-coated microspheres in 5 mL conjugation blocking buffer and store at 4°C.\nCritical: The conjugation blocking buffer contains 0.05% sodium azide to inhibit microbial growth. Sodium azide is a highly toxic chemical with acute dermal and oral toxicity. Avoid direct contact and store the microspheres in tightly sealed tubes.\nExtraction of KC membrane proteins\nTiming: 1 day\nThe liver NPCs are isolated through a perfusion-digestion method modified from previously reported procedure.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] Then, the KCs are enriched by flow cytometry-associated cell sorting with high purity (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Membrane proteins are extracted using commercial kit. Alternatively, membrane proteins can be extracted by traditional ultracentrifugation to separate membrane components and solubilization by detergents.\nEuthanize the mouse (female, 8-week-old, C57BL/6, 18–20 g) by cervical dislocation.\nOpen the abdominal cavity to expose the liver and intestine, and turn over the intestine to the right and push the large lobe of the liver to the diaphragm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2393-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation of mouse liver KCs\n(A) Exposure of the portal vein and inferior vena cava after surgical dissection.\n(B) Perfusion with digestion buffer by inserting into the portal vein and flowing out from the inferior vena cava.\n(C and D) Liver turns light brown post thorough perfusion. (E) Liver homogenate post thorough mincing.\n(F) FACS gating strategy and the purity of sorted KCs which are CD31-/CD45+/CD11b+/F4/80+/Tim-4+.\nSee also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nLoad 5 mL digestion buffer into a syringe with a 24 G needle.\nPerfuse the liver by injecting the needle into the portal vein and flowing out through the incision of the inferior vena cava (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Note: Perform the perfusion immediately after dissection to avoid intravascular blood coagulation in the liver. Complete perfusion can be achieved by clamping and opening the inferior vena cava with forceps for several times during perfusion. The liver will become light brown after complete perfusion (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D).\nExcise the liver lobes carefully into a 6 cm Petri dish and remove the gallbladder.\nMince the liver to small pieces (< 2 mm) with scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCritical: Thorough mincing is critical for maximal dissociation of the tissue.\nAdd 10 mL digestion buffer into the dish and put on a horizontal rotator (360 rpm, MIULAB Thermo-Shaker ST70-2) at 37°C for 30 min.\nNote: After complete digestion, the mixture can be easily pipetted by 1,000 μL tips.\nFilter the mixture through a 70 μm cell strainer into a 15 mL tube that precooled on ice.\nCritical: Macrophages such as KCs are strongly adherent and easily to attach on the plastic surface, thus the tubes should be kept on ice in following steps before proceeding to protein extraction.\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C and wash twice with ice-cold HBSS.\nLyse red blood cells with 1 mL RBC lysis buffer on ice for 1 min.\nAdd 10 mL HBSS to stop lysis, then centrifuge at 50 g for 1 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 50 g for 1 min at 4°C.\nNote: After the 50 g centrifugation, the pellet are mainly hepatocytes and most NPCs remain in the supernatant.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL FACS buffer (PBS + 3% FBS) and count the number of NPC using Countstar Automatic Cell Fluorescence Analyzer Mira FL as the manufacture’s instruction.\nNote: Generally, 1.0–1.5 × 107 NPCs are obtained from one mouse liver, in which KCs compose ∼20%.\nAdjust the cell density to 1 × 107 per 100 μL FACS buffer, and incubate with 1 μL of 0.5 mg/mL blocking antibody (anti-CD16/CD32) for 10 min at 4°C.\nWash with 1 mL FACS buffer and collect NPCs by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend NPCs with FACS buffer containing staining antibodies and incubate for 20 min at 4°C.\nWash with 1 mL FACS buffer and resuspend the NPCs in 1 mL FACS buffer.\nSort KCs through a 70 μm nozzle into a 15 mL tube preloaded with 1 mL ice-cold FACS buffer. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nNote: KCs are gated as CD31-CD45+CD11b+F4/80+Tim-4+ cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nCollect sorted KCs by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant and proceed to membrane protein extraction using Mem-PER Plus Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Thermo Scientific) as the manufacture’s instruction.\nCritical: Add the protease and phosphatase inhibitors in the solutions when extracting the membrane proteins.\nExchange the buffer by ultracentrifugation using Eppendorf centrifuge 5810R at 3,220 g for 20 min at 4°C through 3 kDa cutoff unit against PBST buffer.\nMeasure protein concentration by BCA assay.\nAliquot at 100 μg total proteins per tube and store at −80°C.\nCritical: Avoid repeated freezing-thawing of the protein stocks.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Isolation of murine liver Kupffer cells, related to steps 30–48\nScreening of CPS-binding candidates from KC proteins\nTiming: 3–5 days",
    "The CPS-binding proteins are captured on the CPS-coated beads after affinity reaction and subsequently dissociated by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Detached proteins are separated on SDS-PAGE gel and then subject to in-gel digestion and mass-spectrometry analysis. The MS identification can be conducted by professional researchers specialized on proteomics. Beads coated with different serotypes of the CPS are used to filtrate the type-specific CPS-binding proteins by comparative proteomics. Normally, the CPS isolated from high-virulence bacteria, e.g., serotype 8 S. pneumoniae in this STAR protocol, are used as negative control because these CPS are poorly recognized by any host receptor.\nUse 108 CPS-coated beads for each binding reaction.\nWash the beads three times with 1 mL PBST and resuspend in 500 μL binding buffer (PBST with 2 mM CaCl2/MgCl2).\nAdd 100 μg total KC membrane proteins and incubate for 1 h at RT with constant vertical rotation (60 rpm).\nCritical: The binding reaction is more efficient at RT for 1 h than at 4°C for 12 h.\nDiscard non-binding proteins by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nWash the beads for three times with 1 mL PBST.\nCritical: The CPS-protein complex may make the beads viscous. Do not touch the pellet when aspirating the supernatant, and leave small volume of the supernatant in each washing.\nResuspend the beads in 50 μL PBST containing 1× SDS-PAGE loading.\nBoil the mixture at 100°C for 5 min to dissociate CPS-binding proteins, then quickly chill on ice.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4°C, and carefully transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\nCritical: Do not aspirate up the beads and leave small residual supernatant in the tube.\nSeparate the dissociated proteins on SDS-PAGE gel (5% stacking gel and 12% resolving gel).",
    "Critical: Use MS-grade reagents for electrophoresis and wear gloves and mask to avoid any possible contamination.\nStain the gel with Coomassie brilliant blue for 1 h at RT with shaking.\nDestain the gel with ultra-pure water until the protein bands appear.\nExcise the protein bands at minimal size of the gel and put into 1.5 mL tubes.\nProceed to in-gel digestion and subsequent procedures for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.\nSearch the spectra from each LC-MS/MS run against the mouse Unreviewed TrEMBL with “Transmembrane” filtered FASTA database using Proteome Discovery algorithm.\nAnalyze the relative abundance of proteins with ≥ 2 unique peptide matches.\nCompare the protein abundance enriched by indicated type of CPS to the negative control which is naturally resistant to recognition by host proteins.\nNote: The resultant list of enriched CPS-binding proteins may vary up to over hundreds candidates which depends on the criteria, e.g., enrichment fold. The criteria can be adjusted according to the researchers’ requirements.\nOverexpression of CPS-binding receptor candidates in CHO cells\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThe top hits of the CPS-binding proteins candidates are overexpressed in nonphagocytic cell lines, e.g., CHO cells. The cell line should be tightly adherent and have marginal or no binding activity to the encapsulated bacteria.\nClone the candidate CPS receptor genes in expression plasmids using E. coli system.\nExtract the total RNA from sorted mouse KCs using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture’s instruction.\nSynthesize the full-length cDNA library using a Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific).\nAmplify the target genes by PCR with specific primers.

    "Extract the backbone plasmids (e.g., pCDH, pFUGW, or other plasmids) from the harboring E. coli DH5α strains using HiPure Plasmid Micro Kit (Magen).\nDigest the PCR products and the backbone plasmids with restrict enzymes.\nPurify the digested DNA using HiPure Gel Pure Micro Kit.\nLigate the digested products by T4 DNA ligase (NEB) at 16°C overnight.\nTransform the ligation into E. coli DH5α and select the transformants on LB plates with indicated antibiotics, e.g., 100 μg/mL ampicillin for pCDH and pFUGW.\nVerify the recombinant plasmids by DNA sequencing.\nExtract the recombinant plasmids and lentiviral packaging vectors pMD2.G and psPAX2 using HiPure Plasmid EF Micro Kit (Magen).\nPrepare lentiviruses carrying target genes in HEK293T cells.\nSeed 293T cells in a 6 cm dish and grow to 80%–90% confluence.\nPrepare the following lentiviral target mixture. For a 6 cm dish: Component A\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2393_10.csv\nComponent B\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2393_11.csv\nIncubate each component for 5 min at RT.\nAdd the component A to the component B, invert several times, and incubate for 10 min at RT.\nAdd the mixture dropwise to the 293T cells and place in a cell incubator for 4 h.\nReplace the medium with 5 mL of prewarmed complete DMEM medium and incubate for 2 days.\nPool the lentivirus supernatant and filter through a 0.45 μm filter to remove cellular debris.\nAliquot and store at −80°C before use.\nOptimize the antibiotic selection concentration for CHO cells.\nSeed CHO cells in 96 well plate and grow to 50% confluence.\nReplace the medium with fresh F-12K containing a series of concentrations of corresponding antibiotics, e.g., 0–10 μg/mL puromycin for pCDH and 0–500 μg/mL zeocin for pFUGW.\nReplace the medium with the same fresh medium at day 3.\nCompare the cell viability at day 7, and choose the minimal concentration for complete killing of the cells.",
    "Note: In this protocol, 5 μg/mL puromycin and 300 μg/mL zeocin are selected for CHO cells.\nConstruct stably transfected CHO cells overexpressing target genes.\nSeed CHO cells in 6 cm dish and grow to 50% confluence.\nReplace with 3 mL fresh medium.\nAdd 0.5 mL lentivirus stock and 8 μg/mL polybrene, then mix the medium with gently shaking.\nNote: Set up a non-transfection control and a blank plasmid control.\nIncubate the cells for 24 h, normally to 80%–100% confluence.\nSubculture the cells in fresh medium containing selective antibiotics.\nIncubate for 3–5 days until the non-transfection control CHO cells die completely.\nHarvest the CHO transfectants and make stock vials.\nVerify the successful overexpression by western blot using anti-His6 tag antibody. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nFunctional validation by in vitro bacterial binding assay\nTiming: 3–5 days\nThe CHO transfectants are subjected to an in vitro bacterial binding assay to evaluate the gain-of-function phenotype. The specific CPS receptors result in a significant bacterial adherence to the CHO transfectants compared to marginal bacterial binding to the native CHO cells. The specific bacterial binding is inhibited in the presence of the corresponding type of CPS.\nGrow the CHO transfectant cell lines in complete F-12K medium containing selection antibiotics in 6 cm dish to 90% confluence.\nDigest with 1 mL 0.25% trypsin for 1 min at 37°C.\nAdd 4 mL complete F-12K medium to stop digestion and collect cells by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min.\nResuspend in 1 mL fresh complete F-12K medium and count the cell number.\nAdjust the cell density at 2 × 105 cells per 1 mL medium.\nSeed the cells in 48 well plate at 105 cells per well, i.e., 500 μL suspension.\nIncubate for 12 h or overnight in a cell incubator.",
    "Note: The cell density should be at 90%–100% confluence that equals 1.5 × 105 cells per well. Do not overgrow the cells.\nPrepare the S. pneumoniae strains in basic F-12K medium at a bacterial density at 7.5 × 105 CFU/mL.\nWash the CHO cells twice with fresh basic F-12K medium.\nAdd 200 μL bacterial suspension into the well at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:1.\nNote: Normally, each well contains 1.5 × 105 CHO cells in 48 well plate at 90%–100% confluence, and equal numbers (MOI 1:1) of bacteria are added into each well, e.g., 200 μL bacterial suspension at a density of 7.5 × 105 CFU/mL.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 5 min to maximize the contact between bacteria and CHO cells.\nCritical: A low speed centrifugation enables synchronization of CHO cells and the planktonic bacteria. This step is critical for the ligand-receptor mediated binding but doesn’t impact the non-specific adhesion.\nIncubate the mixture for 30 min in a cell incubator.\nVigorously shake the cell plate 10 times to reduce non-specific adhesion.\nTransfer the supernatant in a 1.5 mL tube and keep on ice.\nGently wash the cells with 200 μL basic F-12K medium and collect the supernatant in the above 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 500 μL ice-cold sterile H2O into each well and pipette several times to lyse the cells.\nCollect the lysate into a 1.5 mL tube and keep on ice.\nCount the bacterial numbers in the supernatant and the lysate fractions by gradient dilution and titration on TSA plate with 3% sheep blood or suitable agar plates for other bacteria.\nCalculate the bacterial binding ratio by dividing the cell-associated CFU by the total CFU in each well.\nCompare the bacterial binding level to the native CHO and CHO transfectants with empty plasmids.",
    "Note: A specific CPS-binding proteins, i.e., the CPS receptors, significantly promote the adhesion of bacteria harboring the corresponding type of capsule used in affinity screening. The gain-of-function can be blocked in the presence of the same type of free CPS in a dose-dependent manner, which is not affected by heterologous types of CPS."
