    "Animal Care\nThe Xenopus laevis tadpoles used in this study were grown, raised and treated according to procedures approved by Upstate Medical University IACUC and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Pre-behavior Setup: Tadpoles\nObtain fertilized Xenopus embryos from a commercially available source or in vitro fertilize oocytes, as previously described6.\nPlace blastula to neural plate stage embryos at 18 ˚C in 60 mm Petri dishes containing 0.1X MMR [10 X Marc's Modified Ringer's (MMR) solution stock (10 mM MgCl2; 20 mM KCl; 20 mM CaCl2 ; 50 mM HEPES; 1 M NaCl; adjusted to pH 7.5, autoclaved and stored at RT)] with 50 µg/ml gentamicin antibiotic. Change 0.1X MMR each day and remove any dead embryos.\nOnce the embryos reach Nieuwkoop and Faber stage ~27 - 307, switch the embryos into 0.1X MMR without antibiotic to allow gut bacterial growth.\nGrow the tadpoles until they reach the feeding stage (stage 45) and move them into 100 mm Petri dishes filled with 0.1X MMR. Feed them nettle powder supernatant every other day for a week, changing the 0.1X MMR on the intervening day.\nAfter one week in the 100 mm Petri dish, move animals to half gallon tanks filled with frog water [0.5 g/L instant ocean and 2 mM Sodium phosphate dibasic (Na2HPO4: mw 141.96) pH 6.8]. Feed them as in step 2.4, but change water only 2-3 times per week when water is cloudy. Maintain the animals in a 12 hr light/12 dark light cycle with the lights turning on at 6 am.\nPlace the half-gallon tank with the test subjects on a white surface like a lab bench underpad, at least 12 hr O/N, prior to testing.\nTest tadpoles at stages 45 to 50 as described in step 3 below.",
    "2. Pre-behavior Setup: Equipment\nSet aside an area of the lab for the behavior assay. It should be in a quiet, low-traffic area with standard fluorescent lighting.\nPrepare the testing tanks for the animals.\n\tThe nested, half-gallon testing tanks are composed of two parts: an inner tank that will hold the water and tadpoles; and an outer tank with the visual stimulus.\n\t\nFor the inner tank, make a small mark on the outside corners with a sharpie, 5 cm from the bottom; this is the water line (Figure 1A, green dotted line).\nAlso, for the inner tank, fill the divets in the tank (at the corners and the center) with an inert compound, like Sylgard elastomer. NOTE: The tadpoles will linger in these areas if they are not filled in.\nFor the outer tank, cover exactly one half of the outside of one tank with black electrical tape and the other half with the white tissue paper Figure 1B.\nPlace the tanks on the inoculating turntable.\nSetup the webcam/tripod so that it is above the testing tanks. Adjust the camera to allow visualization of the testing area, as shown in Figure 1C.\nConnect the webcam to a computer with QuickTime Player software installed5. Turn on the camera. In QuickTime Player, under File, select ‘New Movie Recording.’ The behavior assay setup will be visible on the computer right away.\nDrape a lightweight cotton cloth over the entire setup to reduce external cues that could affect tadpole behavior, as well as, reduce reflected light on the surface of the water.\nEnsure that the luminance under the cloth measures between 35-50 cd/m2.\n3. Behavior Assay\nFill the inner testing tank to the 5 cm water mark made in step 1.2.1 with frog water.",
    "Using a small net, gently move the animal into the inner testing tank.\nOpen QuickTime software on computer and, using the outer tank as a guide, make sure that the camera is able to visualize and record the testing area.\nWrite the animal name, date and time on a piece of paper and record with the camera.\nPlace the test tank into the outer tank with the black side of the tank to the right Figure 2.\nStart recording the movie immediately after arranging the tank and set timer for 2 min.\nWhen the timer beeps, remove the inner test tank, rotate the outer tank 180° and place the inner test tank inside the outer tank. Start the timer. Note: the black side should now be on the other side.\nRepeat step 3.7, eight more times for a total of ten trials. Use Figure 2 as a guide, checking off each trial.\nRepeat the behavior assay on two separate days.\n4. Retinal Axotomy\nPlace animal in 0.02% tricaine until they are unresponsive to a tail pinch with a #3 forceps.\nMelt 1% agarose in 0.1X MMR and then add to a 60 mm Petri dish. Once cooled, make a small rectangular divot in the agarose and add the tadpole to the divot with a little 0.02% tricaine, so that the animal is partially submerged in the liquid.\nPierce the skin at a 45 degree angle behind the dorsal region of the eye with a 25 G needle, while bracing the animal against forceps on the opposite side.",
    "Taking care not to snip the vein, which lies next to the optic nerve, carefully reach into the hole with #5 forceps, snip the optic nerve and flip it out of the way. If there is severe bleeding due to accidently snipping the artery, then quickly place the animal in 2% tricaine to euthanize. CAUTION: 2% tricaine solution can cause numbness in humans. This solution should be handled with gloves.\nTo recover the animal after surgery, place animal in 100 mm Petri dish with 0.7X MMR and 50 µg/ml gentamicin for 20 min. Next, transfer tadpole to recovery tank with frog water. Let animal rest O/N.\nThe next morning, test the visual function as described above (steps 3.1-3.9).\n5. Analyze Results\nAfter the trials are finished, measure the amount of time the tadpole stays on the black side of the tank.\n\t\nManually view the videos using software that displays the time and allows frequent pausing. Look at the video display time. Write down the start of the two-min trial, which is when the inner tank successfully nests inside the outer tank and is squared in view of the camera.\nUse the position of the tadpole’s eyes to define which side of the tank the animals are swimming on. Define crossing over from one side of the tank to the other only when both eyes have crossed the black/white line.\nWrite down the beginning and end of each interval (in sec) that the animal spends on the black side. Pause and rewind the video to ensure accuracy. Total the sec within each trial.",
    "Input these numbers into the attached Behavior Worksheet. The worksheet will calculate the ratio of time that the animal spent on the white side by subtracting the time spent on the black side of the tank from the total 120 sec trial and divide by the total time in sec [(120 – total seconds spent on the black side)/120 sec]. The worksheet averages this ratio over all 10 trials.\nUse a student’s T-test, paired, two-tailed distribution to determine if the trials between days are significant (P ≤ 0.05).\nSubscription Required.
