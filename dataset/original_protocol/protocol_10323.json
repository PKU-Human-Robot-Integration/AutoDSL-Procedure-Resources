NOCSAE DOC.011-13m14d: \" MANUFACTURERS PROCEDURAL GUIDE FOR PRODUCT SAMPLE SELECTION FOR TESTING TO NOCSAE STANDARDS\"24. NOCSAE DOC.087-12m14: \" STANDARD METHOD OF IMPACT TEST AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT FOR FOOTBALL FACEGUARDS\"25. NOCSAE DOC.100-96m14: \"TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE FOR TEST EQUIPMENT AND IMPACT TESTING\"26. NOCSAE DOC.101-00m14a: \"EQUIPMENT CALIBRATION PROCEDURES\"27\n1. Test Setup\nConstruct NOCSAE twin-wire drop carriage assembly as defined in Section 15.1 of NOCSAE DOC. 001,18 as depicted in Figure 5. Verify that all components of the assembly are securely attached.\nAttach the size \"large\" NOCSAE headform to the drop carriage assembly by aligning the headform collar with the desired position on the headform rotator adjuster and by tightening the headform threaded lock ring.\n\tNote: If the headform is new or repaired, refer to Section 5 of NOCSAE DOC. 100.26\nSecurely attach the triaxial accelerometer to the accelerometer plate located at the center of gravity of the headform. Place the accelerometer in the center of the accelerometer plate lining up both holes in the accelerometer with the holes in the accelerometer plate. Using an Allen head screwdriver insert both screws and tighten them in a clockwise direction until the accelerometer is securely mounted to the accelerometer plate.\nConfigure the data acquisition system according to manufacturer's specifications.28\nConnect the cables for the data acquisition assembly.\n\t\t\nConnect accelerometer cable to the three-way coaxial splitter, then connect a coaxial cable to each output of the coaxial splitter.\nConnect the free end of each coaxial cable from the three-way coaxial splitter to a sensor input port for channels 1, 2, and 3 located on the rear of the amplifier module.",
    "Connect a coaxial cables from the output ports of the amplifier module (channels 1, 2, and 3) to input connections on the front of the data acquisition system (channels 1, 2, and 3, respectively).\nConnect the split end of the RS-232 cable to the rear connector of the data acquisition system.\nConnect the remaining RS-232 cable to Com Port 1 of the Personal Computer (PC).\nPower on the Personal Computer (PC) and login.\nDownload and install the data acquisition system software onto the computer.\nPower on the data acquisition assembly: Plug in each components 120 volt outlet into a power source, then flip the amplifier toggle switch to the \"on\" position.\nDouble-click the data acquisition program icon located on the desktop to open the software.\nObserve a prompt asking to check module status, click \"yes\".\nLoad the Test Setup File. Click the \"Setup\" tab, scroll down to \"Open\" and then select \"Test Setup\".\n\t\t\nBrowse the computer directory, locate and select the test setup file labeled \"NOCSAE1.TSF\". Click \"Load\".\nEnter sensor information for the accelerometers.\n\t\t\nClick the yellow Sensor Input icon for channel 3 in the active Module.\nInsert the calibration value (mV/G) for the z-axis accelerometer into the \"CAL Value\" text box.\nClick the \"PREV\" button.\nRepeat Steps 1.4.8.1 - 1.4.8.3 for the y-axis accelerometer (channel 2) and for the x-axis accelerometer (channel 1).\nClick the green \"Return\" icon to exit sensor.\nClick the green \"Save\" icon and then name the Test Setup as \"NOCSAE-JoVE\".\nClick \"save\".\n2. Helmet Preparation\nSelect the helmet model for impact testing. For helmet certification, select samples for testing according to NOCSAE DOC.011.24 Test the sample according to Table 1 and as depicted in Figures 1 and 2.",
    "Select corresponding faceguards for each selected helmet model. Differing from the NOCSAE standard, conduct base helmet impact tests with the baseline faceguard for such helmet.\nUsing a Philips head screwdriver, securely attach the correct faceguard and all faceguard specific hardware to each helmet selected for testing. In contrast to the NOCSAE standard test method, test all helmets with faceguards attached.\nCondition helmets in the temperatures according to Table 1, NOCSAE DOC. 0027, and NOCSAE DOC.08725 by exposing them to a laboratory environment or environmental chamber. Conduct initial helmet drop tests at ambient temperature.\nMove selected helmets to a laboratory environment, 72 °F, ± 5 °F (22 °C, ± 2 °C), at least 4 hr prior to testing.\nIf all ambient temperature impacts have been conducted, expose the helmet to the conditioned temperature, according to Table 1, for 4 but no longer than 24 hr.7\n\t\tNote: At least two but no more than four impact locations that result in the highest recorded SI values for ambient temperature drops will be tested at high temperature.\n3. Calibration\nPerform Headform Calibration: Each headform must be calibrated prior to testing using the triaxial accelerometer, 3\" calibration MEP pad and drop locations/velocities as identified by the annual NOCSAE Calibration Pad Qualification Report for that specific calibration MEP pad.\nSecurely attach 3\" Calibration MEP pad to the anvil using an Allen wrench.\nUsing the annual NOCSAE Calibration Pad Qualification Report, select an impact location and the corresponding impact velocity.\nUsing the headform rotator assembly and anvil guide rail, adjust headform and anvil to the desired impact orientation (front, side, or top). Refer to Table 1, Appendix 2 of NOCSAE DOC. 001,18 and NOCSAE DOC. 100.26",
    "Remove the taper-loc bolt from the headform rotator assembly and orient the headform adjuster to align bolt-holes to the desired position. Insert and securely fasten the taper-loc bolt.\nLoosen the headform threaded lock ring and rotate the headform nose position to the required orientation. Securely tighten the headform threaded lock ring.\nLoosen the two base plate-anvil bolts and slide anvil until desired impact location is achieved. Tighten base plate- anvil bolts and ensure all connections are securely fastened.\nAttach release system to drop carriage assembly. Lift the drop carriage assembly to the height of the release system. Center the release system to its attachment point on the drop carriage assembly then flip the toggle switch for the electromagnetic release system to the \"On\" position.\nRaise drop carriage assembly to the specific height determined to achieve the desired impact velocity. Note: Specific heights may vary for each system due to frictional variations. Additional impacts may need to be conducted varying height to ensure the correct inbound velocity is achieved.\nReady the data acquisition system for recording an event (according to manufactures specifications28).\n\t\t\nLoad the Test Setup File. Click the \"Test\" tab, and then click \"Collect Data\".\nBrowse the computer directory, locate and select the test setup file labeled \"NOCSAE-JoVE.TSF\". Click \"Load\".\nClick \"OK\".\nType a test description \"Description\" dialog box and then press the \"Tab\" key.\nProvide a 5 character test ID, Type \"JoVE1\" and click \"Continue\".\nClick \"Continue\".\nObserve the instrumentation warming up. Once the counter has reached 15 s, click \"Continue\" .\nObserve the system automatically performing accelerometer calibration. Once all boxes are colored green, click \"continue\".\nUsing the release system, drop the carriage assembly and trigger the data acquisition system to record the event by simultaneously flipping both toggle switches located on the release system power control box.",
    "Calculate and record the resulting SI value. Ensure the result is 1,200 SI ±2%.\nRepeat steps 3.4.2-3.4.8 until results are obtained for each of the three required impact locations.\n\t\tNote: Calibration pads should be requalified annually at the laboratory specified by NOCSAE.\nPerform a system check and maintain results. (see Section 18, NOCSAE DOC.00118)\n4. Testing Procedure \nPerform a system check and maintain results.\nExchange the MEP pad used for calibration for the MEP test pad.\nSelect impact location and velocity for testing according to Table 1.\n\tNote: Impacts must be conducted from lowest drop velocity to the highest. Ambient temperature impacts should be conducted before conditioned impacts.\nProperly adjust the headform orientation and anvil position to achieve the desired impact location, as depicted in Figures 1 and 2 and according to the steps in section 3.\nSelect helmet for testing.\nProperly fit the selected helmet to the headform according to the helmet manufacturers fitting instructions and NOCSAE procedures. Adjust and securely attach the helmets chinstrap to the headform.\n\tNote: Due to the additional constraints of the faceguard, a light application of talcum powder may aid in fitting of the helmet to the headform.\nAttach mechanical release system to drop carriage assembly.\nRaise drop carriage assembly to the specific height determined to achieve the desired impact velocity.\nReady the data acquisition system for recording an event. Repeat steps 3.4.1 through 3.4.8.\nUsing the mechanical release system drop the carriage assembly and simultaneously trigger the data acquisition system to record the event.\nImmediately after impact, record SI, HIC, and peak acceleration results.\nCompare the recorded results to pass/fail criteria. Differing from the NOCSAE Standard, set a pass/fail value of 700 SI for all 5.46, 4.88, and 4.23 m/sec impacts. Maintain the pass/fail criterion of 300 SI for all 3.46 m/sec impacts.",
    "Repeat steps 4.3-4.11 until results are obtained for all required impacts.\n\tNote: It is acceptable to test all helmets for a given impact location before changing headform orientation and anvil position.\nPerform a system check upon completion of testing and maintain results.\nData validation: Compare pre-test and post-test system checks and ensure that any variation is 7% or less.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53929/53929table1.jpg\nTable 1: Football helmet drop test matrix showing required impacts by drop velocity (m/sec) and impact location.
