Composition of intracellular (intra.) and extracellular (extra.) buffers for chloride selectivity experiments in HEK cells. Abbreviations used: ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and aspartate (ASP). All concentrations are in mM.\nPrepare the recording solutions with ion concentrations as indicated in Table 1.\nPrepare 15 mL of 2 M stock solutions in ultrapure water for MgCl2, CaCl2, KCl and CsCl.\nWeigh the solid components for 100 mL of the intracellular and 500 mL of the extracellular buffered solutions according to table 1 into separate beakers and add the respective amount of the prepared stock solutions afterwards. For example, for the intracellular buffer, use 0.3803 g (10 mM) EGTA, 0.2383 g (10 mM) HEPES and 0.6428 g (110 mM) NaCl and add 100 µL of the 2 M MgCl2 and CaCl2 and 50 µL of the 2 M KCl and CsCl stock solutions.",
    "Add ultrapure water and carefully adjust pH using acids and bases, which do not interfere with the measurement, i.e. are not conducted by the ChR, such as citric acid and N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMG+).\nAdjust the osmolarity to 290 mOsm for the intracellular and to 320 mOsm for the extracellular solutions with glucose.\n\t\tNote: Slightly hypoosmotic intracellular solutions increase success rate of patching26.\nSterile filter all solutions through 0.22-µm filters. Store solutions at 4 °C for two weeks or freeze at -20 °C for long term storage.\nCalculate liquid junction potentials and prepare recording protocols.\n\tNOTE: Change of extracellular chloride concentration after establishing whole-cell configuration causes a significant liquid junction potential (LJP) that has to be corrected27,28. LJPs can be directly measured or calculated, here the latter option is used. In this protocol, on-line correction will be used demanding one recording protocol for each external buffer. However, for a bigger set of external solutions a post correction of LJP is recommended to avoid false correction.\n\t\nOpen the junction potential calculator (JPC)27 and open the 'New Experiment' dialogue. Then select \"Patch-clamp measurements\". Select \"whole-cell measurements\", \"Standard salt-solution electrode\" and enter a temperature of 25 °C. Between each step, go forward by accepting the selection by pressing the \"next\" button.\n\t\tNOTE: Experiments are performed at a room temperature of 25 °C in an air-conditioned laboratory. Ensure that buffer solutions have room temperature before starting experiments. To vary the sample temperature an incubation stage or chamber can be used. Bath temperature can be frequently measured with a thermometer.\nAdd all individual anion and cation concentrations of the pipetted solution and the high chloride buffer according to the concentrations listed in Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: The JPC will calculate a LJP of -0.5 mV for the starting conditions.",
    "Click \"New Bath Solution\" to enter the anionic and cationic composition of the low chloride buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: The JPC will now calculate a new LJP of +12.6 mV according to the changed extracellular recording solution.\nPrepare two LJP-corrected protocols for the two measuring conditions by subtracting the calculated LJP from the applied holding potential; -0.5 mV for the high and +12.6 mV for the low chloride external solutions. Thus the protocols start with -79.5 mV (high chloride) and -92.6 mV (low chloride), respectively to obtain an LJP-corrected starting holding potential of -80 mV in both cases.\n\t\tNOTE: The following steps apply to the data acquisition software mentioned in the material list.\nOpen the protocol editor in the acquisition software. Switch to the \"Mode\" menu select \"Episodic stimulation\" and include 7 sweeps.\nSwitch to the \"Waveform\" menu in the editor and include a 200 ms period with 0 mV holding potential followed by a 2 s period with varying holding potential starting at -79.5 mV for high chloride. Include a \"Delta level\" of 20 mV for the second period to increase the holding potential by 20 mV in each sweep.\nWithin the voltage steps of the waveform editor apply a 500 ms period of illumination with 540 nm light (3.10 mW/mm²). To do so, change the \"digital bit pattern\" of the connected shutter that controls the light source to be active 500 ms after the second period described above (see 1.2.6).",
    "NOTE: The light intensity can influence biophysical properties of channel currents like amplitude or inactivation. Therefore, light power densities should always be reported. To measure the light power after passing through all optics and the coverslip, use a calibrated optometer. To calculate the power density, determine the illuminated field of the objective by an object micrometer and divide the measured light power by the determined illuminated field.\nSave the protocol for the high chloride extracellular solution. Modify the protocol and replace the first level holding potential by -92.6 mV (low external chloride). Save this second protocol to measure the low chloride extracellular condition.\nLysine-coating of glass cover slips as per adapted protocol29.\nPlace several 100 cover slips in a glass petri dish and add 250 mL HCl (1 N).\nPlace the petri dish with the cover slips on a linear shaker and shake at 120 rpm for 72 h to clean the cover slips and afterwards rinse with ultrapure water to neutralize pH.\nSoak these in a small volume of 95% ethanol for further cleaning.\n\t\tNOTE: Clean cover slips can be stored in 70% ethanol before proceeding. Work under laminar flow hood for the following steps.\nUsing a Bunsen burner and tweezers, flame each cover slip and transfer it into a new petri dish.\nIncubate the glass cover slips with a sterile 50 µg/mL poly-D-lysine solution for at least 1 h (or overnight) at room temperature while shaking with a linear shaker at 150 rpm.\nWash the cover slips with ultrapure water to remove excess poly-D-lysine.\nSpread the cover slips on sterile paper to dry for 10 min, and expose them to UV light for sterilization (at least 20 min).\nCollect the cover slips into a sterile petri dish covered in aluminum foil until use.",
    "Prepare DNA of the PsACR1 gene fused to mCherry using standard molecular biology techniques.\nClone the human codon-optimized gene sequence encoding PsACR1 into a peGFP-C1 plasmid (CMV promotor, kanamycin resistance) in frame with the mCherry fluorophore using restriction enzymes or other established cloning methods.\n\t\tNote: Other fluorophores can be used as well, but make sure to have the corresponding filter-sets available to observe their fluorescence under the microscope in the setup.\nTransform the plasmid DNA into chemocompetent XL1Blue E. coli cells via heat shock as per standard protocol and plate them on agar plates (30 µg/mL kanamycin)30. Grow the plated bacteria over night at 37 °C.\nThe next day, inoculate 4 mL lysogeny broth medium supplemented with 30 µg/mL kanamycin with cells from single colonies and incubate them over night at 37 °C and 180 rpm in an incubator.\nAfter overnight incubation, purify the plasmid DNA from the cultures using a commercially available kit (see Materials Table) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.\nSeed the cells\n\tNOTE: Perform steps under a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nPlace up to three lysine-coated glass cover slips side by side in a 35-mm petri dish.\n\t\tNOTE: Gently press them against the bottom of the dish to prevent slipping onto each other.\nSeed 1.5 x 105 HEK cells in 2 mL standard Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) in each dish.\nSupplement all-trans retinal at a final concentration of 1 µM. Grow the cells for at least one day before proceeding with step 1.6.\nTransiently transfect the cells via lipofection31.\nFor each dish of cells, prepare a solution of 2 µg of plasmid DNA (as prepared in step 1.4) in 250 µL DMEM without FBS and 6 µL transfection reagent (see Materials Table).",
    "After 15 min of incubation, gently (dropwise) add the solution to the cells.\nPrepare agar bridges\nAdd 0.75 g agarose to 50 mL sterile sodium chloride solution (140 mM) and dissolve it by heating in a microwave.\n\t\tNOTE: 2 - 3 M KCl for agar bridge preparation further reduces LJP due to higher concentration (e.g. constant diffusion from the bridge) and equal mobility of K+ and Cl- ions, but was avoided to minimize ion-(especially Cl-) leakage into the bath solution32.\nFill 10 µL pipette tips (or a small diameter hose) with the liquid agarose solution using a syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid air bubbles in the bridge.\nAfter the agar bridges have been cooled and solidified, store them in sterile 140 mM sodium chloride solution.\nPrepare recording and bath electrodes.\nRemove silver wires of the bath and recording electrode of the patch-clamp setup.\nPolish the wires with sandpaper to remove silver chloride from previous experiments. Immerse the clean silver wire in 3 M KCl and connect it to the positive pole of a 1.5 V battery for electrolytic coating with silver chloride.\n\t\tNOTE: A lab power supply can be used instead of a battery.\nPull low resistance patch pipettes (1.5-3.0 MΩ) from glass capillaries with a micropipette puller and fire polish them as described by Brown et al33. Store pipettes dust-free for the day of measurement.\nTurn on all setup components to heat up to working temperature 30 min prior recordings. Ensure that buffers are at room temperature.\n2. Selectivity Measurements\nStart the recordings 24 to 48 h after transient transfection of the cells described in 1.6.",
    "Place one cover slip in the measuring chamber and seal it with silicon to prevent leakage of the external buffer. Store the petri dish with the other cover slips in an incubator for the next set of experiments.\nCarefully fill the chamber with extracellular buffer (high [Cl-]) to prevent detaching of cells, then place it under the microscope and use the 40X objective for cell visualization.\nPut an agar bridge over the bath electrode and place it into the chamber together with the fluid level sensor and the perfusion outlet of the bath handler.\nExchange the extracellular solution twice with 1 mL of fresh external solution (high [Cl-]) to remove residual culture medium and detached cells.\nBring the cells into focus and search for a transfected (fluorescent) cell, which needs to be isolated from other cells. Use a triple-band filter-set and orange light (590 nm; bandwidth 15 nm; 100% intensity) to excite and visualize mCherry.\n\tNOTE: HEK cells can be electrically coupled to their neighbors by gap junctions34 resulting in low membrane resistance in the whole-cell configuration.\nFill one of the pulled pipettes with intracellular solution and remove air bubbles by flipping the pipette several times.\nMount the pipette on the pipette holder and apply some positive pressure to prevent clogging of the tip.\nLocate the tip of the patch pipette under the microscope and navigate it close to the cell using the micromanipulator.\n\tNOTE: The following steps apply to the amplifier, data acquisition and evaluation software mentioned in the material list.\nStart the \"membrane test\" in the data acquisition software and apply a voltage step (test pulse; e.g. 5 mV for 10 ms, baseline at 0 mV), manually or automatically via specified software using \"bath mode\" while running \"membrane test\" in the data acquisition software.",
    "Check that the pipette resistance is in the desired range (1.5-3.0 MΩ).\nZero offset currents by adjusting the pipette potential by turning the pipette offset knob at the amplifier while working in \"bath mode\" of the \"membrane test\".\nEstablish a patch in the whole-cell configuration26.\n\tNOTE: The following steps require application of positive and negative pressure delivered to the side port of the used pipette holder. This can be done by using either a syringe, via a mouth piece or an electronically controlled pressure regulator. In this protocol positive and negative pressure is applied via a mouth piece.\n\t\nSlowly approach the cell with the patch pipette from the top and relieve the positive pressure right before touching it.\n\t\tNOTE: When the tip is close to the cell, the resistance will rise slightly; this is indicated by a reduced size of the test pulse.\nChange the \"membrane test\" from \"bath mode\" to \"patch mode\" thus the holding potential to the cells' expected resting potential (-30 to -40 mV).\nIn some cases the cell-attached configuration forms itself after release of the positive pressure (2.13.1), if not, gently apply negative pressure to assist gigaseal formation.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell-attached configuration is established when the test pulse is reduced to two small capacitive peaks at the beginning and end of the pulse and the membrane resistance is in the GΩ range; negative voltages up to -60 mV might facilitate gigaseal formation.\nCompensate the pipette capacitance by turning the \"pipette capacitance compensation\" knobs to get a flat response of the test pulse.\nRupture the patch without destroying the seal by applying short pulses of negative pressure or negative pressure with increasing strength, to obtain whole-cell conformation.\n\t\tNOTE: Successful transition from cell-attached to whole-cell configuration is indicated by an increase of the capacitive peaks.",
    "Apply series resistance compensation by setting whole-cell parameter and compensation adjustments of the used amplifier for accurate clamping of the membrane potential to the desired holding voltage.\n\t\t\nSwitch the \"membrane test\" to \"whole-cell\" mode, in the \"Series resistance compensation\" panel turn on \"prediction\" and \"correction\" up to 90% avoiding overshots and oscillation of the capacitive response, turn the whole-cell compensation switch on and adjust whole cell parameters with the appropriate front-panel knobs (\"whole-cell capacity\" and \"series resistance\") of the amplifier in an iterative way to obtain an ideally flat test seal response.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For detailed description of series resistance compensation and correction refer to the amplifier manual or guideline as this procedure varies among different manufactures.\nAfter establishing whole-cell configuration, wait at least 2 min before recording to ensure sufficient replacement of intracellular solution through the patch pipette35.\nRecord light-induced currents at different holding potentials by using the protocols that were setup previously (in 1.2).\nExchange the extracellular buffer to low [Cl-] in the chamber at least five times without destroying the patch and record another current-voltage relation (cf. step 1.2) at the new chloride concentration.\n\tNOTE: A perfusion system for automated buffer exchange facilitates this process, but is not necessary.\nRepeat 2.15. for every ionic condition to be tested, but repeatedly check the quality of the patch between the measurements by a \"membrane test\" described above.\n\tNOTE: To guaranty accurate membrane voltage and stable intracellular ion composition membrane resistance should be above 500 MΩ whereas access resistance should not surpass 10 MΩ, see. 2.12.6). Do not forget to switch the whole-cell parameter compensation off for the membrane test.\nRepeat 2.2. to 2.15. for several cells, but take a new cover slip for each test series to ensure healthiness of cells.\n3. Data Evaluation",
    "Adjust the baseline of each current trace by subtracting the mean current before illumination.\nCalculate the mean stationary photocurrent Is (Figure 2A) by averaging the current over the last 40 ms of illumination.\n\tNOTE: Analyze peak photocurrents or vary the length of averaging to determine the stationary photocurrent depending on the protocol or scientific question.\nRepeat steps 3.1) and 3.2) for all tested conditions and different cells.\nPlot the determined photocurrents versus the respective holding potential.\n\tNOTE: If multiple measurements are averaged, individual recordings can be normalized to a specified condition or the capacitance of the cell.\nThe intersection of the current-voltage relation with the voltage axis represents the reversal potential (net current is zero). Determine it by linear interpolation between the two neighboring data points.\n\tNOTE: If there is no polarity inversion of photocurrents, extrapolate linearly from the last two points close to zero to obtain an approximation of the point of intersection.\nAverage the determined reversal potentials for the same conditions and plot them against the chloride concentration of the external buffer solutions (cf. Figure 2B).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
