    "ETHICS STATEMENT: Animals are housed in standardized conditions following the guidelines of the German Animal Welfare Act. Animals are fed a standard diet and water ad libitum and kept with a 12 hr day/night cycle. All experiments with animals are authorized by the local ethics committee.\n1. In Vivo Analysis of Adipocyte Homeostasis in Adult Males\nTo quantify hypoxia in vivo, first determine the body weight of the mice, then inject 60 mg/kg body weight of solid pimonidazole hydrochloride intra-peritoneally (for example: inject 1.5 mg into a 25 g mouse). Pimonidazole is an effective hypoxic marker, which forms adducts with thiol groups in proteins, peptides and amino acids and is detected by a specific antibody.\nSacrifice mice and remove the perigonadal fat pads (Figure 1).\n\t\n45 min after injection, sacrifice mice by CO2 asphyxiation and subsequent cervical dislocation.\nPin down the limbs of mice (as illustrated in Figure 1) and open the peritoneal cavity. Remove the left and the right perigonadal (epididymal) fat pad inside the peritoneal cavity.\n\t\tNote: Fat pad are bound to the epididymis by the peritoneal leaflets as shown in Figure 1 (perigonadal fat pads are indicated by arrows).\nTake care to remove the gonadal tissues from the fat pad. Determine fat pad weights to calculate the ratio: fat pad weight (g) per body weight (g).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53822/53822fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Location of the perigonadal fat pads in the peritoneal cavity of mice.

Note: Until the tissue is processed, store tissue samples in RNA stabilization solution at -80 °C or in liquid nitrogen.",
    "To homogenize the fat pad, add the fat pad to 1 ml single-phase solution of guanidine isothiocyanate and phenol. Use tubes containing ceramic beads (1.4 mm) to crush the tissue in a homogenizer at 6,500 rpm (2 times 20 sec, with 30 sec pause).\nIsolate the RNA as follows (single-step method by Chomczynski and Sacchi 17).\n\t\t\nTo separate the phases, transfer homogenized fat pad to microcentrifuge tube, add 0.2 ml volume chloroform, shake for 15 sec, incubate for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuge 12,000 x g for 5 min. Transfer the upper aqueous phase (around 400 µl), which contains the RNA, into a new microcentrifuge tube. Do not include the DNA-containing interphase or the protein-containing phenol phase.\nTo precipitate the RNA, add 1 volume of isopropanol, mix and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C (it is also possible to incubate at -20 °C overnight). Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min. Remove isopropanol supernatant carefully. Wash twice with 75% ethanol with centrifuge steps of 12,000 x g for 10 min.\nAfter drying the precipitated RNA for around 10 min at room temperature, dissolve it in 50 µl H2O (RNase-free). To facilitate this, incubate for 2 min at 65 °C.\n\t\t\tNote: Keep RNA in 75% ethanol at -80 °C or in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nQuantify the RNA preparations by A260/280 (optimal quotient is between 1.8 and 2.2) and calculate the concentration by A260:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53822/53822eq1.jpg\nTo avoid DNA contamination, digest 1 µg of the RNA preparation with 1 U DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C in a volume of 10 µl. Inactivate at 65 °C for 10 min.\n\t\tNote: This step is optional.",
    "Use 10 µl of RNA preparation containing 1 µg RNA for the reverse transcriptase reaction to generate single-stranded cDNA, suitable for quantitative PCR application. The components and their amounts are listed in Table 1.\nUse a PCR Master Mix for a quantitative real-time PCR reaction. To determine metabolic changes in the whole fat pad, use specific primers for genes involved in AT homeostasis (Table 2) and the PCR conditions listed in Table 3.\nReal-time PCR data analysis.\n\t\t\nDefine the baseline (Figure 2), normally cycle 1 to 15, where there is no change in fluorescence signals. The real-time PCR software normalizes specific fluorescence signals to the baseline fluorescence and to the internal reference dye, ROX, resulting in the magnitude of the specific signals by the primers, delta Rn (ΔRn).\nSet the threshold within the exponential phase of the amplification curve. The intersection defines the threshold cycle (Ct). Based on the CT value, calculate the relative expression (ΔCt) and the fold change (ΔΔCt):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53822/53822eq2.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53822/53822eq3.jpg\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nComponent,Volume µl / reaction\n10x RT Buffer,2.0\n25x dNTP Mix (100 mM),0.8\n10x RT Random Primers,2.0\nMultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase,1.0\nNuclease-free H2O,4.2\n1 µg RNA,10\nTotal per reaction,20\nTable 1: Components with respective volume for the reverse transcriptase reaction to generate single-stranded cDNA.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\n,Official full name,Symbol,Sequence 3´--> 5´,Sequence 3´--> 5´\n,Official full name,Symbol,Forward,Reverse\nAdipogenesis,Delta-like 1 homolog (pref-1),Dlk1,GACACTCGAAGCTCA  CCTGG,GGAAGGCTGGGACGG  GAAAT\nAdipogenesis,Early B cell factor 1,Ebf1,CCACCATCGACTACGG  CTTC,TCCTGGTTGTTGTGGGG  CATC\nAdipogenesis,Zinc finger protein 423,Zfp423,GTGCCCAGGAAGAAGA  CGTA,GGCGACGTGGATCTGA  ATCT\nAdipogenesis,Fatty acid binding protein 4 (Ap2),Fabp4,TCACCTGGAAGACAGCT  CCTC,AAGCCCACTCCCACTTC  TTTC\nAdipogenesis,\"CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha\",Cebpa,AAGAGCCGCGACA  AGGC,GTCAGCTCCAGCACCT  TGTG\nAdipogenesis,\"CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), beta\",Cebpb,TTTCGGGACTTGATGC  AATC,CCGCAGGAACATCTTT  AAGG\nAdipogenesis,cAMP responsive element binding protein 1,Creb1,ACTCAGCCGGGTACT  ACCAT,TTGCTGCCTCCCTGTT  CTTC\nAdipogenesis,\"CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), delta\",Cebpd,CAGCGCCTACATTGAC  TCCA,GTTGAAGAGGTCGGCG  AAGA\nAdipogenesis,Kruppel-like factor 4,Klf4,GCAGTCACAAGTCCCC  TCTC,TAGTCACAAGTGTGGG  TGGC\nAdipogenesis,Early growth response 2 (Krox20),Egr2,AGGCGGTAGACAAAATC  CCAG,GATACGGGAGATCCAG  GGGT\nAdipogenesis,Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma,Pparg,AGAGGTCCACAGAGCTG  ATTC,GATGCACTGCCTATGAGC  ACTT\nLipogenesis,Acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase alpha,Acaca,TGGGGACCTTGTCTTCA  TCAT,ATGGGCGGAATGGTCTC  TTTC",

Do not desiccate the tissue!\n\t\nFix the fat pad in 3.7% PBS-buffered formaldehyde overnight, embed in paraffin (follow the instructions as described elsewhere 18) and cut the embedded tissue into 2-5 µm thick sections (maximum 5 µm).\nDetermine the number of adipocytes per field and adipocyte size in a bright-field microscope after hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining:\n\t\t\nDeparaffinize sections by washing 3 times for 5 min in xylene and rehydrate the section 2 times for 2 min in 100% ethanol and 2 times for 2 min in 96% ethanol. Finally, wash the section in distilled H2O for 5 min.\nStain with hematoxylin, diluted 1:5 with distilled H2O, for 10 min at room temperature and wash in H2O for 5 min. Stain with eosin solution (20 ml 5% eosin Y/210 ml distilled H2O/25 µl glacial acetic acid) for 30 sec and wash again with H2O for 5 min.",
    "Dehydrate sections using 96% ethanol and 100% ethanol 2 times each for 2 min, and xylene 3 times for 5 min. Mount the sections with anhydrous mounting agent.\nEvaluate the sections under a bright-field microscope. A representative example of how to analyze adipocytes with ImageJ 1.48v 19 is shown in Fig. 3: number of cells per area (µm2), cell area (x 103 µm2), cell size (µm).\n\t\t\t\nOpen the picture of the section with ImageJ 1.48v. If the parameters of the image are indicated in pixels instead of a unit of length, adjust the scale.\nSelect *Straight line* in the toolbar and adjust the line to a known distance by reference to the scale bar. Go to Analyze -> Set Scale. The distance of the line is shown in pixels; add the known distance and the unit of length, e.g., µm. Confirm with OK. The size of the picture and the analysis of the parameters are indicated in the unit of length given.\nTo determine the parameters of the adipocytes, adjust the threshold. Go to Image -> Adjust -> Threshold to open the Threshold window. Select the following settings: Thresholding method: Default; Threshold color: B&W; Color space: HSB. The picture is now shown in black and white. Adjust the Brightness to clear white adipocytes and to close black intercellular spaces, as in Fig. 3b.\nCount the number of adipocyte per µm2 (Figure 3e) with the *multi-point* selection in the toolbar and mark each cell for counting.\nTo determine the adipocyte size, select *Straight line* again in the toolbar and draw the diameter of an adipocyte (Figure 3c). Go to Analyze -> Measure and a new window will appear, with the length of the diameter in µm.",
    "To determine the adipocyte area, select *Wand (tracing) tool* and click inside the adipocyte. The inner wall of the adipocyte is selected in red (Figure 3d). Go to Analyze -> Measure and a new window will appear, with the area of this adipocyte in µm2.\nFor immunohistochemistry, prepare the section for antibody and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining as follows:\n\t\t\nDeparaffinize sections by washing 3 times for 5 min in xylene and rehydrate the section 2 times for 2 min in 100% ethanol and 2 times for 2 min in 96% ethanol. Finally, wash the section in distilled H2O.\nFor antigen retrieval, digest the tissue section for 30 min at 37 °C with Proteinase K working solution (20 µg/ml in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4-8) and rinse with PBS.\nPerform antibody staining in wet chambers:\n\t\t\nTo block the endogenous peroxidase, use 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 min, with subsequently washing 2 times for 5 min in PBS. To block the unspecific binding of antibodies, use 10% serum in PBS. Use the serum of the host of the secondary antibody, in this case goat.\nFor the staining, use the antibodies for apoptosis, proliferation and hypoxia detection (Table 4). Dilute antibodies in PBS/10% goat serum. Incubate at 4 °C overnight. Wash the sections 3 times for 5 min in PBS.\nTo enhance the signal use a biotinylated secondary antibody, with the dilution as listed in Table 5. For hypoxia detection, use HRP conjugated rabbit anti-FITC as the secondary antibody. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature. Wash the sections 2 times 5 min with PBS.\n\t\t\tNote: For the hypoxia staining with FITC-MAb1, skip step 1.4.4.4) and continue with step 1.4.4.5).",
    "For each slide, pre-incubate 50 µl avidin solution with 50 µl biotinylated peroxidase H for 30 min at room temperature (this method is also referred to as avidin/biotin ABC complex formulation) and then add to the sections for another 45 min. Wash 2 times for 5 min with PBS.\nIncubate the sections in peroxidase substrate solution until the staining become more intense (between 5 to 10 min). Wash for 5 min with distilled H2O.\nFor counterstaining, stain with hematoxylin diluted 1:5 with distilled H2O for 10 min at room temperature and wash in H2O for 5 min.\nDehydrate sections in 96% ethanol and 100% ethanol 2 times each for 2 min, and xylene 3 times for 5 min. Seal the sections with coverslips and anhydrous mounting agent. Evaluate the sections under a bright-field microscope.\nDetermine apoptosis by TUNEL assay and follow manufacturer's instructions:\n\t\t\nAdd 50 µl enzyme solution into 450 µl label solution. Then apply 50 µl TUNEL reaction mixture on histologic sections and incubate for 60 min at +37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. Wash the sections 3 times with PBS for 5 min and mount with fluorescence mounting medium including DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for counterstaining.\nEvaluate the section under a fluorescence microscope with 100 fold magnification. For measurement of Fluorescein use an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and detect between 515-565 nm (green laser); DAPI excites at about 360 nm and emits at about 460 nm when bound to DNA (blue laser).\nQuantify the overlays of DAPI and Fluorescein:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53822/53822eq4.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53822/53822fig3.jpg",
