    "Surface sterilization and preparation of fruitsWipe off any dirt from the fruits using wet tissue paper with 70% ethanol. As a standard, we use 6 fruits (replicates) for each treatment but, depending on the variability of the assay, more or less replicates may be required.Line the propylene trays with tissue paper and arrange them on a clean surface.Spray 70% ethanol onto the tissue paper laid out in the trays until the entire tissue surface is covered.Add 1 L of 70% ethanol into the 3 L measuring cylinder.Dip the fruits in 70% ethanol for 1 min (do not wipe after dipping) by hand (using surface sterilized gloves), gently turn the fruits so that the entire fruit surface is covered, carefully transfer fruits to the sterilized tray by-hand (using surface sterilized gloves).Let them dry for 1 h in the sterilized trays. Label each tray with the different treatments. When using larger fruits (i.e., apples), apply the label using a permanent marker pen to the fruit itself.Wounding of fruitsSterilize the custom-made tool using 70% ethanol and use it to create a 2.5 mm wide and 3 mm deep wound in each fruit (Figures 1A-1B).Let the inflicted wound dry for 1 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200115/20200115233053_6711.jpgFigure 1. Wounding and infection of an apple fruit using mycelium. A. Wound infliction on an apple using a custom-made tool. B. Wound created before infection. C. Application of mycelium into the wound to start the infection. D. Measuring of the lesion at day 5 post-infection.Preparation of yeast suspensionDefreeze the biocontrol yeast initially preserved in 30% glycerol at -80 °C. Transfer 10 µl to a PDA plate and spread using an inoculation loop. Incubate at 22 °C for 72 h.Using an inoculation loop, pick 5 colonies of the biocontrol yeast cells that have been grown on PDA for 72 h.",
    "Transfer the colonies into 1 ml of distilled water.Vortex the suspension for 1 min or until the yeast cells solution is homogeneous.Dilute the yeast suspension 10 times inside the disposable cuvettes (i.e., mix 100 µl yeast solution with 900 µl distilled water).Using the spectrophotometer, measure the absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) and record this OD600 reading.Adjust the cell suspension to a final OD600 of 2 in 1,000 µl of distilled water as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200115/20200115233118_6412.jpg Example: If the OD600 reading is 5.6, then 357 µl ((1,000 µl x 2)/5.6 ) of the yeast cell suspension and 643 µl (1,000 µl - 357 µl) of distilled water are mixed in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Note: The final OD600 can vary depending on the yeast, fruit, and pathogen.Yeast application to woundsAdd 10 µl of the yeast suspension to the wound (ensure the solution is pipetted inside the wound and not flowing out).Let the wounds dry for 3 h (do not move the trays to avoid yeast solution flowing out of the wound). Depending on the goal of the assay, inoculate yeasts and pathogens simultaneously or give the yeast more time to establish in the wound (i.e., inoculate the pathogen after 3 h, 12 h or 1 day).Note: Some yeasts may benefit from a longer time to establish before the pathogen is added.Preparation of the fungal plant pathogenDefreeze the fungal pathogen mycelium plugs that were initially preserved in 30% glycerol at -80 °C. Take out the mycelium plugs using sterile loops and transfer them on a PDA plate. Place 1 mycelium plug per plate (in the center of the plate) and incubate at 22 °C.Depending on the pathogen of choice, use either conidia or mycelium for infection.Preparation of conidia (e.g., Fusarium sp.",
    ")Let the fungus grow on 5 cm PDA plates (or the medium most suitable to the particular fungal pathogen in question) for 7-14 days depending on the fungal pathogen.Add 10 ml of distilled water onto the 5 cm PDA plate containing the pathogen.Using the inoculation loop, gently scrape the surface of the plate to suspend the conidia in the water.Filter the conidia using sterile miracloth and collect the filtrate in a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube.Note: The conidia are in the filtrate, while hyphae remain in the miracloth. Transfer 1 ml of the filtrate into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Clean the glass cover slips and hemocytometer using 70% ethanol.Place the glass cover slips over the counting chambers of the hemocytometer (apply sufficient force, so that the slide is intact and forms ‘Newton colour rings’).Pipette 10 µl of the conidia suspension between the fixed cover slip and the hemocytometer (pipetting slowly at the edge will allow the solution to seep through).View the hemocytometer under the microscope at magnification 125x (objective 10x, ocular 12.5x).Count the number of conidia in the large corner squares and calculate their density based on the specifications of the specific hemocytometer used.Adjust the concentration of conidia to 5 x 104 conidia per ml in a defined volume (1,000 µl is usually sufficient) as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200115/20200115233158_9094.jpg Example: If the calculated conidia concentration is 1 x 105 conidia/ml, then 500 µl (1,000 µl x 5 x 104/1 x 105 ) of the conidia suspension and 500 µl (1,000 µl - 500 µl) of distilled water are mixed in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Note: The conidia can be stored in 30% glycerol at -80 °C for subsequent use.",
    "However, if stored for a longer period they should be tested for viability (plate on PDA medium and after 24 h, microscopically check for germination and growth).Preparation of mycelium (e.g., B. cinerea)Use a 7 days old fungal culture maintained on PDA.Using a 3 mm cork drill, careful cut out mycelium plugs from the edge of the colony, where the mycelium is young (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200115/20200115233224_8468.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of mycelium plugs. A. Tools and material needed for mycelium preparation (forceps, cork drill and a pathogen growing on PDA plate). B. Using the 3mm cork drill to cut out a mycelium plug. C. A mycelium plug is being picked from the plate using forceps and will be used for wound infection.Wound infectionWith conidiaUse the conidia suspension with the adjusted concentrations for infection.Carefully pipette 10 µl of the conidia solutions into the wound and let it dry for 1 h (do not move the trays to avoid the pathogen flowing out of the wound).With myceliumTransfer the mycelium plug using forceps and place it upside down onto the wound (this ensures the mycelium grows into the wound (Figure 1C).IncubationMaintain bigger fruits (e.g., apples, oranges, nectarines) on fruit pack trays. Evenly distribute the different treatments across all boxes and cover the boxes with an autoclave bag. Keep the smaller fruits (e.g., cherries, plums) in plastic incubation boxes that are tightly covered with a lid (in all cases ensure the infected side is facing upwards).Incubate at room temperature for 3-7 days.Note: Depending on the type and ripeness of the fruit and the pathogen, rotting and lesions will develop at different time points.Evaluation and measurementMeasure the diameter of the lesion/rot using a ruler perpendicularly to the stem (Figure 1D)Record the measurement."
