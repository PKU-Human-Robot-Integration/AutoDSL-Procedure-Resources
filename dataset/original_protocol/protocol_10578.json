    "1. Preparation of RNA Molecules for Single-molecule Tweezing\nCloning the sequence of interest. Clone the DNA sequence corresponding to the RNA structure into a vector.\nSynthesis and purification of the transcription template. Synthesize a transcription template by PCR. [place table 1 here] Next, purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit, and concentrate the sample to >200 ng/µl. Because the purified DNA is used for transcription, RNase free water should be used in the elution and concentration steps.\nIn vitro transcription. Synthesize RNA by in vitro transcription at 37 °C overnight to maximize RNA yield. [place table 2 here] After transcription, add 1 µl DNase I to digest the DNA template for 15 min at 37 °C. Purify the RNA using a silica spin column.\nSynthesis of the biotinylated handle A. First, produce the unmodified handle A by PCR using primers Af and Ar and concentrate the amplified DNA to >200 ng/µl. Next, incorporate biotin modifications into the PCR product using a primer extension reaction. [place table 3 here] NOTE: The biotinylated handle A (biotin-HA) can be directly used in the annealing without purification. As the biotin-HA is to be annealed with RNA, it is critical to use RNase free water in both steps.\nSynthesis of the digoxigenin-modified handle B. Synthesize digoxigenin modified handle B (dig-HB) by PCR using primer Bf and digoxigenin-modified oligo Dig-Br (Figure 3). Next, purify the PCR product and concentrate the sample to >200 ng/µl.\nAnnealing RNA to the handles. Anneal the RNA with handles. [place tables 4 and 5 here]",
    "Purify annealed sample. Add 3 volumes of ethanol of the annealed sample and mix well. Store the mixture at -70 °C for at least 1 hr. Spin down at 15,800 x g and discard supernatant. Dry the pellet using a lyophilizer. Dissolve the pellet in 100 µl RNase free water. NOTE: The sample is ready to be used and can be stored at -20 °C.\n2. Calibration and Operation of the Optical Tweezers\nCalibrate Pixel Size of Video Monitor\n\t\nUse the optical trap to trap a bead with known diameter (size standard).\nCapture images of a trapped bead using imaging software (Figure 4).\nDetermine the diameter of the bead using the imaging software based on the centroid method.\nRepeat this procedure to determine diameters of beads of different size.\nFit the measured and known diameters of the beads by a linear regression to obtain the physical size of a pixel.\nVerify Distance Calibration\n\t\nUse the optical trap to trap a bead.\nDetermine the pixel position of its centroid by the image capture software and record its position using the Minitweezers.\nSteer the bead to different positions and repeat the position determination.\nConvert the X and Y positions of the bead from pixels to m unit using the calibrated pixel size.\nCompare the X and Y between positions measured by video and by the Minitweezers. The two sets of values should agree. As the image resolution is > 0.1 µm, move the bead over 1 µm between measurements to ensure accuracy. If the distance calibration is not comparable to the one stored in the Minitweezers, recalibrate the instrument.\nTrap Stiffness Calibration\n\t\nCapture a bead using the optical trap and hold it still.",
    "Record the force of the trap using a bypass fast data acquisition at a rate > 5 kHz for 3 sec.\nGenerate a power spectrum from the recording of the bead motion using software. Fit the power spectrum to a Lorentzian (Figure 5)38:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51542/51542eq1.jpg (Eq. 1)\n\t\tin which S(f) is the power at the frequency of f, fc is the corner frequency, and S0 is the asymptotic power. The corner frequency, fc, is the frequency where the power of thermal motion has decreased to half of the asymptotic value. As fc varies with laser power and bead size, calibrate each trapped bead individually.\nCompute the spring constant of the trap, κ, from fc:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51542/51542eq2.jpg (Eq. 2)\n\t\tin which γ is the drag coefficient of the bead (Eq. 3). Use the spring constant to determine extension changes of an RNA from force change.\nStokes’ Law Test\n\t\nCapture a bead using the optical trap. Move the bead back-and-force at different speed.\nRecord the motion of the bead and force using the Minitweezers.\nCompute the radius of the bead.\n\t\tNOTE: The frictional force, Fd, generated by the motion of a spherical particle in a fluid can be described by the Stokes’ law:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51542/51542eq3.jpg (Eq. 3)\n\t\tin which r is the radius of the sphere, v is the velocity, and h is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, which can be found in reference tables. Using the measured force as Fd, the radius of the bead can be computed using Eq. 3 (Figure 6) and should agree with that determined by the image acquisition software. The Stokes’ law test effectively tests the overall calibrations and performance of the instrument.\n3. Nanomanipulation of Single RNA Molecules\nMaking fluidics.",
    "Drill six holes (2 mm diameter each) on a No. 2 cover glass (Figure 7a) and cut three slits (2 mm width) into double-sided polyimide tape (Figure 7b) using a laser engraver.\nMake a flow chamber by sandwiching two cover glass with two layers of double-sided Kapton tape. Insert a micropipette and two bypass tubes between the tape (Figure 7c).\nMount the flow chamber onto a metal frame by matching fluidic holes (Figure 7d).\nConnect the fluidic channels of the chamber to 10 ml syringes filled with buffer of choice via polyethylene tubings (Figure 7e).\nMount the entire chamber onto the optical tweezers between the two objectives. Ensure that the front side of the chamber with the fluidic channels faces to the right. Retract the right objective and plug the brass pins of the frame (Figure 7e) to mounting holes on the tweezers. Tighten screws to fix the chamber position.\nMixing the annealed sample and beads. Mix the annealed sample with anti-digoxigenin-coated beads (dig-beads), and let the mixture to stay at room temperature for 5-10 min. Typically, 1 µl of annealed sample is mixed with 5 µl dig-beads in 1 ml of buffer. NOTE: The amount of the beads to be loaded into the flow chamber should be chosen to ensure a reasonable quantity of the beads to be delivered from the bypassing tube. The ratio of the annealed sample to the beads cannot be easily quantified. In an ideal case, most beads have no RNA such that only a small fraction of beads may have only one RNA molecule per bead. As the annealed samples and the bead suspension are difficult to quantify, the best and only way currently is to vary the mixing ratio and test the mixture on the tweezers.",
    "Deliver beads to the reaction site in the flow chamber (i.e., a few micrometers on top of the micropipette tip, Figure 7c).\n\t\nLoad a suspension of streptavidin-coated beads (strep-beads) into a 1 ml syringe.\nConnect the syringe to the fluidic tubing leading to the bottom channel of the flow chamber (Figure 7a).\nPush the syringe to flow the strep-beads into the chamber.\nMove the entire chamber using motor control software to place the optical trap near the opening of the bottom bypass tube (Figure 7b). Then operate the optical trap by a trackball to capture a strep-bead.\nMove the bead close to the tip of the micropipette using the motor control software.\nPull the syringe connected to the micropipette to suck the bead onto the micropipette.\nApply flow gently by pressing the syringe to the middle channel to flush out extra strep-beads.\nSimilarly, deliver the mixture of sample and the dig-beads (see step 3.2) to the top channel of the chamber.\nCapture a dig-bead and bring it close to the strep-bead using the optical trap.\nClean the middle channel by applying flow. NOTE: The strep- and dig-beads are chosen to be different sizes so that they can be distinguished visually under the microscopic view (Figure 4).\nFishing” a single-molecule tethering between a pair of beads.\n\t\nPlace the dig-bead vertically on top of the strep-bead (Figure 4).\nMove the dig-bead down towards the strep-bead by steering the trap. Open a force-distance plot window on computer to visualize force changes.\nUpon contact of the two beads, move the dig-bead vertically away from the strep-bead.",
    "If no specific contact is made, the force remains almost zero. If the two beads are connected by molecules, the force increases significantly when the two beads separate. This procedure, commonly referred to as “fishing”, is often performed multiple times on each pair of beads to find an effective single-molecule tether.\nSubscription Required.
