    "Embryoid Body Production: Singularizing and Plating Human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs)Prepare EB Media without growth factors and prewarm to 37°C using a water bath. EB Media (without growth factors) can be stored for up to 1 week at 4°C, and once warmed, the stock should be used or discarded.Wash hESCs, which have reached 70–80% confluence, twice with 3 volumes of D-PBS-/-.Note: This protocol was established using hESCs cultured in mouse embryoinic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned media supplemented with bFGF to a final concentration of 4 ng/ml (Sivitilli et al., 2020). Add 1 ml TrypLE and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (22°C).Gently pipette up and down to dissociate colonies to a single-cell suspension.Neutralize TrypLE with 4 volumes (i.e., 4 ml) EB media and add the resulting suspension to a 15-ml Falcon tube.Use a hemocytometer to count the cells. Avoid using an automated cell counter, which can result in inaccurate cell numbers because hESCs are prone to clumping.Cenrifuge cells at 150 × g for 5 min at room temperature (22°C).During centrifugation, prepare EB Media by supplementing with 4 ng/ml bFGF and 50 µM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor). For this, use 15 ml EB media with 1.5 µl bFGF (from a 40 ng/µl stock) and 7.5 µl Y-27635 (from a 100 mM stock).Resuspend single hESCs to a final concentration of 80,000 cells/ml in the freshly prepared EB Media supplemented with bFGF and Y-27632.Transfer the resuspended cells to a sterile disposable reagent reservoir and add 150 µl cell suspension (12,000 cells) to each well of a 96-well V-bottomed non-binding plate using a multi-channel pipette.Place the plate at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 2 days.Embryoid Body Production: FeedingPrepare EB Media fresh daily and prewarm to 37°C using a water bath.On day 2, feed the EBs with EB media supplemented with 2 ng/ml bFGF.",
    "To reach the required concentration, mix 15 ml EB media with 0.75 µl bFGF (40 ng/ul).Remove 135 µl media from each well of the incubated 96-well plate using the multi-channel pipette.Transfer the EB media (supplemented with 2 ng/ml bFGF) into a sterile disposable reagent reservoir and add 150 µl EB media using the multi-channel pipette.Return the plate to the CO2 incubator for a further 2 days.Note: Due to evaporation, wells toward the peripheral edge of the 96-well plate may have a slightly lower volume. This is normal and EBs should still form correctly. Embryoid Body Production: Assessment CheckpointOn day 5, measure the EB size using a brightfield microscope to determine whether the EBs are ready for neural induction (Figure 2). If the size of the EBs is 350–600 µm, proceed to Procedure D (Neural Induction); if the size is below 350 µm, then repeat Procedure B; if the size is above 600 µm, we do not recommend continuing with the protocol. Restart the protocol and double check cell counting in Procedure A to ensure accuracy when seeding EBs and start another batch.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3985/bioprotoc-11-08-3985-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative EB derived from H9 hESCs on Day 5 Neural Induction: Transfer to Neural InductionPrepare Neural Induction Media fresh for each differentiation and prewarm an aliquot to 37°C using a water bath. Neural Induction Media can be stored for 1 week at 4°C. Once warmed, Neural Induction Media should not be reused.Choose EBs that meet the size and visual criteria (Figure 2).Cut 2–3 mm off the extremity of a 200-µl filtered pipette tip using a razor blade to make a wider opening.Prepare a 24-well ultra-low attachment plate by adding 500 µl prewarmed Neural Induction Media to each well.",
    "Using a dissecting scope and a cut 200 µl pipette tip, pick up the EB and transfer to a 24-well ultra-low attachment plate. Set the pipette to 20 µl, place the end at the bottom of the well and pipette up the EB. A maximum of 2 EBs per well can be added; additional EBs increase the likelihood of further aggregation.Place the plate in a CO2 incubator for 2 days.Neural Induction: FeedingPrewarm Neural Induction Media to 37°C using a water bath.Feed the EBs by adding an additional 500 µl Neural Induction Media to each well.Return the plate to a CO2 incubator for a further 2 days.Neural Induction: Assessment CheckpointUse a brightfield microscope to examine the neuralized EBs for optical clearing in the outer 100 µm of the EB (Figure 3). The outer ring structure should be prominent and marked by a stark change in opacity as compared with the central region of the EB. This is a critical checkpoint; EBs that do not have the correct organization of the neuroepithelial ring will not form organoids.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3985/bioprotoc-11-08-3985-g003.jpgFigure 3. Neuroectoderm formation in an EB derived from H9 hESCs at Day 9 Neuroepithelial Expansion: Transfer to Solid Phase Matrigel ScaffoldThaw Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel on ice for 2 h. Once thawed, Matrigel can be used for up to 6 h but must be kept on ice. Matrigel cannot be refrozen once thawed.Prepare CO Differentiation Media without Vitamin A (CDM-A) fresh for each differentiation and prewarm an aliquot to 37°C using a water bath. CDM-A can be stored for 2 weeks at 4°C. Once warmed, CDM-A should not be reused.Prepare a box of wide-bore tips by cutting 3–4 mm off the extremity of a 200 µl filtered pipette tip using a razor blade to make a wider opening.",
    "Pick up the EBs one by one using a 200 µl cut tip and transfer to the center of each well of the 4-well plate (1 EB per well).Using an uncut 200 µl tip, draw 25 µl to aspirate the remaining Neural Induction Media from each well. It is critical to remove all media from the EB in the 4-well plate; failure to do so will prevent the Matrigel from attaching to the plate surface and prevent removal of the Matrigel in Procedure J.Cover the neuralized EB with a drop of cold Matrigel (30 µl) using an uncut 200 µl tip.Position the EB in the center of the Matrigel droplet using a 10 µl tip. Ensure that the EB is not resting on the bottom of the plate.Once a plate has been filled (4 EBs), transfer the full plate to a CO2 incubator for 10 min at 37°C to polymerize the Matrigel.After 10 min, carefully add 500 µl prewarmed CDM-A and return to a CO2 incubator for a futher 2 days.Note: Be consistent with the amount of media collected when transferring the EB. We recommend collecting EBs with 25 µl media to create a droplet in the 4-well plates. Neuroepithelial Expansion: FeedingPrewarm an aliquot of CDM-A to 37°C using a water bath.Carefully aspirate all media and add 500 µl CDM-A to each well of the 4-well plate.Return the plate to the incubator for a further 2 days.Neuroepithelial Expansion: Assessment of CheckpointUse a brightfield microscope to examine the COs for ring structures in the peripheral regions of the organoid (Figure 4). COs should be approximately 500–700 µm in diameter and have multiple ring structures throughout; this is a critical checkpoint, those without ring structures will not form organoids.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3985/bioprotoc-11-08-3985-g004.jpgFigure 4.",
    "Representative hCOs derived from H9 hESCs on day 13 prior to Matrigel extraction Transfer to Spinning Culture: Extraction from Solid Phase MatrigelPrepare CO Differentiation Media (CDM) fresh and prewarm an aliquot to 37°C using a water bath. CDM can be stored for 2 weeks at 4°C. Once warmed, CDM should not be reused.Prepare wide-bore pipette tips by cutting 4–5 mm off the extremity of 200 µl pipette tips to make a wider opening.Prepare a 6-well plate with 3 ml prewarmed CDM per well.Using a dissection microscope, carefully cut around the COs implanted in the Matrigel droplet; the goal here is to remove as much Matrigel as possible without damaging the CO. Excess Matrigel remaining on the CO at this stage will result in formation of cyst-like structures in the spinning culture.Use a cut 200 µl tip to transfer the COs to the 6-well plate containing CDM; a maximum of 4 hCOs per well is acceptable.Once all the COs have been transferred, place the 6-well plate on an orbital shaker (ThermoFisher Cat:  88881101  ) in a 37°C incubator at a speed of 80–90 rpm (rpm may vary if a different orbital shaker model is used).Transfer to Spinning Culture: Feeding in Spinning CulturePrewarm CDM using a 37°C water bath.Pause the orbital shaker and collect the plate containing the COs.Carefully aspirate 2/3 of the total media volume from each well; be mindful not to aspirate the COs with the media since they are in suspension.Add 3 ml prewarmed CDM to each well.Return the plate to the orbital shaker in the incubator and initialize (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3985/bioprotoc-11-08-3985-g005.jpgFigure 5.
