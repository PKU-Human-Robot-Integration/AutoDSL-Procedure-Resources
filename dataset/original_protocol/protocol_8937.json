    "1. Homogenization and Total Protein Extraction from Human and Mouse Brain Tissue\nBrain tissue homogenization. Homogenize the brain tissue 10% (w/v) in 8 M urea, 2 M thiourea and 1% w/v SDS buffer (UTS) using a potter glass (for human samples) or Teflon homogenizer (for mice samples). Sonicate at 60 Hz 30 pulses with a ultrasound generator applying 0.5 sec for total tissue disintegration13,14.\n\t\nDetermine protein concentration with Bradford assay, using BSA as standard. This UTS buffer extraction is totally compatible with one dimension SDS-PAGE as long as lysates are not over-heated to avoid carbamylation15.\nAdd 1% (w/v) of Amberlite and incubate with gentle mixing during 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter filter onto 0.22 µm syringe filters and finally add the SDS to the urea/thiourea solution. This step reduces the amount of uric acid and isocyanic acid, which are in equilibrium with urea in solution and facilitate its degradation.\nChloroform/methanol protein precipitation. Precipitate between 100-150 µg of protein for 11 cm IPG Strips and 1-1.5 mg for 18 cm ones (independently on the pH range selected to perform the IEF).\n\t\nPerform all the steps on ice or at 4 °C. Cool chloroform and methanol at 4 °C for 30 min before starting the precipitation procedure.\nAdd three volumes of methanol and one volume of chloroform to one volume of UTS lysate. Shake manually the mixture and add three volumes of cold water. Vortex during 1 min and pellet the proteins by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant using a Pasteur pipette and add three volumes of cold MeOH. Vortex again and centrifuge at 12,000 x g during 30 min at 4 °C. Finally discard supernatant and dry the pellet under N2.",
    "Preparation of proteins for 2D analysis. Resuspend the protein-dried pellet in 2D-buffer (8 M urea, 2 M thiourea supplemented with 4% CHAPS). Wash the solution with Amberlite as indicated above and try to keep the proportion of 500 µg of protein per 200 µl of 2D buffer for 2D-DIGE. Note: 2D buffer can be stored at -80 °C or kept at 4 °C during one week (to prevent urea degradation).\n\t\nSonicate and store the samples at -80 °C until carrying out the following step. Noteworthy, this protocol can be used after formic acid solubilization of protein aggregates10. Briefly, evaporate formic acid under N2 and resuspend the pellet as described.\n2. 2D-DIGE\nSamples test quality. Dose samples again using Bradford method. Dilute 15 µg of proteins in LDS sample buffer, heat at 37 °C15 and load onto 4-12% polyacrylamide gels.\nCoomassie staining. Stain polyacrylamide gel with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue G-250, 50% EtOH and 10% (v/v) acetic acid solution for at least 1 hr. Let background destain overnight in 7% acetic acid and 10% (v/v) ethanol solution.\nPre-electrophoretic labeling of samples. Prior to performing cyanine dye labeling, verify the pH of the sample, which should be basic or even neutral since the N-hydroxysuccinimide substitution is more efficient at basic pH and given to be optimal at pH 8.6.\n\t\nLabel minimally the two samples of study with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes with a ratio of 50 μg protein/400 pmol dye and keep for 1 hr at 4 °C in the darkness to facilitate the NHS ester reactive group of the cyanines with the unprotonated amine groups of lysines.",
    "Reduce sample variations making a cross-labeling with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes, avoiding a preferential coupling of one sample to a particular cyanine. Note that the cyanine-dye minimal labeling can be adapted for small amount of proteins with keeping the proportion of 1 µg protein per 8 pmol cyanine-dye. If so, the mini-2DE system can be used instead of the large 2D gel system. This will enable the 2D-DIGE analysis for a small amount of brain tissue.\nLabel a pool of both samples with the same amount of protein (50 µg in total) with Cy2 fluorescent dye and used as internal standard. Use the same conditions as previously indicated.\nComplete to a total volume 350 μl with 2D buffer containing 1.1% Destreak reagent, 1.2% of IPG buffer and traces of Bromophenol Blue the total 150 µg of labeled proteins (50 µg of Cy2, 50 µg of Cy3 and 50 µg of Cy2). Perform this step in quadruplicate using four independent strips. Moreover, prepare two additional non-labeled strips (one for each sample) with 350-450 µg of protein for the preparative gels.\nLeave the six loaded strips covered with mineral oil overnight for passive rehydration.\nIsoelectrofocusing. Carry out the IEF at 20 °C. For a pH 3-11NL, 18 cm strip the protocol is: maximum current setting is 50 μA/strip during 8 stages: 1) 150 V step for 1 hr, 2) 200 V step for 5 hr, 3) 500 V gradient for 2 hr, 4) 1,000 V gradient for 2 hr, 5) 2,000 V gradient for 2 hr, 6) 4,000 V gradient for 2 hr, 7) 8,000 V gradient for 2 hr and 8) for a total of 24,000 V·hr step. After IEF, dispatch the excess of mineral oil using chromatography paper and store the strips at -20 °C until the second dimension.",
    "IPG Strips equilibration. Equilibrate strips in 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 30% Glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6 buffer with 1% of DTT during 15 min and after with 4.7% of iodoacetamide in the same buffer but without DTT.\nSecond dimension or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Make the six 12% SDS-PAGE gels (1.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.072% (w/v) APS and 0.1% (v/v) TEMED) at the same time using a large 2D system, with four low-fluorescence glass plates for the strips with fluorescence samples and two other glass plates with 1.5 mm of thickness for preparative gels in order to excise the protein spots.\n\t\nLoad the six IPG Strips on the top of the gels and over layered with 0.5% (w/v) of agarose. Running buffer is composed of 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Carry out the migration at 2.5 W/gel overnight with a refrigeration system set to 4 °C16,17.\nFluorescence images acquisition and analysis. Use a Typhoon 9400 scanner to obtain the fluorescence gels images (12 images for one experiment). Scan Cy2, Cy3 and Cy5 images for each gel at 488/520 nm, 532/580 nm and 630/670 nm excitation/emission wavelengths, respectively. Use informatic software to analyze the images. Data are representative of the changes of spot volume associated with the distribution of the signal across the four gels among the two samples studied.",
    "Coomassie staining for big gels. Fix the preparative gels in 50% (v/v) EtOH and 3% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid solution for at least 24 hr. Then after, wash twice with ultra pure water for 20 min. Perform coloration in 34% (v/v) MeOH, 17% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and 2% orthophosphoric acid for 1 hr before adding 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue G-250. Keep the gels in coloration for at least 48 hr and decolorized in ultra pure water.\n\t\nSpots for MS identification. Once fluorescence images are analyzed, the software provides a list of spots whose expression is statistically different. Manually excise these spots from the preparative gels. This procedure requires practice and some manual dexterity in order to avoid keratin contamination. Then samples can be kept in water at -20 °C until sending to MS. Spot identification is perfectly compatible with Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and relevance of protein identities is judged according to the probability based Mowse score calculated with a p-value of 0.05 (p < 0.05)18.\n3. Qualitative Mini-2DE Assay\nResuspend maximum 100 µg of protein sample in 2D buffer until a final volume of 200 µl for a 11 cm IPG strip. In case of overexpression system or purified protein, the starting amount can be lowered to 20 µg.\nAdd 1.1% (v/v) Destreak Reagent, 0.55% (v/v) IPG buffer and traces of Bromophenol Blue to a final volume of 200 µl. Then, vortex, make a fast spin and load into an IPG strip for passive rehydration (to bring the strip to its original thickness) overnight covered with mineral oil. Note: the proportion of IPG buffer is the same for all the interval of pH desired (pH 3-11, 4-7, 7-11, etc), but its composition varies in function of the pH range selected.",
    "Isoelectrofocalisation. Perform IEF at 20 °C. The duration of the program depends on the pH interval selected. Noteworthy, parameters such as electroendosmosis may disturb the IEF profile and in these cases, optimization in electrofocalisation time is required19. Note: it is not necessarily a longer IEF that provides better results but shortening the time of IEF can also improve the resolution. After IEF, IPG strips can be stored at -20 °C for months.\nIPG strips equilibration. Equilibrate the strips in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 20 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.05% Bromophenol Blue. Make three equilibration bathes for 15 min with changing the buffer solution between each bath.\nSDS-PAGE. Layer the IPG strip onto a precast gel (IPG+1 well, 11 cm IPG strip) with a percentage of polyacrylamide chosen depending on the MW of the protein of interest. Then, blot the gel onto a nitrocellulose/PVDF membrane at 100 mV during 33 min.\nIncubate overnight with the required antibody and visualize by peroxidase activity. Perform the alignments of immunoblots using unrelated polypeptides revealed by the secondary antibody. Reach a semi-quantitative analysis by densitometry of the volume and intensity for the traces/ spots with ImageJ software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
