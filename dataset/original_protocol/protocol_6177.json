    "Dissection of infected barley leavesGrow barley (Hordeum vulgare) cv. Golden Promise seedlings in a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 20 °C. It is essential to keep the plants well-watered, as drought stress prevents effective dissection of the epidermis.Maintain the powdery mildew fungus (B. graminis f. sp. hordei) on living barley plants in a dedicated enclosed transparent container protected from air currents that may displace the conidia. Remove old conidia by shaking the inoculum pots one day before infecting healthy plants.Inoculate seven-day barley seedlings. At this stage, the primary leaves are fully extended. The inoculation B. graminis is carried out by shaking heavily infected plants over the uninfected barley. The plants will be ready for dissection seven days after inoculation.Note: It is highly recommended that a tight-fitting face mask be used when carrying out this procedure to prevent conidia from entering the operator’s airways. Prepare scissor, tweezers, razor blade, Parafilm, Pasteur pipettes, 15 ml/50 ml polypropylene tubes and liquid nitrogen. Place two 50 ml tubes in a liquid nitrogen container and fill with liquid nitrogen.Dissolve 5 g of cellulose acetate in 100 ml anhydrous acetone. Pour the solution into a 15 ml polypropylene tube.Dissolve 0.2 g of MES hydrate powder in 100 ml H2O to make 10 mM MES buffer. Adjust the pH to 5.3 with HCl. Pour 20 ml of MES buffer into a 50 ml tube at room temperature.Cut one infected primary leaf and immerse it in 5% cellulose acetate acetone, holding it at the leaf base. Carefully take out the leaf and wait for a few seconds above the mouth of the tube to remove any cellulose acetate acetone droplets accumulating at the leaf tip. Then place the leaf onto two Pasteur pipettes.Repeat the above step five times.",
    "Let the acetone evaporate from the leaf surface for 5-8 min.Note: This step is critical: the cellulose acetate membrane needs to be dry enough to allow peeling; however, if the leaves are left too long they dehydrate and wilt rendering the dissection of the epidermis impossible. As the acetone evaporates, the epiphytic mycelia-containing cellulose acetate layer will harden and begin to peel away from the rest of the leaf. Now peel off the cellulose acetate membrane with the epiphytic fungal structures embedded in it. Keep the leaves stripped of epiphytic structures on water for 5 min to ensure full hydration.Following this, turn the leaf so the adaxial surface faces upwards. Press a razor gently near the tip of the leaf, carefully rock the blade back and forward.Note: This step is challenging and requires some trial and error to gain sufficient experience to achieve correct dissection. The aim is to cut through the upper, adaxial epidermis and part of the mesophyll, while retaining the lower, abaxial epidermis intact. Turn the leaf over to let the abaxial side facing upwards. While gripping the leaf at its tip (this forms a ‘tab’ which can be used to pull the epidermis) and holding the section of the leaf below the cut steady, pull back the abaxial epidermis which contains fungal haustoria.Note: Free the epidermal layer by pushing away other layers with forceps, if needed. Once free, carefully peel the abaxial epidermis in a continuous smooth motion.Once complete, take away the tip of the leaf (the ‘tab’) by cutting the epidermis and removing it with the tweezers.Note: To isolate haustoria from epidermis, skip to Step B1. Snap freeze peeled epiphytic and epidermal materials separately in two 50 ml polypropylene tubes in liquid nitrogen for future use.Store at -80 °C till needed.",
    "Haustoria isolationFloat peeled epidermis in 15 ml 10 mM MES hydrate buffer (pH 5.3) in a 50 ml tube.Once sufficient epidermis strips are collected (we used one pot in Video 1), add 200 mg of Cellulase R-10 into 10 ml MES buffer in a new 50 ml tube. Mix thoroughly, so the final concentration of cellulase is 2% (w/v).Carefully transfer all dissected epidermis with tweezers into the new mixture.Incubate the suspension at 28 °C for two hours with gentle shaking (e.g., 80 rpm on a rotating platform). During incubation, the cellulase will lyse the barley epidermal cells and release haustoria into the incubation buffer.After incubation, place a 70 μm nylon mesh sieve over a 50 ml tube. Slowly pour the buffer through the filter while using forceps as a barrier to retain larger pieces of undigested plant material.Once all the buffers are collected, centrifuge in a swing out rotor at 3,270 x g for 10 min, at 4 °C.After centrifugation, the pellet should contain haustoria.Pour off the supernatant and retain the pelleted haustoria.Note: After this step, the haustoria can either be kept at -80 °C for long-term storage or stained immediately to visualize (continue with Procedure C).WGA-Alexa Fluor 488 staining (optional for quality control)Gently resuspend the haustorial pellet in 300 μl of PBS buffer (pH 7.4) (Recipe 1).Add WGA-Alexa Fluor 488 into the mixture to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml.Mix well by inverting the tube several times.Load the mixture onto a microscope glass slide and carefully place a cover glass on top.Visualize under the GFP filter with an epifluorescence microscope.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
