    "1. Capturing Bees from the Colony and the Starvation Period\nNote: Experiments described here were performed at Newcastle University, UK with Bombus terrestris audax. Multiple (2-3) commercially purchased colonies were used per treatment. The colonies have been maintained on a bench at laboratory conditions (25 ± 2 °C and 28 ± 2% RH) in constant darkness and were fed with honey bee collected pollen and sugar solutions ad libitum.\nCollect individual worker bumble bees using a plastic vial (7 cm long, 2.8 cm inner diameter) with a perforated plastic stopper, after having opened the gate to the colony just long enough for one bee to exit and be trapped.\nPrior to the experiment, individually starve all bumble bees for 2-4 hr in the plastic vials and keep at room temperature in complete darkness.\n2. Transferring Bees into the Holding Tubes and the Habituation Phase\nAfter the starvation period, transfer a bumble bee directly from the plastic vial into a holding tube. The holding tube is a modified 15 ml centrifuge tube (length: 119 mm; diameter 17 mm), with a 4 mm hole drilled at the tip and a piece of steel mesh (base: 8 mm; height 30 mm) fixed inside by melting the plastic of the tube with a heated dissecting steel needle.\nFix the holding tube containing the bumble bee onto a polystyrene holder with dental wax. Fix two pieces of cardboard on either side of the holding tube. This is to shield the bee from visual stimuli that might interfere with the experiment.\nPosition a digital microscopic camera 5 cm above the tip of the holding tube and connect the camera to a compatible laptop.",
    "Adjust the holding tube so that at least the first 18 mm of the holding tube tip is within the video frame. Prior to the experiment, commence the 3 min habituation period.\n3. Pre-test Phase: Presenting a Drop of Sucrose\nConnect a syringe to a female adapter containing a droplet of sucrose solution (~3.5 µl, 500 mM sucrose dissolved in deionized water). Present the sucrose inside the holding tube tip to motivate the extension of the proboscis.\nGive the bumble bee up to 5 min to consume the sucrose droplet. If the droplet is not consumed, remove the bumble bee from the experiment.\nBegin video recording after the habituation period. In this study, the proboscis activity was recorded at 26.7 frames/sec-1 with a 25X magnification rate.\n4. Test Phase: Presenting the Test Solution\nFill a 100 µl microcapillary tube with the test solution. Connect it to a piece of silicone tubing (6 cm length, 1 mm inside diameter) and fix it to a micro manipulator.\n\t\nConnect the tubing via a male adapter to another silicone tubing (6 cm length, 4 mm inside diameter), which acts as a pipette bulb.\nPosition the microcapillary tube 5-10 mm away from the holding tube tip. Gently squeeze the tubing to maintain the feeding solution at the tip of the microcapillary tube.\nAfter the bumble bee consumes the sucrose droplet, immediately remove the syringe containing the 500 mM sucrose solution.\nBegin the 2 min test phase when the bumble bee's proboscis contacts the solution inside the microcapillary tube.\n\t\nTo control for possible evaporation, fill two additional microcapillary tubes with sucrose or water and manipulate it exactly as during the test phase.",
    "Before and after each trial scan the liquid levels inside the microcapillary tube using a scanner at 600 dpi to measure the amount of food consumed (Figure 4A).\n5. Image Analyses\nDetermine the volume of solution consumption using ImageJ (version 1.48), an image processing software.\n\t\nUpload the image file and zoom into the image (~400%). To set the reference scale, select the straight line tool and draw a line between the two ends of the microcapillary tube. Select 'Analyze' then 'Set Scale'. Input the total length of the tube under 'Known distance' and the corresponding unit under 'Unit of length'.\nSelect the straight line tool again and draw a line between the two ends of the liquid level. Select 'Analyze' then 'Measure'. In the results window the length of the liquid is given under the 'Length' column.\nCalculate the volume of solution consumption by using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54233/54233eq1.jpg\n\twhere imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54233/54233eq2.jpg is the length of the microcapillary tube and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54233/54233eq3.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54233/54233eq4.jpg are the measured lengths of the liquid inside the microcapillary tube before and after the test phase, respectively.\n6. Video Analyses\nScore the feeding behaviors during the 2 min testing phase of each video using an event logging software (See Materials Table).\n\t\nAt first, define the feeding behaviors (i.e. the elements) in the behavioral classes menu of the recording software. The feeding behaviors are as followed: (1) proboscis out/contact: the proboscis extends and is in contact with the solution inside the microcapillary tube (2) proboscis out/no contact: the proboscis extends and is not in contact with the solution inside the microcapillary tube, (3) proboscis stowed: the proboscis is not extended but instead stowed under the head and (4) out of sight: the bumble bee is out of the video frame.",
    "Set each behavior as a 'state' and 'mutually exclusive' in the properties menu and make continuous recordings for a 2 min interval. Replay the videos in slow-motion mode (2 times slower) for more precision.\nMeasure the speed of proboscis retraction from the test solution after the first contact between two consecutive frames (separated by 37.5 msec in the video recordings shown here) using a motion tracking video software (See Materials Table).\n\t\nUpload the video file and skip to the frame where the proboscis first contacts the solution.\nTo set the reference scale, select the line tool and draw a line on the width of the microcapillary tube in the video frame. Right click on the line and select 'Calibrate measure'. Input the width of the capillary tube and the corresponding unit.\nSelect 'Image' then 'Coordinate system origin'. On the new window click on the tip of the proboscis and select 'Apply'.\nSelect the hand move tool, right click on the tip of the proboscis on the video frame and select 'Track Path'. Move to the next frame and readjust the tracking point to the tip of the proboscis.\nRight click on the tracking point and select 'Configuration'. Select 'Complete Path' and select 'Speed' under measurement. Select 'Apply'. The speed is then displayed."
