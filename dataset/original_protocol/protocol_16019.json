    "This protocol describes the method for de novo labeling of newly synthesized histones and DNA. Cells are grown in appropriate medium containing the methionine analog azidohomoalanine (AHA) and 5-ethynyl-2′deoxyuridine (EdU). Dividing cells incorporate AHA in their newly synthesized proteins including histones. EdU will be incorporated in newly synthesized DNA during the S-phase. In our method we used the hTERT RPE-1 cell line. This cell line was chosen because it is an immortalized nearly diploid cell line from human retinal pigment epithelial cell with an average chromosome number of 46. This feature makes sequencing analysis feasible. The nuclei are being isolated through a simple and fast method using 0.1% of NP-40 in PBS and a few short centrifugation steps.\nMaterials\nRPE-1 cells (hTERT RPE-1, ATCC®, CRL-4000™)\nStandard medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.805#cpz1805-rec-0007])\nGlutaMAX (Gibco, cat. no. 35050-038)\nPenicillin-streptomycin (10,000 U penicillin and 10 mg streptomycin/ml) (Gibco, cat. no. 11548876)\nFetal bovine serum (Serana, cat. no.

Seed four 175-cm2 flasks each with 3 × 106 RPE-1 cells per flask (12 million cells in total) in appropriate (standard) medium. Incubate overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nWe used RPE-1 cells for their nearly diploidy. RPE-1 cells were cultured in DMEM, high glucose, pyruvate, GlutaMAX™, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.",
    "It is important that cells are seeded in such a concentration so that they are still actively dividing (±60% confluency). Check cells for mycoplasma regularly.\n2. Prepare 95% AHA medium by mixing 28.5 ml AHA medium with 1.5 ml standard medium per 175-cm2 flask.\nIt is important to add 5% standard medium (which already contains methionine) to ensure the continuation of cell division.\n3. Aspirate the medium from the cells.\nThere is no need to wash the cells.\n4. Add 9 µl EdU (67 mM stock) to 30 ml of the 95% AHA medium (this results in 20 µM final concentration of EdU) to the cells and incubate for 24 hr at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nThe 24 hr of incubation is based on the doubling time of the cells. In this step, it is possible to add compounds for treatment to your cells. It is advised to pre-mix the medium with the EdU before adding it to the cells. Turn off the light in the flow-cabinet because EdU is light sensitive.\n5. Incubate the cells for 24 hr at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nThe time for one cell division is 24 hr for RPE-1 cells cultured in AHA medium. If you use other cells in your experiment, please check the division time beforehand. Be aware that the division time can change when adding treatment compound.\n6. Aspirate the medium and wash the cells twice, each time with 10 ml PBS.\n7. Add 3 ml Trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37°C until all the cells are detached from the bottom of the flask.\nTrypsinization takes about 5 min. You can check under the microscope whether all the cells have detached.\n8. Quench the trypsin by adding 3 ml standard medium with FBS.",
    "The FBS in the medium quenches the activity of the trypsin\n9. Collect the cells in 50-ml tubes.\nThe cells from four 175-cm2 flasks are collected in one 50-ml centrifuge tube.\n10. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 200 × g at room temperature.\n11. Wash the cells with 5 ml ice-cold PBS and centrifuge again for 5 min at 200 × g at room temperature.\n12. Remove the supernatant and store the pellets at −80°C until further use or continue directly to step 13 to extract the nuclei.\nPellets can be stored at least 4 months at −80°C.\nNuclei extraction\n13. To extract the nuclei, the thawed pellet is resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% NP-40 supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail.\n14. Transfer the cell suspension into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube.\n15. Vortex the cells suspension for 5 sec at maximum speed.\nVortexing at maximum speed will lyse all the cells.\n16. Centrifuge the lysed cell suspension for 5-10 sec at 9000 × g, 4°C, in a benchtop centrifuge.\n17. Discard the supernatant.\nThe pellet contains most nuclei.\n18. Resuspend the nuclei in 1 ml ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% NP-40 and supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail.\nIn this step, the nuclei are being washed.\n19. Centrifuge the washed nuclei for 5-10 sec at 9000 × g, 4°C, in a benchtop centrifuge and discard the supernatant.\n20. Store the nuclei at −80°C until further use.\nThe nuclei can be stored at −80°C for at least 4 months.",
    "In this second protocol we describe the first click reaction performed on isolated nucleosomes. During the incubation with AHA in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.805#cpz1805-prot-0001], newly synthesized proteins have incorporated the unnatural methionine analog. This molecule contains an azide moiety, which is employed in a click reaction to covalently link to a biotinylated alkyne. After the click reaction, the protocol proceeds with an MNase digestion of the nuclei to obtain mononucleosomes. It is important to optimize the MNase concentration per cell type and per cell density in order to avoid over digestion or under digestion (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.805#cpz1805-fig-0002]). After digestion, the mono-nucleosomes can diffuse out of the nuclei where they are captured in a streptavidin pull-down with magnetic beads, which enables enrichment of intact newly synthesized nucleosomes.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a6a073ff-7347-45e5-b136-564f773fe957/cpz1805-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nRepresentative image of nucleosome digestion by the MNase enzyme. Increasing concentration of MNase results in different DNA fragments size. In lanes 1-2 are shown fragments of 450 bp corresponding to trinucleosomes.

    "The MNase reaction is quenched by the addition of EDTA and cooling on ice.\n13. Add 100 µl wash buffer.\n14. Spin down 5-10 sec at 10,000 rpm to pellet the nuclei and store the supernatant in a new 1.5-ml microtube. Discard the pellet.\nThe supernatant will contain the mono-nucleosomes, which diffuse out of the nuclei.
