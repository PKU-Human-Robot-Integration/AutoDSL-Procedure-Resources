    "Construction of the introducing DNA fragmentOverview of the construction: PCR-amplified DNA fragments (Upstream and Downstream of homologous regions for the genome-specific locus) and StuI-digested pMKT (including two fragments Digested vector L and S) are connected using the In-fusion system to generate the pMKT-UPandDOWN. The resultant plasmid is used as the template DNA for amplification of the introducing DNA fragment by PCR (Figure 2).PCR amplification of DNA fragments (Figure 2A):Specific primer sets are designed as given below to amplify the DNA fragments (500-1,500 bp each) for homologous recombination to the genome-specific locus. Upstream and Downstream DNA fragments do not need to share the same length. For tagging, the upstream DNA fragment should include an open reading frame devoid of the termination codon, which is fused in frame to the epitope tag. Each colored region (20 bp) is the homologous sequence of the end of relevant StuI-digested pMKT (The colors correspond to Figure 2A) and each repeated ‘Ns’ (20-25 bp) indicates the annealing sequence to amplify the Upstream and Downstream DNA fragments. The Tm of the annealing sequence (‘Ns’) of each primer should be designed to be above 63 °C.Upstream Forward (UF):5’-GACACGTGAATTTAAATAGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3’Upstream Reverse (UR):5’-TGAAAATAAAGATTTTCAGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3’Downstream Forward (DF):5’-AGGGATTGTGGCGCGACAGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3’Downstream Reverse (DR):5’-GACACGTGAATTTAAATAGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3’PCR reactions are carried out using KOD-Plus-Neo DNA polymerase under the following reaction conditions: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s/1 kb at 68 °C, and a final extension of 2 min/1 kb at 68 °C with specific primers sets (UF/UR for Upstream and DF/DR for Downstream) and 50 ng wild type C. merolae DNA as a template. PCR-amplified DNA fragments are purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System following the manufacturer’s protocol, and the concentration of DNA is measured.Note: We routinely obtain reproducible amplification results by the above condition.",
    "The PCR results should be checked by gel electrophoresis to confirm the amplification.pMKT vector digestion by StuI to obtain two DNA fragments, here named Digested vector L (Long, approximately 3.6 kbp) and S (Short, approximately 3.0 kbp, Figure 2B)Incubate 1 μg of pMKT DNA in 50 μl 1x CutSmart Buffer (i.e., provided buffer of StuI) containing 10 units of StuI at 37 °C for 1 h.Add 100 μl of dH2O and 150 μl of Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol = 25:24:1 solution and mix vigorously. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Take 150 μl of supernatant and add 15 μl of 3 M sodium acetate and 375 μl of 100% EtOH. Mix vigorously and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant, add 75% EtOH to the precipitate, and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant, completely remove the remaining drops by pipette after flush centrifugation, and air dry the pellet briefly on the bench at room temperature. Then add 20 μl of dH2O and dissolve the precipitated DNA. Measure the DNA concentration.Note: When using phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, personal protective equipment needs to be used according to local health and safety regulations. Always work under a fume hood.In-fusion reaction to generate the template plasmid (Figure 2C)Gently mix 5 μl of DNA mixture [StuI-digested pMKT (Digested vector L and S):upstream:downstream ≈ 100 fmol:50 fmol:50 fmol] and 5 μl of 2x In-fusion reaction mix. Incubate the reaction mixture at 50 °C for 15 min and then cool it down on ice.Transform Escherichia coli DH5α with the reaction mixture by using a chemical transformation method as common use. Find the expected plasmid construct by colony PCR.",
    "PCR reactions are carried out using GoTaq DNA polymerase under the following reaction conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 1 min/1 kb at 72 °C, and a final extension of 2 min at 72 °C with primers sets (Forward primer for up: 5’-CGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGC-3’/Reverse primer for up: 5’-GATCTAGTAACATAGATGACACCGC-3’ for the upstream sequence, and Forward primer for down: 5’-GCTGCTAGGGATTGTGGCGCGA-3’/Reverse primer for down: 5’-CCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCC-3’ for the downstream sequence). Subsequently, the positive candidates are examined by DNA sequence analysis with primer sets for colony PCR. Extract and purify the plasmid DNA (pMKT-UPandDOWN).Amplification of DNA for transformation by PCR to prepare the linearized DNA fragment and completely remove the template circular plasmid DNA (Figure 2D)Note: Inclusion of the template plasmid DNA frequently may result in random integration of the plasmid into the genome. Thus, the template plasmid DNA should be carefully removed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190328/20190328225057_3794.jpgFigure 2. Overview of the template vector (pMKT-UPandDOWN) and DNA constructs for transformation. A. DNA regions (Upstream and Downstream) corresponding to the target gene are amplified by PCR with the specific primer sets having the 20 bp homologous sequence for the pMKT (shown as red, blue, green and yellow). B. Digestion of the pMKT vector with StuI enzyme generates 2 DNA fragments named Digested vectors L and S after their lengths (L-long; S-short). The red hatched areas indicate the homologous repeat sequence (i.e., URA5.3 terminator region). C.

    "PCR is carried out as described in Step A2 with the specific primer sets (Upstream Forward: UF and Downstream Reverse: DR) and pMKT-UPandDOWN as the template. To digest the plasmid DNA, treat the amplified PCR mix with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. Purify the specific band using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System after 1.2% agarose electrophoresis (applying a voltage of 100V for 30 min). Prepare 2-5 μg of DNA fragments for transformation in 40 μl of dH2O.Transformation of C. merolae cellsTransform the C. merolae T1 cells following the polyethylene glycol-mediated protocol as described by Ohnuma et al. (2008) and Fujiwara and Ohnuma (2018).When OD750 reaches ~10, dilute the cell culture in 50 ml MA2 medium to yield an OD750 of 0.4 and cultivate in the glass cylinders (3 cm in diameter and 35 cm in length) with cotton plug bubbled with 2% CO2 in air under constant light (20 μmol photons m-2 s-1) at 40 °C for 20-24 h.Harvest the cells (OD750 < 0.7) by centrifugation (1,200 x g, for 5 min at 40 °C), and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet with 200-300 μl of MA2 medium.Combine 2-5 μg of the DNA fragment in 40 μl of dH2O and 60 μl of DNA solution (see Recipes).Add 25 μl of the resuspended cells to the tube and mix gently.Add 125 μl of the PEG solution (see Recipes) immediately and mix the liquid by gently pipetting 4-5 times using the 200 μl pipette.Transfer the mixture to 30-40 ml of MA2 medium and incubate under the same condition as described in Step E1 for 20-24 h.",
    "Harvest the cultured cells by centrifugation (1,200 x g, for 5 min at 40 °C) and spread the cells onto the MA2 solid gellan gum plate without uracil and 5-FOA by the top starch method to increase the plating efficiency (Takemura et al., 2019). Incubate the plate at 40 °C supplemented with 5% CO2 in AnaeroPack with AnaeroPouch. After 2-4 weeks, colonies will appear on the surface of the MA2 solid gellan gum plate.Pick up well-separated colonies (usually 20-24 candidates) using sterilized toothpicks, and inoculate 2 ml of MA2 liquid medium prepared in a 24-well tissue culture test plate.After incubation for 1-2 weeks in the same incubator without agitation, harvest the 20-24 candidate colonies and extract the DNA as described below (Kobayashi et al., 2010). To select the positive transformants, perform the PCR with the DNA using the ‘‘Confirmation primer sets’’ to anneal to the outside sequence of the homologous regions used to introduce the DNA fragment (Figure 3). PCR reactions are carried out using KOD-Plus-Neo DNA polymerase under the following reaction conditions: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s/1 kb at 68 °C, and a final extension of 2 min/1 kb at 68 °C.DNA extraction from C. merolae cellsHarvest C. merolae cells by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, and discard the medium.Resuspend the cell pellets with 400 μl of DNA extraction buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Sodium dodecyl sulfate].Add 400 μl of neutralized phenol.Incubate at 65 °C for 10 min with shaking every 2 min by hand vigorously.Note: A vortex should not be used. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Transfer 375 μl of the above aqueous phase into a fresh tube, and add 375 μl of PCI (neutralized phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol = 25:24:1). Invert the tube by hand vigorously.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Transfer 350 μl of the above aqueous phase into a fresh tube, and add 350 μl of PCI. Invert the tube by hand vigorously.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Transfer 300 μl of the above aqueous phase into a fresh tube, and add 30 μl of the 3 M sodium acetate and 750 μl of 100% ethanol. Invert the tube by hand vigorously.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and add 200 μl of 75% ethanol.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and let the liquid evaporate completely.Dissolve the precipitate of DNA in distilled water.Note: When using phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, personal protective equipment needs to be used according to local health and safety regulations. Always work under a fume hood.Elimination of URA5.3 gene marker from the genomeThe transformant cell using URA5.3T as a gene selectable marker is cultured in 50 ml of MA2 medium until the OD750 reaches 0.5-5.0.Centrifuge 50 ml of the culture at 1,200 x g for 5 min at 40 °C.Discard the supernatant, add 1.5 ml of MA2 medium and resuspend the precipitated cells.Add 1 ml of the top starch solution (Takemura et al., 2019) to 1 ml of the cell suspension, mix gently, and spread onto the MA2 solid gellan gum plate containing 0.5 mg/ml uracil and 0.8 mg/ml 5-FOA. Add 1 ml of MA2 medium to the remaining cell suspension.",
    "Take 1 ml of the diluted cell suspension, and spread onto the MA2 solid gellan gum plate as in Step F4. After 2-4 weeks, the colonies of the URA5.3 eliminated cells appear on the MA2 solid gellan gum plate.Pick up well-separated colonies (usually 20-24 candidates) using sterilized toothpicks, and inoculate each in 2 ml of MA2 liquid medium prepared in 24-well tissue culture test plate.After incubation for 1-2 weeks in the same incubator, extract DNA from each green colored inoculate as described in Step E10. To confirm URA5.3 elimination, perform the PCR with the DNA using the “Confirmation primer sets” to anneal to the outside sequence of the homologous regions used to introduce the DNA fragment as described in Step E10 (Figure 3).After confirmation of URA5.3 elimination by PCR, the strain is ready for the next transformation experiment using URA5.3T as a gene selectable marker.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190328/20190328225200_5540.jpgFigure 3.
