    "Patients provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board at the University of Gothenburg.\n1. Anesthesia\nSet up all the monitoring (ECG, blood pressure cuff) 17.\nInsert an epidural catheter in the lower to mid thoracic level 17.\nInduce anesthesia with Propofol 2 mg/kg, 150 µg of Fentanyl, and Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg through a previously inserted peripheral venous catheter.\nPreoxygenate and intubate the patient. Maintain anesthesia with Sevoflurane, oxygen and air 17.\nInsert a double lumen central venous catheter and an arterial catheter. Monitor CVP and arterial pressure 17.\n2. Isolation of the Liver and Cannulation of Vessels\nAdminister 100 IE/kg of heparin and give antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., 160 mg of Trimethoprim and 800 mg of Sulfamethoxazole).\nUsing the percutaneous Seldinger technique, place a 17 Fr catheter in the femoral vein and a 15 Fr catheter in the external jugular vein 18. Verify the positions of the catheters by fluoroscopy.\nPerform a laparotomy by an L-shaped incision from the xiphoid process down the midline and then extended to a right subcostal incision 19.\nVerify that no extra-hepatic metastases exist in the abdomen by a complete inspection and palpation.\n\t\nIf any suspicious lesions are found, verify malignancy by frozen section.\nTerminate the procedure if there is evidence of extrahepatic manifestation (periaortal adenopathy, abdominal metastases). Lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis is not considered a contraindication. \nMobilize the liver by dividing the falciform ligament, the left and right triangular ligament and the coronary ligament 19.\nDissect the caval vein beginning from the renal veins up to the diaphragm with ligation of retroperitoneal tributary veins.\nIdentify the right adrenal vein and place a vessel loop around it.",
    "Identify the right gonadal vein. Dissect it for 5-10 cm. Place a purse-string suture around the entrance to the caval vein.\n\t\nPlace a ligature distally on the gonadal vein. Using scissors, open the gonadal vein 3-5 cm from the caval vein.\nInsert an 18 Fr wire-reinforced catheter through the right gonadal vein and place the tip retrohepatically above the renal veins.\nPlace a ligature around the gonadal vein to secure the position of the catheter.\nVerify the return of blood through the catheter. Heparinize the catheter 18. \nDissect the hepatoduodenal ligament and visualize the common hepatic artery, the gastroduodenal artery and the proper hepatic artery.\n\t\nPlace vessel loops around the common hepatic artery and the gastrodoudenal artery.\nDissect the portal vein and place a vessel loop around it.\nIsolate the rest of the ligament containing the common bile duct and include all of this in a vessel loop. \nLift the gastroduodenal artery with the vessel loop. After interrupting the arterial inflow, make an incision using scissors.\n\t\nInsert an 8-12 Fr catheter with its tip into the proper hepatic artery. Secure the position with a ligature around the gastroduodenal artery.\nVerify blood return in the catheter and then heparinize it 18.\nPrime the perfusion system with one unit of packed erythrocytes, 100 ml of albumin (50 g/L), 100 ml of Tribonat (sodium bicarbonate), 2500 units of heparin (5,000 IE/ml) and 250 ml of crystalloids.\nConnect the arterial and the caval vein catheters to the perfusion system consisting of a heart lung machine equipped with a roller pump and a heater together with a venous reservoir, oxygenator and tubing systems of disposable type.\nConnect the femoral and external jugular catheters to the venovenous bypass pump consisting of a centrifugal pump, along with a heater unit and start bypass.",
    "Complete the isolation of the liver by tightening a Rumel tourniquet around the caval vein infrahepatically above the renal veins and clamping the caval vein suprahepatically using a Klintmalm vascular clamp.\n\t\nTighten a Rumel tourniquet around the common bile duct, the portal vein and the right adrenal vein and finally clamp the hepatic artery using a vascular clamp.\n3. The Perfusion\nStart the perfusion and manually monitor the blood level in the venous reservoir. Adjust the flow rate until a steady-state level is reached, usually a flow rate between 500-1,200 ml/min.\nPlace thermistor probes into the right and left liver lobes and one directly into the arterial catheter.\nHeat the perfusate aiming at a target liver temperature of 40 oC. Keep this temperature throughout the perfusion.\nPlace a scintillation probe over the venovenous bypass pump head.\nCalibrate the leakage monitoring system, by injecting a small dose of 10 MBq 99mTc-albumin (1 ml) into the systemic circulation and register the baseline activity.\n\t\nInject a ten-fold higher dose, 100 MBq 99mTc-albumin (1 ml), into the hepatic perfusion unit.\nRecord any leakage from the perfusion system to the systemic circulation as an increase in activity measured by the scintillation probe.\nRecord any leakage from the systemic circulation to the perfusion system as an increase in volume in the venous reservoir. \nWhen steady-state of the flow rate is established, no leakage is present and the liver temperature has reached 40 °C, inject melphalan at a dose of 1 mg/kg bodyweight into the perfusion system divided into two doses given 30 min apart.\n4. End the Perfusion and Remove Catheters\nAfter 60 min of perfusion, empty the perfusate from the system and irrigate the liver with 1,000 ml of crystalloid.",
    "Add one unit of packed erythrocytes to the perfusion unit, infuse into the liver and then stop the perfusion.\nRelease the Klintmalm clamp and the Rumel tourniquet from the caval vein.\nRelease the Rumel tourniquet from the hepatoduodenal ligament.\nRemove the ligature from the gastroduodenal artery. Remove the catheter and ligate the vessel.\nRelease the clamp from the hepatic artery.\nRemove the catheter from the gonadal vein and ligate the vessel.\nStop the veno-venous bypass pump and disconnect the tubes.\nClose the abdomen with an uninterrupted fascial suture and then an intracutaneous skin suture.\nRemove the catheters in the femoral and external jugular veins and apply local pressure for 5 min.\n5. Postoperative Care\nExtubate the patient and transfer to postoperative care unit for 24 hr. Keep monitoring central venous pressure and arterial blood pressure.\nTransfer the patient to a surgical department for a typical of 3-7 days of post-operative care.\nContinue with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at a dose of 5,000 IE/day for a total of 4 weeks.\nSubscription Required.
