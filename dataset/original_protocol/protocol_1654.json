Vortex dissolved reagents to ensure proper mixing following thawing. Reagents may be frozen/thawed multiple times without detriment.\nThe acrylate backbone is created through mixing of the acrylate and alkanolamine monomers at a determined molar ratio. The molar ratio for a sample vector (POLY2) is as follows: 1.05:0.7:1. This equates to a mass ratio of 349.5:434.3:100 mg. The required mass of each component is calculated using equation 1. Here, V5 (Di(trimethylolpropane) tetraacrylate) is used in the example calculation:\n   M  V 5    ( mass )  =    X  V 5    MW  V 5   ∗  M  Scaled, S 3      X  S 3    MW  S 3      \nXV5 = molar ratio of V5 (0.7), MWV5 = molecular weight of V5 (466 g/mol), XS3 = molar ratio of S3 (1), MWS3 = molecular weight of S3 (75.11 g/mol), MScaled,S3 = scaled mass of S3 (100 g).\nNote: This equation may be used to calculate the required masses of all other components in the backbone through substitution of the respective mass ratios and molecular weights. The final scaled mass of S3 (3-amino-1-propanol) may be chosen as desired. Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] lists mass ratios used during synthesis of respective POLYseq vectors.\nAdd all backbone components (acrylate monomers and alkanolamine) into glass vial with suitable airtight cap. 12 x 75 mm borosilicate glass culture tubes with corresponding polypropylene (PP) plastic caps may be used.\nCaution: Take care if using Polystyrene (PS) caps as DMSO may react with the cap.",
    "Mix the monomers either by pipetting or through vortex mixing for 30 s to achieve homogeneity. Vortex mixing is recommended. Inhomogeneity may be visually observed by the presence of fine stratified layers.\nHeat the mixture in an oil or sand bath affixed to a temperature controllable hotplate at 90°C for 20 h.\nNote: After 20 hours, an aliquot may be directly taken from the synthesis tube and dissolved in deuterated DMSO (DMSO-d6) for optional 1H NMR. Adjust the volume added in Step 5 accordingly.\nNote: Uncapped POLYseq backbone will show NMR peaks at δ 6.2–5.6 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Successful capping will eliminate these resonant peaks (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). 1H NMR was acquired on a Bruker Ascend 600 MHz spectrometer. Acquisition may be easily acquired on spectrometers with other operational frequencies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1213-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Typical 1H NMR (d6-DMSO with 0.03% v/v TMS, 600 MHz) spectrum form acquisition of uncapped POLYseq (backbone)\n1H NMR spectrum demonstrates resonance at δ 6.2–5.6 from terminal acrylate groups (a) and POLY2 (Capped) showing absence of terminal acrylate groups following successful capping (b).\nAdjust the hotplate to 50°C, remove backbone from hot bath.\nAllow the backbone to cool to 25°C and add respective amount of desired caping agent dropwise while vortex mixing. The mass capping ratio of POLY2 is 100:75 (backbone:cap). For the above example in Step 6, this equates to 662.8 mg of spermine (MC2) and is calculated using the summed masses of D8 (MD8), V5 (MV5), and S3 (MS3) in equation 2.\n   M  C 2    ( mass )  =  (  M  D 8     + M   V 5     + M   S 3   )  ∗  75 100",
    "Heat the mixture at 50°C for 24 h after addition of capping agent to generate the final capped POLYseq vector. An aliquot may be directly taken from the synthesis tube after 24 h and dissolved in deuterated DMSO for optional 1H NMR.\nThe final POLYseq concentration is 200 mg/mL in DMSO if all starting reagents were initially dissolved in DMSO at 200 mg/mL. Directly dissolve capped POLYseq in 25 mM HEPES, pH = 7.4 at a final concentration of 10 mg/mL to achieve the working solution (50 μL DMSO stock in 950 μL HEPES buffer). Working solution can be further diluted with 25 mM HEPES buffer if desired.\nOptional: DyLight NHS Ester may be conjugated to 10 mg/mL working solution by the addition of 1 μL of DyLight NHS stock solution to each 100 μL of 10 mg/mL POLYseq working solution. Vortex unconjugated POLYseq during addition of DyLight NHS Ester. Maintain POLYseq at 20°C–25°C in the dark for 30 min following DyLight NHS Ester addition to complete conjugation. Aliquot as desired and freeze unused POLYseq at −20°C.\nNote: Other NHS Ester dyes may be conjugated to POLYseq but may require optimization of conjugation conditions.\nNote: POLYseq vectors may be stored directly in DMSO at −20°C without detriment to performance for longer than one year. Vectors can be directly dissolved in 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH = 7.4 at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml and stored at −20°C. Binding ability of vectors should be checked by agarose gel electrophoresis if vectors are stored dissolved in HEPES buffer for longer than six months.\nNote: Free induction decay (FID) files generated by NMR by be loaded into an academic licensed version of TopSpin (Bruker) for free.",
    "Critical: Ensure the correct hot bath temperature prior to backbone synthesis and capping. Ensure homogeneous mixing during synthesis and dropwise addition of the capping agent.\nPause point: POLYseq stock solution may be stored in DMSO at −20°C for longer than one year.\nTesting POLYseq barcode binding performance\nTiming: [1 h, 30 min]\nThis section checks the ability for POLYseq vectors to bind and retain ssDNA barcodes following synthesis using agarose gel electrophoresis. Optional DyLight conjugation may be tested using electrophoresis and a gel imaging station with fluorescent capability.\nCreate a 2.5 % agarose gel by dissolving 2.5 grams of agarose, low electroendoosmotic (EEO) in 100 mL of TAE buffer (0.5× concentration).\nFollowing heating to dissolve agarose, add 10 μL of 10,00× SYBR Safe stock solution prior to casting the gel. A BioRad gel station with a 20-well comb setup was used for casting. Alternate casting stations may be used.\nPOLYseq vectors may be examined at a range of mass ratios (w/w). A w/w of 10 indicates 10 μg of POLYseq for 1 μg ssDNA barcode. For synthesis of POLY2, w/w ratios of 0, 2, 5, 10, 20 may be used. If imaging DyLight conjugated POLYseq, skip every other well. w/w = 0 corresponds to a control well without POLYseq (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1213-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Dilute 10 mg/mL POLYseq solutions to 2 mg/mL with 25 mM HEPES.\nCreate a 1 mg/mL (1 μg/μL) solution of ssDNA barcode in 25 mM HEPES.\nFor select w/w ratios, set up the following conditions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1213_4.csv\nWait 10 min following mixing and add 2.3 μL of loading dye without SDS\nNote: Take care to use loading dye without SDS as SDS interferes with POLYseq/barcode binding.\nOptional: If testing DyLight conjugation, create a control solution of free DyLight by pipetting 1 μL of stock DyLight solution into 500 μL of HEPES buffer. This is the DyLight Control Solution in the following table. The following control (C) mixes may be made for observation of migration of unconjugated DyLight along with unbound ssDNA for juxtaposition against POLYseq vectors mixed in step 10c:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1213_5.csv\nLoad mixtures into cast agarose gel and run at 100 V for 30 min. If using DyLight control wells (C), a migrating dye band will be visible. Correctly conjugated POLY2 should show ssDNA barcode retained within loaded wells beginning at a mass ratio of 10×.\nImage ssDNA barcode migration using a ChemiDoc MP or similar gel station capable of imaging SYBR safe.\nIf imaging DyLight conjugated POLYseq, image gel with ChemiDoc MP with pre-set fluorescent mode or similar gel station with fluorescent imaging.\nRe-freeze POLYseq working solution and ssDNA aliquots at −20°C. POLYseq working solutions, when dissolved in HEPES, are stable at −20°C for at least 6 months. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nOptional: POLYseq vectors may be conjugated with DyLight fluorescent dyes at a conjugation ratio of 10 μg DyLight-NHS : 1 mg POLYseq.\nNote: Gel images may be loaded into ImageJ for imaging processing and quantification of fluorescent intensity.",
    "Critical: Avoid the use of Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in loading dye during gel electrophoresis. SDS can cause ssDNA to become unbound from POLYseq. Gel Loading Dye, Purple (6×), no SDS offered by New England Biolabs has been successfully used.\nPause point: POLYseq may be stored diluted in HEPES at −20°C without detriment for at least six months.\nPOLYseq single-cell barcoding\nTiming: [1 h]\nSingle cell transcriptomics offers a high-resolution method to investigate transcribed genes in heterogeneous populations (Shalek et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), (Stubbington et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). This section details basic POLYseq barcoding of Hep G2 cells for pooling during 10× single-cell RNA sequencing runs. This protocol is applicable to other cell types and can be run in parallel for the barcoding of other cells. However, specific culture and labeling conditions may need to be tailored for different cell lines/types.\nNote: POLYseq labeling for scRNA-seq has so far only been tested on single-cell suspensions of live cells. Compatibility with cell fixation or organelle isolation methods for scRNA-seq may work but have not been fully verified with the currently published methods.\nCulture Hep G2 cells in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10 % FBS in tissue culture treated 6-well 10 cm dishes at 37°C under 5 % CO2. Split with confluency reaches 70–80%. If recovering cells from frozen stock, allow for at least one passage prior to barcoding to allow for recovery.\nPrepare complexed barcoding vector:\nAdd 1 μg ssDNA barcode to 25 μL Opti-MEM in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 10 μg POLY2 to 25 μL Opti-MEM in a new 1.5 microcentrifuge tube.\nMix (a) into (b) with pipette mixing and allow 10 min for complexation.\nRemove medium from Hep G2 cultures.",
    "Add 1 mL Accutase into each well of a 6-well plate or 3 mL Accutase into one 10 cm dish.\nNote: Other enzymatic or enzyme-free cell dissociating reagent may be used.\nWarm in 37°C cell culture incubator for 5 min.\nGently pipette Accutase solution to dislodge cells from culture dish.\nAdd 1 mL of dissociated cells to 9 mL of MEM + 10 % FBS to quench Accutase.\nSpin cells at 280×g for 3 min to pellet.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant using a vacuum flask or pipette and resuspend cells in 2 mL Opti-MEM for cells harvested from 6-well plates or 5 mL for cells harvested from 10 cm dishes.\nCount number of live cells/mL on Countess II automated cell counter.\nNote: Other methods for counting number of live cells may be used.\nAliquot 1E6 (1×106) number of live cells.\nNote: For successful 10× sequencing runs, cell viability should be at least 70 %.\nSpin aliquoted cells at 400×g for 3 min to pellet.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant using a vacuum flask or pipette and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL Opti-MEM.\nAliquot 10 μL of POLYseq barcoding vector prepared in 2c into a new microcentrifuge tube.\nRemove a 100 μL aliquot (100k cells) and quickly add to the 10 μL aliquot of prepared POLYseq barcoding vector.\nNote: With 1 μg of prepared POLYseq barcoding vector, up to 500k (500 μl) of cells can be barcoded. Volumes can be linearly scaled so that 100 μl of POLYseq barcodes 1E6 (1×106) cells.",
    "Incubate with Hep G2 at 37°C for 5 min. Cell lines with 5 min labeling times have been investigated (Dunn et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). These cells include: mouse ES, 3T3, B16-F10, human ESH9, HUVEC, and MEG-01. DyLight conjugated POLYseq may be used to identify if 5 min of labeling time is sufficient for new cell lines. When running labeled cells on a flow cytometer, single cells should show >95% of cells labeled relative to an unlabeled control.\nDilute cells with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS + 0.2 % FBS.\nSpin cells at 400×g for 3 min.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant using a vacuum flask or pipette and resuspend cells with 1 mL ice-cold PBS + 0.2 % FBS.

In this section, fusion of anterior and posterior gut cultures derived using established protocols is used (Koike et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). This method is applicable to other cell types. Human liver organoids have been successfully stained directly in culture. (Ouchi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), (Koike et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).
