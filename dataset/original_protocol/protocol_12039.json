    "NOTE: Steps describing expansion, differentiation, and transduction of 32D/G-CSF-R cells are presented below.\n1. Preparation\nMedia preparation\nPrepare 250 mL of culture medium: RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (fetal bovine serum) and murine IL-3 (10 ng/mL).\n\t\t\nAlternatively, use home-made IL-3. To produce home-made IL-3, transduce HEK293 cells with IL-3 expressing vector and collect IL-3 containing supernatant22.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Antibiotics, such as penicillin G (100 IU/mL), streptomycin (100 µg/mL), and gentamicin (40 µg/mL), can be used for cell culturing at any step of the protocol unless otherwise stated.\nPrepare 50 mL of differentiation medium: RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and human G-CSF (100 ng/mL).\n\t\tNOTE: (Important) Not all serum batches support differentiation of 32D/G-CSF-R cells. Prior to experiment start test different batches of serum. It is recommended to test at least 4 different batches and select the optimal based on the ability of the 32D/G-CSF-R cells to differentiate. See 32D/G-CSF-R differentiation protocol below.\nPrepare 10 mL of freezing medium: RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 40% FBS, and 10% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide).\nProduction of retrovirus\nPlate a single cell suspension of Bosc23 cells (6 × 106) in a 16 cm Petri dish and cultivate in 18 mL of DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) containing 10% FBS until the confluency of the culture reaches 80 % (24 h).",
    "NOTE: Cells should grow in a monolayer and not form clumps in culture. Cell counting can be performed using different methods (valid for the rest of the protocols presented here). In case of low number of samples, manual counting under the microscope using Bürker chamber is recommended. In this case, use Trypan blue for exclusion of dead cells. Mix cells 1:1 with 0.4% Trypan Blue in PBS. To perform counting of large number of samples, an automatic cell counter can be employed.\nCombine 40 µg of retroviral construct (such as MSCV), 20 µg of pCL-Eco (packaging vector)23, 80 µl of PEI (polyethylenimine), and 2 mL of reduced-Serum medium (e.g. Opti-MEM) medium (without antibiotics). Incubate this mixture for 20 min at room temperature (RT).\nCarefully replace Bosc23 cells medium with 16 mL DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Pre-warm the medium to 37 °C before use.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not use antibiotics during transfection, since it may reduce transfection efficiency.\nAdd the mixture prepared in 1.2.2. dropwise and carefully to the Bosc23 culture, and incubate for 4 h at 37 °C. Limit incubation to less than 6 h due to PEI toxicity.\nAfter incubation, change Bosc23 medium to 18 mL pre-warmed DMEM containing 10% FBS, and cultivate cells for 48 h at 37 °C. Place dishes in a biosafety level 2 laboratory, keep here from this step on, and follow standard safety procedures.\nCollect Bosc23 medium (containing ecotropic retroviral particles) using a 25-mL serological pipette into a 50-mL conical tube, and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: (Important) Transfection efficiency should reach 90% to produce a high titer virus.\nAdd 18 mL pre-warmed DMEM 10% FBS to Bosc23 cells and cultivate for 24 h.\nRepeat step 1.2.6.",
    "NOTE: Retroviral supernatants from 1.2.6 and 1.2.8 can be pooled once they reach the same temperature (4 °C) to preserve viral integrity.\nTo avoid Bosc23 contamination in viral supernatants, spin collected virus at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquot virus, snap freeze using dry-ice or liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C. However, note that freshly prepared virus is of higher quality in terms of infection efficiency than frozen stocks.\n\t\tNOTE: (Important) Avoid repetitive freezing/thawing of virus, since it leads to viral degradation.\nProduction of lentivirus\nPlate a single cell suspension of HEK293T (Human embryonic kidney 293T) cells (6 × 106) in a 16-cm Petri dish and cultivate in 18 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS until the confluency of the culture reaches 80 % (24 h).\n\t\tNOTE: Cells should grow in a monolayer and not form clumps in culture.\nCombine 15 µg of lentiviral construct (such as pGhU6), packaging plasmids pCMVdR8.74 (encoding for gag/pol, 12 µg) and pMD2.VSVG (encoding for VSV-G, 1.4 µg), 85.2 µL PEI, and 2 mL of reduced-serum medium (without antibiotics). Incubate this mixture for 20 min at RT.\nCarefully replace HEK293T medium with 16 mL of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Pre-warm the medium to 37 °C before use. Do not use antibiotics during transfection, since it may reduce transfection efficiency.\nCarefully drop the mixture prepared in 1.3.2 to the HEK293T cell culture and incubate for 4 h at 37 °C. Limit incubation duration to within 6 h to prevent PEI toxicity.\nChange medium to 18 mL pre-warmed DMEM 10% FBS and cultivate cells for 48 h at 37 °C. Place dishes in a biosafety level 2 laboratory, keep here from this step on, and follow standard safety procedures.",
    "Collect HEK293T medium (containing amphotropic lentiviral particles) using a 25-mL serological pipette into a 50 mL conical tube and store it at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: (Important) Transfection efficiency should reach 90% to produce a high titer virus.\nCarefully add 18 mL of pre-warmed DMEM 10% FBS to the HEK293T cells. Cultivate for 24 h at 37 °C.\nRepeat step 1.3.6.\n\t\tNOTE: Lentiviral supernatants from 1.3.6 and 1.3.8 can be pooled once they reach the same temperature (4 °C) to preserve viral integrity.\nTo avoid contamination of viral supernatant with HEK293T cells, spin collected virus at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquot virus, snap freeze using dry-ice or liquid nitrogen, and store it at -80 °C. However, notice that freshly prepared virus is of higher quality in terms of infection efficiency than frozen stocks.\n\t\tNOTE: (Important) Avoid repetitive freezing/thawing of virus, since it leads to viral degradation.\nTitration of virus containing a GFP reporter\nSeed 1 × 105 NIH/3T3 cells in 300 µL of DMEM 10% FBS per well into a 24-well plate. 7 wells will be employed to titer one virus.\nThaw virus at 37 °C and add 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 µL virus to NIH/3T3 cultures. Do not add any virus into negative control well. Cultivate cells in the presence of the virus for 48 h at 37 °C.\nHarvest NIH/3T3 cells using 30 µL of trypsin/EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) (0.25% Trypsin, 0.01% EDTA in PBS) and place cells in 250 µL PBS in a FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) tube.\nDetermine the frequency of GFP+ cells by flow cytometry in each sample24. Exclude dead cells by addition of a viability dye, such as Hoechst 33258.",
    "Calculate the total numbers of GFP+ cells (based on the number of plated cells and percentage of GFP+ cells), and plot them against the volume of virus used for infection.\n\t\tNOTE: (Important) Efficiency of infection reaches a plateau when large viral doses are applied. Therefore, it is important to estimate the titer based on viral concentrations at which infection efficiency occurs in a linear range (example shown in Table 1). The number of GFP+ cells indicates the number of functional viral particles (TU - transforming units) in a given virus volume. Recalculate the number of TU per mL.\nTitration of virus containing a puromycin reporter\nSeed 5 × 104 NIH/3T3 cells in 3 mL of DMEM 10% FBS per well in a 6-well plate; employ 6 wells to titer one virus. Culture overnight at 37 °C.\nNext day dilute virus as indicated in Table 2. To dilute virus, use pre-warmed DMEM 10% FBS. Do not vortex.\nRemove culture medium from NIH/3T3 cells and add 1 mL of diluted virus.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C.\nGently replace the virus-containing medium with 2 mL of pre-warmed DMEM 10% FBS, and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nGently replace NIH/3T3 medium with 2 mL of pre-warmed DMEM 10% FBS containing puromycin (2 µg/mL).\nCulture at 37 °C and carefully refresh medium with puromycin every 3 days or when medium turns yellow.\nAt 10-12 days after infection, aspirate medium from each well and wash gently with PBS.\nStain with 1 mL of crystal violet solution (0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol and dH2O), 2 min at RT, and wash carefully with PBS twice.\nCount blue colonies present in each well under a microscope (magnification X4). No colonies should be observed in the negative control well.\nCalculate the total numbers of TU/mL considering the dilution factor.",
    "2. Expansion and maintenance of 32D/G-CSF-R cells\nIf 32D/G-CSF-R cells are frozen, take an aliquot and thaw cells in a 37 °C water bath for 1 min and pour cells from the vial directly into 10 mL of pre-warmed RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a 15-mL tube. Invert the tube 3 times and spin the cells down at 400 × g. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in IL-3 containing culture medium at a concentration of 0.3 × 106 cells/mL.\nOptimal cell growth concentration is 0.25-0.5 × 106 cells/mL. Split cells every 2 days bringing them to a concentration of 0.1-0.2 × 106 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: (Important) 32D/G-CSF-R cells may partially lose their ability to differentiate if grown to concentrations higher than 1 × 106 cells/mL. Therefore, it is very important to split 32D/G-CSF-R cells on time.\nAs needed, freeze and store cell aliquots for long periods of time at -80 °C or in liquid nitrogen. Spin down 3 × 106 cells, remove supernatant, and resuspend in 1 mL of freezing medium. Place tube in a freezing container at -80 °C. For long term storage, reposition cells to liquid nitrogen.\n3. Transduction of 32D/G-CSF-R cells\nPlate 32D/G-CSF-R cells into 6-well plate at a concentration of 0.3 × 106 cells/mL.\nAdd appropriate amount of virus to reach a MOI (multiplicity of infection) between 10 and 40.\n\tNOTE: Higher MOI will result in increased percentage of GFP+ cells as well as higher levels of expression of the gene of interest. Example: To infect 0.3 × 106 cells with a MOI of 10; 3 × 106 TU will need to be added to the 32D/G-CSF-R cells.",
    "Add polybrene to final concentration 8 µg/mL and incubate for 6 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, perform a spin-inoculation procedure: centrifuge at 1200 × g for 90 min at 30 °C in a culturing plate using a swing-bucket rotor, and incubate for 3 h at 37 °C.\nCollect cells, transfer to a 15-mL tube, and spin at 450 × g for 5 min (4 °C).\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend pelleted cells in 6 mL of culture medium, place in a T25 cell culture flask, and culture at 37 °C.\n48 h later, harvest cells and spin them at 450 × g for 5 min (4 °C). Discard the supernatant.\nIn case of a GFP reporter: place cells in 500 µL of PBS and sort GFP+ cells using a flow cytometry sorter. In case of a puromycin reporter containing vector: place cells in culture medium containing 2 µg/mL of puromycin.\nExpand cells as needed for further analysis and experiments.\n\tNOTE: (Optional) Transduced cells can be frozen in freezing media in a freezing container at -80 °C, and further stored in liquid nitrogen.\n4. 32D/G-CSF-R cell proliferation assay\nTo assess proliferation rate place 0.2 × 106 cells in 1 mL of culture medium and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nNext day count number of cells and dilute them back to a concentration of 0.2 × 106 cells/mL using culture medium. Incubate overnight at 37 °C. Keep records of cell concentrations and dilutions applied to the daily cultures using Table 3.\nRepeat step 4.2 for as many days as proliferation needs to be assessed.",
    "NOTE: The length of the proliferation assays will depend on the effect of the gene of interest. In case of a strong phenotype, 8-9 days might be sufficient to observe a significant effect (See Figure 3A). However, in case of a mild phenotype, longer periods of time might be required.\nAssess cell growth by making a proliferation curve as indicated in Table 3.\n5. 32D/G-CSF-R cell differentiation assay\nWash 0.2 × 106 32D/G-CSF-R cells twice with RPMI medium without cytokines.\n\tNOTE: The washing steps before addition of G-CSF into the culture are important, since presence of residual IL-3 may inhibit differentiation.\nPlace cells in 1 mL differentiation medium (containing 100 ng/mL G-CSF) in a 24 well/plate, resulting in a cell concentration of 0.2 × 106 cells/mL (Day 0). Culture overnight at 37 °C.\nCount number of cells/mL as indicated above (step 1.2.1).\nCytospin 2-5 × 104 cells on a glass slide (76 mm X 26 mm) using a centrifuge with necessary adaptors at 20 × g.\nRefresh differentiation medium and plate cells at a concentration of 0.2 × 105 cells/mL on a 24 well/plate (Day 1). Discard the old plate, and proceed next day with step 5.6 with the new plate.\nOn days 2 to 7, repeat steps 5.3 to 5.5. Assess cell proliferation in the presence of G-CSF as described in step 4.\n\tNOTE: (Important) During differentiation, cell proliferation slows down, therefore after 3 to 4 days in the presence of G-CSF it is adequate to culture cells at higher concentrations.\nAssess differentiation state of 32D/G-CSF-R cells based on cell morphology.\n\t\nFix cells from step 5.4 in methanol for 5 min at RT and leave slides to air-dry.",
    "NOTE: Slides from Day 0 to 7 can be stored at RT, and fixed simultaneously. Similarly, they can also be kept at RT for longer periods after fixation.\nStain cells using May-Grünwald Giemsa staining following manufacturer's protocol.\nVisualize stained cells using a microscope and magnification X40.\nQuantify number of blasts, intermediately differentiated cells, and mature granulocytes using illustrative pictures on Figure 1 and description in Table 4.\nSubscription Required.
