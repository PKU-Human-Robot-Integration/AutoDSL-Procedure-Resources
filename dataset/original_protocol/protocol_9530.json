    "1. Purification of TRIP8b (241-602) Protein\nTransform the plasmid containing TRIP8b (241-602) in the bacterial protein expression vector pGS213 into competent E. coli for protein expression according to manufacturer's instructions. Plate 300 µl of the culture on Luria Broth (LB)-agar with 5 µg/ml of Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 16 h.\nThe next day, pick a single colony to inoculate 50 ml LB with 50 µg/ml of Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin. Incubate the culture at 37 °C for 16 hr (with shaking).\nAdd 50 ml culture to 1 L of LB with 50 µg/ml of Ampicillin. Incubate at 37 °C with shaking.\nOnce the culture has reached an OD600 reading of 0.8-1.2, change the temperature of the incubator to 18 °C and add IPTG (Isopropyl-Beta-D-Thiogalactoside) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Allow protein expression to proceed for 16 hr.\nSpin down the E. coli at 6,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the bacteria. After removing the tubes from the centrifuge, keep the bacteria on ice for the remaining of the procedure. Resuspend the bacteria in 36 ml of Buffer A with 0.25 mM of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).\nSonicate the resuspended bacteria on ice using a flat bolt for 5-10 min, alternating between 30 sec 'on' and 30 sec 'off' at high power.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge for an additional 15 min if the supernatant is not clear yet.\nApply the supernatant to a column of 2 ml Ni-NTA beads. Incubate for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking.\nAllow the unbound material to flow through the column and wash with 500 ml of Buffer A.\nWash the column with 250 ml of Buffer B.",
    "Wash the column with 125 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 5 mM imidazole.\nElute the protein from the column with 20 ml Elution Buffer.\nAdd the eluted protein to a dialysis cassette (Molecular weight cutoff – 10 kDa) using a syringe. Dialyze the protein for 60 min in 4 L of cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) at 4 °C.\nMove the dialysis cassette into a new 4 L bucket of cold PBS. Dialyze protein for 16 hr at 4 oC.\nThe next morning, check the protein concentration using a Coomassie protein assay kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrate the protein using a protein concentrator, following the manufacturer's instructions, if a concentration below 40 μM is observed. Aliquot and freeze at -80 °C for storage.\n2. Small Scale Fluorescence Polarization Assay to Characterize the Interaction of the Two Protein Fragments\nThaw 200 μl of 40 μM TRIP8b (241-602) and add it to a 1.5 ml tube. Add 100 μl of PBS to 11 additional 1.5 ml tubes.\nPerform serial dilutions by transferring 100 μl of TRIP8b (241-602) from the original tube to the next tube in the series, pipetting up and down, and repeating the process. This will produce a 12-point series of 2-fold dilutions of TRIP8b (241-602) ranging from 0.01-40 μM.\nPrepare a 650 μl master mix of 0.1 μM HCN1FITC  (6.5 μl of a 10 μM aliquot) and 2 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) in PBS.\n\tNote: The master mix is 2x.\nSet up 12 new 1.5 ml tubes. Add 50 μl of the master mix containing HCN1FITC to each tube, and then add 50 μl from each of the 12 serial dilutions.\n\tNote: This will generate 12 tubes, each containing 0.05 μM HCN1FITC and half of the concentration of TRIP8b (241-602) from the original serial dilution.",
    "Add the dilution series to an assay plate, 30 μl per well, in triplicate. Use a low binding solid black 384-well plate.\nSpin the plate for 2 min at 900 x g at RT.\nRead the plate using a microplate reader, following the manufacturer's instructions. Measure fluorescence polarization using the following measurement parameters: 485 nm excitation, 530 nm emission, 505 nm dichroic mirror, 100 msec integration time.\nPlot the polarization (mP) values versus the TRIP8b (241-602) concentration on a logarithmic scale. Fit the data with the Hill equation to determine the affinity (Kd) of TRIP8b (241-602) for the labeled HCN1 peptide.\n\t​Note: For preparing the serial dilutions, a multi-well plate can also be used instead of tubes.\n3. Examine the Protein-protein Interaction Using a Positive Control\nAdd 200 μl of unlabeled HCN1 peptide (200 μM) to a 1.5 ml tube. Add 100 μl of PBS to 11 additional 1.5 ml tubes. Perform serial dilutions by transferring 100 μl from the tube containing 200 μl of peptide to the first tube of 100 μl PBS. Repeat the process to generate 12 tubes with 2 fold dilutions of unlabeled HCN1 peptide.\nPrepare a 650 μl master mix of 0.2 μM HCN1FITC and 4 μM TRIP8b(241-602).\n\tNote: This is a 2x solution.\nAdd 50 μl of master mix to 12 new 1.5 ml tubes.\nAdd 50 μl of each serial dilution to a 1.5 ml tube.\nLoad the black 384-well microtiter plate in triplicate, adding 30 μl per well.\nCentrifuge the plate for 2 min at 900 x g at RT.\nRead the plate using a microplate reader capable of FP. Use the same settings as described in step 2.7.",
    "Calculate the affinity of the unlabeled peptide for TRIP8b(241-602) using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: Kd1 = IC50 / (1 + [L]/Kd2), where Kd1 represents the affinity of the unlabeled peptide for TRIP8b(241-602), IC50 is determined in the preceding step and represents the ability of the unlabeled ligand to displace the labeled ligand, [L] is the concentration of the labeled ligand in step 3.2, and Kd2 is the affinity of TRIPb(241-602) for the labeled ligand.\n4. Evaluate Assay Performance (Calculate Z Factor)\nPrepare a master mix by making a 12 ml solution of FP buffer with 2 μM TRIP8b (241-602), 50 nM HCN1FITC, and 1 mM DTT in FP Buffer.\n\tNote: This will require 60 μl of 40 μM TRIP8b (241-602), 60 μl of 10 μM HCN1FITC, and 1,080 μl of FP Buffer.\nAdd 30 μl of the master mix to each well of a black 384-well microtiter plate.\nAdd 1 μl of 1 mM unlabeled HCN1 peptide to 192 wells to serve as a positive control.\nAdd 1 μl of FP buffer to 192 wells to serve as a negative control.\nCentrifuge the plate for 2 min at 900 x g at RT.\nRead the plate using a microplate reader.\nCalculate the Z factor for the assay using the following formula: Z = 1 - 3*(σpos-σneg)/(μneg-μpos) where σpos and σneg are the standard deviations of the positive and negative control wells, and μpos and μneg represent the average signals in the positive and negative control wells.\n5. High Throughput Screen\nThaw aliquots of TRIP8b (241-602) and HCN1FITC and keep them on ice.\nPrepare 10 ml of TRIP8b (2 μM) and HCN1FITC (50 nM) in FP buffer.\nDispense 25 μl of the mixture into each well of a low binding 384-well black microtiter plate using a pipette.",
    "For library screening, add compounds into each well of columns 3 to 22 (40 µM final concentration for each) using an acoustic liquid handler.\n\tNote: Due to the relatively low hit rate observed with this assay, two different compounds were pooled into a single well. The two compounds from each active well were subsequently tested individually to identify which conferred the activity.\nAdd 100 nl of Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into each well of columns 1 and 23 of each plate as negative controls.\nAdd unlabeled HCN1 peptide into each well of columns 2 and 24 of each plate as positive controls.\nIncubate the plates at RT for 2 h. Read plates or incubate at 4 °C for 16 h before reading.\nMeasure fluorescence polarization on a plate reader. Use the same settings as described in step 2.7.\nCalculate percent inhibition by normalizing the signals using the average positive and negative controls from each plate as 100%. Use the equation XN =100% * ((Xneg - X)/(Xneg – Xpos)) where XN is the normalized percent inhibition corresponding to the signal X, Xpos is the average signal from the positive control wells, and Xneg is the signal from the negative control wells.\n6. Confirmation of Hits Using TAMRA-tagged HCN Peptide\nValidate hits with over 50% inhibition using TAMRA-labeled HCN1 peptide (HCN1TAMRA).\n\t\nPrepare a master mix of 12 ml of 2 μM TRIP8b (241-602) and 50 nM HCN1TAMRA in FP buffer.\nDispense 25 μl of the master mix into each well of a black 384-well microtiter plate.\nTransfer serial dilutions of each active compounds into the respective wells. Make two fold dilutions such that the concentration of each hit ranges from 0.2 µM to 200 µM.",
    "For the negative control reactions, transfer 100 nl of DMSO into each well. For the positive control add 100 nl of serially diluted unlabeled HCN1 peptide with final concentration ranging from 200µM to 0.1µM.\nIncubate the plate at RT for 2 hr. Read plates or incubate for 16 h at 4 °C before reading.\nMeasure fluorescence polarization (mP) using the following measurement parameters: 535 nm Excitation; 580 nm emission; 535 nm dichroic mirror, 20 msec integration time.\nCalculate IC50 values by fitting the concentration dependent FP data of each compound using a four-parameter nonlinear regression model23.\n7. Dose-response Validation of Bead-based Proximity Assay\nThaw 1 aliquot of His-tagged TRIP8b (241-602) (His-TRIP8b) and GST-tagged HCN1 (GST- HCN1C40) fusion proteins and keep them on ice.\nCombine His-TRIP8b with GST-HCN1C40 in assay buffer at concentrations of 400 nM His-TRIP8b and 40 nM GST HCN1C40. Prepare 300 µl of the mixture for each compound to be tested.\n\tNote: Compounds are run in triplicate at 11 different concentrations plus a DMSO control (no compound).\nFor control wells, prepare 30 µl of His-TRIP8b (200 nM) without GST-HCN1C40 and then separately prepare 30 µl of GST-HCN1C40 (20 nM) without His-TRIP8b in assay buffer.\nFor each compound to be tested, add 7 μl of the His-TRIP8b:GST-HCN1C40 mixture (prepared in step 7.2 above) to 36 wells of a plate using a 16-channel pipette. For testing a single compound, arrange the 12 different concentrations in rows A-L and the three replicates in columns 1-3. Add 7 µl of the His-TRIP8b solution (prepared in 7.3) to columns 1-3 of row M and 7 µl of GST-HCN1C40 solution (prepared in 7.3) to columns 1-3 of row N. Briefly centrifuge the plate to ensure the liquids are at the bottom of each well and to remove any bubbles.",
    "Dispense the hit compounds to be tested into the plate such that the concentration of each hit ranges from 200 µM (in row A) down to 0.1 µM (in row K). Dispense a volume of DMSO in rows L-N that matches the amount of compound dispensed in rows A-K.\nShake the plate for 2 min and incubate for 2.5 h at RT.\nDilute the anti-GST Acceptor beads 1:50 with assay buffer.\nAdd 3.5 µl of the diluted Acceptor beads to each well of the plate with a 16-channel pipette and mix by gently pipetting to avoid creating bubbles.\nIncubate the plate for 1 hr at RT in the dark.\nDilute the Nickel Chelate Donor beads 1:50 with assay buffer. Do not expose the mixture to light.\nAdd 3.5 µl of the diluted Donor beads to each well of the plate with a 16-channel pipette and mix by gently pipetting to avoid creating bubbles.\nIncubate the plate for 1.5 hr at RT in the dark.\nRead on a plate reader.
