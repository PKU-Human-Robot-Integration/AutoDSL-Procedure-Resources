    "Sulfur master culture reactor (SMCR)The SMCR is maintained to provide consistent and repeatable SOB cultures attached to sulfur particles for the soil toxicity tests.Prepare a 1.3 L SMCR made of acrylic with a working capacity of 0.6 L in an incubator maintained at 38 °C.Place 500 ml of 0.5-2 mm sulfur particles in the SMCR (Figure 1A) filled with 600 ml of synthetic medium (composition is given in Recipes) and maintain at a temperature of 38 °C.Introduce air into the SMCR using a flexible air diffuser and a air pump at a flow rate of 2-3 L/min and operate the reactor in fed-batch mode in the incubator. Influent and the air pump should also be placed in the incubator to maintain the temperature of 38 ± 1 °C.Use 10 ml of aerobic return activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant as the initial inoculum.Feed the SMCR using synthetic medium (38 °C) at a cycle of 5 min (20 ml/min) and 2 h 55 min of batch reaction mode.Alternatively, the SMCR can be operated manually using a 1 L beaker by feeding 100 ml and wasting 100 ml of the medium twice daily.Activity of SOB in the SMCR can be determined by monitoring changes in EC. An increase in EC indicates SOB growth in the SMCR. Before using the SMCR for toxicity tests, it should be operated continuously for more than 5 days in fed-batch mode.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191219/20191219063817_0483.jpgFigure 1. Sulfur master culture reactor (A) and toxicity test vials (B)Soil collectionRemove all the gravel, concrete, and plant debris present at the sampling site.Collect the soil from a depth of 0-30 cm using a shovel or stainless steel spoon.Completely fill the soil samples in labeled containers or bags to remove any headspace and immediately transfer to the laboratory.Pass soil samples through a 2-mm sieve.",
    "Store the sieved sample in tightly sealed plastic containers until used for toxicity tests.Soil toxicity testsPlace 1 g soil samples in 25 ml flat-bottomed glass vials equipped with plastic caps and Teflon-lined rubber stoppers.Add 5 ml NMB medium to the glass vials placed in a water bath set at 38 °C to maintain media temperature of 38 °C (Figure 2A).When the medium temperature reach to 38 °C, carefully transfer 10 g SOB attached sulfur particles into the glass vials kept in the water bath set at 38 °C (Figure 2A).A headspace volume of 15.0 ml is allotted for oxygen (Figure 1B). Purge the headspace with pure oxygen for 6 s.Cap the vials immediately with plastic caps and Teflon-lined rubber stoppers. Immediately transfer these prepared vials into a shaking water bath set at 38 °C and agitate at 90 rpm for 10 min.After that, briefly remove the vials from the shaking water bath. Equilibrate the pressures by inserting a 26 G needle into the Teflon rubber stoppers for 5 s and immediately re-incubate in the shaking water bath.Run two control samples: one control sample with unpolluted soil; the other, without soil (i.e., NMB media and sulfur particles contain SOB).Run the controls and test samples in triplicate. Strictly maintain the temperature (38 °C) throughout the process of sample preparation as SOB activity is temperature dependent.After 6 h incubation and agitation in the shaking water bath, measure oxygen consumption using the lubricated glass syringe method. Briefly, oxygen volume consumed by SOB can be measured by movement of the glass plunger into the syringe’s barrel.",
    "Before measuring the oxygen volume consumed by SOB in each vial, the plunger and the barrel of the glass syringe is lubricated using an aqueous solution comprised of two drops of dish liquid detergent in 100 ml of distilled water. After lubricating the syringe, the plunger is set at the 10 ml mark and the needle is then inserted parallel to the ground through the Teflon rubber stopper into the test vial. The plunger is allowed to move into the barrel of the syringe and equilibrate between the atmospheric pressures. The value on the syringe corresponds to the amount of oxygen consumed by SOB, i.e., a decrease in oxygen in the head space of the test vial (Figure 2B).Note: The amount of oxygen consumption in the water control should exceed 5 ml after 6 h incubation to reliably confirm toxicity in soil.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191219/20191219063724_4548.jpgFigure 2.
