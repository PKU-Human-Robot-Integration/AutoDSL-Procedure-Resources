    "1. Solutions and Materials  \nPrepare isolation vessel solutions: B1, add 1.5 ml of HEPES 1M to 150 ml of HBSS; B2, add 3.6 g of Dextran to 20 ml of B1; B3, add 1 g of BSA to 100 ml of B1.\nModify the filter holder by cutting the bottom off the upper screwing part.\nPrepare immunostaining solutions: Fixation solution, 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4; Permeabilization/blocking solution, dilute goat serum to 5% and Triton X100 to 0.25% in PBS pH 7.4.\n\tNote: Fixation depends on the type of primary antibodies used.\n2. Dissection\nNote: Sterile conditions are not required, unless vessels are used for cell culture purposes.\nPrepare a 150 ml beaker with 20 ml of B1. Keep on ice and cover with parafilm to avoid air contamination.\nDeeply anesthetize the mouse under a hood with a small paper towel soaked in 1 ml of pure Isoflurane that is added into the cage. Anesthesia is verified by a lack of reaction to a toe pinch. Kill the mouse by cervical dislocation.\n\tNOTE: These steps are accomplished in compliance with national and institutional regulations.\nOptional: Perform intracardiac perfusion with 20 ml of PBS 1x to eliminate the blood content24.\nSection the skin with a scalpel from the neck to the nose and pull it away. Remove all contaminating hairs with PBS 1x.\nTo open the skull, first insert scissors anteriorly to the olfactory bulb, and open the scissors to rupture the skull in two parts.\nCarefully remove the brain using a brain spatula. Dissect out the choroid plexus from the lateral ventricles as they would contaminate the blood vessel preparation38.\n\tNOTE: Optional: The final preparation will contain parenchymal and meninges vessels. If not desired, meninges can be peeled off following the procedure described by 38.",
    "Transfer the brain into the beaker containing B1 solution on ice. Up to 8 brains can be treated together.\n3. Brain Tissue Homogenization\nUsing two scalpels, manually and vigorously beat the brain in the B1 solution subsequently obtaining small pieces of about 2 mm.\nHomogenize the preparation with an automatized Dounce homogenizer, performing 20 strokes at 400 rpm. Ensure that the glass tube is maintained in ice and that the upper part of the douncer is in solution when moving up and down, so as to prevent the formation of air pockets. If several samples are prepared, wash the douncer with ionized water between each homogenization.\n4. Vessel Purification\nTransfer the homogenate into a 50 ml plastic tube and proceed to the centrifugation at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. A large white interface (mostly myelin) will form on the top of the vessel pellet (red if no perfusion was performed) .\nDiscard the supernatant. The vessel pellet and the white interface will remain attached together. Add 20 ml of ice-cold B2 solution and shake the tube manually and vigorously for 1 min.\nProceed to the second centrifugation at 4,400 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The myelin will now form a dense white layer at the surface of the supernatant.\nCarefully detach the myelin layer from the tube walls by holding the tube and slowly rotating it to allow the supernatant to pass along the walls. Discard myelin with the supernatant. The pellet containing the vessels remains attached at the bottom of the tube.\nBlot the inside wall of the tube with an absorbent paper wrapped around a 5 ml plastic pipette and remove all residual fluids, avoid touching the vessel pellet. Keep the tube upside-down on an absorbent paper to drain any remaining liquid.",
    "Suspend the pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold B3 solution by pipetting up and down with low-binding tips , keeping the tube on ice, then add another 5 ml of B3 solution. Make sure that vessels are dispersed as much as possible and do not form aggregates.\n5. Filtration\nPrepare a beaker on ice with 30 ml of ice-cold B3 solution. Cover with parafilm to avoid air contamination.\nPlace a 20 µm-mesh filter on a modified filter holder on the top of a becker flask and equilibrate by applying 10 ml of ice-cold B3 solution.\nPour the vessel preparation on the filter and rinse the vessels with 40 ml of ice-cold B3 solution.\nRecover the filter using clean forceps and immediately immerse it in the beaker containing the B3 solution. Detach the vessels from the filter by shaking it gently.\nPour the beaker content in a 50 ml plastic tube and centrifuge at 2,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nNote: Alternatively, the brain vessels’ suspension from step 4.6 can be filtered onto a 100 µm-mesh filter. In this case, larger vessels are preferentially retained on the filter while the flow-through contains microvessels (mainly capillaries), which are then filtered on a 20 µm-mesh filter as above.\nResuspend the pellet of microvessels in 1 ml of ice-cold B3 solution and transfer it by pipetting it into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 2,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n6. Fixation, Permeabilization and Blocking\nTransfer vessels by pipetting into 0.2 ml PCR tubes containing PBS using a 1.0 ml low binding tip. Be careful not touching the vessels as they may adhere to the outside part of the tip. Perform all the following steps under a binocular microscope.",
    "For each of the following medium changes, leave the tubes on ice until the vessels have reached the bottom, and pipette out most of the liquids using long and thing gel-loading pipet tips.\nRemove most of the PBS and add 200 µl of fixative solution. Suspend the vessels by shaking gently and incubate for 20 min at RT.\nPipette out the fixative solution and replace it with 200 µl of 1x PBS (first wash), incubate for 5 min at RT and repeat this step 3 times. Each time, verify that vessels have correctly sunk to the bottom of the tubes and pipette out 1x PBS, ensuring the vessels are not touched.\nAfter the last wash, replace 1x PBS by the permeabilization/blocking solution and incubate 1 hr at RT, resuspending the vessels by shaking gently from time to time.\n7. Immunostaining\nReplace the permeabilization/blocking solution with the mix of primary antibodies (see references of the antibodies used here and dilutions in the Materials template table) diluted in the permeabilization/blocking solution, and incubate at 4 °C O/N.\nAfter 3 washes in PBS at RT, incubate the vessels with the mix of secondary antibodies diluted in PBS for 2 hr at RT.\nNote: we strongly recommend performing nuclear staining with Hoechst (1:2,000) or DAPI (1:2,000) in order to distinguish vessels from possible contaminating hairs or dusts under the microscope.\nAfter 3 washes in PBS, resuspend the vessels in 50 µl of PBS.\n8. Mounting and Observation\nPrepare a tip with a siliconized glass capillary: cut a P200 pipette tip using a scalpel and adjust the capillary inside. The approximate volume of the capillary is 40 μl.\nTransfer the vessels to a glass slide using the siliconized glass capillary and carefully remove the liquid with a piece of absorbent paper.",
    "Apply a single drop of mounting medium onto the vessels and hold a coverslip at 45º allowing the drop to spread along the edge of the slip. Let go off the coverslip and allow medium to spread slowly. Let it dry O/N at RT with protection from light. Vessels can be observed under a fluorescent confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required.
