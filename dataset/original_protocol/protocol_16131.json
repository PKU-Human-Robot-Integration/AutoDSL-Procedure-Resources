    "For generation of a negatively depleted output, the insertional mutant library of U. maydis must be raised, pooled, and infected into its host maize. The following protocol describes the processes of infection and of harvest of the infected maize tissue.\nNOTE: Repeat the procedure for a total of three biological replicates.\nMaterials\nSoil [4:1 mixture of standard potting soil (Einheitserde Werkverband e.V.) with perlite (Granuflor)]\nEarly Golden Bantam (EGB) maize seeds\nNematode (Biohelp) solution (1 g in 3 L water)\nCryopreserved U. maydis insertional mutant library (strain SG200 background genotype; transformed via homologous recombination; Kamper et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-bib-0012]; Uhse et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-bib-0025])\nPotato dextrose–agar plates containing 200 µg/ml hygromycin (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-rec-0003])\nYepsLight liquid medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-rec-0007])\nDouble-distilled water\n0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in double-distilled water\nLiquid nitrogen\n12-cm-diameter round pots\nPhytochamber\n5-ml glass pipets\n48-deep-well liquid culture plates (5-ml well volume, UCT)\n28°C incubator-shaker\n15- and 50-ml Falcon tubes\nRotator\nPhotometer/plate reader\n500-ml centrifuge tube\nStandard tabletop centrifuge\n1-ml syringe (B.

Working in a laminar flow hood is recommended, if possible.\nPotting of maize\n1. Distribute soil in 12-cm-diameter round pots and water pots sufficiently. Seed five EGB maize seeds per pot for a total of >100 seeds per insertional mutant pool replicate. Treat each pot with 100 ml nematode solution for pest control.\n2. Grow maize in a phytochamber under the following conditions: 14-hr/10-hr light/dark cycle at 28°C/20°C with a total light intensity of 183.21 µmol m− s−1.",
    "After 7 days, maize seedlings are ready for infection with the insertional mutant pool.\nGrowth of U. maydis insertional mutant library\n3. Distribute cryopreserved U. maydis insertional mutant library strains on potato dextrose–agar plates containing 200 µg/ml hygromycin using 5-ml glass pipets. Keep individual mutant strains separate by streaking ≤8 strains on designated sectors per plate. Grow at 28°C for 2 to 3 days in the dark.\n4. Inoculate each strain in 2 ml YepsLight liquid medium per well in 48-deep-well liquid culture plates. Grow infection pre-culture overnight in a 28°C incubator-shaker with agitation at 180 rpm.\n5. Inoculate 5 ml YepsLight per 15-ml Falcon tube with pre-culture at a 1:3000 ratio to form infection main cultures. Grow overnight (for 15 hr) at 28°C in a rotator at 20 rpm.\n6. Measure optical density at 600 nm in a photometer/plate reader for each individual mutant strain infection main culture. Adjust the amount of culture to achieve an optical density between 0.6 and 1 for each strain and pool equal volumes of cultures of all mutant strains in a 500-ml centrifuge tube.\n7. Centrifuge 10 min at 2000 × g and discard supernatant by decanting, ensuring removal of all supernatant. Resuspend pellet in double-distilled water to an optical density at 600 nm of 1 by pipetting up and down.\nInfection of U. maydis insertional mutant library in maize seedlings\n8. Using a 1-ml syringe and a 0.45-mm-diameter needle, inject ∼250 µl pooled infection culture into 7-day-old EGB maize seedlings (see step 2) that display three juvenile leaves. Make sure to infect maize seedlings in the center of the leaf whirl by piercing the stem halfway. Infect a total of >100 maize plants with the pool.",
    "9. For the input control, centrifuge 10 ml pooled infection culture in a 15-ml Falcon tube for 1 min at 10,000 × g. Discard supernatant and store pellet at −70°C until isolation of gDNA from the input sample (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-prot-0002]).\nHarvest of infected maize tissue\n10. Grow infected maize seedlings from step 8 for another 7 days in a phytochamber with a 14-hr/10-hr light/dark cycle at 28°C/20°C with a total light intensity of 183.21 µmol m−2 s−1.\n11. Harvest infected second and third maize leaves at a 1-cm distance from the infection site with scissors, making sure to restrict the harvested material to infected tissue. Wash harvested tissue in 0.05% Tween-20 in double-distilled water in a 1-L beaker by stirring on a magnetic stirrer with a magnetic stir bar at 200 rpm for 5 min. Subsequently, wash leaves twice in double-distilled water. Air-dry wet leaves at room temperature before cryopreservation (see steps 12 to 14).\nThe wash steps facilitate removal of any remaining dead insertional mutants located on the leaf epidermis.\n12. Crush dry infected maize tissue in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle.\nFrom now on, cool down all consumables and equipment with liquid nitrogen and avoid thawing of the maize tissue to ensure gDNA integrity.\n13. Using a metal spatula, transfer crushed material into a container compatible with the Laboratory Mixer Mill MM 200 and add three 8-mm-diameter metal balls. Mill samples at 25 Hz for 90 sec. Cool mill container in liquid nitrogen for 60 sec and repeat milling step.\n14. Using a metal spatula, transfer milled maize powder into a 50-ml Falcon tube and store at −70°C until gDNA extraction from the output sample (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-prot-0002]).",

Firstly, gDNA from the input library is required to analyze the composition of the initial insertional mutants. Secondly, the gDNA of the infected material is required to obtain insights about the insertional mutant pool composition after infection.

    "This protocol describes how insertion pool data are analyzed, using the pipeline that we developed (available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/ipoolseq-pipeline[href=http://www.cibiv.at/software/ipoolseq-pipeline]), to find insertional mutants with significantly increased or decreased virulence. Virulence is measured as the abundance of a deletional mutant in the post-infection output pool relative to the pre-infection input and is compared to the virulence of a reference set of known neutral mutants to find significant deviations from neutral behavior.\nNOTE: In the following, commands intended to be entered on a Unix-style terminal, either directly on a Linux machine or via SSH, are printed in a monospaced font. Outside of such commands, filenames are printed monospaced and underlined. Placeholders for names of experiments or libraries that have to be supplied by the user are printed in italic.\nNOTE: iPool-Seq pipeline is based on the workflow engine “snakemake” (Köster & Rahmann, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-bib-0013]). It is thus not strictly necessary to proceed step by step; in particular, jumping to step 13 directly after adding all required data in step 6 will cause all intermediate steps to be executed automatically.

On a workstation running Linux or Windows 10 with WSL, download and install iPool-Seq analysis pipeline by executing\n         \nVER=latest-release\nURL=http://github.com/Cibiv/ipoolseq-pipeline\ncurl -L -O $URL/archive/$VER.tar.gz\ntar xzf $VER.tar.gz\ncd ipoolseq-pipeline-$VER\nYou can also use a web browser to download the latest release from http://github.com/Cibiv/ipoolseq-pipeline/releases[href=http://github.com/Cibiv/ipoolseq-pipeline/releases]. Then, change into the directory containing the downloaded file in a terminal window and continue with the tar command to unpack the archive.\n2. Install and activate our Bioconda (http://bioconda.github.io[href=http://bioconda.github.io]; Grüning et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-bib-0008]) environment, containing all software packages required by pipeline, with\n         \n./install-environment.sh\nsource ./environment/bin/activate\nShould environment.tar.gz fail to download, download that file from http://github.com/Cibiv/ipoolseq-pipeline[href=http://github.com/Cibiv/ipoolseq-pipeline] manually and place it in the folder containing the pipeline.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The environment must be re-activated (but not re-created) whenever you open a new terminal window.",
    "3. Optional: Test for successful installation of library by re-analyzing one of the replicates of Uhse et al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-bib-0025]). To download the raw sequencing data for replicate A1 (data/Uhse_et_al.2018/expA.r1-in.bam and expA.r1-out.bam) and to run the differential virulence analysis, do\n         \nsnakemake data/Uhse_et_al.2018/expA.r1.dv.tab\nAfterward, data/Uhse_et_al.2018/expA.r1.dv.tab contains a table listing the differential virulence analysis results for all deletional mutants (see Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-tbl-0003] for a list of columns), and an accompanying HTML report is written to data/Uhse_et_al.2018/expA.r1.dv.html. Note that although the pipeline discussed here uses the same approach as the pipeline used by Uhse et al., it differs in some details and does not cover combining data from multiple replicates. The re-analysis thus cannot be expected to reproduce the published results exactly.\nAdding the reference genome, cassette file, KO list, and libraries\n4. Pick a name (e.g., your_design) for the experimental design (including the reference genome and the list of KO cassette insertions) and create two folders with\n         \nmkdir -p data/your_design\nmkdir -p cfg/your_design\n5. Copy the reference genome of U. maydis in FASTA format to cfg/your_design/reference.fa, the FASTA file containing the sequences at 5′ end (named “5p”) and 3′ end (named “3p”) of the KO cassette to cfg/your_design/cassette.fa, and the list of deletional mutants of U. maydis as a GFF2 file listing KO cassette insertion positions to cfg/your_design/knockouts.gff.\n6. For a single replicate (named your_replicate here, but it can have an arbitrary name), which always consists of two libraries, name pre-infection input pool your_replicate-in and post-infection output pool your_replicate-out. For each of those two libraries (in the following, referred to as your_lib, which thus stands for either your_replicate-in or your_replicate-out), place raw paired-end sequencing data either into data/your_design/your_lib.bam as a single BAM file containing unmapped sequencing reads or into data/your_design/your_lib.1.fq.gz (read1) and data/your_design/your_lib.2.fq.gz (read2) as two separate compressed FASTQ files.",
    "This naming scheme ensures that the pipeline knows which reference genome and KO list belong to a particular library and (in step 13) which input and output libraries constitute one replicate.\nSteps 7 to 12 must be executed for each library, i.e., twice per replicate, replacing your_lib first with your_replicate-in and then with your_replicate-out.\nTrimming and UMI extraction (per library)\n7. To trim the technical sequences (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-fig-0002]A) from the raw sequencing reads for library your_lib, do\n         \nsnakemake data/your_design/your_lib.trim.1.fq.gz\nExecuting the trimming step for either read1 (in the command above) or read2 automatically trims the other read as well. If you started from an unmapped BAM file, the file is also automatically converted into two FASTQ files, with one for each read, during this step.\n8. Optional (but recommended): To verify the trimming, generate FastQC (Andrews, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-bib-0001]) reports for trimmed first and second reads with\n         \nsnakemake data/your_design/your_lib.fastqc.1.html\nsnakemake data/your_design/your_lib.fastqc.2.html\nMapping and assignment to insertional KOs (per library)\n9. To map and assign trimmed reads to KOs (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-fig-0002]B) for the sequencing library your_lib, do\n         \nsnakemake data/your_design/your_lib.assign.bam\nDetermining KO abundances (per library)\n10. To produce a table of genome abundance estimates for sequencing library your_lib, do\n         \nsnakemake data/your_design/your_lib.count.tab\nFor a description of the columns of data/your_design/your_lib.count. tab, see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-tbl-0002]. During this step, the TRUmiCount algorithm (Pflug & von Haeseler, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-bib-0018]) also produces the accompanying PDF report data/your_design/your_lib.count.pdf.\nTable 2.\n                Columns in the Knockout Abundance Table Generated by TRUmiCount in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-prot-0004], step 10\ntable:\n﻿Column name,Type,Description\ngene,String,\"Combination of knockout name and flank, “knockout:flank”\"\nn.umis,Integer,Observed UMI count (after filtering)\nn.tot,Numeric,\"Est. number of total UMI count, n.umis/(1-loss)\"\nefficiency,Numeric,Estimated PCR efficiency\ndepth,Numeric,Avg. number of reads per UMI (including lost UMIs)\nloss,Numeric,Est. fraction of lost (unobserved) UMIs\nn.obs,Integer,Same as for n.umis\nn.reads,Integer,Observed total read count (after filtering)\nn.umis.prefilter,Integer,Observed UMI count before read-count filter",

To see if adjustment of TRUmiCount's read-count threshold is necessary, check read-count distribution plot in the TRUmiCount report data/your_design/your_lib.count.pdf.\n12. Optional: If there is a clear overabundance of observed vs. predicted UMIs for read counts slightly larger than the threshold, increase threshold. If the predicted and observed numbers of UMIs agree well for read counts below the threshold, decrease threshold (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-fig-0002]C). To set a library-specific threshold T for library your_lib, add the following lines to the “trumicount” block in cfg/config.yaml (be sure to match the indentation of the existing lines in that block):\n         \n- file: 'data/your_design/your_lib.*'\nopts: '--threshold T'\nIMPORTANT NOTE: After changing the setting, remove data/your_design/your_lib.count.tab and re-run step 10.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/645c7b8d-90f1-4af5-96c7-bb425f8b471c/cppb20097-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\n(A) Layout of sequenced fragments on both sides of knockout (KO) cassette insertions.

To compute the log fold changes of KO virulence for your_replicate and p-values for how significantly these log fold changes deviate from zero (i.e., no change compared to the neutral reference set), do\n         \nsnakemake data/your_design/your_replicate.dv.tab\nThe differential virulence analysis is based on the KO abundances and loss correction factors from the tables your_replicate-in.count.tab and your_replicate-out.count.tab, both created in the folder data/your_design during step 10.

    "14. To produce plots and to combine data from multiple replicates, load output table data/your_design/your_replicate.dv.tab from step 13 into a table-oriented tool such as Microsoft Excel, GraphPad Prism, R, or SPSS. Then, filter KOs based on fold change, p-value, q-value, number of genomes, etc. Combine data from multiple replicates either by filtering based on criteria from multiple replicates (e.g., significance) or by computing a combined p-value (e.g., with Fisher's method).\nSee Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-tbl-0003] for a description of the columns of data/your_design/your_replicate.dv.tab, which contains the results of the differential virulence analysis step.\nTable 3.\n                Columns in the Differential Virulence Table Generated in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20097#cppb20097-prot-0004], step 13\ntable:\n﻿Column name,Type,Description\nknockout,String,Name of the knockout as in the knockout list GFF file\nis.neutral,Flag,\"1 if the knockout is part of the reference set, 0 otherwise\"\nn.out,Integer,Sum of 5′ and 3′ UMI counts after filtering (output pool)\nloss.out,Numeric,Average of 5′ and 3′ est. fraction of lost UMIs (output pool)\nabundance.out,Numeric,\"Est. number of genomes, 0.5*n.out/(1-loss.out) (output pool)\"\nn.in,Integer,Sum of 5′ and 3′ UMI counts after filtering (input pool)\nloss.in,Numeric,Average of 5′ and 3′ est. fraction of lost UMIs (input pool)\nabundance.in,Numeric,\"Est. number of genomes, 0.5*n.in/(1-loss.in) (input pool)\"\nlog2fc,Numeric,Virulence log fold change compared to the reference set (log2 ∆v)\nlow.pval,Numeric,p-value for log2fc being significantly low\nhigh.pval,Numeric,p-value for log2fc being significantly high\nlow.qval,Numeric,FDR-corrected p-value for log2fc being significantly low\nhigh.qval,Numeric,FDR-corrected p-value for log2fc being significantly high"
