    "Infiltration of Nicotiana benthamianaN. benthamiana plants were grown in a growth chamber at 19-22 °C under long-day conditions (14-h-light/10-h-dark) and 70-80% relative humidity for 5-6 weeks as shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926014841_8341.jpgFigure 1. Nicotiana benthamiana plant used for PAMP treatmentN. benthamiana leaves of the same position and similar size were treated with PAMPs (e.g., flg22) or control (e.g., ddH2O) by infiltration using 1 ml needleless syringe (Figure 2). The infiltrated plant were dried gently using the tissue paper and kept in the growth chamber for 3-6 h before collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926014859_5260.jpgFigure 2. Infiltration of N. benthamiana using the needless syringe Total RNA isolationTotal RNA was isolated from N. benthamiana leaves using E.Z.N.A.® Total RNA Kit I isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with proper modifications.Harvest the N. benthamiana leaves at 3-6 h after PAMP treatment. Grind the frozen tissues into powder with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen.Transfer the leaf powder into the 1.5 ml RNase-free tube with 700 μl TRK Lysis Buffer and 14 μl β-mercaptoethanol, vortex the samples for 30 sec, and maintain the sample at 4 °C for 5-10 min.Centrifuge the samples at 15,000 x g for 5-10 min at 4 °C, carefully transfer 600 μl supernatant into a new 1.5 ml RNase-free tube.Add equal volume (600 μl) 70% ethanol (see Recipes).Add the mixed liquid into the HiBind® RNA Mini Column (assembled 2 ml collection tube), centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.Add 300 µl RNA Wash Buffer I to the HiBind® RNA Mini Column, centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.",
    "Add 500 µl RNA Wash Buffer I to the HiBind® RNA Mini Column, centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C. Discard the filtrate and change a new 2 ml collection tube.Add 500 μl RNA Wash Buffer II, centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.Repeat Step B8.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 2 min to completely dry the HiBind® RNA Mini Column.Put the HiBind® RNA Mini Column into a new 1.5 ml RNase-free tube, add 50 μl DNase/RNase-free ddH2O into Column, and let it sit at room temperature for 1 min. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C to elute RNA from the HiBind® RNA Mini Column.Measure RNA concentration using NanodropTM 1000. Store the eluted RNA at -70 °C.First-strand cDNA synthesisTotal RNA was reverse transcribed using PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time).Remove gDNA reactionReaction mixture:table:",
