Allow the fish to swim in this clean water for 5 min to remove AIEC from the surface of the fish.",
    "Repeat the net procedure (step 1.b.i) and place the fish into another 600 mL beaker containing 400 mL sterile infection water. Keep the fish in this beaker for the duration of the experiment (another 18 h) at 28°C.\nEuthanasia.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2119-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Detailed experimental procedure for zebrafish infection and colonization\n(A–G) Steps marked A–G have been detailed in the text.\nAt the desired experimental endpoint, take a sample of the infection water (15 mL is usually sufficient) to quantify excreted bacteria and stool markers for inflammation (such as calprotectin; details in later section).\nPour the remainder of the water through a fishnet (to collect the fish) into bleach to kill the AIEC.\nPlace the fish into a 250 mL beaker containing 100 mL infection water plus 336 μg/mL of tricaine. Incubate the fish in this solution at room temperature until 30 min after cessation of opercular movement.\nCritical: The fishnets should be sterilized with a 10% bleach solution, rinsed well, and dried between uses.\nDissection.\nPreparation of fish.\nWearing gloves, extract a fish out of the tricaine solution with a disposable plastic spoon or small net and place it on the sterile dissecting surface (a wax dissection tray works well for this).\nPosition the fish with its ventral side facing upward and pin it to the dissection tray through the lower jaw, with the blunt end of the pin angled away from the body midpoint. Insert another pin just posterior to the anus, also angled away from the body.\nExposure of intestinal tract (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nSwab the ventral surface of the fish with a lint-free wipe dipped in 70% ethanol.\nSterilize a scalpel and Vannas scissors by dipping them in 70% ethanol and flaming them in a Bunsen burner.",
    "Using a sterile scalpel, make a small incision to penetrate the skin and scales of the belly. Be careful not to cut too deeply, as the intestinal tract is located just under the skin.\nUsing sterile scissors, cut carefully along the length of the body between the anus and gills, cutting no deeper than skin level. Do not cut through the anus.\nMake lateral cuts with the scissors just below the gills to produce flaps.\nPin the flaps on each side to the dissecting surface, angling the pins away from the body.\nNote: The tips of the pins should be sterilized by flaming them with alcohol before use.\nRemoval of intestinal tract (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCritical: The intestinal tract is a pale, very thin tube on top of the other organs and just under the skin of the fish belly.\nSterilize the forceps by dipping in 70% ethanol and flaming to burn off the ethanol. Remove the entire intestinal tract (typically 12–15 mm in length from mouth to anus). Place the intestine into a homogenization tube containing glass beads (see steps 4.a–4.b) and 1 mL of PBS or LB, on ice.\nHomogenization (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nPrior to beginning the experiment, add ∼1.5 g of 1 mm glass beads to 2 mL screw cap tubes (fill them approximately half-way) and sterilize by autoclaving.\nAdd 1 mL of sterile LB or PBS to the sterile homogenization tubes.\nAfter zebrafish intestines have been added (step 3.c.i) to the tubes, screw the caps on very tightly and secure the tubes in the bead-beating homogenizer.\nHomogenize the samples for 1 min on the maximum setting, then cool them on ice for 1–2 min. Repeat this homogenization cycle once more.\nCritical: Several alternative homogenization methods, such as grinding with a sterile pestle, also work.",
    "Quantifying intestinal AIEC colonization levels (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3G).\nFor each fish, prepare a series of 5 or 6 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for serial dilution of the intestinal homogenate by adding 900 μL of LB or PBS to each tube.\nMake 10-fold serial dilutions of the intestinal homogenate by adding 100 μL of homogenate to the first tube.\nVortex it to mix thoroughly.\nAdd 100 μL from the first tube to the second tube.\nRepeat this dilution process until all tubes have been used.\nPlate 100–200 μL of each dilution on LB agar plates containing 75 μg/mL of Ampicillin (if using Ampicillin resistant strains).\nIncubate the plates at 37°C for 16–18 h.\nAfter the overnight incubation, count AIEC colonies on the plates using an automated colony counter or by manually counting the colonies. In the latter case it is helpful to mark the counted colonies with a marker tip.\nDetermine the CFU per fish intestine by multiplying the CFU on the plate by the dilution factor of the suspension, also considering the volume that was plated.\nQuantifying intestinal invasion levels.\nTake the whole intestine from step 3.c in 250 μL sterile PBS and chop it into small segments using sharp scissor tips.\nIncubate the small intestinal segments with 100 mg/mL of Gentamicin in sterile PBS at room temperature for 25 min to remove the surface colonizing bacteria.\nWash intestinal segments three times in sterile PBS for 10 min with periodic mild vortexing.\nHomogenize the washed intestinal segments with glass beads as described in step 4.\nSerially diluted and plate the homogenate as described in step 5 for CFU count of the internalized bacteria.\nQuantifying the bacterial load in excreted water (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3G).",
    "Take a water sample at the desired time point and serially dilute it as described previously.\nPlate 100 μL of each of the serial dilutions on selective media (LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotic) and incubate at 37°C for 16–18 h.\nCount the colonies. Calculate the CFU per mL of water using serial dilutions as described in step 5.\nAdministration of probiotic strain E. coli Nissle to assess its effect on AIEC colonization\nTiming: 3 days\nThis part of the protocol describes the detailed procedure for zebrafish inoculation with EcN. It also describes the protocol for testing the effects of EcN on co-inoculation with AIEC, pre-inoculation with AIEC (prophylactically), and post-inoculation with AIEC (therapeutically).\nCritical: The probiotic strain, E. coli Nissle, can be administered in three ways, depending on the desired study: by co-inoculation (same time as AIEC infection), prophylactically (before AIEC infection), and therapeutically (after AIEC infection).\nInoculation of E. coli Nissle with AIEC.\nCo-Inoculation and incubation.\nPlace four or five zebrafish into 400 mL of sterile infection water in a 600 mL beaker.\nAdd 2 mL of AIEC (cell suspension, described above) and 2 mL of E. coli Nissle to 400 mL sterile infection water at the desired infectious dose (typically 5 × 106 CFU/mL for both strains).\nCover the beaker with a perforated lid to prevent the fish from jumping out; the top of a 200 μL tip box works well for this.\nLabel each beaker and place them into a glass-front incubator set at 28°C for 6 h.\nAfter 6 h exposure, pour the beaker water through a fishnet into a container of bleach to kill the AIEC and to collect the fish.",
    "Place the fish into a fresh 600 mL beaker containing 400 mL sterile infection water. Allow the fish to swim in this clean water for 5 min to remove AIEC from the surface of the fish.\nRepeat the net procedure (step 8.a.v) and place the fish into another 600 mL beaker containing 400 mL sterile infection water. Keep the fish in this beaker for the duration of the experiment (another 18 h) at 28°C.\nProphylactic Inoculation and incubation.\nPlace four or five zebrafish into 400 mL of sterile infection water in a 600 mL beaker.\nAdd 2 mL of E. coli Nissle to 400 mL of infection water at the desired infectious dose (typically 5 × 106 CFU/mL).\nCover the beaker with a perforated lid to prevent the fish from jumping out; the top of a 200 μL tip box works well for this.\nLabel each beaker and place them into a glass-front incubator set at 28°C for 6 h.\nAfter 6 h of exposure to E. coli Nissle, add 2 mL of AIEC and incubate at 28°C for another 6 h.\nAfter 12 h of incubation, pour the beaker water through a fishnet into a container of bleach to kill the AIEC and to collect the fish.\nPlace the fish in a beaker of 400 mL of sterile infection water.

Keep the fish in this beaker for the duration of the experiment (another 18 h) at 28°C.\nEuthanization and dissection of zebrafish, and the homogenization and serial dilution of the zebrafish gut can be done as described earlier. Quantifying intestinal colonization and bacterial load in the excreted water can be done for both AIEC and E. coli Nissle in their respective antibiotic media following the method previously described.\nQuantification of inflammatory markers in the zebrafish gut\nTiming: 1 day\nThis part of the protocol describes how to do assays such as qRT-PCR and ELISA from zebrafish intestinal samples.",
    "Critical: Zebrafish specific primary antibodies for most inflammatory markers are not readily available. Therefore, qRT-PCR based quantification of inflammatory markers is performed in most cases.\nCritical: Incubate a group of fish for 12 h with 20 μM TNBS (2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution; in infection water to induce non-lethal inflammation as a positive control.\nqRT-PCR of inflammatory markers.\nRNA isolation from whole gut.\nPut the whole gut in TRIzol and homogenize using a 1.5 mL tube pestle homogenizer.\nAdd 0.2 mL of chloroform, securely cap the tube, then thoroughly mix by shaking and incubate for 2–3 min.\nCentrifuge the sample for 15 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C. The mixture separates into a lower red phenol-chloroform, an interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase.\nTransfer the aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new tube by angling the tube at 45° and pipetting the solution out.\nAdd 0.5 mL of isopropanol to the aqueous phase, incubate for 10 min at 4°C. Centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C. Total RNA precipitate forms a white gel-like pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nDiscard the supernatant with a micropipettor and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 75% ethanol.\nPause point: The RNA can be stored in 75% ethanol for at least 1 year at –20°C, or at least 1 week at 4°C.\nVortex the sample briefly, then centrifuge for 5 min at 7,500 × g at 4°C. Discard the supernatant with a micropipettor and vacuum or air dry the RNA pellet for 5–10 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 50–75 μL of RNase-free water.\nIf not dissolved completely, Incubate the tube in a water bath or heat block set at 55°C–60°C for 10–15 min.\nUse the RNA solution immediately or store it at −80°C.",
    "Measure the RNA concentration using a nanodrop.\nPreparation of cDNA from RNA. Prepare the cDNA from the RNA following the company protocol for SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System from Invitrogen. https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FsuperscriptIIIfirststrand_pps.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FsuperscriptIIIfirststrand_pps.pdf].\nSample preparation for qRT-PCR.\nCritical: Use PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix and Applied Biosystems™ MicroAmp™ Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate with Barcode (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for the qRT PCR.\nDetermine the number of reactions you need to set up to see the effect of AIEC induced inflammation. For example, to see the fold change of TNFα (target) during AIEC infection, four groups are needed: cDNA from infected gut with TNFα primers, cDNA from control gut with TNFα primers, cDNA from infected gut with β-actin (housekeeping standard) primers and cDNA from control gut with β-actin primers. Take triplicate for each group. If more than one target genes are there, housekeeping standard can be used once for all the target gene expression.\nMake master mix by adding 5 μL of PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix, 0.5 μL of forward primer (100 μM), 0.5 μL of reverse primer (100 μM) and 3 μL of nuclease free water for 1 reaction. Make the master mix for each target gene separately.\nCritical: Always make master mix for one extra reaction, which will help during pipetting.\nMake a template for the 96 well plate on a paper and mark the wells properly for target genes and sample used.\nAdd master mix to the corresponding wells according to the template.\nThen add 1 μL of corresponding cDNA in each well.\nSeal the plate with MicroAmp™ Optical Adhesive Film (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\nMix the solution by mild vortex of the plate and perform a brief centrifuge to move all the solution to the bottom of the wells.",

ΔCT is calculated by the CT of the target gene subtracted from the CT of the housekeeping gene β-actin for the same sample.\nCalculate ΔDCT (or ΔΔCT) by subtracting ΔCT (control) from ΔCT (sample) for a particular target gene.\nThe levels of expression of the genes of interest were calculated as fold change by the formula 2–ΔDCT.\nMake the graph with the fold change value or the log2 fold change value for each gene.\nCritical: Each fold change value above 1 is identified as up-regulation of gene expression and each fold change value below 1 is identified as down-regulation of gene expression. For log2 fold change values, all positive values indicate up-regulation and all negative values indicate down-regulation of gene expression.\nELISA of inflammatory markers.\nAdd 50 mL of RIPA buffer in 100 μL PBS containing zebrafish gut and homogenize using a 1.5 mL tube pestle homogenizer. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min with periodic vortexing.\nResuspend the pelleted stool from excreted water in 1 mL PBS.\nDilute the samples (intestinal homogenate or stool suspension) 1:25 with PBS and run the calprotectin ELISA kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA).",
