    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEstablishment of lung PDX mouse model\nTiming: 4–8 weeks\nIn this section, we describe the establishment of the lung PDX model with NOD/SCID mice.\nNote: Stock of PDX sample should be stored in a liquid nitrogen tank with screw cap cryogenic tube. Do not repeat the freeze-thaw cycle to keep the viability of the sample.\nNote: Unless specified instructions, it is strongly recommended to perform the process below in sterile conditions to prevent possible contamination.\nTake a frozen lung PDX sample out from a liquid nitrogen storage tank.\nNote: There is a possibility for murine-cell infiltration and contamination while tumor grows in mice. It is recommended to begin with fresh PDX samples without necrotic regions and murine stromal cell infiltration.\nResuscitate the frozen lung PDX sample by incubating it in a 37°C water bath for 1 min.\nIn a biological safety cabinet (BSC), place a 60 mm culture dish on ice. Bring the thawed lung PDX sample to the culture dish with 5 mL of complete culture media [RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution] to prevent the sample from drying.\nMince the PDX sample into 2–3 mm3 pieces with a sterile surgical scalpel and keep it aside on ice.\nPrepare anesthesia cocktail solution by mixing ketamine/xylazine/PBS.\nNote: The usage doses of the anesthesia cocktail are ketamine 200 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg.\nAnesthetize 6–8-week-old female NOD/SCID mouse by injecting the anesthesia cocktail 100 μL per 10 g of body weight.\nNote: The anesthesia onset takes 3–5 min with 30–40 min duration.\nRemove the hair of the right flank of NOD/SCID mouse with clippers.\nMake a 10–15 mm skin incision on the shaved region with surgical scissors.\nSecure enough space under the skin by pushing a trocar needle.",
    "Load 3–5 pieces of PDX samples on the tip of stainless-steel trocar needle. Add 20 μL of Matrigel over the loaded tissues and inject subcutaneously into the NOD/SCID mice.\nNote: Matrigel helps to improve the frequency of tumor formation.\nClose the surgical region with a sterile suture.\nReturn the mouse to the cage and monitor the mouse until fully recovered.\nNote: Maintain the PDX-implanted mouse in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) room at a stable temperature (22 ± 2°C) with ad libitum availability of standard chow and water and 12 h of light/dark cycle.\nRemove the suture by 10–14 days after surgical intervention.\nObserve the PDX tumor growth and wait until it reaches the appropriate size (<500 mm3).\nNote: The time to reach the endpoint can vary depending on the condition of the PDX sample, the initial amount of tissue implanted, and/or the condition of the mouse.\nCollection of lung PDX tumor from immunodeficient mouse and establishment of a primary cell line\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section, we describe the processes of harvest and dissociation of PDX tumor for obtaining a primary cell line.\nAnesthetize the PDX-bearing mouse by injecting an anesthesia cocktail of 100 μL per 10 g of body weight.\nShave around the PDX tumor with clippers and disinfect the surgery area with a 70% ethanol cotton swipe.\nDissect the flank skin and detach the PDX tumor.\nCritical: It is strongly recommended to perform this procedure in a BSC with sterile surgical tools and materials to prevent possible contamination.\nCritical: Remove the mouse dermis and necrotic parts completely from the tumor. It is important to secure viable tumor cells and to increase the yield of PDX primary cells.\nNote: Surgical tools can be sterilized by autoclave sealed with an instant sealing sterilization pouch.",
    "Place the collected PDX tumor in5 mL of complete culture media in a 15 mL conical tube for temporary storage or transport. Keep the sample in ice (4°C).\nNote: Cutting into smaller pieces in this step may help to keep the sample submerged in the culture media preventing it from drying out.\nIn BSC, place the PDX tumor in a 60 mm culture dish on ice with 5 mL of complete culture media. Mince the PDX tumor into several small pieces of ∼2–4 mm with a sterile scalpel.\nNote: Chopping the PDX tumor into smaller pieces increases the efficacy of tumor dissociation enzymes and the yield of single cells.\nPrepare the human Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) component enzymes (Enzymes H, R, and A) by adding culture media (RPMI 1640) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). For storage, prepare aliquots of the enzyme solutions with proper volume to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2536_7.csv\n∗Prepare the enzymes in BSC with sterile culture media. Aliquot the enzyme with an appropriate amount and store it at −20°C. These enzyme solutions are stable for up to 6 months after reconstitution.\nNote: Please refer to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nhttps://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0002061.PDF[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0002061.PDF].\nNote: 60 μL of Collagenase D (100 mg/mL) and 75 μL of DNase I (1% solution) in 3 mL of PBS can be used as alternative enzymes for tumor dissociation.\n[troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]].\nTransfer the chopped PDX tumor into a gentleMACS™ C tube and add 2.2 mL of RPMI 1640 media, 100 μL of Enzyme H, 50 μL of Enzyme R, and 12.5 μL of Enzyme A.\nAttach the C tube to the gentleMACS™ dissociator and run program h_tumor_01.\nDetach the C tube and incubate in a 37°C CO2 incubator for 30 min while inverting C tube every 5 min.",

Incubate the cells in 37°C CO2 incubator for 5 min.\nNote: Sometimes the primary culture cells are more firmly attached to the bottom of the cell plate. As such, increase the incubation time with TE buffer up to 10 min.\nAdd complete culture media of two times the volume of 2× TE solution.
