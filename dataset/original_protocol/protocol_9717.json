  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All cell cultures should be handled using a proper aseptic technique.\nThe human intestinal organoids employed in this study were obtained from Johns Hopkins University and all methods were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines and regulations. All experimental protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board (IRB #NA 00038329).\n1. Preparation of the cell culture reagents\nPrepare the human organoid growth medium following the manufacturer's instructions (Table of Materials) and supplement it with 100 µg/mL of primocin.\nPrepare human microvascular endothelial cell growth medium following the manufacturer's instructions (Table of Materials) and supplement with 1:20 vol/vol FBS and 50 μg/ml instead 100 μg/ml of primocin.\nResuspend Y-27632 (Rho-kinase Inhibitor) in sterile 0.1% BSA in DPBS to prepare a 10 mM stock solution. Aliquot into sterile microtubes and store at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\nResuspend CHIR99021 (GSK-3 Inhibitor) in sterile dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare a 5 mM stock solution. Aliquot into sterile microtubes and store at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\nPrepare the human organoid digestion solution by mixing a 1:1 vol/vol organoids dissociation solution (Table of Materials) with DPBS solution (Table of Materials) and supplementing it with 10 µM stock solution of Y-27632. This reagent must be made fresh for each use.\n2. Culture of Human Intestinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HIMECs)\nInitiate the HIMEC culture (Table of Materials) 7 days before seeding it onto the chip. Only HIMECs at passage 1-6 can be used for chip seeding.\nAdd 5 mL of the attachment factor solution (Table of Materials) to a T150 flask; incubate at 37 °C for 1 min and discard the solution.\nAdd 19 mL of endothelial cell growth medium pre-warmed at room temperature (see step 1.2) to the flask.",
    "Thaw a frozen vial of HIMEC (2 million cells/vial) in a 37°C water bath.\nTransfer the contents of the vial into the flask and gently rock the flask to distribute the cells evenly. Place the flask in a 37 °C incubator overnight to allow the endothelial cells to adhere.\nReplace the medium with 20 mL of endothelial cell growth medium pre-warmed at room temperature on the next day and every 3 days thereafter. Cultures should reach 90% of confluency on the day of cell harvest for chip experiments.\n3. Microfabrication and preparation of the chip\nObtain chips from a commercial supplier (Table of Materials). Unpack the chips and position them in the chip cradle placed in a square Petri dish (Table of Materials). Label the front side of each chip carrier with the experimental conditions (Figure 1A).\n\t​NOTE: While the presented protocol relies on the use of a specific commercially available chip and instrumentation, there are several microfluidic devices offered through different vendors, which may offer alternative advantages but lack the ability to incorporate stretch. In addition, microfabrication of the Organs-on-Chips can be performed \"in house\" following the procedures described in Huh et al.21.\n4. Activation and ECM coating of the membrane\nPreparation of the activation solution\n\t\nBring the ER-1 and ER-2 reagents (Table of Materials) to room temperature to equilibrate before use. ER-1 is light sensitive and must be handled in the dark.\nReconstitute ER-1 in 10 mL of ER-2 reagent to make a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and confirm that the ER-1 is completely dissolved.\nSurface activation\n\t\nGently push 50 µL of the ER-1 solution through both channels of the chip (Figure 1A).\nRemove any excess ER-1 solution from the surface of the chip using an aspirator.",
    "Inspect the chips to make sure that all the chips have received the ER-1 solution. In case of air bubbles, introduce more ER-1 solution until the bubbles are fully removed.\nIncubate the chips inside the UV lamp chamber (Table of Materials) for 15 min. Confirm that the UV lamp is set to the Consistent setting.\nBring the ER-1 activated chips back to the biosafety cabinet (BSC). Aspirate the ER-1 solution from both the channels. Wash any residue of the ER-1 solution with 200 µL of ER-2.\nPush 200 µL of sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DBPS) through the channels (Table of Materials) and leave DBPS in the channels until the next step.\nPreparation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and membrane coating\n\t\nPreparation of stock solutions of ECM components\n\t\t\nReconstitute collagen IV (Table of Materials) and fibronectin (Table of Materials) using sterile cell culture grade water (Table of Materials) to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. Prepare aliquots and store them at -20°C until use.\nPreparation of ECM working solution for membrane coating\n\t\t\nPrepare 1.5 mL of each ECM solution for the top and bottom channel for every 12 chips to be coated. The ECM solution should always be prepared just before use.\nFor the top channel, mix collagen IV and solubilized basement membrane matrix (BMM) (Table of Materials) in sterile cold DBPS at 200 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively. For the bottom channel, mix collagen IV and fibronectin in sterile cold DPBS at 200 µg/mL and 30 µg/mL, respectively.\nECM coating of the chips\n\t\t\nAspirate the DBPS from both channels of the chips and replace with the appropriate ECM working solution for each channel (Figure 1A).",
    "Inspect each chip to ensure it has received the coating solution. In case of air bubbles, push through more coating solution until all the bubbles are fully removed.\nAdd sterile DPBS to the chip cradle and place the Petri dish containing the chips in a 37 °C incubator. Incubate overnight to allow the ECM proteins to form ionic bonds with the activated PDMS membrane. If desired, cells can be seeded anytime between 2 h and 1 day after coating of the chips. Alternatively, coated chips can be stored at 4°C overnight, followed by overnight incubation at 37°C and chip seeding.\n5. Seeding of Intestinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HIMECs) in the bottom channel of the chip\nNOTE: Small intestinal and colonic HIMECs are seeded in the bottom channel of the duodenum and colon chip, respectively.\nPrepare chips\n\t\nTransfer the ECM-coated chips to the BSC. Gently aspirate the ECM coating from both the channels of the chips, and then wash both channels with 200 µL of organoid growth medium and endothelial cell growth medium, respectively.\nStore the washed chips in a 37°C incubator until proceeding with endothelial cells seeding.\nHarvest the endothelial cells\n\t\nBring the HIMEC culture flask to the BSC and wash using sterile DPBS.\nAdd 3 mL of dissociation solution to the flask and place it in the 37°C incubator for 2 min to allow for complete cell detachment.\nCollect the cells in a 15 mL conical tube and add endothelial cell growth media until it reaches 10 mL. Sample 15-20 µL of the cell suspension for cell counting. Centrifuge at 150 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the HIMECs to a density of 8-10 x 106 cells/mL in endothelial cell growth media.\nSeed endothelial cells into the bottom channel of the chip",
    "Bring the Petri dish containing the chips to the BSC and gently remove all the media from the bottom channel using a 1,000 µL pipette.\nIntroduce 10-15 µL of the HIMEC suspension into the bottom channel of the chip. Inspect the chip right after seeding to ensure optimal seeding density (80%-90% of coverage) and homogenous cell distribution within the channel (Figure 1D). If the seeding density is higher or lower than expected or uneven, wash the channel 2x with 200 µL of endothelial cell growth media and repeat the seeding procedure.\nInvert the Petri dish immediately after seeding each batch of six chips to allow endothelial cell attachment to the bottom side of the PDMS membrane. Place the Petri dishes into the 37°C incubator for 30 min to 1 h, or until the HIMECs in the bottom channel have attached to the membrane (Figure 1D).\nWash the chips\n\t\nGently push 200 µL of endothelial cell growth media through the bottom channel inlet to remove any unattached cells and replenish the nutrients in the media.\nWash away the cells that did not attach in the top channel with 200 µL of organoid growth medium supplemented with 5 µM CHIR99021 and 10 µM Y-27632.\nPlace the chips in the 37°C incubator until proceeding to the epithelial cell seeding.\n6. Seeding of organoid fragments in the top channel of the chip",
    "NOTE: Organoids isolated from biopsies of various intestinal regions can be cultured in the intestine chip7. Follow the procedures described in Fujii et al. for the isolation of human intestinal crypts and establishment of organoid cultures22. Here, duodenal and colonic organoids are used to generate the duodenum and colon chips, respectively. Given the high batch-to-batch and donor-to-donor variability in organoid formation and growth, it is suggested to perform a pilot evaluation of cell density in the organoid suspension culture (24-well plate format) to achieve the optimal seeding density of 8 million cells/mL.\nPilot evaluation of the cell numbers/well of static organoid culture.\n\tNOTE: The following procedure is solely to determine the number of wells of organoid suspension culture required for the chip seeding. The resulting single cells should not be used for the chip seeding.\n\t\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant from three wells of the organoid culture plate. Add 500 µL of ice-cold BMM dissociation solution (Table of Materials) to each well and use a plastic scraper to detach the solubilized BMM from the plastic.\nCollect the organoid suspension into a sterile low protein binding conical tube using an ice-cold 1,000 µL pipette. Incubate on ice for 60 min, mixing every 15 min by gently shaking the tube. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 2 mL of Trypsin. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min to digest the organoids to the single-cell level and add 10 mL of complete organoid growth medium to stop the enzymatic reaction. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of complete organoid growth medium and count the total number of cells using a hematocytometer according to standard methods.\nPreparation of organoid fragments and their seeding in the chip",
    "NOTE: The following procedures can be used to seed duodenal or colonic organoids in the top channel of the chip. The establishment of an epithelial monolayer with an in vivo relevant 3D cytoarchitecture is contingent on the presence of flow15,23 and successful seeding of organoid fragments.\n\t\nCarefully aspirate the medium from the number of wells of the static organoid culture, which is sufficient, as determined in step 6.1, to achieve final seeding density of 8 million cells/mL. Add 500 µL of ice-cold BMM dissociation solution to each well.\nDetach the solubilized BMM from the surface of the wells using a plastic scraper or 1,000 µL pipette. Collect the suspension into a 15 mL low-protein binding conical tube.\nStore the suspension on ice for 60 min, mixing every 15 min by gently shaking the tube. Proceed to centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C. A well-defined organoid pellet should be visible after the centrifugation. If a transparent gel layer is observed above the cell pellet (residues of solubilized BMM) (Figure 1B), proceed with the following steps.\n\t\t\nMix the supernatant and cell pellet and add an equal volume of BMM dissociation solution in the tube. Gently mix and store on ice for an additional 10 min, and proceed to centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nIf needed, repeat step 6.2.3.1 until no solubilized BMM residues are present.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the organoid pellet with organoid digestion solution (see step 1.5). Use a sufficient volume of organoid digestion solution to ensure complete submersion of the pellet. 2 mL of solution is appropriate for approximately 2,400-12,000 medium-sized organoids (Figure 1D, Post-Seeding). Incubate at 37°C for 1-3 min.",
    "Add Advanced DMEM/F-12 to the tube to stop the enzymatic reaction. Use four times the volume of the digestion solution used. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the organoid fragments pellet in a complete organoid growth medium supplemented with 5 µM CHIR99021 and 10 µM Y-27632 to achieve 8 million cells/mL. Prepare 360 µL aliquots of the suspension in sterile 1.5 mL low protein binding tubes to prevent the reduction of cell density because of attachment on the walls.\nRemove the medium from the top channel of the coated chips. Add 30 µL of cell suspension in the top channel of each chip. Incubate the chips overnight in a 37°C incubator to allow the organoid fragments to adhere to the ECM-coated membrane (Figure 1D).\n7. Dynamic culture of intestine chip - initiation, and maintenance of flow and peristalsis-like motions\nMedia preparation and degassing\n\t\nTo maintain constant laminar flow through the chip, allow the media temperature to equilibrate to room temperature, and then subject it to vacuum-driven filtration for 10 min using a vacuum pump and PVDF filter conical tubes (media degassing).\nPriming of portable modules\n\tNOTE: Portable modules are reservoirs that act as an interface between the chips and the culture module allowing for repeating sampling and dosing of media.\n\t\nOpen the portable modules, in the BSC, and place them on the culture module trays, which are specialized containers for the alignment of the portable modules.\nAdd 3 mL of pre-equilibrated complete organoid growth medium supplemented with 5 µM CHIR99021 and 10 µM Y-27632 to the top inlet reservoir and 3 mL of pre-equilibrated endothelial cell growth medium in the bottom inlet reservoir (Figure 1C). Add 300 µL of the same media in the respective outlet reservoirs.",
    "Bring the trays to the 37°C incubator and slide them into the culture module (Figure 1C). Use controls on the screen of the culture module to run the \"Prime Cycle\" (1 min long). When the status bar indicates \"Ready\", the Prime Cycle is completed. Repeat the Prime Cycle to ensure sufficient droplets have formed for successfully connecting the chips.\nEnsure that all portable modules are primed and have visible media droplets.\nIntroduction of flow\n\tNOTE: Flow is typically initiated 24 h after seeding organoid fragments to allow the intestinal epithelial cells to attach firmly to the membrane.\n\t\nWash both channels of the seeded chips with 200 µL of the respective media to remove any bubbles or cell debris. Leave small droplets of media on the ports after the wash. Slide the chip carrier into the portable module (Figure 1C).\nPlace the portable modules on the trays, and then into the culture module. Use the controls on the screen of the culture module to program the appropriate organ chip culture conditions (flow rate and stretch).\n\t\tNOTE: For standard duodenum and colon chip culture conditions, set the flow rate to 30 µL/h15 and 60 µL/h16 respectively, for both the top and bottom channels. However, the flow rates for each channel are controlled independently and can be set between 0-1,000 µL/h. Syringe or peristaltic pumps can be used, instead of culture modules presented here, to introduce laminar flow to microfluidic chips. However, establishment of reliable fluidic connections between chips and pumps using tubing and connectors might be technically challenging when simultaneous perfusion of multiple chips is required.\nStart the \"Regulate Cycle\" (2 h long) that pressurizes the culture media in portable module and chip to prevent nucleation of the air bubbles. Programmed conditions will resume after completion of the Regulate Cycle.\nMedia change",
    "Prepare fresh media for both channels and replenish them every 48 h by adding 2 mL of fresh medium to the inlet reservoirs (Figure 1C).\nPause the culture modules and bring the trays to BSC. Aspirate media in all the reservoirs and replenish with fresh media. Bring the trays back and restart the flow.\nIntroduction of stretch\n\tNOTE: Allow the cells to grow to 100% confluence before application of cyclic strain. Stretch is typically introduced 3 days post-seeding or 48 h after initiation of fluidic culture. 2% cyclic strain at the frequency of 0.2 or 0.15 Hz, for the duodenum11 and colon24 intestine chip, respectively, is applied for the initial 24 h. It is then further increased to 10% for the remaining duration of the intestine chip culture to closely resemble the cyclic strain experienced by intestinal epithelial cells in vivo (Figure 1D)25. The culture module can support application of 2%-12% cyclic strain and frequency of up to 0.4 Hz.\n\t\nTo introduce stretch to the ongoing fluidic culture, pause the culture module. Using controls on the screen, change the stretch settings to 2% stretch, 0.2 or 0.15 Hz frequency, and restart the culture module.\nAfter 24 h, repeat step 7.5.1 to apply a 10% stretch, 0.2 or 0.15 Hz frequency.\n8. CYP450 induction using prototypical CYP inducers in the duodenum chip",
    "NOTE: The cytochrome P450 (CYP450) induction assay enables assessing whether the test compound increases the mRNA levels and/or catalytic activity of specific CYP450 enzymes. Here, we describe the protocol for the evaluation of CYP3A4 induction by the industry standard and regulator recommended in vitro CYP inducers, Rifampicin (RIF) and 1,2-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (VD3). The presented method may be used to identify the potential of various test compounds to induce different isoforms of CYP450 in human intestinal tissue. Specific sets of primers and probe substrate will need to be selected for each enzyme isoform to be evaluated.\nExposure to CYP Inducers\n\t\nPrepare stock solutions of 20 mM RIF, 100 mM VD3, and 200 mM Testosterone (Table of Materials) using sterile DMSO.\n\t\tCAUTION: Testosterone is a Schedule III controlled substance. Follow regulatory procedures during handling.\nPrepare dosing media with CYP inducers by diluting the stock solutions in complete organoid growth medium and endothelial cell growth medium to achieve 20 µM RIF, 100 nmol/L of VD3. Prepare vehicle control by diluting DMSO in the respective media to achieve 0.1% of DMSO.\nPause the culture module and bring the trays to BSC. Replace the media in all the inlet reservoirs with 2 mL of dosing media with inducers or vehicle control. Return the portable modules back to the culture module and restart the flow at 30 µL/h.\nAfter 24 h, replace the media with inducing solution, and repeat steps 8.1.2-8.1.3. Inducing solutions should be prepared fresh daily and replenished every 24 h over the course of the experiment, which is typically 48-72 h long.\nIncubation with a prototypical substrate (Testosterone)",
    "On the day of harvest, prepare the probe substrate solution of Testosterone along with corresponding inducers in Advanced DMEM/F12 to yield a final concentration of 200 µM. Omit the addition of the serum to the media as this may interfere with the LCMS analysis.\nBring the trays to BSC, and aspirate the dosing medium from all the reservoirs. Wash and replace the top and bottom inlet reservoirs with warm Advanced DMEM/F12 medium and endothelial cell growth medium, respectively.\nRemove the wash medium from the reservoirs and replace it with 1 mL of probe substrate solution, prepared in step 8.2.1. Perfuse the chips at a high flow rate of 1,000 µL/h for 5 min and aspirate both top and bottom outlet reservoirs. Return the chips to the culture module and incubate for 1 h under the constant flow of 300 µL/h.\nData analysis\n\t\nSample collection for LCMS analysis\n\t\t\nAliquot 200 µL of stop solution containing Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid in pre-labeled 1.5 mL tubes and place them on ice. The composition of LCMS stop solution may vary based on the substrate that needs to be analyzed.\nAfter 1 h of treatment is complete, stop the flow and bring the trays back to BSC. Collect 100 µL of effluent from the top outlet reservoir, and add it to the corresponding tube containing the stop solution (Figure 2A). Place the tubes immediately on dry ice. Store the samples at -80°C before proceeding to analysis.\nExtract and analyze samples by using either HPLC or LC-MS/MS techniques, monitoring the formation of metabolite-6β-hydroxytestosterone (6β-OH-T). CYP enzyme activity can be expressed as pmol/min/mg protein where pmol refers to the amount of metabolite (6β-OH-T) formed during the reaction. Total protein content per chip (protein; mg) is determined by performing a Bradford assay described in step 8.3.2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63724/63724eq01v3.jpg",
    "The fold-induction activity is calculated by: CYP activity(induced) / CYP activity (vehicle).\nIf collecting samples for mRNA analysis, see step 8.3.3.\nLysis of the cells for protein expression analysis\n\t\tNOTE: Protein extraction from cells on-chip is performed using a protein lysis buffer, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Table of Materials). Extracted protein is then quantified using the Bradford assay and used in downstream analysis.\n\t\t\nDetach the chips from portable modules and place them in a Petri dish. Wash both the channels with 200 µL of sterile DPBS.\nBlock the bottom channel outlet with a 200 µL filter pipette tip. Perfuse 50 µL of the dissociation solution through the bottom channel and incubate for 2 min at room temperature.\nInspect to confirm complete detachment of the endothelial cells. Pipette up and down 1-2 times and remove the dissociation solution from the channel. Repeat wash.\nBlock the top channel outlet with a 200 µL filter pipette tip. Perfuse 75 µL of protein lysis buffer through the top channel. Leave the pipette tip inserted, to block the top channel inlet and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Pipette up and down 5-10 times and collect the cell lysates in a pre-labeled 1.5 mL tube.\nRepeat step 8.3.2.4. until complete detachment of cells is observed. Collect the cell lysates in the same 1.5 mL tube and store them at -80 °C until analysis.\nExtract the protein fraction according to standard methods and quantify total protein using the Bradford assay (Table of Materials).\nLysis of the cells for gene expression analysis",
    "​NOTE: On-chip cell lysis for RNA extraction can be achieved using an RNA lysis buffer, supplemented with 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Table of Materials). Alternately, a phenol-based RNA lysis buffer can be used if high yields of high-quality RNA suitable for NGS and microarrays analysis are required.\n\t\t\nFollow steps 8.3.2.1 to 8.3.2.2 to prepare intestine chip for lysis.\nBlock the outlet of the top channel using a 200 µL filter pipette tip. Perfuse 150 µL of RNA lysis buffer through the top channel. Leave the pipette tip inserted to block the inlet of the top channel. Incubate for 2 min at room temperature. For lysis using a phenol-based RNA lysis buffer, use 350 µL of the reagent.\nPipette up and down 5-10 times and collect the cell lysates in a pre-labelled 1.5 mL tube. Repeat the step with another 150 µL of RNA lysis buffer and collect. Store the cell lysates at -80 °C until analysis. In case of subsequent RNA sequencing analysis, proceed with the analysis within 1-month post lysing.\nExtract total RNA from the cell lysates using an RNA purification kit.\nReverse-transcribe into cDNA using a reverse transcriptase kit and carry out real-time PCR using a real-time PCR cycler and the appropriate primers and buffer. Quantify the results using the 2-ΔΔCt method.\n9. Disruption of the epithelial barrier using proinflammatory cytokines in colon chip",
    "NOTE: This protocol describes disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier by the cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ)26,27,28,29. The cytokine is dosed in the bottom channel of the colon chip given the basolateral expression of IFNγ receptor on intestinal epithelial cells.  The proinflammatory stimulus is introduced in the chip on day 5 of the culture, as soon as the Papp has been stabilized below 0.5 x 10-6 cm/s. A similar dosing regimen can be used for other proinflammatory cytokines and barrier disruptive agents.\nStimulation with IFNγ\n\t\nPrepare a 100 µg/mL of stock solution of IFNγ (Table of Materials) in sterile cell culture water. Store the stock solution at -80°C over the course of the experiment. For each experiment, always use a fresh stock of IFNγ and avoid more than three freeze and thaw cycles.\nPrepare IFNγ dosing solution by diluting stock solution in degassed endothelial cell growth medium to achieve a final concentration of 10-100 ng/mL.\nBring the trays to BSC and remove the medium from bottom channel inlet reservoirs and replace it with 3 mL of the IFNγ containing medium. Refresh the IFNγ dosing medium daily.\nPlace the trays into the culture module and perfuse the chips at a high flow rate of 1,000 µL/h for 5 min to initiate IFNγ treatment. Switch the flow rate back to 60 µL/h and continue the fluidic culture.\nData analysis",
    "Assessment of the epithelial barrier function. The epithelial apparent permeability (Papp), or barrier function, can be measured at various time points of the culture post-treatment with IFNγ, in the effluent media of both channels' inlet and outlet reservoirs. The fluorescent tracer should be added to the top channel organoid growth medium 4 h before the assessment of the Papp. Typically, 3 kDa Dextran Cascade Blue is used as the fluorescent tracer and is added in the medium 24 h before.\n\t\t\nPause the culture module and bring the trays to the BSC.\nLabel and prepare a 96-well black-walled plate with 100 µL of DPBS per well. Using a 200 µL multi-channel pipette, collect and add 50 µL of effluent from all the reservoirs to the respective wells (Figure 2B).\nTo prepare the standard curve, dilute the medium containing 100 µg/mL of 3 kDa dextran Cascade Blue 1:3 in DPBS. Subsequently perform serial dilutions using a three-fold dilution of endothelial cell growth medium in DPBS.\nRead the fluorescence at 375 nm excitation and 420 nm emission using a plate reader. Use the OD values measured to calculate apparent permeability (Papp) as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63724/63724eq02v2.jpg\nImmunofluorescence staining of cells on-chip\n\t\t\nWash using 200 µL of DPBS for each channel, three times.\nPerfuse 200 µL of the fixative solution (4% PFA in DPBS) in each channel. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nRepeat the washing step 9.2.2.1. At this stage, washed chips can be stored for up to 7 days at 4°C.\nPermeabilize the cells using 200 µL of permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton-X 100 in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) in DPBS) for each channel. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Repeat the washing step 9.2.2.1.",
    "Block the cells on the chip by using 200 µL of blocking solution (10% NDS in DPBS) for each channel. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nDilute the primary antibodies in antibody solution (5% NDS in DPBS) as follows: anti-Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO-1) (1:100, epithelial tight junction marker), anti-Occludin (1:100, epithelial tight junction marker), anti-Claudin 4 (1:100, epithelial tight junction marker), anti-E-cadherin (1:100, epithelial adherens junctions marker (Table of Materials). Perfuse 200 µL of the primary antibody solution through each channel and incubate overnight at 4 °C. Repeat the washing step 9.2.2.1.\nDilute the secondary antibodies in antibody solution (1:300, 5% NDS in DPBS). Perfuse 200 µL of this solution through each channel and incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Repeat the washing step 9.2.2.1. If desired, phalloidin, a cytoskeletal marker, can be added to the secondary antibody solution.\nPrepare a 50 µg/mL of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution in DPBS and use it to perfuse 200 µL through each channel. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min. Repeat the washing step. At this point, stained chips can be stored for up to 14 days at 4°C.\nAssessment of Caspase 3 cleavage\n\t\t\nIsolate and quantify the total amount of protein of epithelial cells as described in step 8.3.2. Omit the washing step 8.3.2.1. Dilute the samples with DPBS to a final concentration of 400 µg/mL.\nQuantify the levels of total and cleaved caspase 3 using caspase 3 detection kit following the manufacturer's protocol.\nAssessment of proinflammatory cytokines secretion\n\t\t\nUse the effluents collected from the outlet of both channels of the colon chip to quantify secreted acute-phase proinflammatory cytokines, following protocols provided by the manufacturer.
