AGO-CLIP-seqCell culture and HCMV infectionNote: To propagate HCMV and prepare the HCMV stock, we have followed the previous instruction (Britt, 2010).HFF cells are obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in five 100-mm culture dishes with complete DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM GlutaMAX-I, and 1x P/S at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2.Wash twice with PBS.Add HCMV-containing serum-free DMEM at an MOI of 3 with a total volume of 2 ml/dish and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h rocking by hand gently but thoroughly at an interval of 15 min.Decant the virus media, wash twice with PBS and add 10 ml 10% FBS, P/S, L-Glu DMEM/dish.Incubate for the indicated time (24, 48 and 72 h).UV irradiationWash once with 3 ml/dish of Cold PBS.Add 2 ml/dish of Cold PBS in four of five dishes and extract total RNAs from one of five dish to construct libraries for mRNA-seq and smallRNA-seq (go to step B1a).Irradiate with 254-nm UV at 250 mJ/cm2 on ice in Spectrolinker.Decant PBS completely.Prepared cells were stored at -80 °C until subsequent steps.Preparation of antibody-conjugated DynabeadsTransfer 50 µl of Sheep α-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated Dynabead per sample into 1.5 ml tube.

Visualization of PCR products. The region that should be excised by razor is indicated by the  red-dotted rectangle. Over-amplified PCR (Over PCR) products are frequently found in >22 PCR cycles if AGO-CLIP-seq is well-performed. We recommend collecting at least five PCR reactions to gather a large enough quantity for library construction and high-throughput sequencing.Library construction for mRNA-seq and smallRNA-seqLibrary for mRNA-seqNote: The mRNAseq libraries can be prepared as previously described (Guo et al., 2010) with the following modifications.With one of five dishes (from step A2b), extract total RNA using Trizol® reagent according to manufacturer’s instruction.Enrich poly(A)+ RNAs using Dynabeads® mRNA DIRECT™ Purification Kit according to manufacturer’s instruction with 5 μg of total RNA.0.2 μg of oligo (dT)-enriched RNAs are fragmented using the NEBnext Magnesium RNA Fragmentation module.",

Adaptor-ligated RNAs are reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified following the protocol described for AGO-CLIP-seq, except that cDNAs are amplified for 17 cycles in PCR.Library for smallRNA-seq: The smallRNA-seq libraries are prepared using the method described for mRNA-seq libraries except for differences in the initial RNA harvest steps: 5 μg of total RNAs are electrophoresed in a 10% TBE-Urea Gel, and 18–25-nt RNA species are purified for further steps.High-throughput sequencingAmplified cDNA libraries are sequenced by using Illumina HiSeq2000 for 1 x 51 cycles at single read/quadruplexed.Data processing and bioinformaticsPreprocessing:Sequencing reads are preprocessed before reads alignment by using CutAdap (v. 1.2.1) to remove adapter sequences, fastx_artifacts_filter in FASTX-Toolkit (v. 0.0.13.2, http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) to filter artifact reads, and then remove low quality read sequences. The options used in CutAdap software are \"-m 17 --match-read-wildcards -O 10 -e 0.10\". To calculate the relative fraction of reads mapped to human rRNA or tRNA, apply Bowtie2 (v. 2.1.0) aligning software to the rRNA reference sequences from Rfam (http://rfam.samger.ac.ur/) (Burge et al., 2013) and the tRNA reference sequences from GtRNAdb (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/) (Chan and Lowe, 2009). To be as comprehensive as possible, expand these sequence sets to include homologous sequences found in the human genome (hg19) with BLAST+ (v. 2.2.27) software (Camacho et al., 2009).",
    "Genomes and databases:All alignments and analyses are conducted based on human hg19 reference sequences and the HCMV Towne genome.The genome annotations for genes, lincRNAs, miscRNAs, mt tRNAs, snoRNAs, and snRNAs are downloaded from the UCSC genome table browser and the BioMart in Ensembl for human and NCBI for HCMV, respectively. The miRNA annotations of human and HCMV miRNAs are downloaded from miRBase21 (http://mirbase.org/). Because most of HCMV-encoded miRNAs are annotated by studies using other kinds of HCMV strains, their annotated locations are not concordant to Towne genome.Blast searching is conducted with miRNAs whose annotation is based on AD169 genome to HCMV Towne and miRNAs to obtain the annotation of HCMV miRNA annotations (Stark et al., 2012).Gene expression measurement:Calculate the expression levels of mRNAs and miRNAs using the Tuxedo suite. To determine the gene expression level, apply Tophat2 (v. 2.0.9) with \"--no-coverage-search --b2-very-sensitive --no-nevel-junc\" options and cufflinks (v. 2.1.1) with \"-q --no-update-check\" options for the calculation of RPKM (reads per kilo base of transcript per million fragments mapped) scores.Apply Bowtie2 (v. 2.1.0) with \"-k 101, --score-min C,0,0 (no mismatch) or --score-min C,-8,0 (for 1 mismatch) -mp 8,8 --np 8 --very-sensitive\" options for the determination of miRNA expression levels with up to one mismatch to calculate RPM (reads per million reads mapped) scores. Quantify expression levels of miRNAs from AGO-CLIP-seq data similarly to smallRNA sequencing data. An additional mismatch (--score-min C, -16,0 option in Bowtie2) for AGO-CLIP-seq alignments can be allowed, because AGO-CLIP-seq is more error-prone.AGO binding site detection:As AGO-CLIP-seq reads indicate AGO-RNA interactions, a cluster of AGO-CLIP-seq reads (“peak”) suggests an AGO binding site. To exclude random AGO-RNA interactions, a peak detection method is devised to measure significant enrichment of AGO-CLIP-seq reads compared to mRNA-seq reads using Fisher's exact test.",
    "Note: This test compares the expression level of a given 60-bp and 1-Mbps local background region in AGO-CLIP-seq and mRNA-seq, respectively. The resulting P-value is used to define a peak region and to evaluate the significance of the peak.Read preparation and alignment1.)Non-miRNA reads are collected and filtered from AGO-CLIP-seq data. 2.)Align AGO-CLIP-seq reads and mRNA-seq reads onto the human genome using TopHat2 with a less stringent mode (added --b2-score-min L, -0.6, 0.9 in mRNAseq options) to allow for slightly more sequencing errors in AGO-CLIP-seq. 3.)For each genomic position, calculate the aligned reads for AGO-CLIP-seq and mRNA-seq to identifying the peak region. 4.)Since mRNA sequencing has a coverage bias across the transcript, the average over the transcript length is taken for each transcript to identify peaks.Peak detection1.)To detect significant peaks from AGO-CLIP-seq data, apply Fisher's exact test using mapped reads in 60-bp candidate peak regions and in the surrounding 1-Mbp background region.2.)Window size is determined by the AGO footprint spans about 60 bp (Chi et al., 2009), and the background was set to be large enough. 3.)Adjust p-values using Q-VALUE (v. 1.1) from the Storey lab (http://genomics.princeton.edu/storeylab/qvalue) with default settings for multiple comparison correction. 4.)Define peaks with false discovery rates (FDRs) less than 0.01 as significant. 5.)Combine overlapping peaks in a merged peak site to avoid redundancy. 6.)Use peaks located in human exon regions for the analysis of AGO binding sites on human mRNAs.Increased CLIPseq constraint:1.)To detect target sites of a specific miRNA on 3'-UTR in mRNAs, examine whether a peak site includes a seed pairing site with canonical seeds sites (8mer, 7mer-A1, 7merm8, and 6mer) of both human and viral miRNAs by searching in the defined peak region (60 bp, longer for merged peaks).",
    "Based on this search, peaks in case that there is no seed pairing site in its region can be excluded. 2.)To identify more robust targets of viral miRNA, “Increased CLIP-seq” constraint is applied, representing as the level of enriched AGO-CLIP-seq reads relative to the previous time of viral infection. 3.)To measure the enrichment score for a given microRNA target site, we introduce a relative score called, the “ACE-score (AGO-CLIP-seq Enrichment score)”. ACE-score is defined as the Log ratio of normalized counts at a given time point to the normalized counts at the previous time after viral infection (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160421/20160421203409_2058.jpgFigure 5.
