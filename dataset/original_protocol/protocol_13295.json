    "The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, RP 41/2018. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study.\n1. Sample preparation\nCentrifuge EPS-urine samples within 2 h of collection at 2,100 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT). Store the supernatant at -80 °C until use.\n2. Sample thawing\nTransfer the sample from -80 °C to -20 °C the day before digestion.\nPrior to sample processing, transfer the sample for 15-20 minutes at 4 °C and then at RT.\n3. Reagent preparation for FASP\nOn the same day, prepare the following solutions: urea buffer, 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in urea buffer, 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate and 500 mM dithiothreitol (DTT).\nPrepare urea buffer (urea 8 M, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8): for 10 mL, weigh 4,800 mg of urea and dissolve it in the appropriate amount of HPLC water after adding 1 mL of 1 M Tris pH 8. A volume of 800 µL of urea is needed for each sample.\nPrepare 500 mM dithiothreitol (DTT): dissolve 38.5 mg of DTT in 500 µL of HPLC water. For each sample, 66.7 µL of DTT are needed.\nPrepare 50 mM IAA in Urea Buffer: dissolve 9.25 mg of IAA in 1 mL of urea buffer. For each sample 50 µL of IAA are needed.\nPrepare 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Add 150 µL of 1 M TEAB to 2.85 mL of HPLC water. For each sample 460 µL of TEAB are needed.\nPrepare a solution of trypsin (100 ng/µL) in HPLC water. This solution can be stored at -80 °C and thawed immediately before use. For each sample, 2 µL (200 ng) are needed.\n4. Protein digestion by FASP",
    "Dilute 500 µL of each EPS-urine sample with 66.7 µL of 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 66.7 µL of 500 mM DTT and 33.3 µL of 1 M Tris pH 8 to solubilize proteins and to reduce disulphide bonds. Incubate 10 minutes at 95 °C with gentle shaking.\nAdd 300 µL of diluted EPS-urine sample on the filter unit (10 kDa) and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 20 minutes.\nAdd 200 µL of urea buffer to the filter and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 minutes. Repeat this step and then discard the flow-through.\nAdd 50 µL of IAA solution and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 25 minutes.\nAdd 200 µL of urea buffer and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 20 minutes. Repeat this step and then discard the flow-through.\nAdd 200 µL of 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB) and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 20 minutes. Repeat this step.\nTransfer the filter unit into a new collection tube.\nAdd 60 µL of 50 mM TEAB buffer and 200 ng of trypsin and incubate the sample in a thermo-mixer at 37 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: To avoid sample evaporation during overnight incubation, wrap each filter unit with a layer of aluminum foil and then a layer of parafilm.\nAfter trypsin incubation, add 140 µL of water and centrifuge the vial at 14,000 x g for 25 minutes to collect the volume of digest (180-200 µL).\n5. Reagent preparation for SCX purification\nPrepare 1 mL of wash 1 (0.5% formic acid (FA) and 20% acetonitrile (ACN)) as follows: add 50 µL of 10% FA and 200 µL of 100% ACN to 750 µL of HLPC water. For each sample, 100 µL of wash 1 are needed.",
    "Prepare 1.5 mL of wash 2 (0.5% FA and 80% of ACN) as follows: add 75 µL of 10 % FA and 1.2 mL of 100% ACN to 225 µL of HPLC water. For each sample 190 µL of wash 2 are needed.\nPrepare 100 µL of eluting solution (500 mM ammonium acetate (AA) and 20% of ACN): add 25 µL of 2 M AA and 20 µL of 100% ACN to 55 µL of HPLC water.\nPrepare StageTips as follows.\n\t\nPack a 200 µL pipette tip with a layer of SCX resin using a blunt-ended syringe needle (gauge 16). Insert the StageTip into a microcentrifuge lid that has been previously pierced in order to accommodate the microcolumn.\nAssemble the lid onto a 2 mL microcentrifuge from which the original lid was removed. The micro-SPE centrifugal device just assembled should fit into a benchtop centrifuge. Since perforated lids are tedious to prepare, they can be utilized multiple times.\n6. SCX purification\nDilute 30 µL of each sample to 120 µL using wash 2.\nCondition the StageTip by adding 50 µL of wash 1 on top of the extraction resin and centrifuge at 400 x g for 2 minutes. Since flow resistance depends on how strongly the extraction resin was packed into the pipette tip, centrifuge speed may need to be adjusted in order to obtain a flow rate of 20-30 µL/min. Try not to leave the tip dry during sample loading and washing.\nEquilibrate the StageTip with 50 µL of wash 2 and centrifuge at 400 x g for 2 minutes.\nLoad the diluted sample (120 µL) using a lower spin speed.\nWash the StageTip with 50 µL of wash 2 and centrifuge at 400 x g for 2 minutes. Repeat with 50 µL of wash 1.",
    "NOTE: After this wash the resin must be completely dry.\nElute peptide mixture with 7 µL of eluate solution (500 mM ammonium acetate (AA) and 20% of ACN) slowly using a lower spin speed.\nAdd 27 µL of 0.1% FA to dilute AA and to obtain a sample for LC-MS/MS preliminary injection. The final dilution to 34 µL will result into a 1:1 volumetric ratio between urine and peptide solution (1 µL of purified digest will correspond to 1 µL of original urine sample).\n7. Protein quantification by external standard using DDA analysis (Figure 2)\nDetermine protein amount in samples by injecting 2 µL of the resulting peptide digest in LC-MS/MS and interpolating the resulting total peptide area with a calibration curve built as follows:\nPrepare five different HeLa digest solutions (1 ng/µL, 2.5 ng/µL, 7.5 ng/µL, 25 ng/µL, 75 ng/µL) using a HeLa digest stock (100 µg/µL).\nInject each Hela solution in duplicate (2 µL).\nSet the LC-MS/MS method.\n\t\nInject 2 µL of the five HeLa peptide mixtures and separate peptides through a linear gradient of 75 minutes at a flow rate of 230 nL/minute on a 15 cm, 75 µm i.d column packed with 3 µm C18 silica particles. Use a binary gradient constituted by mobile phase A (0.1% FA, 2% ACN) and mobile phase B (0.1% FA and 80% of ACN).\nPerform gradient elution by increasing mobile phase B content from 6% to 42% in 60 minutes and from 42% to 100% in additional 8 minutes. Maintain for 5 minutes 100% B and then move back to 0% B in two minutes.",
    "Operate in DDA mode using a top-12 method and set MS full scan range at 350-1800 m/z, resolution 70,000, ACG target 1e6 and maximum injection time 50 ms. Set the mass window for precursor ion isolation at 1.6 m/z, resolution 35,000, ACG target 1e5, maximum injection time 120 ms, HCD fragmentation at of 25 NCE (normalized collision energy) and dynamic exclusion 15 seconds.\nAnalyze raw files using Sequest as search engine, and the HUMAN Uniprot Complete protein sequence as the database. In the experiments presented here, the database was downloaded on March 2016 and contained 42.013 sequences.\n\t\nUse the following settings: MS tolerance 15 ppm, MS/MS tolerance 0.02 Da, trypsin as enzyme by setting two missed cleavage sites. Set the carbamidomethylation of lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine (+57.021) and the oxidation of methionines as dynamic modifications and the carbamidomethylation of cysteines (+57.021) as static modifications. Use the cut-off of false discovery rate (FDR) for peptides and proteins identification to 0.01 and filter out by percolator.\nCalculate the peak area for all MS1 peptide signals. Calculate the total area of the peptides.\nInject 2 µL of peptide mixtures obtained from EPS-urine samples using the same LC-MS/MS method used for the HeLa samples and analyze the raw file using the same parameters used for HeLa data processing.\nCalculate total intensity of peptide signals by summing up area values of all identified peptides and interpolate the external standard curve. This will provide an acceptable estimation of peptide amount present in the EPS-urine protein digest.\n8. Reagent preparation for C18 StageTip protocol\nPrepare 500 µL of solution A (0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 50% ACN): add 250 µL of 100% ACN and 10 µL of 5% TFA to 240 µL of HPLC water.",
    "Prepare 2 mL of solution B (0.1 % TFA): add 40 µL of 5% TFA to 1960 µL of HPLC water.\nPrepare 100 µL of eluting solution (0.1% FA, 50% ACN): add 1 µL of 10% FA and 50 µL of 100% ACN to 49 µL of HPLC water.\nPrepare StageTips as previously described. In this case, C18 extraction disks are used.\n9. SCX/C18 StageTip protocol\nNOTE: Purify EPS-urine digests by C18 StageTip protocol to remove salts.\nStart from 2 µg of peptides (as quantified by the preliminary injection). Dilute the digest solution 4-fold in wash 2 SCX and proceed as described above (in section \"SCX purification\"). Elute the peptide mixture with 7 µL of eluate solution (500 mM ammonium acetate (AA) and 20% of ACN) slowly using a lower spin speed (5 µL/min flow rate).\nAcidify the SCX eluate with 150 µL of 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in order to achieve a pH lower than 3 and a concentration of organic solvent below 5%.\nCondition the C18 StageTip with 50 µL of solution A and centrifuge at 400 x g for 2 minutes.

Add 47 µL of 0.1% FA. Expected peptide concentration will be 40 ng/ µL. Analyze by LC-MS/MS in DIA mode.\n10. DIA Analysis (Figure 3)",
    "nanoLC separation: Separate the peptide mixture using a linear gradient of 140 minutes at a flow rate of 230 nL/min on a 15 cm, 75 µm ID column packed with 3 µm C18 silica particles.\n\t\nPerform gradient elution at 230 nL/minute flow rate and increase mobile phase B content from 3% to 25% in 90 minutes, then from 25% to 40% in 30 minutes and finally from 40% to 100% in 8 minutes.\nAfter 10 minutes at 100% B, equilibrate the column with mobile phase A for 15 min.\nMass spectrometric parameters: perform DIA analysis using a method employing the following scan cycle: (i) a full scan MS event at a resolution of 17,500 (AGC target 1e6, maximum injection time 50 ms) followed by (ii) 20 windows at 20 m/z isolation width, starting from m/z 350, (ii) 5 windows at 50 m/z isolation width and (iv) 1 window at 200 m/z isolation width, ending the scan range of DIA at 1200 m/z. Perform DIA scans at resolution 35,000 (AGC target 5e5, maximum injection time 120 ms and 25 NCE).\n11. High- pH reversed phase C18 fractionation for library generation\nNOTE: Pool EPS-urine representative samples in an amount of higher than 10 µg in order to build a data-dependent library for DIA analysis by the following procedure:\nAcidify the peptide mixture (11 µg) by 0.2% of TFA and load the resulting solution onto a C18 StageTip packed with two layers of extraction disks to allow higher capacity. We estimated the loading capacity of a single micro disk (from a 16 gauge syringe needle) to be in the 5-10 µg range.\nCondition and equilibrate stationary phase as already described for C18 purification.",
    "Carry out peptide fractionation by stepwise elution (n=10) from high pH reversed phase C18 using elution solutions containing 0.2% of ammonium hydroxide, 10 mM TEAB, and increasing v/v concentrations of ACN (4%, 8%, 12%, 16%, 20%, 24%, 28%, 32%, 40%, 80%).\nAnalyze the 10 fractions using the same chromatographic parameters of the DIA method. Operate the mass spectrometer in DDA mode using the settings previously adopted for the preliminary analysis (see \"Protein quantification by external standard using DDA analysis\").\n12.
