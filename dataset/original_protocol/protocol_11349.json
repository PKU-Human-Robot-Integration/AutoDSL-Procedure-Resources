    "Animal housing and experimental procedure were approved by the French Government (agreements #C44-278 and #APAFIS 03479.01). Animal care and procedures were conducted under directive EU 2010/63/EU and French Law #2013-118 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.\n1. Evaluation of the Drug Interaction Between mAb 8B6 and Topotecan In Vitro\n96-well sample preparation\n\tCAUTION: Consult the institution's Health and Safety committee and follow local regulation rules related to laboratory safety. Review the Material and Safety Data Sheet information before working with any media, cell lines, or reagents. Use proper sterile technique and work in a laminar flow hood. All solutions/equipment that are used to manipulate cells must be sterile.\n\tNOTE: The following protocol was designed for use with adherent cells. Modifications are required to apply the method to nonadherent cells growing in suspension; this protocol uses quadruplicate for each experimental condition.\n\t\nGrow IMR5 cells in a T75 flask.\nOn the first day (day 0), observe the cell culture under a microscope to check the cell confluency. Aspirate the cell medium from the flask, wash it with 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and add 3 mL of 0.05% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)/PBS solution. Return the flask to the incubator for 3 min (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nExamine the cell culture under a microscope for cell detachment.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, return the flask to the incubator for an additional 3 to 5 min, depending on tumor cell type.\nAdd 10 mL of complete cell medium to the flask and transfer the cell suspension to a sterile 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 x g. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.",

Then, click OK.\nType the file name of the analysis file and click SAVE to generate the report.\n\t\tNOTE: After clicking OK, the report will automatically open in the computer's default web browser.\nTo print the report, choose Print from the web browser's file menu. The report contains a Summary Table Section that includes title, date, file name, description note, parameters (m, Dm, and r), ED50 for either agent used in monotherapy or in combination, and the CI table for each combination at ED50, ED75, ED90, and ED95.\n\t\tNOTE: A CI value of <1 indicates synergism, a CI value of =1 indicates additivity, and a CI value of >1 indicates antagonism.\n2. Generation of Human Neuroblastoma Xenografts in Nonobese Diabetic NOD Scid Gamma Mice (NSG Mice)\nNOTE: Exclude any contamination of the cell culture. Since the basement membrane matrix forms a gel above 5 °C, all cultureware or media coming in contact with the basement membrane matrix reagent should be prechilled/ice-cold. Keep the basement membrane matrix on ice during the entire process.\nPreparation of the IMR5 cell suspension\nThaw the basement membrane matrix reagent overnight by submerging the vial in ice in a 4 °C refrigerator before use.\nOn day 0, harvest the cultured IMR5 cells as detailed above.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.",
    "Discard the supernatant. Wash the cells 2x with 15 mL of ice-cold PBS, and prepare a cell suspension of 5 x 107 cells/mL in ice-cold PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSwirl the basement membrane matrix vial.\n\t\tNOTE: The basement membrane matrix reagent should be thawed and dispersed.\nAdd one volume of basement membrane matrix reagent and mix it by pipetting to obtain a cell suspension of 2.5 x 107 cells /mL.\nKeep the cell suspension on ice.\nPreparation of the mice\n\tNOTE: The mice should be six to seven weeks old.\n\t\nMaintain mice under a specific pathogen-free condition.\nAllow a three- to five-day acclimatization period after the mice have arrived.\nOn the day of inoculation, shave the flank where the injection will be done (see step 2.3.6).\nPreparation of the tumor cell injection\n\tNOTE: Keep the ice-cold basement membrane matrix cell suspension aseptic throughout the procedure.\n\t\nMix the cells and carefully draw the cell suspension into a 1 mL syringe mounted with a 21 G needle.\nCheck to be sure that there are no air bubbles in the syringe.\nDisinfect the inoculation area of the mouse with an antiseptic solution.\nGently squeeze the mouse's skin on the flank between fingers, at the injection site.\nInsert the needle exactly into the skin fold. Do not place the needle deep into the tissue to ensure a subcutaneous injection.\nInject 100 µL of IMR5 cell suspension (i.e., 2.5 x 106 cells) subcutaneously into the lower right flank of the mice.\nRotate the syringe to prevent leakage and withdraw the needle.\nMonitoring of body weight changes and tumor growth\nMeasure the length (A) and the width (B) of the tumor with a caliper.\nCalculate the tumor volume using the formula (A x B2) x 0.5.",
    "Start therapy when the tumors have reached an average volume of ~50 - 60 mm3.\n3. Drug and Antibody Administration in Mice\nIntravenous administration of mAb 8B6\nCarefully fill a 1 mL syringe mounted with a 25 G needle with mAb solution.\nPlace the mouse under a heat lamp for 10 min to dilate the tail vein.\nRestrain the mouse in a rodent restrainer.\nDisinfect the inoculation area of the mouse with an antiseptic solution.\nInsert the needle parallel to the tail vein, penetrating 2 - 4 mm into the lumen while keeping the bevel of the needle face upward (Figure 3A).\nInject 100 µL of antibody solution intravenously (i.v.).\nWhen the injection is finished, gently pressure the injection site to prevent bleeding.\nIntraperitoneal administration of topotecan\nDraw the drug solution in a 1 mL syringe mounted with a 25 G needle.\nHold the mouse in a supine position, with its posterior end slightly elevated.\nDisinfect the inoculation area of the mouse with an antiseptic solution.\nLocate the mouse's abdomen midline and mentally divide the abdomen into quadrants. Locate the injection site in the right or left lower quadrant (Figure 3B).\nInsert the needle into the abdomen (5 mm deep) at ~10° angle, in the right or left lower quadrant.\nInject 100 µL of drug solution intraperitoneally (i.p.).\nDisinfect the inoculation site.\nSubscription Required.
