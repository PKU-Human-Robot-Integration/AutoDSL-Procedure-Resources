    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBefore recording\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThese procedures involve immobilizing flies, applying conductive solution to the fly. After placing the electrodes, it’s ready for recording.\nAnesthetize flies with carbon dioxide (CO2), then use high precision tweezers to hold the fly wings and gently glue the wings on a plastic board with double-sided adhesive tape.\nNote: Tilt the body of the flies approximately 45° to completely expose one compound eye to the light beam (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nFix the thorax and abdomen of the flies with single-sided adhesive tape with a width of 1/4 of fly body length.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1553-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Immobilized flies\nBlue arrows point to the location of each material (Wu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1553-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Fly before recording\nConductive solution is smeared on the surface of the compound eye and thorax, then two glass microelectrodes are placed on the thorax and compound eye (Wu and Han, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: This not only ensures the integrity of the compound eye structure but also mitigates movement of the eye during electrode placement (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nCritical: 1) To keep the eye intact, do not touch the compound eye during this step. Exposure of one whole compound eye is important for recording. 2) The number of immobilized flies at one time should not exceed six to ensure the recording time will not be too long, which results in decline of vitality or even death of the flies. Preferably, the time for fixing and recording steps should be less than two hours.\nPlace the flies under a microscope.\nWith an objective lens at 20×, take a small amount of conductive solution with an electrode and daub thinly over the entire surface of the compound eye and the thorax.",
    "Apply the appropriate amount of conductive solution, once the surface becomes transparent and bright.\nNote: Carry out these operations in a Faraday cage covered with a shade cloth, and filter the source light using an OG 590 nm filter.\nCritical: Pay attention to the amount of conductive solution smeared: too little solution will dry during the experimental process, whereas too much solution will electrically bridge the compound eye and thorax, which will prohibit the acquisition of physiological signals (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nPlace the electrodes.\nPress the reference electrode gently onto the thorax at the position coated with conductive solution by manipulating the left-hand three-axis micromanipulator.\nNext, carefully place the recording electrode onto the surface of the compound eye by using the right-hand three-axis micromanipulator.\nManually change the position of the light beam to point directly at the compound eye of the fly.\nNote: Carry out these operations in a Faraday cage covered with a shade cloth, and filter the source light using an OG 590 nm filter (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nCritical: Pay attention to the electrodes’ pressure on the respective body parts. Keep the compound eyes and thorax intact without any dents, to ensure the normal state of the flies. Fix approximately six flies to keep the experiment as short as possible and to ensure free breathing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1553-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Pre-test ERG measurement\n(A) The state of flies for pre-recording to evaluate the ERG signal.\n(B) Pre-recording data. Upper, rough, and unstable recording trace. Examine the condition, electrodes, etc., then redo the pre-recording; Lower, an ideal smooth and stable pre-recording trace (Wu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nPre-recording\nTiming: ∼7 min\nThese procedures include checking whether the equipment is working well and whether the flies are in normal physiological condition.\nSet up the equipment and prepare flies for recording.",
    "Cover the Faraday cage with shade cloth completely to protect the compound eye from ambient light.\nRun Axoscope 10.6 software, control the light on/off stimulation via the electronic shutter controller to assess the compound eye’s light response.\nUse the shutter output simultaneously as the second channel that records a high or low stimulus signal to tag the exact time point at which lights are turned on or off.\nNote: Signals are not amplified by an Intracellular Electrometer. The signal is sampled at 4 kHz.\nDeliver light flash trains by a collimating beam probe. Position this probe approximately 4–6 cm away towards the fly’s eye. Adjust the light intensity and spectrum based on experimental purpose (see details in ‘ERG recording[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]’) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nIf a signal with proper amplitude that depends on the intensity and spectrum of light, is observed, proceed to the next step. If not, please redo steps 4–5 (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nTurn off the light, stop the software, and let the flies adapt to the darkness for a few minutes to ensure that the light-dependent translocations have enough adaptation processing.\nCritical: Dark adaptation is necessary for reliable measurements. We usually allow flies to adapt to darkness for at least 5 mins to ensure that Ca2+ dependent fast light adaptation mechanisms such as rhodopsin and pigment granule migration.\nERG recording\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThese procedures below outline four ERG recording protocols that satisfy various experimental needs.\nRun Axoscope 10.6 to record the retinal potential of flies.\nNormal ERG recording.\nBefore ERG recording, perform a pre-test to determine the stimulus intervals that are sufficient for dark adaptation.\nPresent stimuli with increasing intervals to find an interval where the response to the onset of the second light is not attenuated compared to the one to the first light.",
    "Note: As this interval is invariant to genotypes, the same interval (10 s) is used in the following experiments. In the protocol, the stimulus sequence is as follows: 10 s darkness, 5 s light stimulus with a light intensity of 400 lux that is measured by an illuminometer, 10 s darkness, and 5 s light stimulus.\nRecord flies twice in succession with the same stimulus.\nNote: For example, we used this protocol to test these flies w1118 (white eye color), Lai-Gal4/UAS-TeTxLC (orange eye color), Lai-Gal4/+ (orange eye color), and UAS-TeTxLC/+ (orange eye color) flies (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nNote: For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to these publications (Hu et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Wu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nTesting for light intensity.\nRecording flies with different light intensity stimulations can examine the excitability and light sensitivity of photoreceptors. Use Stimulations to measure intensity-response curves.\nBefore recording, perform a pre-test at all light intensity levels to determine the level at which the amplitude is not attenuated compared to the maximum amplitude that can be achieved.\nNote: Measure the light intensity with an illuminometer.\nDetermine the stimulus sequence according to the results of the pre-test.\nNote: Set the first light intensity as 1/10,000 of the maximum intensity, then gradually increase the light intensity until the flies produce detectable physiological responses of the eyes. At this point, mark the light intensity, then gradually increase the light intensity to record the flies’ response to the highest light intensity. The stimulus sequence is as follows: 5 s darkness, 1 s light stimulus with different light intensity levels, and 5 s darkness.\nNote: For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to this publication (Hu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nTesting for inactivation.",
    "Note: The receptor potential of the trp mutant appears normal in response to a flash but quickly decays close to baseline during prolonged illumination. Therefore, we need to judge and determine the different durations of a light stimulus for different genotypes or ages of flies.\nBefore recording, perform a pre-test for the duration of light stimulus in which the response is not decaying.\nDetermine the stimulus sequence according to the results of the pre-test.\nFor trp mutant flies, the stimulus sequence is as follows: 90 s darkness, 1 s orange light stimulus with a light intensity of 400 lux, 90 s darkness, and 1 s orange light stimulus. Record the responses twice to this stimulation.\nNote: As an example, this protocol can be used to test the following flies: w1118 (white eye color) and trp343 (white eye color), etc.\nNote: For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to this publication (Han et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nTesting with different wavelength stimuli.",
    "Note: The photoreceptors of Drosophila have distinct spectral sensitivities that allow them to distinguish stimuli of different wavelengths. Photoreceptors R1–R6 have the same spectral sensitivity, and these cells express a blue absorbing visual pigment, Rhodopsin 1 (Rh1). In contrast, photoreceptors R7 and R8 exhibit heterogeneity, and these cells express four different spectra absorbing visual pigments. R7 cells express one of two different UV absorbing visual pigments, either Rhodopsin 3 (Rh3) or Rhodopsin 4 (Rh4). R8 cells express either blue absorbing Rhodopsin 5 (Rh5) or green absorbing Rhodopsin 6 (Rh6). Despite the fact that the ERG signal is mostly composed of R1-6 photoreceptor responses, it represents the voltage created by all of the light-evoked responding cells in the head. The phenotypes of R7/R8-related phototransduction mutants may not be significant enough to detect the reduction of amplitude through normal ERG which reflects the field potential of photoreceptors R1-R8. Mutants connected to different photoreceptor cells can be screened using various spectrum stimuli that can evoke a depolarizing receptor potential in the dark. If a sufficiently bright light is used to photoconvert >>20% of rhodopsin to Metarhodopsin, the depolarizing potential persists in the dark (PDA); it is then terminated by orange (580 nm) stimulus (Pak et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). As a result, mutants with more than 20% residual rhodopsin can be identified by PDA. We can improve the efficiency and efficacy of ERG-based screening for identifying phototransduction-defective mutants by using PDA. Before recording, perform a pre-test at all light intensity levels and different spectra to ensure that the PDA is occurred.",
    "When a colored light stimulus is applied to compound eyes, the photoreceptors undergo substantial photoconversion. When the light stimulus is removed, the photoreceptors elicit a depolarizing receptor potential in the dark. We can determine the stimulus sequence that generates PDA in dark conditions based on these properties.\nFor PDA, the stimulus sequence is: 1–5 s darkness, 1–5 s 580 nm light stimulus with high-intensity, 1–5 s darkness, 1–5 s 480 nm light stimulus with high-intensity or other spectra, 1–5 s darkness, 1–5 s 480 nm light stimulus with high-intensity or other spectra, 1–5 s darkness, 1–5 s 580 nm light stimulus with high-intensity or other spectra, 1–5 s darkness, 1–5 s 580 nm light stimulus with high-intensity, and 1–5 s darkness.\nNote: For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to this publication (Han et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nSample the signal at 4 kHz.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1553-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Traces of ERG recording\nERG recording traces of w1118, Lai-GAL4/+, UAS-TeTxLC/+, and flies expressing TeTxLC using a Lai-GAL4 driver. The first red dashed lines indicate the light offset and the second red dashed lines indicate the cut-off time, the lines define the window for data to analysis. The bottom trace represents the light monitor (Wu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: During recording, the compound eye signal is not amplified by the Intracellular Electrometer high impedance amplifiers.\nSave the data in .abf format, which can store several data points based on sampled frequency, to conveniently use the fitting function of Clampfit software to analyze data and record the corresponding information about the flies (genotype, age, gender, etc.).\nGroup size should vary depending on the context of the experiment, but the sample size needs to achieve statistical power.",
    "Note: During the experiment, the temperature should be maintained at 25°C, and the humidity should be controlled in the appropriate range of 60%–80%. A stable and uniform environment helps to obtain reliable and consistent results.\nAfter recording\nTiming: ∼4 h\nThe following steps will give you a brief description of how to analyze the ERG traces you got from the previous steps.\nAnalyze the recorded data files with Clampfit 10.6.\nSelect the trace at any given time you want to analyze.\nFor example, measure the response decay after stimulus offset using the trace between the light offset and the light on.\nAnalyze the ERGs of control flies and Lai-Gal4/UAS-TeTxLC flies and compare the trace characteristics, according to a previous publication (Wu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nSelect the light off time as the start time point depending on the parallel second channel that tags the light on/off time, then select all 5 s recorded data of control flies and Lai-Gal4/UAS-TeTxLC flies to compare the decay trace difference with Graphpad Prism 7. See “quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]” for the calculation of decay time constants (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nExport data from the selected trace to an Excel sheet.\nNote: The detailed analysis method is described in the “quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]” section below."
