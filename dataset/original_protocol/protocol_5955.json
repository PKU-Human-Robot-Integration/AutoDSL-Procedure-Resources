    "Cell culture and sample generationSeed 3 x 105 cells per well in 3 ml of media in each well of a 6-well plate (Figure 1–step 1, in total 6 wells per replicate). Note: We used mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) generated from reprogrammable tamoxifen inducible SRSF3-knockout and control mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Ratnadiwakara et al., 2018). The culture conditions described here reflect the requirements for these cells. A detailed description of the generation and culture properties of the iPS cell lines used here can be found in (Ratnadiwakara et al., 2018) and the media composition can be found under Recipes. This protocol is applicable to a wide range of tissue culture cell lines and the culture properties should be adjusted depending on the cell line used.  Let the cells adhere to the culture dish for 4 h, after which treat the cells with 5 µM tamoxifen (4OHT) to induce Cre-activity and SRSF3 depletion (Figure 1–step 2).Note: We have tested a range of tamoxifen (4OHT) concentrations and 5 µM 4OHT results in high recombination efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity. After 24 h, collect the cells from the first well as the first-time point by brief trypsination (0.1% trypsin for 3 min at 37 °C) or by using a cell scraper; t = 0 (Figure 1–step 3). A rapid processing of samples is required for the accuracy of the time points.Spin down the collected cells at 470 x g for 3 min at 20 °C. Re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of TRI Reagent and freeze at -80 °C. To the remaining 5 wells, add 30 µl of 1 mg/ml Actinomycin D stock to obtain a final concentration of 10 µg/ml in 3 ml of culture media (Figure 1–step 3).",
    "Note: Make 1 mg/ml Actinomycin D stock in DMSO and freeze in aliquots at -20 °C. Dilute 30 µl of Actinomycin D stock in 100 µl of media and add dropwise to each well for uniform distribution. Collect samples at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h time points following Actinomycin D addition and freeze the cell pellet in 1 ml of TRI Reagent as described above (Figure 1–steps 4 and 5). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181031/20181031184841_9868.jpgFigure 1. Experimental setup and sample collection. Collect the samples at relevant time points and proceed to RNA extraction. RNA extractionThaw the cells frozen in TRI Reagent at room temperature for 10 min. Add 200 µl of chloroform and shake vigorously for 15 s and allow to stand for 10 min at room temperature.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the aqueous layer into a fresh tube and add 500 µl of 2-propanol and 1 µl of Glycogen.Note: Addition of glycogen helps the maximum recovery of the RNA and visualization of the RNA pellet.  Mix carefully and allow to stand at room temperature for 10 min to precipitate the RNA.Centrifuge the mixture at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet by adding 1 ml of 75% ethanol, vortex and centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Briefly air-dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 min.Note: Avoid over-drying the pellet as this will greatly decrease its solubility. Re-suspend RNA in 30 µl of RNase-free water and proceed to cDNA Synthesis. Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCRPerform DNaseI treatment on all samples to remove potential genomic DNA contamination that can affect the downstream analysis. We used Promega RQ1 DNase kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and use 1 µg of RNA per sample.",
    "Carry out the reverse transcription of the RNA samples using a reverse transcription kit. We used SuperScript III Reverse transcriptase according to the manufacture’s protocol with equal amounts of random hexamers and oligodT18 for reverse priming. In short, 1 µg of DNaseI-treated RNA is incubated with dNTPs and primers at 65 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition of SuperScript III reagents. The cDNA synthesis is performed at 50 °C for 1 h and the reaction terminated by incubation at 70 °C for 15 min.Note: A mixture of random hexamers and oligodT18 can improve the sensitivity of the cDNA synthesis. Dilute the cDNA 1:10 with nuclease-free water to be used as a template for quantitative PCR. Perform quantitative PCR with the primers specific for the gene of interest. Use the optimized manufacturer’s protocol for specific SYBR Green master mixes. We used 5 µl of Luminaries 2x HiGreen qPCR Master Mix per reaction, optimized concentration of each forward and reverse primers (typically 0.15-0.30 µM end concentration) and 2 µl of diluted cDNA per reaction. Perform two or more technical replicates for each sample."
