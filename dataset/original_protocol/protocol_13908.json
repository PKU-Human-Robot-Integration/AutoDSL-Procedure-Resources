    "The protocol has been approved by the local medical and ethics committees. All patients provided written informed consent.\n1. Preoperative Preparation\nEnsure the patients are diagnosed with CCF: All patients undergo digital subtraction angiography (DSA), routine bilateral internal and external carotid angiography, vertebral arteriography for assessment of feeding arteries, sizes, venous drainage patterns of CCFs, and carotid artery compression test with three-dimensional rotational angiographic capability.\nEnsure all the procedures are executed under general anesthesia.\n2. Vascular catheterization\nCatheter and sheath preparation\n\t\nPrepare a 5F vascular sheath and a 6F vascular sheath, a 100-cm length of 4F H1 catheter and a 90-cm length of 6F or 5F guiding catheter, two 150-cm length of microcatheters with the inner diameter of 0.017'.\nPrepare a 150-cm guidewire with the diameter of 0.035' and a 200-cm length of microwire with the diameter of 0.014'.\nConfirm the pulse of the femoral artery below the middle segment of the inguinal ligament, which is the site of puncture.\nPuncture the left femoral artery via percutaneous approach and put a 5F vascular sheath into it with modified Seldinger technique. Position a 4F H1 catheter into the common carotid artery related to the CCF through the sheath with continuous heparinized saline solution (1000 U heparin diluted per 500 mL) perfusion for angiography during the procedure.\nPuncture the right femoral vein via percutaneous approach and put a 6F vascular sheath into it with modified Seldinger technique. Position a 6F or 5F guiding catheter through the sheath with continuous heparinized saline solution (1000 U heparin diluted per 500 mL) perfusion in the internal jugular vein nearby the IPS.\nConfirm the IPS by delayed arterial roadmap with three-dimensional rotational angiographic capability. The IPS is a main draining vein of CS, which flows into the internal jugular vein.",
    "Coaxially navigate two microcatheters with a microwire into the CS through the IPS progressively step by step under the road mapping, and then gently inject the contrast medium (2 mL at 150 pounds per square inch) with the high-pressure injector from the microcatheter (selective venography) to confirm the position.\n\t\nTo do this, position one microcatheter into the proximal side of the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) through the IPS and another into the middle capacity of the CS.\nIn cases of occluded IPS, use another stiffer microwire to pass through the sinus. Inject 2000 U heparin after the femoral artery puncture.\n3. Embolization of CCF with detachable coils and EVOH\nDetach several coils into the proximal SOV and the anterior position of the CS through the microcatheters. However, identify the residual fistulas on the control angiogram after coil detachment. Place the tips of the microcatheters among the detached coils.\nFlush the microcatheter with 10 mL normal saline, followed by 0.25 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to fill the microcatheter dead space. Slowly inject 0.25 mL EVOH by hand into the dead space of the microcatheter and then start the embolization with the persistent injection of EVOH. The procedure is shown on angiography.\n\tNOTE: The EVOH is initially injected into the coil mesh and proximal position of the SOV. It penetrates the anterior compartment followed by the posterior compartment of the CS through two microcatheters with manually persistent injection.\nEnsure preserving the blood flow of the ICA by digital subtraction angiography.\n4. Estimation of treatment\nImmediately perform angiography after the procedure to check for the occlusion of the CCF6,7.\n\tNOTE: The immediate angiographic result is defined as complete disappearance, minor residual fistula, and significant residual fistula6,7.\n5. Postoperative Care\nLet the patient recover from general anesthesia.",
    "Check the patient on the following days for any discomfort, and for the improvement of symptoms in the hospital.\nFollow up the patients admitted to hospital accordingly for the digital subtraction angiography at 3-month, 1-year and 2-year after treatment to confirm further improvement or recurrence.\nSubscription Required.
