    "1. Reagents\nPurchase or develop luminescent bacteria and appropriate culture media such as modified Escherichia coli expressing the luxABCDE21, Vibrio fischeri, Photobacterium sp. Klebsiella pneumoniae22.\nPrepare physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) and culture media solutions according to standard recipes. E. coli and K. pneumoniae were grown in Luria Bertani (LB) at 37 °C, and V. fischeri and Photobacterium sp in LB supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl at 22 °C.\nPurchase or acquire fluorescent probes such as Q-tracker 705 (40 nm diameter, referred to as QD705), Q-tracker 800 (40 nm diameter, referred to as QD800), fluorescent (40 nm diameter) and non-fluorescent polystyrene microspheres (48 nm diameter), and conventional fluorescent dyes.\nPrepare the necessary reagents for bacterial labeling.\nEnsure access to a whole animal bioluminescence imager, such as an IVIS Spectrum, that is capable of detecting signal under a wide range of emission wavelengths and exposure times. A plate reader capable of bioluminescence measurements will suffice for most of the experiments described here.\n2. Basic Recapitulation of FUEL\nStarting from individual colonies on standard culture plates, start overnight cultures of luminescent bacteria. Here, V. fischeri were used.\nThe day of experimentation, initiate fresh subcultures and allow them to progress until an OD600 of 1-1.5 is achieved. In order to produce comparable results it is best to use bacteria in similar growth states in which they produce intense signals. This can be assured by keeping the OD600 constant.\nCombine aliquots of 100 μl from each with either 5 μl of QD705 or physiological saline (PS), and then add to 895 μl of PS into standard spectroscopic cuvettes. Place the filled cuvettes into the IVIS Spectrum and take the measurements under the appropriate filter sets. Here, the 710-730 nm emission filter was used.\n3. FUEL Over Varying Distances",
    "Fill two reduced volume (1 ml) plastic photometric cuvettes with either 50 μl of QD705 or 97.2 μl of non-fluorescent 48 nm polystyrene microspheres in a total volume of 1 ml PS. This ensures similar solid surface area per total volume between the two entities.\nPrepare a light source cuvette by encasing a third cuvette with standard black tape or some other opaque material capable of blocking light. Carefully prepare two identical optical windows on opposite sides of the cuvette.\nPlace the previously filled cuvettes directly onto either side of the light source cuvette. Add a 1 ml aliquot of V. fischeri or other culture (i.e. luminescent E. coli or Photobacterium sp) from a fresh subculture into the light source cuvette and cover it with an opaque material, such as black paper to reduce any light contamination.\nVisualize the three cuvettes under the appropriate emission filters such as the Total Light and 710-730 nm emission filters, with exposure times of 10, 30, and 30 sec, respectively.\nReposition both external cuvettes at equivalent further distances from the central cuvette, and then visualize again. Repeat until a final face-to-face (central to reduced volume cuvette) distance of 3cm is achieved. At each step, acquire a fluorescence image (450-480 nm excitation, 710-730 nm emission) to validate the QD705 location.\n4. Investigating Potential FUEL Pairs\nFill two reduced volume cuvettes with 1 ml solutions containing either a fluorophore or a fluorescent nanoparticle of interest in one, and PS or PS with non-fluorescent nanoparticles as the negative control in the other. In the work demonstrated here, a variety of potential commercially available FUEL fluorophores and fluorescent nanoparticles were investigated as outlined in Table 1.",
    "Add a 1 ml aliquot of fresh V. fischeri or other luminescent bacteria to a blacked-out third cuvette containing two physically equal optical windows situated on opposite sides. Cover the cuvette with an opaque substance such as a piece of black paper.\nAt a short but equal distance place the two reduced volume cuvettes on either side of the blacked-out cuvette and visualize under the appropriate filters. Here, a distance of 0.7 cm was used. Repeat with the other fluorophores.\n5. Targeted FUEL\nPrepare biotinylated antibodies specific to the luminescent bacteria. For example, here primary antibodies specific to K. pneumoniae (α-Kp) were biotinylated using a solution containing EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin.\nRemove excess reagent from the antibodies using desalting columns under centrifugation (1,500 x g) for 2 min.\nUse a standard Bradford assay to determine the protein concentration and determine the degree of antibody biotinylation by HABA assay.\nObtain the α-Kp-biot biotinylated antibody (Ab) batches by mixing 100 μl (10 mM, dissolved in 1x PBS) with 40 μl α-Kp antibody, resulting in a final degree of substitution of 16 biotin residues per Ab and a final protein concentration of 10 mg ml-1.\nUsing multiple overnight replicate cultures, target the washed bacteria with the aforementioned antibodies following the appropriate protocol.\n\t\nSpecifically, wash the K. pneumoniae in 1x PBS, and resuspend in 1x PBS to an OD of 4 (ca. 4 x 108 CFU ml-1 OD-1).\nFor each replicate, incubate 100 μl PBS, α-Kp antibodies (10 μl α-Kp-biotB or 10 μl PBS for the control) and 100 μl cells for 90 min at 30 °C. Wash the cells three times in 1x PBS, and resuspend in 196 μl PBS.\nLabel the cells with the QD705 streptavidin conjugate and divide them into two equivalent volumes.",
    "Wash one solution three times and then resuspend it into the appropriate volume.\nDistribute 100 μl of the washed and unwashed solutions into individual wells of a black 96-well plate. Measure the resulting luminescence under the Total Light, 490-510 nm, and 710-730 nm filters. Fluorophore concentration can be determined using 450-480 nm excitation and 710-730 nm emission."
