  "procedures": [
    "Enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA)Working principles.ELONA works by measuring the activity of an enzyme that is present only upon aptamer’s binding to the target.First, the target virus is incubated in a 96-well microplate with high-binding polymer wells, which allow the virus to stick to the well through non-specific binding.Biotinylated DNA aptamer is added to each well, which binds to the target virus but not other viruses. Overdosed or unbound DNA is washed away.A reporter enzyme, labeled with a streptavidin, is then added to bind to the biotin end of the aptamer. Then, the enzyme catalyzes a colorimetric reaction. The amount of color product will be proportional to the amount of enzyme that is correlated to aptamer binding events.The enzyme used here is Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP).In the presence of H2O2, HRP oxidizes TMB, which produces a blue color.After quenching the reaction with H2SO4, the blue color turns yellow, and the measured absorbance of the yellow color correlates to the amount of HRP.In a biosafety cabinet (all procedures from here need to be inside of the biosafety cabinet), dilute the pseudovirus in SELEX buffer to 5 × 108 copies/mL. Mix by flipping the tube. Do NOT vortex. Incubate 50 μL of pseudovirus in each well of a 96-well microplate (Figure 1.1A) at room temperature for 2 h. During this time, the virus will bind to the walls of the well (Figure 1.1B). The plate needs to be covered by parafilm during all the incubation steps.Note: The pseudovirus can be destroyed by intense mechanical forces. Vortexing is likely to destroy the structure and render it ineffective for this experiment. Similarly, excess pipetting to mix could also be problematic, but it is difficult to say how much is too much pipetting for stability. Instead, we recommend using a gentler method of mixing whenever possible.",
    "Wash each well three times with PBS-T buffer.Flip the plate and drain the virus solution into a prepared container with bleach (10% v/v) inside. Try to remove the liquid as much as possible by tapping.Note: There are many ways to remove the liquid from solution. Flipping over a bucket of 10% bleach is our recommendation due to its speed and simplicity of decontaminating. For example, the 96-well plate could also be tapped on an absorbing sheet, but then the sheet must be decontaminated and treated as hazardous waste. Any similar method, including pipetting, would be acceptable; however, flipping and tapping the solution into a bleached waste container is safe, quick, easy, and effective. Add 100 μL of buffer to each well.Invert over waste bucket, tapping forcefully if necessary to remove all solution.Add 50 μL of PBS-T-BSA buffer to each well and incubate at room temperature for 1 h in order to avoid non-specific binding to reduce the background signal (Figure 1.1C).Wash three times with PBS-T as before.Prepare array of 11 different biotinylated-ssDNA aptamer concentrations.Serial dilute to prepare the ssDNA aptamer at the concentration of 1 μM, 500 nM, 250 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 10 nM, 2.5 nM, 1 nM, 0.25 nM, 0.1 nM, 0 nM in SELEX buffer. The total volume of each solution should be sufficient to add 40 μL for each replicate, plus a little to account for losses during pipetting. In this case, use three replicates of two different virus conditions (intact and UV-inactivated pseudovirus), for a total of six. To do this effectively, make at least 240 μL of each DNA solution.Add 40 μL of ssDNA aptamer at different concentrations to each well of the corresponding column (Figure 1.",
    "1D), and just SELEX buffer to the first column as a blank (consider loading the plate as shown Figure 1.2). Incubate at room temperature for 1 h.Wash three times with PBS-T as before.Add 40 μL of freshly made 1:500 dilution of HRP-S in PBS-T buffer to each well. Incubate for 1 h (Figure 1.1E).Prepare TMB solutions.TMB stock solution (should always be made fresh during experiment)Dissolve 5 mg of TMB in 5 mL of 100% ethanol.TMB working solution (Should always be made fresh during experiment)Add 1 mL of TMB stock solution to 4 mL of acetate buffer.Add 3 μL of 30% hydrogen peroxide.Wash three times with PBS-T as before.Add 50 μL of TMB working solution to each well (Figure 1.1F).Incubate in the dark until the light blue color builds up for high concentration groups (approximately 20–30 min).Quench the reaction by adding 10 μL of stop solution. After quenching, the blue product turns yellow in the acid solution (Figure 1.1G).Measure the yellow product, which has an absorption peak at 450 nm (OD450), using the BioTek microplate reader (Figure 1.3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4548/bioprotoc-12-21-4548-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Microscale Thermophoresis (MST)Working principlesThe physical phenomenon ‘‘thermophoresis” describes molecules’ movement in temperature gradients dependent on their size, charge, and hydration shell.MST works by heating a small spot in the middle of a capillary such that the molecules inside move faster.Smaller molecules move faster than larger ones.Fluorescence is measured in the heated area.The fluorescent DNA aptamer is a relatively small molecule, which becomes much larger and slower when binding to the virus.After aptamers bind to the virus, the fluorescent molecule will leave the tracked area slower, thereby producing a change in the fluorescence intensity.PreparationIn a biosafety cabinet, create a 1:2 serial dilution of 16 pseudovirus solutions in SELEX buffer from 3.9 × 108 copies/mL maximum to 1.2 × 105 copies/mL (Figure 2).Start by making 20 μL of the maximum concentration (3.9 × 108 copies/mL) in SELEX buffer in a PCR tube (tube 1).Arrange 15 PCR tubes in a line and add 10 μL of SELEX buffer to each (tubes 2–16).Remove 10 μL from tube 1 and mix thoroughly with tube 2 by pipetting up and down.Remove 10 μL from tube 2 and mix thoroughly with tube 3 by pipetting up and down.Repeat to end of the line, remove 10 μL from tube 16 and discard.To cover a wider concentration range, use a 1:3 serial dilution.Prepare aptamer solution.Dissolve FAM-functionalized DNA aptamer in SELEX buffer to a final concentration of 500 nM.Heat the aptamer solution at 95 °C for 5 min, then cool on ice for 3 min.Add 10 μL of 500 nM FAM-functionalized DNA aptamer to each tube from step B2a, pipette up and down, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Heat wax until melted (Figure 2.5.).Insert a MO-K022capillary tube into each PCR tube and tap gently to load solution into tube. The liquid should be loaded approximately two thirds full.",
    "The measurement takes place in the middle of the length of the capillary, so the solution must be safely past the midpoint.Dip each end of the tube in melted wax and allow to dry to seal tube (Figure 2.5.).Note: This is a safety recommendation for removing the pseudovirus samples from the biosafety cabinet. Moreover, sealing the tube can prevent solution evaporation during an MST experiment. The wax layer should be thick enough to be robust but not so thick to create bulbous ends that raise the capillary out of the instrument tray.Do not touch the central testing region of the capillary tube, as this may significantly affect the result. Always grab capillary tubes at the ends.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4548/bioprotoc-12-21-4548-g002.jpgFigure 2. Schematic of the MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) experiment. 1 to 4) Scheme of MST sample preparation and capillary tube loading. 5) Sealing the capillary in wax. First, dip the end of the capillary in the melted wax. Then, allow to cool and solidify. Repeat for both ends. 6) Layout of samples loaded to the MST tray with components labeled A) the tray, B) magnetic bars to clamp down capillaries, and C) white bar illustrating where capillaries are placed.MeasurementArrange the tubes 1–16 in the NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 tray and clamp down using the magnetic bars (Figure 2.6.).Start the instrument, insert the tray, and close the instrument door.Set the Instrument control temperature to 25 °C.Select the LED channel. For fluorescein-modified DNA, select the blue channel.Select the option to perform an MST experiment.Set the LED power to 20%.Set MST power to Medium.This setting controls the power of the IR laser, which heats the solution during the measurement. If the signal change is too large or too small, it can be adjusted down to lower or to higher settings, respectively.",
    "Set the time sequence to 5 s cold, 30 s hot (on), followed by 5 s cold.This time sequence corresponds to the time for each phase of measurement. The initial “cold” time establishes a baseline equilibrium fluorescence.The 30 s “hot” period is the time in which the IR laser is heating the solution, causing a temperature gradient, and making the molecules move faster. The hot period may or may not establish a new equilibrium, but the rate at which the measured fluorescence changes will vary related to the amount of virus in the tube. At some time during the hot period, there will be a region that presents a binding curve in the final data.The final 5 s “cold” time is to return towards the initial equilibrium.Enter the maximum concentration (3.9 × 108 copies/mL) and then select 1:2 serial dilution. The instrument will autofill the concentrations of tubes 2–16 according to this dilution factor. Note: The instrument will expect a nanomolar amount as a concentration. It is not advised to try to convert the concentration of the pseudovirus from particles/mL to molarity, but to keep track of the units manually. We recommend just inputting “3.9 × 108 nM” in the unit of nM instead of the correct unit of copies/mL and then correcting the unit back to copies/mL at the end of the analysis. The reason is that converting to 3.9 × 108 copies/mL to its actual nM would result in extremely low concentrations (6.5 × 10-7–2.0 × 10-11 nM), which can cause computational round-off errors in the equipment software when fitting a curve.  Make sure all fields are properly filled in, including the concentration of the fluorescent DNA ligand.Provide a filename for the .",
    "ntp file that will be created and can be opened with the analysis software of the equipment. An ntp-file can contain several MST experiments that are listed accordingly to their name and the date & time when they were recorded. An MST experiment can contain several runs that are listed according to the “Table of Runs” that you defined for your assay (e.g., different MST powers).Start the measurement.Repeat two more times from step B2a to obtain all data in triplicate."
