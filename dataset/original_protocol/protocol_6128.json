    "Generation of HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant glycoproteins (corin or prothrombin)Seed HEK293 cells in a 6-well plate (3 x 105 cells per well) with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, 2 ml per well) containing 10% FBS.Culture the cells at 37 °C in a humidified incubator to 70-80% of confluency (24 h).Transfect HEK293 cells with the plasmid (2 μg, expressing human corin or prothrombin containing a C-terminal V5 tag) using OPTI-MEM medium (85 μl) and Fugene transfection reagent (6 μl), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Culture the cells at 37 °C for 2 days.Remove the medium and wash the cells once with PBS (5 ml per well).Treat the cells with trypsin-EDTA solution (1 ml) at 37 °C for 1-2 min. Check the cells under a microscope to ensure that > 70% of cells are detached. (HEK293 cells attached to the culture plate are flat, whereas the detached cells are round.)Tap the culture plate gently so that > 90% of cells are detached. Stop the trypsin activity by adding fresh DMEM with 10% FBS (1 ml per well).Transfer the transfected HEK293 cells into 100 mm dishes (2.2 x 106 cells per dish) with 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and geneticin (G418, 400 μg/ml), an antibiotic commonly used for the selection of stably transfected mammalian cells. The concentration of G418 was based on the published information and the laboratory’s previous experience. Culture the transfected cells and replace the culture medium with fresh medium every other day, for 2 weeks. No need to passage cells during this time.Maintain the remaining G418 resistant cells for the following experiments.",
    "Verification of recombinant protein expression in stably transfected HEK293 cellsSeed stably transfected HEK293 cells in a 6-well plate (3 x 105 cells in 2 ml DMEM per well) and culture the cells at 37 °C to 90% of confluency (36 h).Gently remove the medium by suction and wash the cells once with PBS (pre-chilled on ice,  1 ml per well).Detach the cells by flushing with 1 ml of pre-chilled PBS using a pipet until all cells are detached.Transfer the cells to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Spin down the cells with a microcentrifuge (900 x g at 4 °C for 5 min) and discard the supernatant.Lyse the pelleted cells in a cell lysis buffer (50 μl) at 4 °C for 30 min (tap the tube every 5 min to ensure the cells were completely lysed).Centrifuge the lysis mixture at 16,200 x g, 4 °C, for 10 min.Collect the supernatant (cell lysate, 50 μl) and discard the insoluble cellular debris.Denature the cell lysate with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2x, 50 μl) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min and cool down the protein sample to room temperature.Confirm the expression of recombinant glycoproteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the conditions indicated in the table below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190528/20190528201804_0859.jpgInhibition of α-glucosidases I and II by DNJSeed HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant proteins (corin or prothrombin) in a 6-well plate or a 100 mm dish, depending on the further analysis, with DMEM containing 10% FBS and G418 (400 μg/ml) (optional but recommended).Culture the cells to 70-80% of confluency.Replace the medium with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS, G418 (400 μg/ml) (optional), and DNJ (2 mM) to block the activity of α-glucosidases I and II.Culture the cells at 37 °C for 24-48 h.",
