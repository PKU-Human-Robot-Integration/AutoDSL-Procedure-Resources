    "All animal experiments were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee and adhered to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.\n1. Fabrication of specialized parts and construction of apparatus\nFabrication of specialized parts\n\t\nProbe fabrication. Hold a glass capillary at an angle as shown in the left panel of Figure 2A. Place a flame from a cigarette lighter about 2 cm from one end and keep it there until the end bends by 90°, as shown in the right panel of Figure 2A.\nSample platform fabrication. Using 3D drawing software, design a platform measuring 30 x 30 x 5 mm and containing hemispherical indentations of 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mm in diameter, as shown in Figure 2B.\nProbe holder fabrication. Using the 3D drawing software, design a mount that holds the capillary probe and attach it to a micromanipulator (see Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: A sample 3D file for platform fabrication and probe holder fabrication in STL format is available on request from the corresponding author.\nNegative lens assembly. Place a negative cylindrical lens (-75 mm in focal length and approximately 50 mm in height and length) as shown in Figure 1C and Figure 1D to correct the distortion caused by the addition of fluid to the Petri dish (addition of fluid distorts the view of the dissected eye when imaged from the side).\nGlue the negative lens to one of the 2-slotted bases (see Figure 2D for positioning of the lens on the base).\nAssemble the remaining parts as shown in Figure 2D.\nAdjust the height of the post so that the lens barely hovers over the scale and tighten the screw in the post-holder.\nConstruction of apparatus",
    "Install on a computer the logging program supplied with the scale, the microscope camera software, and the motorized micrometer controller application.\nConnect the motorized micrometer to the servo motor controller and the latter to the computer. Start the motor controller application and edit the motor settings.\n\t\tNOTE: The motor settings, which are listed below, were chosen following preliminary experiments that revealed that stresses relaxed on a time scale of 10-20 s. Based on this determination, we selected a speed and acceleration that allowed the motor to complete a 50 µm displacement in a time smaller than the relaxation time, but not too short to avoid jolting the sample. Here we chose a displacement time of about 5-10 s.\nSet the maximum velocity to 0.01 mm/s and the acceleration to 0.005 mm/s2.\nInstall the camera in the inspection microscope and test the camera imaging software.\nPlace the scale on the bench space devoted to the apparatus.\nGlue a 3D-printed platform (from step 1.1.2) to a Petri dish and add a 2-3 mm glass bead to one of the wells. Place the Petri dish on the scale so that the bead is located near the center of the pan.\nReplace the manual micrometer from the micromanipulator with the motorized one.\nScrew the two 4-40 screws into the probe holder. Attach the probe holder to the manipulator as shown in Figure 1C.\nPrepare a probe as illustrated in Figure 2A, place it inside the probe holder with the bent portion facing down, and tighten the screws.\nPosition the micromanipulator on the table such that the tip of the probe is over the bead on the platform. Affix the micromanipulator to the table to prevent accidental movement during the experiment.",
    "Position the side microscope on the table so that the bead is at the center of its field of view and in focus.\n2. Sample preparation and data acquisition\nEye fixation and dissection\n\t\nMaintain wild-type mice and Magp1-null animals on an identical C57/BL6J background. Euthanize 1-month-old or 1-year-old mice by CO2 inhalation.\nRemove the eyes with fine forceps and fix the enucleated globes at 4 °C overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Maintain a positive pressure of 15-20 mmHg in the eye during the fixation process, as described6.\n\t\tNOTE: Experiments are conducted on male mice, to control for possible sex-related differences in the size of the ocular globe. The positive pressure ensures that the globe remains inflated, preserving the gap between the lens and the wall of the eye spanned by the zonular fibers.\nWash the eyes for 10 min in PBS. Using ophthalmic surgical scissors and working under a stereomicroscope, make a full-thickness incision in the wall of the eye near the optic nerve head.\nExtend the cut forward to the equator, and then around the equatorial circumference of the eye. Take care to spare the delicate ciliary processes and associated zonular fibers.\nRemove the back of the globe, exposing the posterior surface of the lens.\nUse the forceps to remove a dissected eye from the buffer solution and place it on a dry task wipe with the cornea facing down. Gently drag the cornea over the surface of the wipe to dry it.\nAdd 3 µL of instant glue to the platform wells that will accommodate the eye in the Petri dish.\nPlace the dish on the stage plate of the stereomicroscope so that the well with the glue is in view.",
    "Transfer the eye from the wipe to the edge of the well that contains glue. Then, carefully drag the eye into the well and quickly adjust its orientation so that the back of the lens is uppermost.\nDry the exposed side of the lens by gently blotting it with the corner of a dry wipe.\nApply a dab of instant glue to the bottom of a 50 mm Petri dish and cement the platform to it.\nMeasurement of zonular viscoelastic response\n\t\nTurn on the scale, start the scale logging program and the camera software. Ensure that the logging program can acquire data for 30 min, as some trials can last that long.\nSwitch on the servo motor controller and start the controller application on the computer. Make sure the controller is set to move in 50 µm increments using motion parameters similar to those outlined in the NOTE in step 1.2.2.\nCreate a 90° bend in a capillary rod as described in step 1.1.1.\nSlip the bent capillary into the capillary probe holder and tighten the securing screws.\n\t\tNOTE: To minimize sample dehydration, we recommend that steps 1-4 be completed prior to, or during, eye dissection.\nAdd a small (~1 mm) bead of UV-curing glue to the tip of the capillary.\nUsing the manual adjustments on the manipulator, move the tip of the capillary probe so that it is directly over the center of the lens. Check whether the bottom portion of the UV glue appears centered over the top of the lens when viewed from the front (by visual inspection) and the side (through the microscope camera).\nWhile looking through the camera, lower the probe tip until the UV glue makes contact with the lens and covers one-third to one-half of its upper surface.",
    "Use a low-intensity (~ 1 mW), directional, near-visible UV (380-400 nm) light source to cure the glue.\n\t\tNOTE: These specifications suffice to cure the glue in a few seconds while minimizing the potential for inducing protein crosslinking. The UV light sources supplied with commercial UV glue pens meet these specifications.\nAdd PBS solution to the dish until the eye is covered by fluid to a depth of at least 2 mm.\nPlace the cylindrical lens in front of the inspection microscope and as close as possible to the Petri dish without touching it.\nSimultaneously start the logging program and a timer program. Take a picture of the eye/probe using the camera.\nAfter 60 s, initiate another 50 µm displacement, and thereafter every 60 s until the experiment is complete, i.e., until all the fibers have been broken. Note that the signal will not return to baseline levels due to buffer evaporation during the experiment. Correct the ensuing drift in the readings during the data analysis, as exemplified in step 2.2.14.\nUpon completion of a run, save the scale logging data and export it into a format compatible with the spreadsheet, e.g., a .csv format. Save the lens pictures that were collected during the run.\nImport data into a spreadsheet. Use the first and the last scale reading to interpolate the drift in the background reading over time due to evaporation (see Figure 3). Subtract the interpolated reading from the reading at each time point.",
    "NOTE: If using a spreadsheet, the interpolation can be performed automatically by entering the formula = B2 - $B$2 + ($B$2 - @INDIRECT(\"B\"&COUNTA(B:B)))/(COUNTA(B:B)-2) * A2 in the cell to the right of the first scale reading, then moving the cursor to the right-lower corner of the cell and dragging it down to the last data value. The formula assumes that the data is organized in a column with the first data point appearing in cell B2. If desired, the data processed in step 2.2.14 may be analyzed with the quasi-elastic viscoelastic model developed by one of the co-authors, Dr. Matthew Riley4.\nSubscription Required.
