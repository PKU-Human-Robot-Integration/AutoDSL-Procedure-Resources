    "The use of zebrafish larvae and juveniles is approved by the IUP IACUC (protocol #02-1920, #08-1920). Details of the solution content are listed in the Table of Materials.\n1. Raising larvae\nNOTE: It will take up to 21 days or more to raise larvae and juveniles to the stage of interest.\nSet up adult zebrafish to mate by adding 1 male and 1 female fish in a mating tank in the late afternoon after their last meal.\n\t​NOTE: Not all fish pairs will mate. Start by setting up 20 pairs to determine the mating rate and adjust accordingly in future experiments.\nThe next day after the fish have finished mating (around 1 pm), collect the embryos with E3 medium in Petri plates.\n\t\nEnsure that there are no more than 30 embryos per plate.\nRemove debris (such as feces) from the Petri plates and add 20 mL of E3 medium.\nIncubate at 28.5 °C for 1 day.\nPut the adult zebrafish back in the aquatic system.\nAt 1 dpf, replace the E3 medium with fresh E3.\n\t\nIncubate at 28.5 °C for 4 more days until 5 dpf.\nPut a 400 µm screen in a 2.8 L tank and fill it with 2 cm of system water.\n\t\nAdd the 5 dpf larvae from 1 plate (up to 30 total larvae).\nPut the tank in the aquatic system, but do not start the water flow.\nFeed the larvae 4 mL of powder food twice a day until 14 dpf.\nAt 6 dpf, start the water flow at 1 drip per second.\n\tNOTE: Check the waterflow daily and adjust accordingly.\nAt 8 dpf, increase the water flow to a slow, steady stream.\nAt 14 dpf, feed live brine shrimp in addition to the powder food.\n2. Day 1 - 2: Fixing larvae",
    "Remove a tank of larvae at the desired timepoint.\nFill a Petri plate with 20 mL of system water.\nUse a fine mesh net to gently scoop the larvae and bring them to the water surface.\n\t\nCut off the tip of a transfer pipette to give a wider opening and transfer the larvae to the Petri plate. The larger pipette mouth allows for the transfer of several small larvae or a few larger ones at once.\nAdd 2 mL of tricaine (2%, pH 7 stock) to immobilize the larvae.\n\t\nAfter the larvae stop moving, remove most of the water and add 10 mL of tricaine. Wait for 15 min for the larvae to be euthanized.\nOptional: For juveniles longer than 8 mm, cut off the heads and tails with a razor blade (after euthanasia) under a dissecting microscope to improve penetration of the fixing solution. Make sure to record the total length of each animal before cutting off the head and tail and isolate each one in its own Petri plate. Refer to step 3 for how to measure the animals.\nReplace the tricaine with 20 mL of fixing solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 1% DMSO). Put the lid back on the Petri plate and rock slowly in a fume hood.\n\tNOTE: It is important to use a rocking platform. A shaking platform with a circular motion will cause the animal axis to be curved. Use only fresh (not premade frozen) fixing solution.\n\tCAUTION: The fixing solution contains paraformaldehyde, which is a probable carcinogen. Use fume hood (or mask) and gloves to measure the powder.\nAfter 30 min, replace the fixing solution with a fresh fixing solution.\n\t\nCollect the used fixing solution in a separate waste container for proper disposal.",
    "Transfer the larvae into a 50 mL tube containing 25 mL of fresh fixing solution.\nMake sure the cap is tight and rock slowly at 4 °C for 2 days. It is possible to incubate longer for convenience.\n3. Day 3: Measuring larvae\nIn a fume hood, replace the fixing solution with 20 mL of PBST.\nTransfer the larvae into a Petri plate.\nPut a flat ruler on a dissecting microscope and put the Petri plate on top of the ruler.\nUse an eyelash manipulator to move each larva onto the ruler to measure its total length (from the snout to the tip of the caudal fin) (Figure 1).\nCombine several larvae of similar lengths (e.g., 5.0 mm and 5.1 mm) into one 5.5 mL glass vial, up to 10 larvae per vial.\n4. Day 3 - 4: Dehydration\nReplace the PBST with 4 mL of 100% methanol. Rock the vial for 5 min at room temperature.\nReplace the methanol with fresh methanol and rock for 5 min. Repeat one more time.\nStore the vial at -20 °C for 2 days. It is possible to incubate longer for convenience.\n5. Day 5: Rehydration\nWarm the vial to room temperature.\nReplace the methanol with 4 mL of 75% methanol/25% PBST.

Repeat one more time.\n6. Day 5: Proteinase K digest",
    "Replace the PBST with 2 mL of the proteinase K solution (20 µg/mL, 1% DMSO final concentration in PBST) and rock at room temperature for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Larvae longer than 6 mm will need a longer incubation time and/or a higher proteinase K concentration. The exact time and concentration will need to be determined empirically. Start with a 10 min increase in incubation time for every 0.5 mm longer than 6 mm.\nReplace the proteinase K solution with 4 mL of PBST and rock for 10 min.\nReplace the PBST with 4 mL of fresh PBST and rock for 10 min. Repeat one more time.\nReplace the PBST with 4 mL of fresh fixing solution and rock for 1 h. It is possible to incubate longer at 4 °C for convenience.\n7. Day 5: Bleaching\nReplace the fixing solution with 4 mL of PBST and rock at room temperature for 10 min.\nReplace the PBST with 4 mL of fresh PBST and rock for 10 min. Repeat one more time.\nTransfer the larvae to a 6-well plate (up to 10 larvae per well).\nReplace the PBST with 3 mL of fresh bleaching solution.\nRock at room temperature and monitor the pigmentation under a dissecting microscope every 5 min. Look for the disappearance of pigmentation along the mesonephros (dorsal to the swim bladder and gut).\n\tNOTE: For larvae up to 6 mm long, it will take up to 20 min to bleach the pigmentation surrounding the mesonephros. Do not bleach longer than necessary to preserve the integrity of the larvae.\nTransfer the larvae back into a glass vial.\nReplace the bleaching solution with 4 mL of PBST. Rock for 10 min.\nReplace the PBST with 4 mL of fresh PBST and rock for 10 min. Repeat one more time.",

Repeat one more time.\nReplace the PBST with 4 mL of the Hyb- solution, and rock at room temperature for 10 min.\n\tCAUTION: The Hyb-, Hyb+, and probe solutions contain formamide, which can irritate the skin. Use gloves to handle these solutions.\nReplace the Hyb- with 4 mL of fresh Hyb- and rock for 10 min. Repeat one more time.\n\t\nCollect the used Hyb-, Hyb+, and probe solutions in a separate waste container for proper disposal.\nReplace the Hyb- with 4 mL of the Hyb+ solution.\nIncubate the vial at 70 °C overnight.\nDilute the EGFP-fluorescein probe 1:100 in 500 µL of Hyb+ and incubate it O/N at 70 °C.\n\t​NOTE: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for probe synthesis.\n9. Day 6: Probe hybridization\nReplace the Hyb+ solution in the vial with the preheated probe and incubate at 70 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Larvae longer than 6 mm need 2 days of incubation.\nPreheat the wash buffer, 2x SSCT, and 0.2x SSCT solutions at 70 °C for overnight.\n10. Day 7: Probe washing\nReplace the probe with 4 mL of the preheated wash buffer and incubate at 70 °C for 30 min.\n\t\nCollect the used probe in a separate waste container for proper disposal.",
    "Replace the wash buffer with 4 mL of fresh wash buffer and incubate at 70 °C for 30 min.\nReplace the wash buffer with 4 mL of the preheated 2x SSCT solution and incubate it at 70 °C for 15 min.\nAdd 50 mL of preheated 0.2x SSCT into a 50 mL tube.\n\t\nInsert a cell strainer (100 µm) into the top of the tube. Ensure that the cell strainer is pushed all the way down until it stops.\nTransfer the larvae from the glass vial into the cell strainer. Ensure that the larvae are submerged in the buffer and incubate at 70 °C for 2 h.\nPrepare a new tube containing 50 mL of preheated 0.2x SSCT.\n\t\nTransfer the cell strainer from step 10.4.2 into the new tube of 0.2x SSCT and incubate at 70 °C for 2 h.\nRepeat step 10.5 one more time.\n11.

Day 8 - 9: Antibody incubation\nDilute the anti-fluorescein antibody 1:5,000 in 500 µL blocking solution.",
    "Replace the blocking solution with the antibody solution and incubate at 4 °C for 2 days. It is possible to incubate longer for convenience.\n\t\nSwirl the vial twice a day to agitate the larvae.\n\t\t​NOTE: Larvae longer than 6 mm need 1-2 more days of incubation.\n13.
