    "(A) IBA1+/Ku80+ human G795A-iMG engraft minimally in the occupied adult murine brain.\n(B) G795A-iMG proliferate from the injection site and replace IBA+/Ku80- murine microglia under constant CSF1Ri treatment.\n(C) 60 days of 290 mg/kg PLX3397 treatment is sufficient to replace murine microglia throughout the Striatum, Medial Septum, Corpus Callosum, Cortex, Thalamus, and Brain Stem. Brain stitch scale bar, 500 μm. Representative 20× scale bar, 100 μm.\nNote: Adjustment to dose, duration, and the specific CSF1R antagonist used are likely possible, but must be empirically determined.\nNote: For immunofluorescence staining of engrafted human G795A-microglia (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), mice were perfused with PBS and isolated brains were drop fixed in 4% (wt/vol) PFA for 36 h then cryoprotected in a 30% (wt/vol) sucrose at 4°C. Brains were sectioned coronally into 30-μm-thick slices on a freezing microtome and stored in a solution of 0.05% NaN3 in 1× PBS as free-floating slices. For staining, tissue was blocked for 1 h in 1× PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% donkey serum. Immediately following blocking, brain sections were labeled with goat anti-IBA1 (1:200; Abcam; ab5076) and rabbit anti-Ku80 (1:100; Abcam; ab80592) diluted in 1× PBS and 1% donkey serum and incubated overnight on a shaker at 4°C. After washing, sections were incubated with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400) for 1 h, then washed three times with PBS before mounting with Fluoromount-G. Immunofluorescent sections were visualized and captured using an Olympus FX 1200 confocal microscope."
