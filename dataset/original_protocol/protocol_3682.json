    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPancreatic progenitor and hepatic differentiation\nMethods to differentiate hPSCs to pancreatic progenitor and/or hepatic cells have been reported extensively in the past few years (Kroon, et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Rashid, et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Hannan, et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Pagliuca, et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Russ, et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Teo, et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Teo, et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). This protocol describes the detailed procedures for in vitro pancreatic progenitor and hepatic differentiation from hPSCs (Ng, et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Note that the first 6 days (Days -2 to 4) of both differentiation protocols are identical, and the protocols deviate after the induction of the definitive endoderm (DE) (Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). The specification of cells to the DE stage is crucial as these cells are responsible for the formation of organs such as the pancreas, liver, and intestines in vivo (Zorn & Wells, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Once DE cells are generated, they are then directed towards either the pancreatic or hepatic lineage through the introduction of various differentiation media, growth factors, and small molecules at different time points. An overview of the specific growth factors and small molecules added at specific time points in this protocol is demonstrated in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_609_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_609_5.csv\nSetup on day 2\nHarvesting hPSCs grown in feeder-free culture\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes the setting up of hPSCs grown in feeder-free culture on a 100 mm culture plate two days prior to the start of differentiation. Here, ReLeSR™ is used to dissociate hPSCs into evenly-sized cell aggregates. It is recommended to split one confluent 100 mm plate of hPSCs into a full 6-well plate for differentiation.\nRetrieve hPSCs cultured in a 100 mm tissue culture dish and observe hPSCs under the microscope.",
    "Critical: It is recommended to harvest hPSCs when they are grown to 80%–90% confluency. It is also important to check that there are less than 10% differentiated cells on the plate before proceeding.\nAspirate the hPSC culture medium and wash cells once with 3 mL of DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL of ReLeSR™ to the hPSCs, ensure that the ReLeSR™ solution covers the surface of the entire plate.\nAfter 45 s of incubation at 15°C–25°C, aspirate the ReLeSR™.\nImmediately place the cell culture dish into a 37°C humidified incubator for an additional 2.5 min.\nAfter 2.5 min, gently wash the plate once with 1 mL of DPBS by dispensing the DPBS slowly at the side of the plate without dislodging the cells. Aspirate the DPBS.\nAdd 3 mL of TeSR™-E8™ or mTeSR™1 medium to the plate, and firmly tap the side of the plate to dislodge the cells. Transfer detached cell aggregates to a 15 ml tube.\nRinse the remaining cells on the plate with another 3 mL of TeSR™-E8™ or mTeSR™1 medium and transfer the cells to the same 15 mL tube.\nTop up the cell mixture with 3 mL of TeSR™-E8™ or mTeSR™1 medium and, pipette up and down once using a 5 mL serological pipette.\nSeed 1.5 mL of cells in each well of a coated 6-well plate.\nNote: 6-well plates are coated as per instructions stated in the “Preparation of Gelatin/FBS-containing Medium-Coated Plates for Feeder-free hPSC Culture” subsection; Materials and Equipment section in this paper.\nCritical: Ensure that the cells are evenly distributed in the wells by rocking the plate back and forth.\nIncubate cells in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for two days to allow cells to attach and recover.",
    "Critical: During the two days of recovery, to minimize disturbance to the cells, it is not recommended to change the mTeSR™1 medium.\nHarvesting hPSCs grown in feeder-based culture\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes the setting up of hPSCs grown in feeder-based culture two days prior to the start of differentiation. Here, hPSCs are harvested by enzymatic means using dispase/collagenase mixed in a 1:1 ratio, followed by gentle mechanical scraping to generate dissociated cell aggregates. It is recommended to split confluent hPSCs grown on a 100 mm plate into a full 6-well plate for differentiation.\nWarm dispase/collagenase (1:1) solution in a 37°C water bath.\nRetrieve hPSCs cultured in a 100 mm tissue culture dish and observe hPSCs under the microscope.\nCritical: It is recommended to harvest hPSCs when they are grown to 80%–90% confluency. It is also important to check that there are less than 10% differentiated cells on the plate before proceeding.\nAspirate the hPSC culture medium and wash cells once with 3 mL of DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS.\nAdd 3 mL of warmed dispase/collagenase (1:1) solution to the hPSCs, ensuring that the solution covers the surface of the entire plate.\nIncubate the cells for 3 min at 37°C. This step facilitates the subsequent dislodging of hPSCs but not the feeder cells.\nRemove the dispase/collagenase solution and wash the cells gently with 3 mL DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS.\nAdd 3 mL of hPSC culture medium to the cells.",
    "Use a 5 mL serological pipette to scrape cells off the plate mechanically, from left to right, up to down, in a horizontal and vertical straight-line fashion, until the entire area of the plate has been scraped mechanically. Collect dissociated cell clusters into a 15 mL tube. The action of cell-scraping in two perpendicular orientations allows the hPSCs to be cut into small evenly-sized pieces.\nNote: The aim of this step is to cut hPSC colonies into small evenly-sized clusters while minimizing damage to the cells.\nRinse the remaining cells on the plate with another 3 mL of hPSC medium and transfer the cells to the same 15 mL tube.\nPass the harvested cell clusters through an inverted 70 μm cell strainer to deplete dislodged feeder cells.\nInsert the cell strainer into a 50 mL tube and rinse the strainer with 9 mL of fresh mTeSR™1 medium to collect the trapped hPSC clusters.\nGently resuspend the cell mixture using a serological pipette and seed 1.5 mL of cells into each well of a coated 6-well plate.\nNote: 6-well plates are coated as per instructions stated in the “Preparation of Gelatin/FBS-containing Medium-Coated Plates for Feeder-free hPSC Culture” subsection; Materials and Equipment section in this paper.\nCritical: Ensure that the cells are evenly distributed in the wells by rocking the plate back and forth.\nIncubate cells in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for two days to allow cells to attach and recover.\nCritical: During the two days of recovery, to minimize disturbance to the cells, it is not recommended to change the culture medium.\nPancreatic progenitor (PP) differentiation after day 2 setup\nTiming: 10 min per day\nThis step describes the pancreatic progenitor differentiation process after day -2 setup.",

    "Repeat previous step on days 7 and 9. Lastly, days 10 to 24 of the hepatic differentiation process aim to differentiate hepatoblasts into hepatocyte-like cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/609-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

This protocol describes the use of these hPSC-derived cells in a gene regulation assay, specifically a luciferase reporter-based transcriptional assay. The cells at any stage of differentiation can be harvested for the subsequent assays, depending on the developmental time point of interest.\nCell harvesting and FuGENE® 6 transfection\nTiming: 3 days\nCollect hPSC-derived cells at an appropriate time point. For example, if gene regulation at the PP stage (Day 14) is of interest, cells should be harvested on Day 11.\nAspirate differentiation medium from the wells and wash cells once with DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL of TrypLE to each well of a 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 3–4 min.\nNote: The length of incubation time with TrypLE should be optimized for the specific cell type to ensure that cells are not subjected to over dissociation.\nAdd 1.5 mL of basal differentiation medium (without any growth factors) to each well and collect all the cells into a 50 mL tube.",

    "Dilute an appropriate amount of 5× Passive Lysis Buffer (PLB) with four volumes of distilled water, depending on the number of samples to be collected for the luciferase assay. For each well of a 24-well plate, prepare 100 μl of 1× PLB. Therefore, for a full 24-well plate of cells, 2.4 mL of 1× PLB is required.\nReconstitute LAR II and the Stop & Glo reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For example, to prepare 10 mL of fresh 1× Stop and Glo solution, add 200 μl of 50× Stop & Glo substrate to 9.8 mL of Luciferase Assay Buffer before the assay.\nAspirate differentiation medium from wells.\nWash cells once in 250 μL of DPBS per well. Aspirate the DPBS.\nAdd 100 μl of 1× PLB per well of a 24-well plate.\nGently rock the plate for 15–20 min at 15°C–25°C to facilitate passive cell lysis.\nNote: The plate of samples may be frozen and stored at −20°C for a few days until the luciferase assay is to be performed. For longer-term storage, store plate at −80°C.\nCentrifuge plate at 195 g for 3 min at 4°C to collect the cell debris at the bottom of the plate.\nTo perform the luciferase assay, transfer 20 μl of the clear supernatant (do not collect any visible cell debris) into each well of a flat-bottomed, white 96-well assay plate. For technical duplicates, transfer 20 μl of the clear supernatant twice into two separate wells.\nDispense 100 μl of LAR II to each well using a multi-channel pipette or an appropriate automated injector system.\nMeasure firefly luciferase activity immediately using a suitable luminescence microplate reader.\nDispense 100 μl of 1× Stop & Glo solution to each well using a multi-channel pipette or an appropriate automated injector system.",
    "Measure Renilla luciferase activity immediately using a suitable luminescence microplate reader.\nTo analyze data, subtract background luminescence detected in a non-transfected control sample from all firefly or Renilla luciferase activity results. Next, divide luciferase reporter activity by the respective Renilla luciferase activity for each sample to obtain normalized luciferase activity data.\nCritical: Both LAR II and Stop & Glo reagents are light-sensitive. Therefore, ensure that the reagents and plates containing samples are protected from light."
