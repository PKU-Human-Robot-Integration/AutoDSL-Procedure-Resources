We have found that a PTFE\n      homogenizer attached to a rotor gives us optimal lysing of\n      C. elegans.\n    \n        Once animals have reached the L4 stage, collect all animals in a 15 mL\n        conical tube by washing plates with M9W and centrifuging for 30 s at\n        1500 × g to pellet worms.\n        \nWash worms twice with 10 mL M9W and repeat centrifugation.\n            For the last wash, resuspend animals in 1× PBS and repeat\n            centrifugation.\n            \nNote: The pellet size should be\n              between 0.5–1 mL in size.\n            \n            Allow the pellet to form tightly on ice and remove supernatant by\n            aspirating to the pellet.\n          \n        Prepare a solution of 1× PBS and 2× Halt Protease and Phosphatase\n        Inhibitor Cocktail (dilute 100× Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor\n        Cocktail to 2×). Keep solution on ice.\n        \nEstimate the pellet size of the animals.\n            Add 1 volume of 1× PBS + 2× Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor\n            Cocktail. Flick the bottom of the conical gently to mix. Keep on\n            ice.\n          \nPause point:\nC. elegans animals at this point can be flash frozen (liquid\n      nitrogen or dry ice/ethanol) and stored at −80°C until ready for lysis.\n    \nCritical: Detergents that are commonly\n      used to lyse cells may disrupt downstream ligand-protein interactions.\n    \n        Lyse animals with a modified PTFE homogenizer (see\n        materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) by\n        transferring animals with a glass Pasteur pipet to the mortar.\n        \n            Insert pestle into the mortar containing the animals and turn on\n            rotor. Move mortar up and down at least 10 times. Keep lysed animals\n            on ice.\n          \n            Continue to homogenize until there are no visible animals and the\n            lysate becomes ‘milky white.’",
    "Repeat until entire volume of animals has been lysed.\n        Transfer the lysate into an ice-chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and\n        centrifuge at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\n        \n            There will be some volume loss during the homogenization process.\n          \n        Transfer supernatant, without disturbing the pellet, into a new\n        ice-chilled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and quantify protein concentration.\n      \n        Estimate the protein concentration using the DC protein assay\n        (BioRad) using the\n        manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/product/dc-protein-assay?ID=22faf97a-6b8d-4763-8b97-3dc530dcab66].\n      \nNote: Any protein estimation assay can be\n      used to quantify protein. Follow manufacturer’s instructions.\n    \nAlternatives: If a modified PTFE\n      homogenizer is not available, sonication can also be used to break open\n      C. elegans animals to release and extract protein.\n    \nProceed directly to “performing the CETSA[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2].”\nPerforming the CETSA\nTiming: 2.5 h\n      The following protocol is adapted for C. elegans samples from the\n      original description of CETSA.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] For CETSA, whole cell\n      lysates from C. elegans will be treated with different ligands of\n      choice and then be subjected to increasing temperatures on a thermocycler.\n      If the exogenous ligand binds to the C. elegans protein, the\n      protein will be stabilized at higher temperatures against denaturation and\n      aggregation compared to control samples. Although the following protocol\n      is specific for the addition of exogenous ligands, this protocol can also\n      be used to assess the thermal stability of C. elegans proteins in\n      the presence or absence of endogenous ligands (i.e., in\n      C. elegans mutants that do not express the ligand in question\n      compared to wild-type animals).\n    \n        Dilute the protein in the lysate from Step 5 to 5–10 mg/mL using\n        ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1× Halt Protease and Phosphatase\n        Inhibitor.\n        \n            100,000 L4 animals will yield about 1 mL at 10 mg/mL of protein. The\n            protein will then be diluted 1:1 with the compound of choice (final\n            concentration: 5 mg/mL protein) in a following step.",
    "Equilibrate diluted protein lysate to room temperature (22°C) for\n            10 min.\n          \n        Prepare PCR tubes. Cut 8-tube PCR strips to the number of treatment\n        conditions. For our example, we will treat the lysate from\n        3xFLAG::NHR-86 C elegans animals with either DMSO (solvent\n        control), PCN, R24 (treatments) or PCA (negative control). Hence, we\n        will prepare 8 sets of 4-tube PCR strips for 8 different temperatures.\n        \n            The first tube in each strip will be control and the second, third,\n            and fourth tubes in each strip will be PCN, PCA, and R24,\n            respectively.\n          \n        Transfer 25 μL of diluted and equilibrated protein lysate to each PCR\n        tube.\n      \n        Using a multichannel, transfer 25 μL of 4% DMSO (final 2% DMSO) or PCN,\n        PCA, or R24 to the first, second, third, and fourth sets of tubes,\n        respectively, and mix well.\n        \n            To ensure that the samples are exposed to the different temperatures\n            on the thermocyclers at the same time, adding the solvent control or\n            treatment can be staggered 5 min apart to allow the temperatures to\n            ramp up for ‘Set 2’ (see Step 13).\n          \n        Incubate lysate with compounds at room temperature (22°C) for 15 min.\n        \n            The time for incubation can be adjusted and optimized. Incubation\n            times as little as 5 min and as long as 1 h can be used depending on\n            the protein and compound of interest. These parameters can be\n            determined empirically.\n          \n        During incubation, set the temperatures for the thermocycler. Set 4\n        thermocycler blocks at one time (see below).\n        \n            After incubation with the first 4 temperatures (Set 1), the\n            thermocyclers can be set to the next 4 temperatures (Set 2).\n          \n            Set 1:\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2896_5.csv\n            Set 2:\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2896_6.csv\n        Expose the treated protein lysates to each temperature in ‘Set 1’\n        (4-tube strip per temperature) for 3 min by placing tubes directly onto\n        heated blocks.",
    "Close the heated lids while incubating.\n            Remove tubes from each block and allow samples to cool to room\n            temperature (22°C) for 3 min.\n          \n            Transfer samples on ice until protein lysates have been exposed to\n            all temperatures. Repeat for temperature ‘Set 2.’\n          \nCritical: It is imperative that all\n      samples be exposed to each temperature for the same amount of time for\n      consistent results.\n    \n        Transfer each sample into ice-chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and\n        spin at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\n      \n        Prepare labeled 8-tube PCR strips for gel electrophoresis.\n        \nLabel 1 PCR tube for each sample (total 16 PCR tubes).\n            In each PCR tube, transfer 10 μL 4× LDS sample buffer and 2 μL\n            β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) (5% of total volume).\n          \n        Carefully transfer 28 μL of the supernatant (without disturbing the\n        pellet) from Step 14 into the labeled PCR tubes of\n        Step 15 and mix gently. Pellets may or may not be visible\n        depending on the temperature.\n      \nCritical: To prevent carryover of\n      protein from the sides of the microcentrifuge tubes, do not touch the\n      pipette tips to the sides and take care not to touch pellet at the bottom\n      of the tubes.\n    \nPause point: Samples can be frozen\n      at −20°C until gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Use samples within\n      1–2 days.\n    \nImmunoblot analysis\nTiming: 2 days\n      The primary readout for CETSA is immunoblot analysis to assess the\n      solubility of protein at increasing temperatures when exposed to different\n      treatment conditions. The protocol here describes one method by which you\n      can process and develop your samples. Use any optimized immunoblotting\n      protocol for your protein of interest at this step.\n    \nIncubate samples at 70°C for 10 min.\n        Load samples into four NuPage 12% Bis-Tris gels, 17-well, 1.0 mm in 1×\n        MES SDS running buffer. Run at 100 V constant for about 2 h.",
    "Note: The amount of protein to be loaded\n      for gel electrophoresis will depend on the efficacy of the primary\n      antibody. For FLAG-tagged proteins, we have had success with loading\n      10–15 μL of the protein/LDS/β-ME mixture.\n    \n        Transfer 2 gels to Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer Packs containing 0.2 μm\n        Midi nitrocellulose membranes. Use the Trans-Blot Turbo “Mixed MW”\n        program. Repeat for the other 2 gels.\n      \n        Use a total protein stain, such as Ponceau S staining solution, to\n        confirm that treating protein lysates with increasing temperatures leads\n        to decreased total protein on the immunoblot.\n      \n        Block membranes with 5% milk (w/v) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature\n        (22°C).\n      \n        Incubate membranes in primary antibody (anti-FLAG at 1:1000 in 5% milk\n        (w/v)/TBST) 16–20 h at 4°C while shaking.\n      \n        Wash membranes 3 times with TBST at room temperature (22°C), 15 min each\n        with rocking.\n      \n        Incubate membranes in secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse at 1:10,000 in\n        5% milk (w/v)/TBST) for 1 h at room temperature (22°C) on rocker.\n      \n        Wash membranes 3 times with TBST at room temperature (22°C), 15 min each\n        with rocking.\n      \n        Incubate all 4 membranes with 1–2 mL SuperSignal West Femto substrate\n        per blot at the same time for 5 min.\n      \n        Place all blots in a ChemiDoc Imaging System and develop until bands for\n        all temperatures are visible.\n      \nNote: Samples exposed to the highest\n      temperatures (e.g., greater than 60°C) may not show visible bands.\n    \nPerforming the ITDR\nTiming: 2.5 h\n      Although the absolute kinetics of ligand-substrate binding cannot be\n      determined using CETSA (see limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]),\n      differences in concentrations between multiple compounds to obtain the\n      same thermal stability can be determined using ITDR. ITDR involves\n      treating protein lysates with increasing compound concentrations at one\n      temperature. The temperature used for ITDR can be determined from CETSA\n      experiments and should be chosen based on the greatest thermal difference",
    "between control and treatment conditions. As an example, we will describe\n      the ITDR protocol for R24 to test its dose-dependent thermal stabilization\n      of C. elegans NHR-86.\n    \n        Repeat Steps 1–6 and dilute protein lysates to 5–10 mg/mL. Keep\n        protein lysates on ice.\n      \n        Prepare several concentrations of compound(s) to be tested at 2×\n        concentration.\n        \n            R24 is a compound that can be solubilized in DMSO. We have found\n            that a final DMSO concentration of up to 3% is acceptable and will\n            not lead to variable results.\n          \n            Prepare 8 concentrations of R24 in PBS at 2× concentration (see\n            preparing ligands[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]).\n          \nPrepare 4% DMSO in PBS (2× concentration).\n        In an 8-tube PCR strip, transfer 25 μL protein lysate into each tube.\n      \n        Allow both protein lysate and compound(s) to equilibrate to room\n        temperature (22°C) for 10 min.\n      \n        Transfer 25 μL of 2× compound or solvent control to each PCR tube\n        containing 25 μL of protein lysate.\n      \nIncubate at room temperature (22°C) for 15 min.\n        While incubating, set up a thermocycler and set to “Incubate” at 60°C\n        for ∞ (i.e., for infinity).\n      \nNote: Determine the optimal temperature\n      for ITDR by identifying the CETSA condition that produces the largest\n      difference in temperatures between control and treatment conditions.\n    \n        Transfer the tubes onto the preheated blocks.\n        \n            Incubate protein lysates treated with compound at 60°C for 3 min\n            with the heated lid closed.\n          \n            Remove tubes from block after 3 min and allow to cool to room\n            temperature (22°C) for 3 min.\n          \nPlace on ice.\n        Transfer each mixture into ice-chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n        Centrifuge at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\n      \n        Prepare labeled 8-tube PCR strips for gel electrophoresis.\n        \nLabel 1 PCR tube for each sample.\n            In each PCR tube, transfer 10 μL 4× NuPage LDS Sample Buffer and\n            2 μL β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) (5% total volume).",
    "Carefully transfer 28 μL of the supernatant (without disturbing the\n        pellet) from Step 37 into the labeled PCR tubes of\n        Step 38 and mix gently. Pellets may or may not be visible\n        depending on the temperature.\n      \nIncubate at 70°C for 10 min.\n        Perform gel electrophoresis and immunoblot (see\n        immunoblot analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]).\n      \nNote: To optimize consistency between\n      samples, run gel electrophoresis, immunoblot transfer, and immunoblot\n      development/visualization for all samples together in one run."
