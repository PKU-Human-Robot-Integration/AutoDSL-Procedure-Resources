    "Sample treatment and collectionThis section describes the plant cultivation and treatment procedures for Arabidopsis thaliana and Capsella rubella inflorescence tissue subjected to auxin treatments. Cultivation and treatment procedures may differ for other species, tissues and treatments.Grow Arabidopsis plants on soil at 22 °C in long day conditions (16 h day/8 h dark) until inflorescences emerge (3-4 weeks).Treat inflorescences by spraying the full tray of plants with a solution containing 100 µM Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, auxin) and 0.015% Silwet L-77 or MOCK (only 0.015% Silwet L-77) in water (Note 1).Return treated plants to the growth room for two hours.Using tweezers collect 3 g of young inflorescence tissue in a 50 ml Falcon Tube (Note 2).Collect a total of three biological replicates (3 times 3 g) for one experiment (Note 3).CrosslinkingTransfer the collected samples onto Miracloth squares (~5 x 5 cm), fold into small bags and close them securely with an elastic band (Note 4).Place samples in a glass beaker (100 ml) and add 50 ml 1% Formaldehyde solution (Note 5).Note: Formaldehyde is toxic, work in fume cabinet. Place the glass beakers in the vacuum desiccator and turn it on.Crosslink samples in 1% formaldehyde solution for 3 times 5 min, releasing the vacuum after 5 min and reapply when fully released (Note 6).Quench the reaction by adding 2 M glycine solution to a final concentration of 125 mM and apply vacuum for 5 min.Release vacuum and discard quenched 1% Formaldehyde solution.Wash samples twice with 1x PBS and twice with water.Blot them dry on paper towel and then fold the tissue into aluminium foil.Flash freeze packets in liquid nitrogen.*Stopping point (store at -80 °C).Note: Unless stated otherwise all subsequent steps should be carried out on ice using pre-cooled buffers.",
    "Nuclear extractionUsing pre-cooled mortar and pistil, grind the plant material in liquid nitrogen into fine powder.Suspend ground up plant material in 25 ml Honda Buffer and homogenise for 10 min at 4 °C on a rotor.Filter through one layer of Miracloth (~7 x 7 cm) using a funnel into new 50 ml Falcon tube. Squeeze the Miracloth to maximise the yield.Centrifuge at 850 x g for 20 min (4 °C).Gently resuspend the pellet in 1 ml Honda Buffer (Note 7).Centrifuge at 850 x g for 5 min (4 °C).Repeat step 5 and 6 twice to clear the extract.*Stopping point (pellet can be stored overnight at -20 °C).Chromatin fragmentation by sonicationCentrifuge 4,000 x g for 1 min (4 °C).Remove residual Honda Buffer and resuspend pellet in 300 μl of Nuclei Lysis Buffer.Split the sample in two 2 ml Lobind tubes (~250 μl per tube).Take a 25 μl of this new suspension for your non-sonicated control and store at -20 °C.Sonicate 3 times for 5 min on medium strength using a Bioruptor water bath sonicator (Diagenode) using a 30 s ON/OFF cycle, to fragment the chromatin. Mix samples between each 5 min period (Note 8).Centrifuge the samples for 10 min, 4,000 x g, 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to fresh 2 ml Lobind tubes.Take a 25 μl to check sonication efficiency and store at -20 °C (Note 9).*Stopping point (samples can be stored overnight at -20 °C).Immunoprecipitation (IP)Dilute the samples ten-fold with ChIP Dilution Buffer (~2 ml).Note: Take 20 μl sonicated homogenate as Input control. Prepare the antibody coated magnetic beads.Take 15 μl of Protein A magnetic beads for each IP and wash three times with 1 ml ChIP dilution buffer.Resuspend magnetic beads in 50 μl ChIP Dilution Buffer per IP.Bind 1 μg of antibody per IP to the beads.",
    "To IP H3 we use the anti-H3 antibody and to IP H3K27Ac we use the anti-H3K27ac Antibody.Incubate on a rotor for an hour at 4 °C.Add 50 μl anti-H3 antibody-coated beads to one half of the samples and 50 μl antibody-coated beads to the other half of the samples.Incubate on a rotor at 4 °C for at least 4 h.*Stopping point (this step can also be done overnight).Wash the beads sequentially (each time 5 min at 4 °C incubation on the rotor) with 1 ml with:Twice Low Salt Washing Buffer.Twice High Salt Washing Buffer.Twice TE Buffer.Note: For each of these washes, leave on the magnetic stand for one minute at a time. After the last TE wash transfer the sample to a fresh 1.5 ml Lobind tube then separate on the magnetic stand and remove TE.DNA recoveryElute from beads twice with 200 μl pre-heated Elution Buffer. Incubate for 15 min at 65 °C with 800 rpm agitation. Collect the two elutions (400 μl total volume) in one fresh 1.5 ml Lobind tube and discard the magnetic antibody coated beads.Bring the Input samples to 400 μl using Elution Buffer.To reverse crosslink, add 16 μl 5M NaCl to the eluate and incubate at 65 °C and 600 rpm agitation overnight.After reverse crosslinking, add 3 μl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubate for 1 h at 45 °C.To extract DNA, add 400 μl Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), vortex for 30 s and centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Transfer the aqueous layer (~400 μl) in a fresh 1.5 ml Lobind tube.To precipitate DNA, add 0.1 volume (40 μl) 3 M NaAc and 2 volumes (800 μl) 100% ethanol (mix well) and incubate at -20 °C for 1.5 h.Centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 30 min (4 °C).",
    "Wash pellet with 500 μl ice cold 70% ethanol, centrifuge for 10 min at 4,000 x g (4 °C).Remove all traces of ethanol and dry the pellet in vacuum concentrator for 10 min (65 °C).Resuspend the pellet in the required volume of nuclease free water (Note 10).Identification of precipitated protein-associated DNA by qPCRSetup qPCR reactions in triplicate per antibody, treatment and primer pair as follows (Note 11):Per reaction (10 μl final volume): 3 μl DNA, 5 μl SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma), 0.125 μl Forward Primer (10 μM), 0.125 μl Reverse Primer (10 μM), 1.75 μl water.Run the reaction on qPCR machine using the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min followed by 60 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 30 s.Analyse the data as described under “Data analysis”."
