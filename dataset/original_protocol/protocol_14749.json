    "1. Cleaning Cell Sonifier System\nClean the union between the horn and converter using chloroform and a swab of cotton. Apply a light oil or mineral oil to the threads of the horn and converter to further remove buildup of metal shavings, rust, or oxidation.\nUse chloroform to remove the oil and any other contaminants from the union after wiping the threads with oil.\n2. Reassembling the Cell Sonifier and Setting up the System \nReattach the horn to the converter. To properly torque the system, remove the assembled converter and horn from the cup assembly by pulling the horn out of the bottom of the cup (Figure 2A). Place a slot wrench inside one of the three small holes near the top of the converter (Figure 2B). Then, position a torque-wrench fitted with a ½ inch crow’s foot on the slotted part of the horn (Figure 2B). Tighten in standard clockwise direction until the torque meter reads 54.23 N.m (Figure 2C), the torque recommended by the manufacturer16. Fit the tightened converter and horn back into the cup, and mount the horn and converter to a ring stand in an upright position. Reattach the converter to the power supply before setting the system for experimental pulse dosing.\nSet the system for pulse dosing using 1 sec of sonication with 1 sec between pulses. Different dosing models may be used for other experimental conditions. Many variables, such as water volume and horn diameter would potentially require changes to this dosing. Using the aforementioned cell sample types, volume, and concentration, empirical data and observation have led to the formulation of this dosing regimen.",
    "Adjust the system to the desired amplitude. In this protocol, use 33% and 50% amplitude to prevent complete cell destruction, which would render the efficacy of sonosensitizers difficult or impossible to gauge.\n\tNOTE: In this study the amplitudes are compared.\n3. Assessing System Intensity and Function \nHold the cavitation meter at 1.5 cm, which is the level of the sample sonication. Note the readings to assess that the system is running at an expected intensity. Using the current system and water levels, expect between 100-110 W/cm2 for 33% amplitude and 115-125 W/cm2 for 50% amplitude. Note the cavitation meter readings from the meter display which represents cavitation energy in W/cm2 directly. Take these readings at the surface of the water, and ensure no bubbles are present at the face of the meters probe.\n\tNOTE: It is important to note that these procedures are done without the cap for access above the horn. They need not be repeated after every sonication. Rather, they should be performed only after cleaning, reassembling, and setting up the system.\nPlace the hydrophone in a sample vial containing 12.5 ml of water in order to fully immerse the hydrophone sensor. Suspend the hydrophone using the ring stand.\nAttach the hydrophone to the input of the oscilloscope in order to assess waveform characteristics. Examine the oscilloscope for a clear sine wave, as aberrant waves can alter the frequency of the system from the specifications of the manufacturer. Both the cavitation meter and oscilloscope give a frequency reading, but only the oscilloscope will show aberrant waves that are indicative of a faulty system or improper assembly.\n4. Preparation of Cells and Medium",
    "Prepare the medium by using 240 ml Iscove’s Modified Dubecco’s Medium (IMDM) and 50 ml fetal bovine serum. Do not thaw fetal bovine serum in a hot water bath, as rapid increases in temperature can lead to a compromise in serum stability. Combine 240 µl gentamicin 50 mg/ml and 5 ml penicillin/ streptomycin 100x in a standard culture flask, and add to the medium. Store the medium at 4 °C.\nSeed U937 cells at ~4 x 104 cells/ml in a 25 cm2 flask using the prepared medium. Assess cells for concentration and viability using a TC20 cell counter and trypan blue exclusion by placing 15-20 µl of cells and 15-20 µl trypan blue into a micro-centrifuge tube and mixing the contents. Pipette15-20 µl of this mixture into a TC20 sampling slide, and initiate counts by placing the slide into the TC20 cell counter.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and check for cell viability using trypan blue exclusion and the TC20 cell counter. When the cells are at an appropriate concentration and/or have been treated with sonosensitizers for an appropriate time frame, transfer 3 ml of cells from the culture flask to a 20 ml glass scintillation vial. In this protocol, grow U937 cells for 48 hr, and then treat with 0.5, 1, or 5 mM MeβCD for 30 min to sufficiently deplete the cholesterol of cells prior to sonication.\n5. Cell Sonication",
    "Degas deionized, distilled water using a vacuum and Buchner flask. Transfer the water to the cup horn, and fill to a level of 15 mm above the top of the horn. The sonication process causes further degassing of the water for a period of a few minutes, and can lead to inconsistencies over the course of the experiment if the system is not run prior to sample sonication. Therefore, run the system for ~7 min prior to sample sonication.\nAttach the scintillation vial containing the cells to the holding device. Then, attach the holding device to the top of the cup horn and set to an elevation of 15 mm from the top of the horn (at the water surface using the sliding mechanism).\nThe cells are typically sonicated using three 1 sec pulses of ultrasound, with 1 sec spacing in between each of these pulses. For this protocol, sonicate cells at 33% and 50% amplitude using the abovementioned pulse dosing.\n6. Assessing Cells for Damage Post-sonication\nAssess the suspended cells for damage and viability using trypan blue and the TC20 cell counter. In addition, analyze the sample using a Z2 counter. For Z2 counter analysis, pipette a 100 µl cell suspension into 20 ml isotonic saline (200:1 ratio). Prior to analysis, flush the aperture of the Z2 particle analyzer at least twice using isotonic saline. Place the Z2 sample in the counter holder, and raise the platform to the aperture before initiating counts.\nAcquire the data from the TC20 and Z2 counters using software provided by the manufacturer. Analyze these data for cell damage, viability, and the creation of cellular debris from sonication.\n7. XTT Assay to Determine Cell Viability and Mitochondrial Activity of Treated U937 and THP1 Cells",
    "Prior to the XTT assays, grow U937 and THP1 cells under the same conditions. Pretreat cells with the same concentration range of MeβCD for 30 min prior to sonication. Use the same ultrasound parameters as before except that cells are now sonicated using a range of 1-3 one sec pulses spaced one sec apart to develop a range of damage for the XTT kit to assess.\n\tNote: Many of these steps are taken directly from the XTT kit manual and are only repeated for the convenience of interested laboratories.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 200 x g for 10 min. Resuspend cell pellet in the growth medium previously described. Resuspend cells at ~1 x 105 cells/ml. Seed U937 cells at 100 µl per well into a flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plate in triplicate, and then repeat for THP1 cells using a separate 96-well plate. Include 3 control wells containing 100 µl of complete growth medium alone as blank absorbance readings. Then, incubate the inoculated plates for 24 hr.\nDefrost two aliquots of the XTT reagent and the activation reagent at 37 °C prior to use. Swirl aliquots gently until clear solutions are obtained. Add 0.1 ml of the activation reagent to 5.0 ml of the XTT reagent, which forms enough activated XTT solution for one 96-well microtiter plate assay. Repeat the process for the other plate.\nAdd 50 µl of the activated-XTT solution to each well. Return the plate to the cell culture CO2 incubator for 2 hr. Shake the plate gently following the incubation period to evenly distribute the orange color in the positive wells. Measure the absorbance of the assay wells containing the cells and the blank background control wells at a wavelength between 450-500 nm wavelength using a microtiter plate reader.",
    "Either zero the microtiter plate reader using the blank control wells or subtract their average value from the specific results. Measure the absorbance of all the assay wells again at a wavelength between 630-690 nm and subtract the values from the 450-500 nm values obtained. Note: This second absorbance determination helps eliminate non-specific readings from the assay results. The XTT assay was repeated four times for both cell lines."
