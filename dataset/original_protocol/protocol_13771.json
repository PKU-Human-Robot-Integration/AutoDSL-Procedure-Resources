  "procedures": [
    "13 healthy and sexually mature female Göttingen minipigs (age between 12 and 14 months) and 10 healthy and sexually immature female Landrace pigs (age between 2 and 3 months) were housed in pig stalls conforming to the size recommendations of the most recent Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals DHEW and EU Guidelines 63/2010. Animals were not spayed. The temperature of the animal rooms was controlled, and animals were kept at a 12-hour light/dark cycle and vermin-free. Ad libitum feeding leads to overt weight gain in both Göttingen minipigs and Landrace pigs, therefore, pigs from both the breeds were fed with a restricted diet regimen. Göttingen minipigs were put on restricted diet as early as they arrived to the animal facility and for the whole study duration. Special Diet Services pig chow 180-220 g/meal/animal was given twice daily according to \"Taking good care of Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs\" guideline (revision date: 13 March, 2013) in the first 2 days. Between day 3 and 12 animals were fed 50% Special Diet Services pig chow and 50% maintenance minipig diet. From day 14 until the end of the study animals were fed a maintenance minipig diet. Landrace pigs received pregnant sow chow, 1.5% of body weight given two times a day according to PIC Wean to Finish Manual 2008 and 2013. All the animals received food individually dispensed and food intake was monitored to avoid competition for chow. Animals with feeding difficulties were fed individually aided by tending personnel. All animals received tap water ad libitum. The experimental protocol of post-MI HF in Göttingen minipigs and in Landrace pigs is shown in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61901/61901fig1v2.jpg",

Baseline CMRI\nWithdraw food from animals at least 12 hours before the start of anesthesia but secure access to water to prevent dehydration.\nAnesthesia\n\t\nInduce anesthesia of the animals with ketamine hydrochloride (12 mg/kg), xylazine (1 mg/kg), and atropine (0.04 mg/kg) as an intramuscular injection to the neck region.\nMeasure the body weight and length of animals. The calculation of the body surface areas (BSA) formulas were described by Itok et al. for Göttingen minipigs (BSA [m2] = (7.98 × BW [kg]2/3)/100)17 and by Swindle et al. for Landrace pigs (BSA [m2] = (7.34 × BW [kg]0.656)/100)18.\nIntubate animals, maintain anesthesia with isoflurane (2% isoflurane, 2 L/min oxygen). The size of the endotracheal tube depends on the individual anatomic characteristics of each animal and ranges between 6.0- to 7.5-mm.\nCannulate the ear vein with 18 G needle and start administration of 5% glucose in Ringer solution (1 L/hour).\nCMRI\n\t\nTransfer animal to CMRI facility and administer 0.4-0.5 mg/kg atracurium besylate i.v.. Atracurium besylate is a nondepolarizing, skeletal muscle relaxant that is used to avoid respiratory artefacts during CMRI measurements. Start positive pressure ventilation (16/min frequency, 350 mL volume, 25-30 mmHg positive pressure).",
    "Position the animals in the supine position. Place flexible coils on the chest and 32-channel coils are placed in CMRI bed. Perform non-contrast cardiac MRI with a 1.5T scanner, using a phased array coil and a vector electrocardiogram (ECG) system to assess the cardiac function and morphology (ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output (CO), chamber and wall dimensions). Acquire cine MRI images using a retrospectively ECG-gated, steady-state free precession cine MRI technique in short-axis and long-axis views of the heart using 1.2 ms echo time, 40 ms repetition time, 50-degree flip angle, 300 mm field-of-view, 8 mm slice thickness, and at least 256x256 image matrix.\nQuantify left and right ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV and RVEDV) and end-systolic volumes (LVESV and RVESV), stroke volumes (LVSV and RVSV), EF-s (LVEF and RVEF) and masses by manual planimetry of end-diastolic (LVED mass) and end-systolic (RVED mass) short-axis cine images. Quantify left atrial volume by tracings on the two- and four-chamber cine images. Correct the left atrial volumes to BSA to get left atrial volume indexed to body surface area (LAVi). Assess the presence of pulmonary oedema on the localizer images.\nFor calculation of cardiac index (CI) use BSA and cardiac output.\nTerminate the anesthesia by withdrawal of isoflurane. When spontaneous breathing returns, extubate the animal, remove i.v. cannula and return it to its cage.\n2. Premedication, vascular access and coronary artery occlusion\nPremedication\n\t\nOne day prior to surgical procedure administer 500 mg of acetyl salicylic acid and 300 mg of clopidogrel orally.\nApply analgesia (meloxicam 0.4 mg/kg body weight) and antibiotic cocktail (benzylpenicillin-procain (24.8 mg/mL), benzylpenicillin-benzatine (83.6 mg/mL), dihidrostreptomycine-sulfate (156.3 mg/mL), 3 mL/50 kg body weight) by intramuscular injections on the day of coronary artery occlusion.\nRepeat the steps described in 1.2.1-1.2.4 sections.",
    "Use the ear vein cannula for fluid replacement and drug administration. Administer 1g magnesium sulfate throughout the procedure via ear vein every 30 min to prevent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF).\nVascular access\n\t\nPlace the animal on the operating table, fix the limbs, and apply wedges to immobilize the animal in the supine position.\nDisinfect the surgical site with povidone-iodine. The surgical site is around the skin fold between the gracilis and sartorius muscle.\nRemove the hair at the surgical site with a razor.\nPlace surface ECG electrodes in Einthoven's triangle. This triangle is formed by the two anterior limbs and left hind limb and the electrodes are placed on limbs.\nStart positive pressure ventilation (16/min frequency, 350 mL volume, 25-30 mmHg positive pressure).\nIsolate the disinfected surgical area with a surgical drape.\nApproach the femoral region as described in detail by K. S. Ettrup et al.19. In brief, make a longitudinal incision to the skin between the gracilis and sartorius muscles. Separate the subcutaneous tissue and fascia. Isolate the femoral artery and put two surgical sutures below it to control hemorrhage.\nPuncture and cannulate the femoral artery with a 6F-ACT introducer using the Seldinger technique20,21.\nFix the sheath to the skin.\nUse the artery for blood sampling for further biochemical analyses.\nAdminister 5000 IU heparin via the femoral sheath to secure adequate anticoagulation and prevent thrombosis during the surgical intervention. Readminister 2500 IU heparin every 60 min throughout the procedure. The animals received approximately 370-440 IU/kg heparin during the whole intervention.\nAttach a pressure sensor to the femoral vessel to monitor the arterial blood pressure throughout the surgical intervention.",
    "For calibration of pressure place the pressure recording system on the level of the heart of each animal. After removing the air bubbles, the zero pressure calibration is performed when the three-way stopcock is opened to the direction of the free air.\nCoronary artery occlusion, reperfusion and intracoronary drug administration\n\t\nNote that this intervention should be performed only by trained interventional cardiologist. Through the femoral sheath, introduce and advance the guidewire to the aortic arch and introduce the 5F guiding catheter over the guidewire. First, advance the guidewire to approach aortic root atraumatically. Perform deep intubation by a thin, 5F guiding catheter to avoid significant obstruction of the blood flow.\nPosition the fluoroscope in antero-posterior position.\nEnsure that there is no thrombus or air bubble within the catheter with the aspiration of at least 5 mL of blood, the volume of the catheter, with the syringe connected to the catheter.\nConnect the outer portion of the catheter to a syringe filled with radiocontrast agent (iobitridol 1.1 mL/50 kg body weight).\nTake care that the syringe is held elevated to prevent infusion of air bubbles into the coronary artery.\nTo perform baseline angiography, intubate separately and fill with contrast agent selectively the ostia of right coronary artery and left main coronary artery. For more technical details, refer to catheterization textbooks20,21.",
    "Perform BARI (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation Myocardial Jeopardy Index) scoring after the baseline angiography. A score to all terminal arteries (terminal portion of the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery, as well as the ramus, diagonals, obtuse marginals, posterior descending and posterolateral branches) is assigned based on their length and caliber according to specific criteria22,23. A value of 0 represents an almost insignificant vessel size. In contrast, a value of 3 defines a large-sized artery with a length of two thirds the distance between the base and cardiac apex. Do not take right ventricular marginals and posterior descending artery septal branches into account.\n\t\t\nCalculate the final BARI score (% of the left ventricle at risk) by dividing the total value from the infarct-related artery by the total values of all arteries (Figure 2A-D) supplying the LV. Choose the occlusion site on the left anterior descendent (LAD) coronary artery to achieve approximately 25-30% myocardium at risk as assessed by BARI scoring.\nInsert the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) guidewire through the guiding catheter. Position it distally to the planned site of the occlusion under fluoroscopic guidance, and check angiography for potential complications (e.g., coronary dissection, perforation).\nDetermine by visual estimation the optimal balloon size based on coronary artery diameter.\nPlace the balloon catheter (balloon diameter 2.5 mm and balloon length 12 mm) over the PTCA guidewire and advance it to the planned position.\nFill the balloon with contrast agent and check the position of the balloon catheter by angiography.\nInflate the balloon below the nominal pressure (7-9 atmospheres) of the balloon to develop the soft touch between the balloon side-wall and the surface of the vessel. Soft-touch is defined as interaction of balloon side-wall that is enough to occlude the vessel without causing injury to the vessel wall.",
    "Confirm the occlusion (TIMI 0) with angiography by visualizing the stop of the contrast flow. Keep in place the guidewire and the balloon and pull back the guiding catheter from the ostium of the coronary artery to avoid diffuse cardiac ischemia.\nTape instruments to the surgical drape to avoid dislocation of the intracoronary balloon.\nRecord and document the ECG sign of occlusion by ST elevation.\nDuring the whole procedure, carefully monitor the vital signs, heart rate (HR), blood pressure, core temperature using rectal probe, and pulse oximetry.\nCover the animal with a heating device to maintain the core temperature.\nAdminister 1 g of magnesium sulfate as an intravenous bolus if pulseless VT or VF occurs and start chest compressions with a frequency of 100/min immediately. Apply 300J DC shock and lidocaine 2-4 mg/kg as an intravenous bolus. Treat asystole with 1 mg of epinephrine as an intravenous bolus.\nCheck balloon pressure every 30 min during the coronary occlusion. If there is a decrease of more than 0.5 bar in balloon pressure, set it back to initial values.\nPerform angiography just before the end of coronary occlusion to verify the maintained balloon placement and absence of flow distally to the occlusion site.\nAdminister 2500 IU of heparin and 1 g of magnesium sulfate intracoronarily as a slow bolus to prevent thrombosis and arrhythmias.\nInitiate the reperfusion with balloon deflation after 120 min cardiac ischemia in Göttingen minipigs and after 90 min in Landrace pigs.\nRemove the deflated balloon.\nConfirm the success of reperfusion with coronary angiography to demonstrate the blood flow at the distal part of the coronary vessel (TIMI 3).\n3. Intracoronary drug administration\nTo prevent coronary artery embolization, fill the therapeutic perfusion microcatheter with saline.\nPlace the microcatheter over the PTCA guidewire.",
    "Advance and confirm the position of the microcatheter. The tip of the microcatheter should be placed at the level of occlusion.\nRemove the PTCA guidewire.\nConnect the microcatheter with the perfusion pump and initiate intracoronary administration 5 minutes after initiation of reperfusion.\nAfter drug administration remove the microcatheter.\nMake control angiography to check the TIMI 3-grade flow of the contrast and to exclude that intervention led to air emboli or coronary dissection.\n4. Wound closure and post-operative care\nRemove the arterial sheath and tie down the femoral artery proximal to the puncture site. Occlusion of femoral artery following the angiographic intervention has no effect on the function of legs in pigs as assessed by daily veterinarian observations.\nClose the wound using continuous sutures and apply antiseptic coating.\nTerminate the anesthesia by withdrawal of isoflurane.\nClosely monitor the animals in the recovery period and inspect them every 12 hours until postoperation day 3, then every 24 hours until the end of the study. Particular attention should be given to eating and drinking behavior, lethargy, signs of infection, painful condition, weight change, mobility, and general health status. Following the procedure, the animals were transported with a van in small groups in cages to avoid unnecessary stress in early postoperative period.\n5. Post-MI CMRI and its evaluation\nAnesthesia\n\t\nUse the anesthetic protocol described in sections 1.2.1-1.2.4.\nCMRI\n\t\nAdminister an intravenous bolus of contrast agent, 0.2 mmol/kg gadobutrol at a rate of 4 mL/sec, using a manual injector.\nTake delayed enhancement images using an inversion recovery-prepared, gradient-echo sequence. Obtain short-axis and long-axis images 10 to 15 minutes after the administration of contrast agent.\nEvaluation\n\t\t\nPerform evaluation using MASS 7.6 analysis software in a blinded fashion.\nAssess end-diastolic segmental wall thickness on short-axis cine images.\nMeasure scar transmurality on short-axis delayed enhancement images.",
    "Quantify myocardial necrosis with manual planimetry on the delayed contrast enhancement images by delineating the myocardium with signal intensity 5 SDs above the mean signal obtained in the remote, non-infarcted myocardium.\n6. Statistics\nShow continuous data as mean ± standard error.\nEvaluate the difference using repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD test in Göttingen minipigs and paired t-test in Landrace pigs. BARI scores were compared with unpaired t-test and mortality rates with the chi-square test between the two breeds.\nUse GraphPad Prism for data evaluation. The differences were claimed to be statistically significant if p<0.05."
