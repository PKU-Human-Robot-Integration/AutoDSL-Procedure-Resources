    "Preparation of S. mutans cell pellets (Note 1)The S. mutans bacterial strains of interest were streaked for isolation from frozen culture stocks, on BHI plates (37 g/L BHI; 15 g/L Bacto agar) using 1 µl loops and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% (v/v) CO2/95% air incubator.Using sterile technique, an isolated colony was picked with a 1 µl loop and used to inoculate 5 ml BHI in a sterile glass test tube. Cultures were grown overnight 37 °C in a 5% (v/v) CO2/95% air incubator (Note 2). Using sterile technique, the 5 ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 45 ml BHI in a sterile 125 ml culture flask. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in a 5% (v/v) CO2/95% air incubator until the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm (OD600) reached ~0.6 (mid-log phase growth, roughly 4 h for type strain UA159).Cultures were transferred to 50 ml conical centrifuge tubes and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm (2,272 x g) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were placed at -80 °C until the assays were performed.Preparation of cell extracts from S. mutansFrozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 1 ml ice-cold NAD+/NADH extraction buffer (Frezza et al., 2011).Samples were transferred into 2.0 ml screw-capped microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.5 g glass beads.Samples were homogenized twice in a Mini Beadbeater on the “homogenize” speed setting at 4 °C for a 30 sec cycle, followed by a 2 min incubation on ice, then another 30 sec cycle.Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 x g for 5 min.Supernatants were removed and transferred to a 10,000 MWCO centrifugal filter (Note 3).Supernatant was passed through the filter by centrifugation at 14,000 x g at 4 °C.",
    "With the sample size used, the filtration typically took about 30 min.The filtrate was split into two equal volumes in fresh microcentrifuge tubes (~400 µl each), one for determination of total NAD/NADH (NADtotal), and one for determination of NADH. From this point until step C7, the protocol must be carried out in a dark room (Note 4).The sample aliquot for NADH only was incubated in a 60 °C water bath for 30 min to remove NAD+ then transferred to ice (NAD+ is heat labile, NADH is not). The aliquot for determination of NADtotal was maintained on ice throughout this step (Note 5).NAD+/NADH cycling assayAliquot 500 µl of master mix (Gibon and Larher, 1997) into an appropriate number of microcentrifuge tubes (Note 5).Add 100 µl of sample, NADH standard, or NAD+/NADH extraction buffer (for blank) to each microcentrifuge tube containing master mix.Bring each reaction volume to 900 µl with 0.1 M NaCl and vortex briefly.Incubate reactions in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min (Note 6).Add 100 µl of Adh (containing 10 U) to each reaction and vortex briefly.Incubate reactions in a 37 °C water bath for 40 min.Add 500 µl of 6 M NaCl to stop each reaction and precipitate the reduced MTT. Vortex briefly. The reactions are no longer light sensitive and the remainder of the protocol may be carried out under standard lighting conditions.Centrifuge stopped reactions at 4 °C and 10,000 x g for 5 min.Decant tubes (Note 7) and resuspend pellets in 1 ml 200 proof ethanol.Analyze samples and standards for absorbance at 570 nm, using the sample containing 100 µl NAD+/NADH extraction buffer as a blank. Generate a standard curve using known quantities of NADH (added in step C2 above) and use to calculate the concentration of unknown samples. Calculate NAD+ via NADtotal-NADH."
