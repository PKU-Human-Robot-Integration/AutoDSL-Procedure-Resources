    "This protocol describes a series of procedures required to isolate T-MPs and drug-loaded T-MPs from tumor cell culture supernatant based on differential centrifugation. The protocol begins with the method for tumor cell culture. Tumor cells are exposed to ultraviolet irradiation for 1 hr in order to release T-MPs. 16 hr later, T-MP-containing supernatants are harvested and then undergo a series of differential centrifugations aimed at the removal of cells, cell debris, and apoptotic bodies, ending with a high-speed ultracentrifugation step to pellet T-MPs. The general principles of a basic differential ultracentrifugation workflow for T-MP isolation are outlined in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.144#cpz1144-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3d47ffcf-3358-482d-b6ce-454dbf883f0d/cpz1144-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nFlow chart outlining isolation of T-MPs from cell culture supernatant by differential ultracentrifugation.\nNOTE: Murine or human tumor cell lines used for T-MP studies should be validated to confirm their cellular origin.

    "1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube (e.g., Thermo Scientific™, cat. no. AM12400)\nPreparation of T-MP-containing conditioned medium\n1. Culture 2 × 106 A549 cells in a 100-mm cell culture dish using 10 ml DMEM supplemented with 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nThis step also applies to H22, B16, and HL-60 cells.\n2. When the tumor cells reach about 80% confluence, expose to ultraviolet irradiation (UVB, 300 J/m2) for 1 hr in a biosafety cabinet. For isolation of drug-loaded MPs, add drugs (e.g., MTX, 2 mg/ml) to medium after ultraviolet irradiation.\nThe strength of ultraviolet irradiation should be checked regularly to avoid ultraviolet light attenuation after long-time use.\n3. Incubate 16-20 hr at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nHarvest cell culture supernatant and perform centrifugations\n4. Harvest cell culture supernatant into a 50-ml polypropylene tube using a sterile pipet at 16 hr after ultraviolet irradiation. Wash out the dish with PBS twice to make sure that the T-MPs or drug-MPs sticking to the dish are collected.\n5. Centrifuge cell culture supernatant 10 min at 1000 × g, 4°C.\nThis step will remove whole cells and cell debris.\nPerform all further steps at 4°C in order to maintain the integrity and biological characteristics of T-MPs.\n6. Transfer the supernatant to a new 50-ml polypropylene tube and centrifuge 2 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C.\nThis step will pellet the remaining cell debris and smaller apoptotic bodies.\n7. Transfer the supernatant to a new 50-ml polypropylene tube and centrifuge 60 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C, to pellet T-MPs.\n8. Gently remove tubes from centrifuge and discard the supernatant from each tube.\n9. Add 1 ml pre-chilled PBS and transfer the resuspended pellet to a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.",
    "10. Wash the pellet twice, each time microcentrifuging 60 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C.\nThe PBS wash improves the purity of T-MPs [e.g., frees them from drug (MTX) or residual soluble proteins in supernatants].\nMark the location of the pellet on the wall of the tube, which may be very small or even invisible.\n11. Finally, resuspend the T-MPs or drug-MPs pellet in FBS-free culture medium or PBS for the subsequent experiments.\nT-MPs and drug-MPs are stable when stored for 7 days at 4°C. Use freshly prepared MPs as soon as possible.",
    "Due to the small size (100-1000 nm) and detection approach limitation, verification of extracellular vesicles should rely on a combination of multiple methods, including electron microscopy (EM, including scanning electron microscopy, SEM, or transmission electron microscopy, TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), flow cytometry (FCM), specific protein detection, and so on. EM is used to observe the morphology and structure, allowing T-MP detection with 100% confidence. In T-MP counting, FCM is used to determine T-MP number, but presently NTA offers more of an advantage in counting and tracking. Nevertheless, FCM is widely used for fluorescence staining on T-MPs, which is used for T-MP tracing in vitro and in vivo, and also used to detect protein and other molecular probes. Meanwhile, proteins carried by T-MPs can be detected by immunogold staining EM or western blotting. Because their heterogeneity and small size make T-MPs complex and poorly reproducible, at least two of the methods mentioned above should be used to characterize tumor cell-derived microparticles.

Detection of proteins in MPs by immunogold staining in conjunction with EM is also considered a reliable method. For more detail on the electron microscopic procedures described below, see Current Protocols article Burghardt & Droleskey (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.144#cpz1144-bib-0002]).\nNOTE: Sample preparation for EM requires specialized technicians, especially for fixation of T-MPs and ultrathin sectioning. High-purity T-MPs are needed for EM observation, and a suitable fixing solution concentration and well-prepared sections are key to obtaining these.\n1a. Pass T-MPs through 1-μm filter to remove debris.\n2a. Keep the concentration of T-MPs at ≥ 5 × 108/100 μl (as previously determined by NTA; see steps 1b-6b, below).\n3a. Add 10-15 μl T-MPs suspended in PBS on copper grid coated with formvar/carbon in a dish with Parafilm on the bottom.\n4a. Keep dish covered with lid to avoid contamination on the grid. Incubate T-MPs on grid for 20 min at room temperature.\n5a. Add 100 µl of 4% PFA onto the grid on the Parafilm and incubate at room temperature for 1 hr.\n6a. Add 1 ml PBS onto the grid and shake it slowly for 5 min.\n7a. Add 100 μl of 1% OsO4 and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "8a. After washing with ultrapure water, treat the pellets with a graded ethanol which contains 1% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol for 30 min, and then embed them in OsO4.\n9a. Polymerize samples at 60°C overnight.\n10a. Prepare ultrathin sections and observe under EM (see Current Protocols article: Burghardt & Droleskey, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.144#cpz1144-bib-0002]).\nMeasurement and counting of T-MPs by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)\nThe technique of NTA offers real-time, multiple-functional analysis of nanoparticles in liquid suspensions, including concentration, size distribution, and direct imaging. Particles in a sample can be visualized in real time by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera through tracing the light scattering. By means of this process, each particle's Brownian motion is recorded in real time, then size and distribution are tracked by image recording. Finally, data are processed and analyzed by software. If particles are labeled with fluorescent dye, the positively stained particles can also be detected by fluorescence. For the optimal instrument performance, the procedure should be carried out as follows.\n1b. Fill the fluidics of the NTA instrument with particle-free ultrapure water (which has been passed through a 0.1-μm filter), making sure no bubbles are in the sample chamber and tubing.\nLess than 3 particles observed is optimal.\n2b. Adjust NTA parameters under flow conditions with undiluted T-MP stock to determine the concentration of T-MPs.\n3b. Dilute the T-MP stock in PBS to obtain an appropriate concentration, which should range from 20-60 particles per field.\n4b. The image contrast can be adjusted by the Threshold in Advanced Camera settings.\n5b. Make sure that at least 200 completed tracks are analyzed in each video recording. Each sample should be repeatedly analyzed three times to balance out sample inhomogeneity.\nResults may be presented as three-dimensional image, histogram, or dot plot.\nSurface marker staining of T-MPs by flow cytometry",
    "T-MPs are shed from tumor cells and inherit membrane protein; thus, the T-MPs may be characterized through a tumor cell−specific marker.\n1c. After isolation, resuspend T-MPs with PBS that has been prefiltered through a 0.1-μm filter.\n2c. Pass T-MPs in PBS through a 1-μm filter to further exclude background noise or nonspecific events.\n3c. Centrifuge 60 min at 14,000 × g, and resuspended pelleted T-MPs with 100 μl filtered PBS.\n4c. Add 5 μl APC-anti human CD44 antibody (1:100) and co-incubate on ice in dark area for 60 min. Use 5 µl APC Mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody (1:100) for isotype control.\n5c. Wash T-MPs with PBS twice and resuspend T-MPs with 100-µl prefiltered PBS.\n6c. Detect CD11b-positive T-MPs with flow cytometry, using isotype antibody group for baseline setup.\nDetection of T-MPS protein by western blotting\nT-MPs encapsulate a large amount of information from the parent cell, including that from proteins, RNAs, and lipids. Specific protein detection is generally used to verify the source of MPs, more so than RNA or other macromolecules. In addition to flow cytometry and immunogold staining (TEM), western blotting (WB) is also a classic method for protein detection. The detailed protocol (see Ni et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.144#cpz1144-bib-0020]) on MP protein detection by WB is similar to the procedure for WB on the parent cell. Specific issues are mentioned as follow.\n1d. Pass T-MPs through a 1-μm filter to remove debris.\n2d. Protein lysis buffer should be added.\nSodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% concentration, is needed to optimally disrupt the lipid-raft structure of T-MPs.\n3d. The housekeeping protein is not invariable; β-actin is missed in some T-MP samples.\nMembrane proteins (Na/K ATPase) may be used as a alternative housekeeping proteins.\nDetection of drug concentration in T-MPs by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)",
    "To detect the drug concentration in tumor-cell derived microparticles, drugs should be first extracted and then detected by HPLC. Doxorubicin-encapsulated H22 derived MPs are as an example described in the following steps.\n1e. Wash drug-encapsulated H22-MPs with PBS twice using the centrifugation conditions described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.144#cpz1144-prot-0001].\n2e.

Add 56.4 μl of 10 μg/ml daunorubicin. Make up to 400 μl final volume with PBS.\n6e. Add 5 µl of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubate for 10 min, then add 10 μl of 0.4 M MgCl2 and 20 μl of 1 µg/ml DNase I to sample.\n7e. Centrifuge 10 min at 12,000 × g, then incubate the sample in a 37°C water bath for 30 min. Add 45 μl of 400 mg/ml ZnSO4 mixed with 450 μl methanol to 450 μl of each sample.\n8e. Mix the sample, then centrifuge 5 min at 12,000 × g, and collect 100 μl of the supernatant for HPLC analysis.\n9e. Perform HPLC using a column with parameters including particle size 5 μm and 4.6 × 150 mm2 specification and HPLC system with 2475 Multi-Wavelength Fluorescence Detector, 1525 Binary HPLC Pump, and 717 Plus Autosampler.\n10e.

    "T-MPs can be used for functional analysis after collection by co-incubation with tumor cells or immune cells. Here, we describe different downstream applications of T-MPs. For functional studies, the first step is to confirm whether the T-MPs can be taken up by target cells. Flow cytometry is a convenient method to quantify the uptake of labeled T-MPs by target cells. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy is an intuitive method to observe the precise localization of T-MPs in target cells. In this protocol, T-MPs are stained with PKH67 (green) for fluorescent labeling, and then co-incubated with dendritic cells, macrophages, or tumor cells.

Intravenously inject PKH67-stained MPs into tumor-bearing mice.\n45. Evaluate the distribution of MPs in spleen, bone marrow, lymph node, lung, kidney, liver and tumor by flow cytometry at different time points (0 hr, 4 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, and 72 hr). Use CD45 pan-immune cell marker to distinguish immune cells and tumor cells.\n46. Collect urine and feces and detect PKH67-positive MPs by flow cytometry.\n47. To detect the final drug concentration in organs, intravenously inject 600 μg MTX or 2 × 106 MTX-MPs into tumor-bearing mice, homogenize the tissues for HPLC analysis of MTX concentration at different time points (0.5 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr) by HPLC (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.144#cpz1144-prot-0002])."
