    "This protocol provides instructions for culturing iPSC, including non-enzymatic passaging, as well as freezing and thawing procedures. iPSC are cultured in mTeSR™1 medium on Geltrex™ human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-qualified reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix (Geltrex) coating. To achieve optimal results, iPSC should be passaged at a confluency of approximately 60 to 70% (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-fig-0001]). Full confluency (100%) should be avoided as this may lead to poor passaging results. Furthermore, it is recommended to maintain iPSC in small cell colonies during passaging; this can be achieved by using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and avoiding excessive pipetting.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6b79daea-d5c9-4ac6-8951-abcb06707522/cpz1850-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nPhase contrast images of iPSC colony density. iPSC SBAD3 were cultured until a confluency of around 60 to 70% was reached before starting the PTL differentiation.

Do not warm up the entire bottle of mTeSR1 medium, as prolonged or repeated warming to 37°C may impact the activity of growth factors.\n3. Carefully defrost a cryovial in a 37°C water bath until only a small amount of frozen sample remains and proceed quickly to step 4.\nTo avoid contamination, do not submerge the lid of the cryovial in the water.\n4. Transfer the contents of the vial to a tube containing 4 ml warm mTeSR1 medium.\n5. Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\n6. Aspirate the supernatant from two wells of the warm Geltrex-coated plate and transfer 1.2 ml and 1.8 ml warm mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride ROCK inhibitor to each of the wells.\nThawing to two wells at an 80:20 ratio is designed so that at least one well will have a high density in case of poor cell recovery, whilst the second well serves as a backup in case the first passage from the high-density well fails.\n7. Carefully aspirate the supernatant from the centrifuged cells without disturbing the cell pellet.\n8. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml warm mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride ROCK inhibitor.\nIn order to avoid single cells and maintain iPSC in small cell colonies, pipetting up and down should not be done more than three times.\n9. Add 0.8 ml cell suspension to the well containing 1.2 ml medium and 0.2 ml cell suspension to the well containing 1.8 ml medium.\n10.

Do not warm up the entire bottle of mTeSR1 medium, as prolonged or repeated warming to 37°C may impact the activity of growth factors.\nAmount of mTeSR1 needed: approximately 2 ml per new well + 1 ml per passaged well for collecting cells.\n16. Aspirate medium from a 60 to 70% confluent well of iPSC.\nPassaging at high densities (>90%) may lead to poor passaging results, including poor cell attachment, poor cell growth or spontaneous differentiation.\nOptional: If needed, remove areas of gross spontaneous differentiating cells by scraping them using a pipette tip. Careful and gentle passaging with 0.48 mM EDTA will get rid of small amounts (<10%) of spontaneous differentiating cells.\n17. Add 1 ml DPBS and aspirate.\n18. Add 0.5 ml 0.48 mM EDTA, gently rock the plate to cover all cells with EDTA, and aspirate.\n19. Add 0.5 ml 0.48 mM EDTA, gently rock the plate to cover all cells with EDTA, and incubate for 3 to 6 min at 36.5°C.",
    "The incubation time may vary depending on the cell line. It is recommended to check the cells every few min with an inverted microscope. Proceed to the next step when the cells become rounded and before they start to detach.\n20. Carefully aspirate EDTA.\n21. Detach the cells from the plate with 1 ml warm mTeSR1 medium with gentle pipetting.\nIn order to avoid single cells and maintain iPSC in small cell colonies, pipetting up and down should not exceed more than five times.\n22. Plate out cells at split ratios between 1:3 to 1:25.\n         \nAspirate the supernatant from the warm Geltrex-coated plate and add warm mTeSR1 medium. The volume of medium is dependent on the selected split ratio (see below for an example).\nAdd the cell suspension to the well containing mTeSR1 medium. The volume of cell suspension is dependent on the selected split ratio (see below for an example).\nExample: The split ratio indicates the proportion of cells to be transferred into a new well. For example, if cells from one 6-well are resuspended in 1 ml, a split ratio of 1:10 means that 0.1 ml of the 1 ml cell suspension (1/10th of the original culture) is to be transferred to a new 6-well. The new well would already contain 1.9 ml mTeSR1 medium, resulting in the usual cell seeding volume for a 6-well, which is 2 ml.\nRecommended split ratios vary depending on the growth rate of different iPSC lines.\n23. Check the cells with an inverted microscope to see whether the cell amount is sufficient and whether most cells are in small colonies.\nOptional: Add additional cells if the density is too low.\n24. Gently rock the plate to spread the cells equally over the wells.",
    "25. Carefully transfer the plate to the cell culture incubator.\n26. Feed the cells the second day after passaging with warm mTeSR1 medium.\n27. Continue to feed the cells every day with warm mTeSR1 medium.\n28. Passage iPSC once 60 to 70% confluency is reached.\nFreezing iPSC\nAll volumes described below are based on one well of a 6-well plate. Adjust the volumes accordingly if other plate formats are used.\n29. Pre-cool one cryovial in a cold cell freezing container.\n30.

Detach the cells from the plate with 0.5 ml ice-cold mTeSR1 medium with gentle pipetting.\nIn order to avoid single cells and maintain iPSC in small cell colonies, avoid pipetting up and down more than five times.\n33. Transfer 0.5 ml cell suspension to one pre-cooled cryovial in the cell freezing container.\n34. Add 0.5 ml ice-cold 2× iPSC freezing medium to the cell suspension in the cryovial and pipette up and down once.\nTry to keep the cell suspension cold to decrease cell toxicity by DMSO.\n35. Store the cell freezing container containing the cryovial at −80°C overnight.\n36. Transfer the cryovial to liquid nitrogen storage the next day for long-term storage.\nAvoid keeping cells longer than 24 hr at −80°C, as this will impact cell viability.",
    "This protocol outlines the procedure to differentiate iPSC into PTL within 14 days. PTL can be differentiated on either growth factor reduced Geltrex or de-cellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from cultured RPTEC/TERT1 cells, or from cultured human dermal fibroblasts fHDF/TERT166, as previously described (Chandrasekaran et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-bib-0003]; Murphy et al., 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-bib-0013]).\nExtra care should be taken regarding the starting confluency of the iPSC (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-fig-0001]), the seeding density of the cells on day 0, and the precise timing of the feeding intervals up to day 6. PTL should reach confluency on day 3 of the differentiation (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-fig-0002]). Occasionally, holes in the monolayer may be observed on day 6 after FGF-9 treatment. However, as long as the cells grow back into a confluent monolayer by day 8, this is not a problem. If holes persist after day 8, discard the culture and start a new differentiation.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2c5c9d84-c3c5-49bb-9aaf-123c3c3260f7/cpz1850-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nPhase contrast images of the PTL differentiation. iPSC SBAD3 were differentiated into PTL within 14 days.

    "3. Aspirate medium from a 60 to 70% confluent well of iPSC.\nDo not let the cells become more than 80% confluent. This is very important to increase the success rate of the PTL differentiation.\n4. Add 1 ml DPBS and aspirate.\n5. Add 0.5 ml accutase, gently rock the plate to cover all cells with accutase, and incubate for approximately 2 to 4 min at 36.5°C.\nTo avoid inactivation, do not pre-warm accutase to 37°C.\n6.

    "17. After a further 30 hr (± 2 hr), replace the medium with freshly prepared warm PTL-B medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml FGF-9.\nDo not vortex FGF-9; also avoid freeze-thaw.\nNote that on day 3, and subsequent days until the end of the differentiation, PTL-B medium is used instead of PTL-A medium.\nDay 6\n18. After a further 48 to 65 hr, replace the medium with warm PTL-B medium.\nDay 7 and onward\n19. Feed the cells every 2 to 3 days with warm PTL-B medium.\nDay 14 to Day 20\n20. PTL cells are differentiated and ready to be used or passaged (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-prot-0003]).\nPerform immunofluorescence staining to confirm cells are PTL and polarized (see Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-prot-0008]).",
    "At the end of the PTL differentiation protocol (see step 20 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-prot-0002]), the cells can only be passaged once as PTL will lose their differentiation markers after any additional passage. It is possible to either plate the cells out into the desired plate format or freeze them in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. Please note that after thawing, the cells cannot be passaged anymore and should be used immediately after the maturation period.\nSince differentiated PTL cells produce their own ECM, no coating is required when replating PTL (Chandrasekaran et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-bib-0003]). Nevertheless, for smaller formats such as a 96-well plate, or smaller, a coating is recommended. In such cases, we recommend one of the following coatings: RPTEC/TERT1 or fHDF/TERT166-ECM coating (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-prot-0006]) (Chandrasekaran et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-bib-0003]; Murphy et al., 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-bib-0013]), or human collagen IV coating (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-prot-0007]).\nFor subsequent assays, it is recommended that PTL are used between day 7 and 15 after replating (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-fig-0004]). It is essential to include the TGF-beta type I receptor inhibitor GW788388 hydrate in the cell culture medium at all times, as in its absence the passaged cells will lose their polarization (Chandrasekaran et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-bib-0003]). It is advised to assess the maturation status of passaged PTL by staining of the proximal tubular-enriched marker megalin and the tight junction marker tight junction protein 3 (TJP3 aka ZO-3) to confirm polarization prior to conducting experiments (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-fig-0005], see Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-prot-0008]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/469d11db-edf7-445a-ab05-af1ecef63bcc/cpz1850-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

    "This protocol describes the culturing of PTL on transwells, also known as microporous growth supports, or filters. Transwells allow separate treatment conditions of apical (AP) and basolateral (BL) compartments, as well as transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. It is recommended to passage or thaw PTL onto transwells. As described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-prot-0003], a coating is not required when replating PTL. When using transwells, coating with human collagen IV is preferred.\nPTL have been tested on transwells with pore sizes of 1.0 or 0.4 µm and a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polycarbonate (PC) membrane. PET transwells are preferred, as this membrane material makes it easier to view the cells by phase contrast microscopy. Optimal AP and BL volumes for transport studies are 1.5 ml and 2 ml, respectively, for 6-well PET transwells (membrane surface area: 4.5 cm2 and well surface area: 9.6 cm2) (Wilmes et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-bib-0026]), and should be adjusted accordingly when using different transwells.

    "This support protocol describes the procedure for performing immunofluorescence staining of PTL for the proximal tubular marker megalin to confirm successful differentiation and for the tight junction marker ZO-3 to assess polarization. Before subsequent use of PTL, it is critical to check whether the PTL display a polarized phenotype. Upon full polarization of PTL, ZO-3 staining should be observed exclusively at the tight junctions and not in the cytoplasm or nuclei (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-fig-0003], Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.850#cpz1850-fig-0005]).
