    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nIsolation of Stromal Vascular Fraction from Murine Adipose Tissue and Differentiation into Mature Adipocytes\nTiming: 4 h + differentiation\nNote: Skip the part on isolating stromal vascular fraction, if you are using established brown or brite adipocyte cell lines. For a detailed description regarding seeding pre-adipocytes into Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplates and the differentiation procedure jump to step 12. If you already have an established differentiation protocol, directly jump to step 19 of the respirometry part for instructions on how to perform the oxygen consumption assay.\nFor one whole Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate (corresponding to one measurement) you require either iBAT depots from 1 to 2 mice or iWAT depots from 1 mouse.\nOptional: For siRNA-based gene silencing prior to oxygen consumption analysis follow the cell culture protocol until step 10. For 4 individual siRNA treatment groups with 16 wells per condition on one Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate you require either at least iBAT depots from 2 to 3 mice or iWAT depots from 1 mouse; the number of depots can be scaled accordingly.\nNote: The initial number of fat depots is critical, as it will dictate the seeding density later on. However, the cell yield can be influenced by a variety of factors and may consequently slightly differ between labs depending on chemicals and equipment used. Therefore, the numbers stated above are guidelines and may require further optimization. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] (Cells do not differentiate well or have low/no UCP1 expression)\nEuthanize mice (young mice aged 5–6 weeks are to be preferred) by CO2 asphyxiation.\nDissect interscapular brown adipose tissue and/or inguinal white adipose tissue. Try not to damage major blood vessels during the dissection, as this will help minimizing the contamination with erythrocytes.",
    "Rinse adipose tissue with PBS-A and remove remaining connective tissue and muscle tissue (when dissecting iWAT, remove the inguinal lymph node). Cover with PBS-A to prevent the tissue from drying out; process as quickly as possible in a sterile manner.\nMince adipose tissue into small pieces (<1–2 mm3) using scissors. Large pieces will negatively affect the digestion process and result in a low cell yield.\nTransfer tissue into 15 mL tube and add 7 mL of collagenase solution to start the digestion reaction.\nCritical: One digestion reaction (7 mL) is sufficient for iBAT or iWAT depots of up to 3 mice. If the experimental design requires more depots to be processed at the same time, separate digestion reactions can be combined at step 9 (after the first two centrifugation steps or after the optional red blood cell lysis step); volumes need to be adjusted accordingly. The “7 mL of collagenase solution” stated above and the following volumes refer to one digestion reaction.\nAvoid adding significantly more than 7 mL of collagenase solution into a 15 mL tube, since an increased liquid amount results in impaired mixing and less mechanical force during the digestion process. Otherwise, the incubation time will drastically increase.\nPlace the tube horizontally into an orbital shaker. Digest by incubating at 37°C (120–180 rpm) for 45 min to 1 h 15 min. Vigorous shaking by hand for 10 s every 15 min facilitates digestion. Digestion is completed when almost no visible pieces of adipose tissue are left and the mixture becomes homogenous.\nFilter through a 250 μm nylon mesh and capture flow through in a new 15 mL tube. Rinse the tube, in which the digestion was carried out, with 7 mL of wash buffer, filter through the same nylon mesh, and combine flow through.",
    "Centrifuge at 250 × g for 5 min at 18°C–26°C (room temperature). Carefully invert the tube several times to break up the fat layer floating on top. Centrifuge at 250 × g for 5 min at 18°C–26°C (room temperature).\nCompletely remove fat layer and supernatant (do not disturb the cell pellet), add 1 mL of wash medium, and break up the cell pellet by carefully pipetting up and down (separate digestion reactions can be combined at this point).\nOptional: Erythrocytes can be removed by using a buffer designed to lyse red blood cells. Add 1–2 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer instead of wash medium to break up the cell pellet. Incubate for 3–5 min at 18°C–26°C (room temperature; separate digestion reactions can be combined at this point).\nAdd 13 mL of wash buffer and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 18°C–26°C (room temperature). Completely remove the supernatant (do not disturb the cell pellet), add 1 mL of growth medium, and resuspend cells by carefully pipetting up and down.\nOptional: For the siRNA-based knockdown procedure jump to the chapter “siRNA-based gene silencing in murine adipocytes with oxygen consumption analysis (optional)” below.\nAdd 9 mL of growth medium and filter the suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer into a reagent reservoir or a 10 cm petri dish.\nCritical: Before seeding the cells and throughout the seeding procedure repeatedly mix the cells in the reservoir by gently pipetting up and down (or carefully shaking the reservoir) to ensure that cells are thoroughly resuspended and to prevent the cells from settling down.\nNote: We recommend seeding at least 8–16 wells per condition/treatment.",
    "Seed 80 μL of cell suspension per well into a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate using a multichannel pipette. Do not seed cells in the four background correction wells (A1, A12, H1, H12), but add growth medium (without cells) in these wells. If your experimental design does not require a whole 96-well plate, add PBS or growth medium in the empty wells to reduce the microplate edge effect. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] (The position of a well on the cell culture plate systematically influences oxygen consumption rates)\nLet the plate rest at 18°C–26°C (room temperature) in the cell culture hood for 1 h after seeding. Place the cell culture plate toward the back of the incubator to minimize changes in temperature and humidity caused by frequently accessing the incubator.\nNote: As counting stromal vascular fraction or differentiated adipocytes after the trypsination procedure is problematic due to the sheer amount of cell debris, the presence of cell aggregates, and the heterogeneous size distribution, we explicitly did not state cell numbers nor provide a seeding density. Instead, we simply stick to a defined number of fat depots or wells of a cell culture plate, which is simple and astonishingly reproducible. Following our strategy, at the latest 72 h after seeding the SVF cells should have reached 30%–40% confluence. When working with established brown or brite adipocyte cell lines, seed 10,000 cells per well into a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate.\nOn the next day or at least 6 h after seeding carefully remove the growth medium using a vacuum manifold adapter and add 150 μL of fresh growth medium with a multichannel pipette. From this point on, treat the background correction wells exactly as you treat the remaining wells. The differentiation procedure is schematically summarized in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/192-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Graphical Timeline Illustrating the Differentiation Procedure from Pre-adipocytes into Mature Adipocytes\nCritical: To prevent the cells from drying out only process one half or even one third of the microplate at a time. Remove as much of the medium as possible but do not completely remove the medium (leaving around 20 μL behind), as this may cause the cells to detach. Changing the medium will require some practice.\nChange growth medium every other day until the cells reach 80%–100% confluency (termed “day 0”).\nNote: We recommend 80%–100% confluency, because pre-adipocytes will still proliferate even after the induction/differentiation process is initiated. Therefore, pre-adipocytes/differentiating adipocytes will reach 100% confluence during the 48 h induction phase, which lowers the chances of obtaining overgrown cells. Ensuring that the cells only grow in a monolayer may help to slightly reduce the inter-assay variability. Images of pre-adipocytes and adipocytes at all stages during the differentiation process can be found in the section “Expected outcomes: Cultivation of Murine Pre-adipocytes and Differentiation into Mature Adipocytes.”\nOn day 0 remove growth medium and add 150 μL of induction medium per well.\nCritical: Induction medium and differentiation medium have to be prepared freshly prior to usage. We do not recommend freezing, and/or storing medium for several days.\nOn day 2 remove induction medium and add 150 μL of differentiation medium per well.\nNote: In this context brite adipocytes are defined as cells derived from inguinal white adipose tissue and differentiated in the presence of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) agonist rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone induces a thermogenic gene signature promoting UCP1 expression. We specifically recommend working with pre-adipocytes isolated from adipose tissue of a “129 mouse” (any of the substrains), as they differentiate into adipocytes, which are characterized by high UCP1 levels.",
    "Change differentiation medium every other day until the cells are fully differentiated on day 8.\nOptional: Chemicals that supposedly affect UCP1 expression levels can be added to the differentiation medium at this point.\nsiRNA-Based Gene Silencing in Murine Adipocytes with Oxygen Consumption Analysis (Optional)\nTiming: 2 h\nThe cell culture protocol can be combined with siRNA-based gene silencing prior to respirometry (Isidor et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). This allows studying the effect of a specific gene on UCP1-dependent respiration (Li et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Isolated pre-adipocytes are cultured and differentiated on a 6-well cell culture plate prior to reverse transfection onto a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate containing the siRNA transfection mix. One decisive advantage of this protocol is that a gene of interest can be knocked down at three different time points: 1) during proliferation, 2) directly after induction (early phase of differentiation), and 3) at a late stage of differentiation (after 5 days of differentiation) to test the role of a certain gene at different time points during adipogenesis. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that siRNAs only cause a transient knockdown.\nNote: This procedure starts after step 10 of the “Isolation of stromal vascular fraction from murine adipose tissue” process. The volumes below are calculated for four individual siRNA treatment groups with 16 wells per condition (1 negative control, 3 different siRNAs per target gene) on one Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate and can be scaled accordingly.\nAdd 8 mL of growth medium (iBAT) or 6 mL of growth medium (iWAT) and filter suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer into a 15 mL tube.",
    "Critical: Before seeding the cells and throughout the seeding procedure repeatedly mix the cells in the reservoir by gently pipetting up and down (or carefully shaking the reservoir) to ensure that cells are thoroughly resuspended and to prevent the cells from settling down.\nSeed 2 mL of cell suspension per well into a 6-well cell culture plate (4 wells for iBAT and 3 wells for iWAT). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] (Basal oxygen consumption rate of cells is too high or too low following the reverse transfection procedure)\nCarefully shake the plate backward and forward, then left and right, and let the plate rest at 18°C–26°C (room temperature) in the cell culture hood for 10 min after seeding to allow equal distribution of the cells.\nNote: See Note above (Note after step 13). When working with established brown or brite adipocyte cell lines, seed 60,000 cells per well into a 6-well cell culture plate.\nOn the next day or at least 6 h after seeding carefully remove the growth medium and wash the cells twice with prewarmed PBS (the washing steps help to remove cell debris and erythrocytes). Completely remove PBS and add 2 mL of fresh growth medium.\nNote: Depending on the experimental question the reverse transfection procedure can be carried out at different time points: day 0 (commitment to the adipogenic lineage), day 2 (early differentiation), or day 7 (fully differentiated) of the differentiation procedure. Follow this protocol until the cells have reached the desired stage (step 6, step 7, or step 8), then continue with step 9 (“Reverse transfection”)\nChange growth medium every other day until the cells reach 80%–100% confluency (termed “day 0”).\nNote: See Note above (Note after step 15).\nOn day 0 remove growth medium and add 2 mL of induction medium per well.",
    "Critical: Induction medium and differentiation medium have to be prepared freshly prior to usage. We do not recommend freezing, and/or storing medium for several days.\nOn day 2 remove induction medium and add 2 mL of differentiation medium per well.\nChange differentiation medium every other day until cells are considered as differentiated on day 7.\nReverse Transfection\nUse OptiMEM, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, and siRNA stock solution to make a transfection mix for each siRNA treatment group. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] (Knockdown efficiency is low)\nTransfection Mix for siRNA-mediated knockdown. When preparing the transfection mix, at least 10% extra volume should be added, so that even the last well can be filled properly.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_192_13.csv\nMix gently. Add 25 μL of transfection mix per well into a Seahorse XF96 cell culture plate and incubate for 20 min at 18°C–26°C (room temperature) in the cell culture hood.\nRetrieve the 6-well cell culture plate from the cell culture incubator.\nCritical: Differentiating and especially fully differentiated adipocytes are very fragile. Handle with care; reduce the number of pipetting, resuspension, and mixing steps to the absolute minimum, and always pipette slowly and gently.\nWash cells twice with prewarmed PBS.\nRemove PBS and add Trypsin-EDTA solution (cells processed at day 0 and day 2), or Trypsin-EDTA-Collagenase solution (cells processed at day 5). Return 6-well cell culture plate to the cell culture incubator and leave for 2–10 min. View cells under the microscope to ensure that all cells are detached and floating.\nCritical: Cells should only be exposed to Trypsin-EDTA-(Collagenase) long enough to detach the cells. Prolonged exposure may cause damage or even excess cell death.\nOnce cells are detached add growth medium (cells processed at day 0) or differentiation medium (cells processed at day 2 and day 5) without antibiotics to inactivate trypsin.",
    "Optional: DMEM supplemented with at least 10% FBS is essentially sufficient to inactivate trypsin.\nCentrifuge at 250 × g for 5min at 18°C–26°C (room temperature). Completely remove medium.\nNote: We recommend plating at least 8 - 16 wells per negative control siRNA/siRNA treatment group. Knockdown efficiency can be directly assessed in cells that were subjected to oxygen consumption analysis (pooled RNA isolated from the content of 16 wells of a XF96 cell culture microplate is sufficient to perform qPCR; various suppliers offer kits designed to isolate RNA from small samples). Alternatively, an additional XF96 cell culture microplate/multiwell plate specifically designated to quantify knockdown efficiency can be plated and treated in parallel.\nResuspend the cells in an appropriate volume (125 μL per well) of growth medium without antibiotics and antifungal agents (cells processed at day 0) or differentiation medium without antibiotics (cells processed at day 2 and day 7). For four different groups with 16 wells of a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate per group resuspend in 10 mL of medium. After at least 20 min incubation of the transfection mix at 18°C–26°C (room temperature) add 125 μL of cell suspension per well into the Seahorse XF96 cell culture plate. The necessity of counting cells is avoided by using a defined number of confluent wells, which corresponds to a defined constant number of cells, and seeding this given number of cells into a certain number of wells in a new plate again.

After bioenergetic phenotyping, cells can be harvested for assessing knockdown efficiency if needed.\nMicroplate-Based Respirometry: Hydrating the Sensor Cartridge and Creating a Seahorse Assay Template (Day −1)\nTiming: 30 min + overnight hydration\nNote: The Seahorse XF technology is offered as a 24 or 96-well microplate-based assay platform. This protocol is tailored for the analysis of cultures of primary murine brown and beige adipocytes in a 96-well microplate format. Nevertheless, the rationale behind this protocol applies to all adipocytes expressing UCP1, and it can be extended to the 24-well microplate platform.\nOn the day before the assay the Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridge has to be hydrated. Furthermore, the Seahorse assay template can be created in advance.",
    "On the day prior to the oxygen consumption assay hydrate the SeahorseXFe96 sensor cartridge according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (instructions can be found online; “How to Hydrate an Agilent SeahorseXFe96 Sensor Cartridge”). In brief: Aliquot 22 mL of Seahorse XF Calibrant into a 50 mL tube. Incubate tube at 37°C in a laboratory (non-CO2) incubator overnight. Remove sensor cartridge from the utility plate. Add 200 μl of sterile water per well into the utility plate. Lower sensor cartridge onto utility plate (do not apply force). Incubate sensor cartridge and utility plate at 37°C in a laboratory (non-CO2) incubator overnight.\nAlternatives: Outdated hydration method: Remove sensor cartridge from the utility plate. Add 200 μl of XF Calibrant per well into the utility plate. Lower sensor cartridge onto utility plate (do not apply force). Incubate sensor cartridge and utility plate at 37°C in a laboratory (non-CO2) incubator overnight.\nNote: The sensor cartridge hydration procedure has slightly changed over the years. This assay was initially developed using a now outdated hydration method. However, based on our experience the “old” hydration method does not perform differently compared to the “new” method in the oxygen consumption assay. Thus, we definitely recommend following the updated version of the hydration procedure.\nCreate a Seahorse assay template including the following instrument protocol:\nWe recommend assigning at least eight wells of a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate to each experimental group.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_192_15.csv",
    "Note: Mix time is set to 4 min to ensure proper reoxygenation between two “Measure” commands. This protocol intentionally leaves out a “Wait” command, since during periods of high oxygen consumption even 1–2 min between a “Mix” and “Measure” command can be sufficient to significantly lower the prevailing oxygen partial pressure at the beginning of a “Measure” period. The “Measure” command is set to the shortest possible time of 2 min to prevent hypoxia in the transient microchamber, which is created during a “Measure” command (Gerencser et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nMicroplate-Based Respirometry: Preparation of Respiration Media (Day 1)\nTiming: 45 min\nOn the day of the assay the hydration procedure is completed, and bovine serum albumin (BSA)-buffered respiration assay medium is prepared freshly. All volumes regarding medium and injections below are sufficient for one assay (a whole Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate).\nComplete the Agilent SeahorseXFe96 sensor cartridge hydration procedure (instructions can be found online; “How to Hydrate an Agilent SeahorseXFe96 Sensor Cartridge”). In brief: Separate sensor cartridge from the utility plate. Remove water from utility plate. Add 200 μL of warm XF Calibrant per well into the utility plate. Lower the sensor cartridge onto utility plate (do not apply force). Incubate at 37°C in a laboratory (non-CO2) incubator for around 1 h prior to loading the injection ports.\nOutdated hydration method: Prior to loading the injection ports (step 12) separate sensor cartridge from the utility plate and lower it again onto utility plate (do not apply force).",
    "Aliquot 45 mL of respiration base medium into a 50 mL tube (used for wash steps later on), 22 mL of respiration base medium into a 50 mL tube (used for preparation of respiration assay medium later on), and 13 mL of respiration base medium into a 15 mL tube (used for injections later on). Incubate respiration base medium at 37°C until ready for use.\nPrepare respiration assay medium by supplementing respiration base medium with essentially fatty acid free BSA to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). Add 440 mg of essentially fatty acid free BSA to 22 mL of respiration base medium. Bring respiration assay medium to 37°C (ensure that BSA is completely dissolved) and adjust pH to 7.4. Incubate the final respiration assay medium at 37°C until ready for use. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9] (I do not want to include BSA in the respiration assay medium)\nNote: Fatty acid-free BSA is employed to control intracellular free fatty acid (FFA) levels and to prevent unspecific FFA-induced uncoupling (Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Li et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). However, BSA can bind significant amounts of any given substance depending on the molecular nature of the compound. Thus, the presence of BSA in the respiration assay medium may affect the unbound and available concentration of some chemicals (e.g., FCCP). In some cases you will have to significantly increase the amount of a substance used to exert the same effect as in the absence of BSA. Vice versa, there are examples of BSA facilitating the import of compounds into cells leading to an increased availability.",
    "Optional: Chemicals or inhibitors that supposedly affect UCP1-dependent respiration can be added to the respiration assay medium at this point. However, some chemicals may significantly alter the pH of the respiration assay medium. In doubt, measure the pH after adding your compound of interest again and adjust if necessary.\nMicroplate-Based Respirometry: Washing the Cells and Adding Respiration Assay Medium (Day 1)\nTiming: 30 min\nRegular cell culture medium very often contains bicarbonate as a buffering agent. As the oxygen consumption analysis is conducted under ambient atmosphere, a bicarbonate-based buffering agent would significantly alter the pH of the medium over time. Additionally, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), the second readout of the Seahorse XF technology, can only be detected in a medium with low buffering capacity. Thus, culture medium is replaced with a weakly HEPES-buffered medium containing a defined amount of BSA. BSA is a mandatory addition to the respiration assay medium due to its ability to buffer excess free fatty acids, which prevents non-specific uncoupling. UCP1-dependent respiration can only be unequivocally quantified in the presence of a certain amount of BSA (Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Li et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nRetrieve the Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate from the cell culture incubator.\nCarefully remove all but 20 μL of the differentiation medium using a vacuum manifold adapter or multichannel pipette and add 200 μL of fresh respiration base medium with a multichannel pipette.

    "Critical: A defined set of compounds is required to specifically measure oxygen consumption attributable to the action of UCP1. Many publications use a combination of Oligomycin and FCCP without Isoproterenol or any other pro-lipolytic stimulant. This setup stimulates the flow of electrons along the electron transport chain, but UCP1 is inherently inactive and it will remain inactive in this scenario. Therefore, solely using Oligomycin and FCCP is sufficient to determine electron transport chain capacity, but conclusions about UCP1-dependent respiration must on no account be drawn. Only the combination of Oligomycin and Isoproterenol allows a separate look at the action of UCP1 (Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Li et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Oligomycin shuts down all oxygen-dependent ATP-consuming processes and thereby prevents any compensatory ATP-dependent futile cycle, which may lead to an overestimation of UCP1-dependent oxygen consumption (Schweizer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), whereas Isoproterenol (or any other substance stimulating lipolysis) activates UCP1 through the induction of lipolysis. The working solutions of compounds that are loaded into the sensor cartridge’s injection ports have to be prepared freshly on the day of the assay. Injection working solutions have to be prepared at a 10× working concentration, since the volume of injection working solution per injection port (1 part) and the volume of respiration assay medium per well (9 parts) are defined in a way that each compound finally reaches a 1× concentration in the well of the microplate. Therefore, the volume of injection working solution per injection port has to increase from port “A” to port “D,” as the volume of respiration assay medium per well simultaneously increases after the addition of each injection.\nThaw appropriate volume of Oligomycin, FCCP, and Antimycin A. Isoproterenol stock solution does not freeze, as it is solved in ethanol.\nCritical: Protect Isoproterenol from light.",
    "Use Oligomycin, Isoproterenol, FCCP, and Antimycin A stock solutions to make compound working solutions for loading into the injection ports of the sensor cartridge. Prepare working solutions for each compound in respiration base medium (no BSA added) and load the sensor cartridge ports using a multichannel pipette and reagent reservoir. A detailed explanation on how to properly load the injection ports can be found online (“Loading the Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Sensor Cartridge Injection Ports”). Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11] (Oxygen consumption is not different between WT and UCP1KO adipocytes, or between groups with supposedly high and low UCP1 protein levels.)\nOptional: Isoproterenol can be replaced with a specific set of chemicals, which reliably lead to the activation of UCP1: Norepinephrine, any β3-adenergic receptor agonist, dibutyryl-cAMP, or Forskolin. Therefore, any compound that supposedly activates UCP1 directly or indirectly can be injected instead of Isoproterenol (Li et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Vice versa, putative compounds negatively affecting UCP1 activation or activity (e.g., lipolysis inhibitors) can be injected either after Oligomycin and prior to Isoproterenol or after Isoproterenol depending on the experimental question.\nPlace the utility plate with the loaded sensor cartridge onto the instrument tray and start the assay around 40 min after the Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate was placed in a laboratory (room air or non-CO2) incubator; calibration takes approximately 20 min.\nCritical: Before placing the sensor cartridge including the utility plate, and later on the cell culture plate onto the instrument tray remove all loading guides and plastic lids.
