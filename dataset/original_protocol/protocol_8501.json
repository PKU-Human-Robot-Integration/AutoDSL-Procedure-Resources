    "The experimental protocol was approved by the Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (Inserm; Montpellier, France), is consistent with the European directives, and complies with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic Research. It was carried out under the agreement of the Languedoc Roussillon Comity of Ethics in Animal Experimentation (CEEALR; nuCEEA-LR-12123).\n1. Equipment Setup and Pre-imaging Preparation\nNOTE: Here, OCT was performed on mouse retinas using the spectral domain (SD) ophthalmic imaging system (Figure 1A). The SD-OCT apparatus consists of a base and an animal imaging mount (AIM) with a rodent alignment stage (RAS) (Figure 1B). The base includes the computer, the OCT engine, the SD-OCT probe, and the mouse-specific lens. The probe is mounted onto the AIM, which includes the Z-translator. The RAS is used for mouse positioning thanks to the table with the X- and Y-translator, the cassette that can be rotated and swiveled, and the removable bite bar with the nose band. The software provided by the manufacturer allows for the acquisition and analysis of OCT files, although the latter may also be done with an open-source image processing program.\nFirmly place the probe in the AIM.\nConnect the mouse-specific lens to the probe.\nAdjust the reference arm settings for the specific lens (here, power at 086 and position at 964).\nMaking sure that the mouse-specific lens is sufficiently distant from the cassette, attach the bite bar with the nose band onto the cassette.\n\tNOTE: The distance between the lens and the cassette may be adjusted with the Z-translator screw, located at the back of the AIM. The nose band is a commercially available elastic band, and its tension should be adjusted depending upon the size of the mouse.",
    "Turn on the power supply (lower right corner of the cart) and then the computer.\nTo launch the imaging program, double-click on the appropriate shortcut on the screen.\n\tNOTE: This depends on the type of lens; here, Mouse Retina.\nCreate a new Clinical Study and add the desired Protocols. Otherwise, use the existing Clinical Study and/or Protocols.\nAdd a new study by choosing the \"Study Name\"; \"ID\"; \"Treatment Arm Specifications\" (here, \"Uncategorized\"); and predefined \"Scan Protocols\", if they exist.\nChoose an \"Examiner\" in the \"Clinical Study\" section.\n\tNOTE: For a new \"Examiner\", go to \"Setup Examiners & Physicians\" to define it.\nAdd a new Patient in the Patient/Exam section by click on Add Patient; entering the \"ID\", \"name\", \"surname\", \"sex\", and \"date of birth\" (optional).\n\tNOTE: Do this just before testing each mouse, if more convenient. Make sure that the ID is no longer than 10 characters. For the mouse, the refractive error for both eyes is 0 and the axial length is 23.0.\nClick on \"Add Exam\" and select the desired \"Protocol\" by adding \"Preset Scans\" from the list, starting with the eye that will be measured first (here, the right eye), or by customizing the scans.\nTo customize a scan, either use an existing scan as a template and edit it, or create it from scratch through the \"Add Custom Scan\" option. After adding all the scans to the list, define a new protocol using the \"Enter \"New Protocol Name\" option (OS: oculus sinister, left eye; OD: oculus dexter, right eye).",
    "NOTE: Here, the protocol involves three scans: (i) a radial scan, with a 1.4 mm diameter, 0 mm horizontal and vertical offsets, 1,000 lines of A-scans/B-scan, 100 B-scans/volume, 1 frame/B-scan, 80 lines of inactive A-scans/B-scan, and 1 volume; (ii) a rectangular scan, with a 1.4-mm length and width, 0° angle, 0-mm horizontal and vertical offsets, 1,000 lines of A-scans/B-scan, 100 B-scans, 1 frame/B-scan, 80 lines of inactive A-scans/B-scan, and 1 volume; and (iii) an annular scan, with a 0.4-mm minimum and 0.6-mm maximum diameter, 0-mm horizontal and vertical offsets, 1,000 lines of A-scans/B-scan, 3 B-scans/volume, 48 frames/B-scan, 80 lines of inactive A-scans/B-scan, and 1 volume.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nEye dilation and immobilization\nAt least 15 min before data acquisition, instill 10% phenylephrine eye drops into the mouse eyes, remove the excess, and instill 0.5% tropicamide eye drops.\n\t\tNOTE: The first dilatation can be done at once for all the mice that will be tested in the session. Make sure that the liquids are at room temperature.\nImmediately after inducing general anesthesia (step 2.2), administer 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride eye drops, keeping them in place for 3 s to anesthetize and immobilize the eyes. Afterwards, wipe off the drops and repeat the instillation of 10% phenylephrine and 0.5% tropicamide to ascertain that the eyes are well dilated.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the liquids are at room temperature and that the mouse does not swallow the oxybuprocaine.\nGeneral anesthesia\nPrepare an anesthetic solution of ketamine (20 mg/mL) and xylazine (1.17 mg/mL) in saline. Store at 4 °C for a maximum of 2 weeks.\nApproximately 5 min before testing, intraperitoneally inject 5 - 10 µL of anesthetic solution per 1 g of body mass, depending upon the age and size of the mouse.",
    "NOTE: Young and/or thin mice need less anesthetic, take less time to anesthetize, but also awaken faster. Here, 8 µL/g (160 mg/kg of ketamine, 9.33 mg/kg of xylazine).\nOptionally, lubricate the eyes with viscous eye drops or an ophthalmic gel to avoid corneal dryness.\n3. Mouse Positioning\nLubricate the eyes with viscous glycol-based eye drops to provide corneal hydration.\n\tNOTE: If the eyes seem dry during the exam, re-apply the eye drops.\nWrap the mouse in a sheet of surgical gauze to keep it warm.\nUsing a sponge or cotton wick, apply a thin layer of an ophthalmic gel with 0.3% hypromellose onto each eye, to minimize light refraction, avoid opacities, and secure corneal hydration. While doing so, move the eyelashes and whiskers aside.\nPosition the mouse in the cassette, with the head straight and pointing forward.\nGently open the bite bar clamp and place the bar in the mouth; use the nose band to secure the position.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the bite bar is in the middle of the cassette.\nPlace a cotton roll under the right (left) side if the right (left) eye is being tested.\nWhile keeping the clip-on aiming tip on the mouse-specific lens, bring it towards the eye by rotating the Z-translator screw counterclockwise.\nBy rotating and swiveling the cassette and by turning the bite bar and the X-translator screws, pre-set the position of the mouse; the goal is to have the right eye look directly into the lens, and thus to align the optical axes of the eyes and the lens.\n\tNOTE: If the mouse is too high or too low, the Y-translator screw should be used first.\nChoose the first scan in the \"Exam\", click on \"Start Aiming\", and make any further manual adjustments for retinal imaging.",
    "Using the Z-translator screw, move the retina vertically on the left panel (Figure 2, Horizontal B-scan Alignment) and horizontally on the right panel (Figure 2, Vertical B-scan Alignment).\nRotate the cassette to bring the ONH in the middle of the right panel by moving the ONH up or down. Use the bite bar screw to straighten the retina on the right panel. Swivel the cassette to position the ONH in the middle of the left panel.\nUse the X-translator screw to level the retina on the left panel. Keeping in mind the major function of each modulator, further adjust the position of the retina to centralize the ONH.\n\t\tNOTE: Use the Y-translator screw to move the ONH up and down on the right panel, if necessary. The position may be refined at any time between scans.\n4. SD-OCT Imaging of the ONH and Retina\nOnce content with the adjustments, click on \"Start Snapshot\" to begin SD-OCT scanning.\nIf a 3D imaging is not required, uncheck the OCU option.\nSave the scan and the report.\nProceed with the next scans.\nTo image the second eye, after retracting the lens, turn the cassette accordingly and repeat steps 3.6 - 4.3.\n5. Acquisition Completion\nWhen the acquisition is complete, remove the mouse from the cassette, apply ophthalmic gel with 0.3% hypromellose to each eye, and place the mouse on a heating plate to wake up.\nAfter the last acquisition, close the software and switch off the computer and the OCT machine (power supply button).\nClean the cassette with disinfectant.\n6. Analysis\nFor the retinal layer thickness measurement, use the automated segmentation software provided by the manufacturer.\nClick on the \"Patient\", choose the desired \"Exam\" from then list, and click on the \"Review Exam\" option.",
    "Load the desired OCT data onto the OCT software by right-clicking on the folder icon in the desired scan.\nRight click on the B-scan; configure the calipers by enabling up to 10 measuring calipers; and enter their names, angles, and colors.\nChoosing the desired caliper by a right-clicking on the B-scan; place it accordingly onto the retina for measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: For the scans centered on the ONH, set 5 calipers on each side of it, equidistant from each other. For the peripapillary analysis, make sure that the caliper is not placed too far from the ONH. For radial scanning, analyze 10 pictures per scan that were chosen by the OCT software. Their numbers may be found in the \"Reports\" folder.\nSave the results for analysis in a spreadsheet software program by right-clicking on the B-scan and clicking \"Save results\".\n\t\tNOTE: The results can be found in the same folder as the scanning data.\nAlternatively, use the homemade caliper macro, \"MRI Retina Tool\", developed for an open-source image processing program (see the Table of Materials).\nMake sure that the \"MRI Retina Tool\" and the \"Modify Polygon Section Tool\" macros are active. Load the image. Click on the m button to start the measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: The macro automatically creates one 0.2 mm-long measuring cassette on both sides of the ONH. Each cassette contains 5 measuring points that function as calipers. Their lateral position is unchangeable and is customized for the peripapilla in the radial scans. The horizontal position of the cassettes is predefined to measure the RNFL/GCL thickness, but it is easily modifiable to measure the GC complex layer instead. If the scan quality is poor, the horizontal position needs to be adjusted, or the picture needs to be excluded from the analysis.",
    "For horizontal adjustment, click on the e button. In the newly opened \"ROI Manager\" window, choose the first cassette.\nClick on the blue polygon button and adjust the position of the first cassette by clicking on the borders of the measured layer in the picture.\nRepeat for the second cassette by first choosing it in the \"ROI Manager\" window and then clicking on the appropriate image. Click on the r button to re-measure. View the results in the \"Measurements\" window.\n\t\tNOTE: The results may be copied to a spreadsheet software program at any time. They contain the following values for the right cassette (r), left cassette (l), and total: Intden - integrated density within the cassette; Area: area of the measurement, in mm2; Len: length of the caliper within the cassette, in mm; Mean: mean intensity of the signal within the cassette; and Std: standard error of the mean intensity of the signal.\nProceed with the next image.\nFurther analyze the data in a spreadsheet software program.\n\t\tNOTE: To find the mean thickness of the layer, take the ten Len values.\nSubscription Required.
