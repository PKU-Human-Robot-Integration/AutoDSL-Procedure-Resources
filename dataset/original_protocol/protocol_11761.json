    "White Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos), white Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus) and Japanese quail (Cortunix coturnix japonica) are incubated at 37 째C in a humidified chamber until stage-matched at HH7/817.\n1. Preparing the donor tissue\nNOTE: Preparation of reagents and tools and how to open eggs for experimental manipulation has been described6.\nPrepare DMEM media with neutral red, a glass transfer pipette, and sharpened tungsten needles.\nExpose embryos (as shown in6).\nHarvest tissue grafts from the left side of basal forebrain of stage 7/8 embryos. Use curved sharpened tungsten needles6 to gently incise a piece of the forebrain measuring ~0.3 mm in length by 0.2 mm in width, making sure to not include the underlying endoderm by sliding the needle beneath the forebrain so that the needle is parallel to the axis of the neural tube.\nUsing the glass transfer pipette, pick the graft up from the donor embryo.\nTransfer the graft into DMEM containing Neutral Red (0.01% in PBS, 23 째C) for 2 minutes to stain it, and then place the stained graft into DMEM that does not contain Neutral Red until ready for engraftment.\n2. Preparing the host\nIncubate fertilized eggs from white Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus) at 37 째C in a humidified chamber until HH7/8 17.\nExpose embryos (as shown in6).\nUsing sharpened tungsten needles, prepare the graft site by gently cutting, then removing a 0.3 mm by 0.2 mm piece of basal forebrain from the left side to accommodate the graft as was done to isolate the donor tissue.\nTake care to avoid excessive disruption of the underlying endoderm, which will be evident as yolk granules will begin to leak through any tear that is made. This takes practice and not all attempts will be successful.",
    "After transferring to the host6, position the graft to replace the extirpated basal forebrain of the host.\nPlace tape tightly over the hole and return the embryo to the 37 째C incubator for the appropriate length of time for analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
