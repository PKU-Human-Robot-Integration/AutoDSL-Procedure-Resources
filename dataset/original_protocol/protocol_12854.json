    "1. Generation of Stable Cell Lines by the Tol2 System\nTransfect plasmid vectors (Figure 1A) of Tol2-based optogenetic modules together with the transposase (Tol2) expression vector (pCAGGS-mT2TP) into C2C12 cells. In all steps, culture cells with DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C (Table 1), in the presence of 5% CO2, otherwise denoted.\nCount trypsinized cells with a cell-counter, and plate 5 x 104 C2C12 cells per well in a 12-well plate one day before transfection.\nCo-transfect 0.375 μg of Tol2-based optogenetic vectors (pAI177 or pAI218), 0.125 μg of a drug selection vector (pAI170) and 0.5 μg of pCAGGS-mT2TP vector by using lipofection reagent.\nTrypsinize transfected cells, and plate them into 100 mm culture dishes one day after transfection.\nExchange culture medium for transfected cells to culture medium supplemented with 100 mg/mL hygromycin.\nCulture cells for 3 days to eliminate un-transfected cells. Note that medium change is not necessary.\nTrypsinize transfected cells, and purify a population of cells expressing fluorescent proteins for selection. For receiver cells carrying pAI177, set the sorting gate to Green-PE channel for purification of mCherry-positive cell population. For photo-sensitive sender cells carrying pAI218, set the sorting gate to APC channel for purification of iRFP713-positive cell population.\n(optional) Establish a clonal cell population by standard methods, such as limited dilution or single-cell sorting by FACS.\n2. Evaluation of Photo-sensitivity of Engineered Cells at the Population Level\nNOTE: This part describes a protocol to check dynamic induction of Dll1 ligand proteins upon blue-light illumination by biochemical assays, such as qPCR and Western blotting.",
    "Set up two types of incubators with or without light sources for a light-induced condition or a dark condition, respectively. Set-up light-intensity of a blue-LED trans-illuminator, as shown in Figure 1B, by using a light meter. Program timings and duration of light illumination by loading a control-script to a single-board micro-controller that allows programmable schedules for illumination (Figure 1C).\nCount trypsinized cells with a cell-counter, and plate 1.0 x 105 photo-sensitive sender cells carrying pAI218 and pAI170 on 35-mm diameter plastic culture dishes (more than 12 dishes for light condition and 1 dish for dark condition) and set the dishes in separate incubators for dark/light conditions. After setting up dishes, keep doors of the incubators closed until collecting cell lysates.\nOne and a half days after plating, start light illumination (cells are expected to be more than 80% confluent). Don't expose cells to light to avoid undesirable photo-stimulation.\n\tNOTE: Schedules for illumination depends on the purpose of experiments. Note that a sustained illumination condition (e.g. 1-min duration and 10 min intervals with 40 µmol/m2/s light-intensity) is sufficient for a simple check of photo-induction, and that strong light illumination is harmful to cells. Thus, ensure that harmless parameters for illumination are selected.\nAbout 2 days after plating, prepare cell-lysate with 30-min intervals. Move sample dishes from incubators to on-ice, and start preparing cell lysates for further analysis.\n3. Dynamic Sender-receiver Assay at the Population Level: Real-time Monitoring of Cellular Responses upon Optical Stimulation by PMT\nTrypsinize and count the numbers of the sender and the receiver cells with standard methods. Prepare a 1-mL total volume of mixing suspension of 2.5 x 104 receiver and 1.25 x 105 sender cells (1:5 ratio).\n\tNOTE: 2:1, 1:1, or 1:2 sender-receiver ratios also work with a total cell number of 1.5 x 105.10",
    "Plate mixed cells in each well of 24-well black plates with culture medium containing 1 mM luciferin.\nAnalyze the cells on plate reader for luciferase assay, and confirm that the output signals are not too high for the recording system.\n\tNOTE: If output signals are higher than 1 x 106 photon counts/s, they may be saturated. In that case, reduce the concentration of luciferin to optimal values so that output signals are lower than 1 x 106 photon counts/s.\nSet the plate on the recording system, and start a recording program (Figure 1D). For example, start light illumination at 18 h after setting the recording.\n\tNOTE: Temporal filtering, such as detrending signals with moving averaging and Savitzky-Golay filtering, are useful for visualization of wave-forms and peak detections.\n4. Dynamic Sender-receiver Assay at the Single-cell Level: Real-time Imaging of Single-cell Responses under the Control of Optogenetic Perturbation\nPlate 0.5 x 105 receiver and 2.5 x 105 sender cells onto 27-mm-diameter-glass-base 35 mm diameter dishes. Ensure that mixing ratios and a total cell number (a cell density) are correctly adjusted.\nOne day after plating, exchange medium with 2 mL of the recording medium (phenol-red free DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin and 1 mM luciferin), and set the glass-base dish on the microscope. If necessary, wash out debris of dead cells with PBS (-).\n\tNOTE: It is preferable to do this step in a dark condition.\nSet up an inverted microscope equipped with an environmental chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nSet up a cooled CCD camera. Ensure that the temperature of CCD sensor is cooled down to the destination value (typically, -90 °C).",
    "Set parameters for \"Multi-Dimensional Timelapse\" window in automatic acquisition software to capture images with 5 min intervals and more than 288 times (more than one overnight recording).\nOpen \"Multi-Dimensional Timelapse\" window, select a luminescence channel and a slow 50 kHz read-out mode from the pull-down menu and set 4 x 4 binning with 4-min exposure. Ensure that the read-out mode is set to the slow 50 kHz mode, which is critical for reducing read-out noises to detect weakly emitting bioluminescent light.\nOpen \"Multi-Dimensional Timelapse\" window, select fluorescence channels and a fast 1 MHz read-out mode from the pull-down menu and set 2 x 2 binning with 400 ms exposure. Ensure that the read-out mode is set to the fast 1 MHz mode to reduce the time required for fluorescence imaging.\nStart time-lapse recording by clicking \"Acquire\" button.\nExtract single-cell traces of luminescence channels from time-lapse movies by image analysis software, as follows. First, make luminescence and fluorescence stack images by importing the image data to image analysis software. For luminescence images, remove hot pixels derived from cosmic rays by comparing the intensities of pixels in temporally adjacent images, replacing the pixel values to the temporal average of the previous and next frames (implemented as \"SpikeNoise Filter\"), apply these processed images to a spatially smoothing filter, and subtract background pixel values of out-field views from each frame. Then, determine a \"region of interest\" (ROI) for each cell on a fluorescent image at each time point, apply the ROI to luminescent images, and measure the luminescent intensity of each ROI.\nSubscription Required.
