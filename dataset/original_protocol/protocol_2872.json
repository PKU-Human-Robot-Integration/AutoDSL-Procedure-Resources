The deep cervical lymph nodes are important as they drain the brain. Remove the lymph nodes and store them on a plate on ice with dissection media.\nNote: Other lymph nodes, including inguinal and mesenteric lymph nodes, can also be collected.\nRemove the spleen and store it on a plate on ice with sterile dissection media.\nNote: Each well should have ∼2 mL of dissection media.\nIsolation of B-cells from lymphoid organs\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the isolation of B-cells from lymphoid organs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2581-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of B-cell isolation\n(A) Representative cartoon of starting lymphocyte/spleenocyte population.\n(B) Addition of B-cell isolation cocktail (step 11) leads to binding of biotinylated antibodies to all non-B-cells.\n(C) Addition of streptavidin magnetic RapidSpheres binds all biotinylated antibodies (step 12).\n(D) Magnetic isolation of RapidSpheres binds all non-B-cells to the walls of the magnet and leaves only B-cells in suspension (step 15).",
    "Place a 70 μm sterile cell strainer (Fisherbrand cat# 22362548) on top of a 50 mL conical tube and rinse with 1 mL of cRPMI.\nPlace the spleen on the cell strainer and crush it with a 1 mL syringe plunger. Add 1–2 mL of cRPMI to rinse the cells through the filter.\nNote: Use a new strainer for each spleen to prevent strainer clogging.\nNote: Multiple lymph nodes can be pooled into the same strainer (up to 10 lymph nodes).\nAdjust the volume to 10 mL for each tube with cRPMI and centrifuge (300 × g, 5 min, at 4°C). Discard supernatant.\nResuspend the disassociated splenocytes and lymphocytes at 100 M cells per 950 μL MACS Buffer per spleen. Filter the cells through a 70 μm sterile cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: Make sure to keep the MACS Buffer chilled.\nNote: The isolation protocol can be scaled accordingly if starting with significantly fewer cells.\nAdd 50 μL of rat serum (Included in the B-cell Isolation Kit) per 100 M cells.\nTransfer into a 5 mL round bottom polystyrene tube, up to 1 mL per tube. Discard the caps of the tubes.\nAdd 50 μL of B-cell isolation cocktail per mL of sample and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nVortex the RapidSpheres for 30 s, ensuring the solution is mixed well. After incubation with B-cell Isolation Cocktail, add 75 μL of RapidSpheres per mL of sample. Mix and incubate at room temperature for 2.5 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2581-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
