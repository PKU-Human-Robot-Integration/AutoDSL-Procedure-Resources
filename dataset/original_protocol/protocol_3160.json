    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPerforming Spotting Assays\nTiming: 3–5 days\nThis step describes how to perform spotting assays on agar plates, starting from liquid yeast cultures. Obtaining spotting assays with spots of approximately equal size and correct dilutions is critical for subsequent steps of this protocol.\nInoculate transformed yeast cells in 3 mL liquid media and grow overnight in a shaker-incubator at 30°C and 200 rpm.\nDilute cultures after growth for 12-16 hrs in a 1:10 ratio in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and measure their OD600 using a spectrophotometer to determine cell density.\nEqualize the number of cells in each culture by diluting them in sterile ddH2O to OD600=1.0, or medium, or an appropriate buffer and to a total volume of 200 μL in row A of a 96-well plate. Fill the wells in the rows B-F with 120 μL of ddH2O using a multichannel pipette.\nPerform a 1:5 serial dilution by pipetting 30 μL of culture from each row above to the row immediately below.\nImmediately transfer equal volumes of diluted culture from each well using a 48-prong spotter onto dry agar plates, containing selective media. Sterilize the spotter with a submersion in 70% ethanol and brief flaming after each transfer. Ensure that the spotter has sufficiently cooled down after flaming.\nCritical: After picking up the liquid from the 96-well plate, check the tips of the prongs to ensure that each prong contains a droplet of liquid and these droplets are of equal size.\nCritical: Taking the spotter out of the liquid with a relatively high speed, while keeping the hand motion vertical, helps to ensure the uniformity of the droplet size on each prong.",
    "After all spotted liquid has been absorbed, incubate the plates for 2–5 days at the required temperature (typically 30°C), depending on the desired experimental conditions. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problems 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nImage Acquisition\nTiming: 2–3 min/plate\nAcquiring high-quality images of spotting assays, with uniform background brightness and no glare, significantly simplifies the next step of background subtraction. Images of plates containing different biological replicates or experimental groups should be taken at the same time.\nTurn the agar plates lid up and take the lid off. Taking the lid off helps to prevent glare, however, if contamination of the colonies on the plate is an issue, the lid can be left on as long as lighting is even.\nPlace the plate under the camera or on the tray of the gel imager.\nFor the best possible resolution of an image, zoom in on the plate such that most of the image frame is taken up by the spotting assay.\nIf using a camera, do not use the flash to reduce glare.\nTo avoid excessive glare from the agar, ensure uniform lighting of the plate. If taking an image with a digital camera, this can be achieved by taking images away from natural light and using a shield (e.g., cardboard) to prevent light from directly falling on the surface of the agar.\nPause Point: Save the spotting assay images for further analysis\nImage Preparation\nTiming: 5 min/plate\nImage preparation is an important step in the process of spotting assay quantification as it allows to ensure the uniformity of background on a single plate and eliminate the excessive glare that might affect the consistency of the mean gray value measurements across multiple spots.\nImport the image into ImageJ by first opening ImageJ and then clicking on “File” then ”New” then ”Image.”",
    "When the window with the image opens, click on the “image” then “type” and select “8-bit” option.\nClick on the straight-line tool and extend the line over the diameter of the largest spot in the spotting assay. Ensure that the units of length are set to pixels. Click “analyze” then ”measure.” The “length” measurement in the table will be equal to the diameter of the spot. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nClick on “process” then “subtract background.” In the newly opened window, set the rolling ball diameter to the diameter measured in step 14 + 20 pixels, select “sliding paraboloid” option and click “OK.” The image with the adjusted background will appear in a new window (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/293-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. ImageJ Tools for Equalizing Background on the Images of Spotting Assays\n(A) Settings for the image subtraction Rolling Ball algorithm.\n(B) “Brightness and Contrast” adjustment tool that allows the individual spots on the image to be made more visible after the background has been subtracted.\nCritical: The rolling ball diameter cannot be smaller than the diameter of the largest spot on the spotting assay. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]\nUsing the “Image” then ”adjust” then “brightness/contrast” function adjust the image parameters such that the individual spots are easier to see (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTo check for the uniformity of the background use the circular selection tool and adjust its size to the size of the smallest spot on the spotting assay. Using this selection, perform several measurements of the background mean gray value on different places on the plate by clicking “analyze” then ”measure.” Ensure that the background readings from different places on the plate are no more than 3 mean gray value units apart (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/293-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The Results of Background Subtraction Using the In-Built Rolling Ball Algorithm in ImageJ",
    "(A) The unprocessed image that was used as the input file for background subtraction.\n(B) Resulting image after background was subtracted using the Rolling Ball algorithm with settings indicated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Background subtraction was iterated four times, and the brightness and contrast were adjusted to make the individual spots more visible. On both images, the colored circles represent the places for measurements that are presented in the tables in (C) and (D).\n(C) Gray value measurements for the input image. Background gray value measurements on the starting image are highly variable and in the case of selection B, this measurement is even higher than the value of the spot F. Selections 1 and 2 were used to estimate the background values for the spots E and F, respectively.\n(D) Gray value measurements from the processed image. The background values are now grouped much closer to each other. The proximity between the F-2/F-1 ratios and F-background/E-background ratios indicates that image processing did not affect the relative gray values of the spots.\nIf the background readings fall far apart, run the Rolling Ball background subtraction algorithm again. Several iterations of background adjustment, until the background readings from different places on the plate are no more than 3 gray value units apart, can help ensuring its uniformity. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]\nWithout closing the obtained image in ImageJ and exiting the program, proceed directly to the growth quantification step.\nCritical: Perform your quantification directly on the processed image. If the image is saved and then re-opened, the adjustments to the brightness/contrast might affect the results and increase variability between replicates.\nGrowth Quantification\nTiming: 5 min/plate",
    "Yeast growth is quantified by measuring the gray value of the spots across different samples and for the same dilution on the processed spotting assay image. For this quantification, it is crucial to select an appropriate dilution (discussed further below), maintain the same area of the circular selection for all measurements on the same plate, and to use images with the properly adjusted background.\nOn the processed image of a spotting assay, choose a dilution that is appropriate for quantification. This dilution should fit the following requirements:\nTo be the lowest dilution (i.e., the least diluted culture) that is representative of the differences in growth between all samples (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/293-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Choosing an Appropriate Dilution and Measuring Background Gray Value for Spotting Assay Quantification\n(A) In this case, the third dilution (boxed) is chosen because it is the lowest most informative dilution. The second dilution was not chosen because the difference in growth between gene 2 and gene 3 samples is clearer in the third dilution. The fourth dilution was not chosen because the third dilution is sufficiently informative.\n(B) Five spots on the plate that should be used to measure the gray value of the background. Those spots were chosen in different regions of the plate, because they give the optimal background value.\nDisplay enough growth to enable quantification.\nNote: From the spotting assays that we have quantified using this protocol, the third dilution (25×) is usually appropriate, however, this might change depending on the experiment. If a growth phenotype is too toxic, the first or second dilutions might show more appropriate differences in growth between samples, and they should be used for quantification. If the difference is not seen in the third dilution, the fourth dilution can be used for quantification.",
    "Click on the circular selection tool and extend the selection around the smallest spot in the dilution such that the entire spot but not the background is within its bounds.\nCritical: It is important to use the same selection tool to perform all gray value measurements on the same plate, as the area of the selection can affect the gray value readings. If throughout the measurements the area of the selection was changed, it can be restored by clicking “edit” then ”selection” then “restore selection.” If the selection is not restored, the measurements, including the ones for the background, should be repeated.\nBy dragging the same circular selection over five different places on the plate and clicking “analyze” then ”measure,” measure the gray value of the spotting assay image background. It is best if the background measurements are performed on different places on the plate, such as in each corner of the plate an in the middle of it (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Calculate the mean of the five background measurements.\nBefore proceeding further, check that the background measurements are within three units of each other, otherwise repeat the background subtraction algorithm again.\nUsing the same selection as in the previous steps, measure the gray value of each spot in the chosen dilution and record those values in an Excel spreadsheet. If possible, measure the gray values of different biological replicates on different technical replicates (i.e., different plates) of a spotting assay. This will help to decrease the chance that the difference in growth between samples is due to technical variability.",
    "Subtract the gray value of the background from the gray values of the spots measured on the same plate. Repeat this step for all the plate images. The obtained values will represent the growth of each biological replicate, including the control. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problems 8 and 9\nRepeat steps 12–25 for all other spotting assay images (i.e., biological replicates).\nData Analysis\nTiming: 10 min\nThis data analysis step relies on normalizing the growth data to a control, which should be present on each plate. This normalization or comparison between experimental groups spotted on different plates cannot be performed if the growth of the controls on these plates is considerably different from each other (See Limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]).\nUsing the gray values obtained in step 24, calculate the mean gray value for the control group.\nDivide each of the gray values obtained in step 24 by the gray value of the corresponding control on the same plate.\nCritical: Within the control group, divide each of the individual control gray values by the mean value of all controls, calculated in step 26. This step allows conversion of the raw control growth values to relative growth values.\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation for three or more relative values calculated in step 27 Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Problem 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.19]\nPlot the obtained mean relative growth values +/- standard deviation on bar graph using Excel, GraphPad Prism, or any other data analysis software.\nIf the measurements were performed for at least three biological replicates that are distributed normally, and several means are compared at once, perform a one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s test. Statistical analysis can be performed using any available software, however, for a brief protocol of how to perform this analysis using RStudio, please refer to step 30",
    "Optional: Statistical analysis of spotting assay data in R.Studio.\nOpen a new Excel spreadsheet and in the first column type in the categories (sample names) of the samples to be compared, with one per each replicate. Category names should be the same for the replicates of the same experimental group, otherwise the program will assume they are different experiments.\nInto the next column, input the relative growth values obtained in step 3.5.2.\nSave the spreadsheet in the CSV format.\nOpen R.Studio. Under the “environment” tab on the right click “import dataset” then “from text (base)” and select the .CSV spreadsheet containing your data.\nThe table with your data will appear in a new window. Leave the settings in the right-hand side of the window as they appear and click on “import.” Your data will now appear in the window in the top left corner.\nIn the console window (bottom left) type the command attach (file name) and press enter. After that all commands that you type in the console will refer to your data.\nIn the console type the code:\nmyaov<-aov(V2~V1)\nsummary(myaov)\nTukeyHSD(myaov, conf.level = 0.95)\nInterpret the output of the statistical test."
