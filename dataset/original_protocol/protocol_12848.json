    "For the purposes of ONDRI, ethics protocols and informed consent were obtained based on the Research Ethic Boards at Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care (Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Elizabeth Bruyère Hospital (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada); Hamilton General Hospital (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada); London Health Sciences Centre (London, Ontario, Canada); McMaster (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada); The Ottawa Hospital (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada); Parkwood Hospital (London, Ontario, Canada); St Michael's Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Toronto, Ontario, Canada); and University Health Network-Toronto Western Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).\n1. DNA Isolation from Human Blood Samples\nCollect samples from sequencing participants in accordance with appropriate ethics protocols and informed consent.\nTo obtain DNA of high quality, draw blood samples for the purposes of extraction.\n\t\tNOTE: DNA can also be extracted from saliva or buccal cells, ensuring that an appropriate DNA extraction kit is used.\nIf extracting from blood, to obtain a high yield of DNA, collect the sample in three 4 mL EDTA K2 tubes, providing a sample of total volume ~12 ml.\nCentrifuge blood samples for 20 min at 750 x g to fraction into an upper phase of plasma, thin, middle phase of leukocytes, and a bottom phase of erythrocytes.\nRemove the plasma from the blood sample by pipetting it off the top of the sample with a disposable transfer pipette. Appropriately discard the plasma or dispense into multiple 500 µL aliquots for storage at -80 °C for future biochemical analyses. Ensure that a new, sterile pipette is used for each sample.\nExtract DNA from the blood sample with a blood extraction kit12 (Table of Materials) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: If a sample of the volume described above is obtained, ~3 mL of leukocytes will be obtained to use in the DNA extraction.",
    "Measure initial DNA concentration in ng/µL using a full-spectrum spectrophotometer13 (Table of Materials), according to manufacturer's instructions.\nProceed directly to step 2. Alternatively, store DNA at 4 °C.\n2. Sequencing Library Preparation\nPerform serial dilutions on the DNA samples over the course of three days to obtain a final concentration of 5.0 ± 1.0 ng/µL.\nDilute 1 M Tris buffer pH 8.5 to 10 µM with deionized water.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume diluted will depend on the number of DNA samples that will need to be diluted in the subsequent steps.\nIf performing the DNA dilution directly after step 1.4, proceed to the following step. If not on the same day, measure the DNA concentration as was done in step 1.4.\nBased on the concentration measured, dilute 40 µL of the DNA to ~10 ng/µL using 10 µM Tris buffer pH 8.5 and allow the sample to sit overnight at 4 °C.\nMeasure DNA concentration with a fluorometer14 appropriate for the quantification of DNA (Table of Materials), according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of the sample should be >10 ng/µL because of the lower sensitivity of the spectrophotometer used previously.\nBased on the concentration measured, dilute 20 µL of the DNA to 10 ng/µL using 10 µM Tris buffer pH 8.5 and allow the sample to sit overnight at 4 °C.\nMeasure DNA concentration with the fluorometer14, according to manufacturer's instructions.\nBased on the concentration measured, dilute 10 µL of the DNA to 5 ng/µL using 10 µM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 and allow the sample to sit overnight at 4 °C.\nPrepare sequencing library according to manufacturer's instructions with the targeted NGS panel's appropriate target enrichment kit15 (Table of Materials). Ensure that the enrichment kit is appropriate for the NGS platform being used.",
    "Follow manufacturer's instructions16 regarding the plexity and pooling of libraries.\n\t\tNOTE: For ONDRISeq, libraries are composed of 12 DNA samples, pooled in sets of two, and run on the NGS desktop instrument (Table of Materials). The number of samples that can be run in a single reaction will depend on the sequencing kit and platform used.\nTo achieve higher quality sequencing data, perform the optional step to validate the DNA library quality following tagmentation, described in manufacturer's instruction of the target enrichment kit15.\n\t\t\nAnalyze each library in triplicate to ensure the quality of the library yield.\nIf pooling libraries, measure DNA concentration with the fluorometer14, according to manufacturer's instructions. Use this concentration to determine the volume of each DNA library to pool to obtain the equimolar ratios recommended by the target enrichment kit being used.\n3. Next-generation Sequencing\nSequence the library according to the NGS desktop instrument's reagent kit manufacturer's instructions17,18 (Table of Materials).\nPrepare a sample sheet according to manufacturer's instructions18 using the appropriate NGS technology software (Table of Materials), which will be imported into the NGS desktop instrument's workflow.\n\t\tNOTE: For the purposes of ONDRISeq, the application option chosen is 'other', with only the FASTQ files requested (Figure 1). Subsequent steps will process these FASTQ files, to allow for full customization of alignment and quality parameters. However, if targeted sequencing is chosen, some NGS instruments are able to process the sequencing data into VCF files themselves. The manufacturer's instructions18 may be consulted for a full selection of options.\nIf using a cloud-based computing environment19 (Table of Materials), log in when setting up the sequencing run. Do this after clicking \"Sequencing\" on the NGS desktop instrument home page.\nFollowing library denaturation18 according to the manufacturer's instructions, measure DNA library concentration with the fluorometer14.",
    "Validate the DNA library quality using an appropriate automated electrophoresis system and DNA quality analysis kit20 (Table of Materials), as per manufacturer's instructions.\nTo convert the DNA concentration from ng/µL to nM, use the following formula16\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57266/57266eq1.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Average library size will be specific to target enrichment kit being used, and can be obtained from the electrophoresis trace observed in step 3.1.4.\nDilute the sequencing library to a final concentration of 6–20 pM, as appropriate, and volume of 600 μL, according to manufacturer's instructions21.\n\t\tNOTE: The exact concentration needed is dependent on the sequencing kit used. Consult the enrichment kit manufacturer to determine the proper loading concentration.\nDilute, denature, and include a positive control sequencing library21, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nKeep a log of every sequencing run, which includes the DNA library concentration loaded (pM), the percentage of positive control added, reagent cartridge barcode, application chosen in step 3.1.1, number of index reads, enrichment kit used, read length(s), and the sample sheet name.\n\t\tNOTE: The run time of the NGS desktop instrument will depend on the instrument, enrichment kit, and read lengths chosen (4–56 h for the sequencer used in this experiment22).\nUpon completion of the sequencing run, access the \"Run Folder\", which includes all outputs, by navigating to the NGS desktop instrument home page and clicking \"Manage Files\". Move the files to a local drive for later access. For a separate option, on a computer, find the files within the cloud-based computing environment19 by selecting \"Runs\" on the navigation panel. Select the appropriate sequencing run to navigate to the Run Summary page. Select \"Download\" to obtain data from the cloud. From the dialog box that appears, select the FASTQ files as the file type to download and click \"Download\".",
    "From the Run Summary page of the cloud-based computing environment19,23, navigate to \"Charts\" to analyze the quality of the sequencing run with the various figures produced by the computing environment. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions23 for details regarding each figure produced.\nFrom the Run Charts page, find the figure labeled \"Data by Cycle\". Under chart, select \"Intensity\" and under channel select \"All Channels\". Ensure that this signal intensity plot produced is similar to that produced by sequencing runs performed in the past with the same enrichment kit and NGS desktop instrument.\n\t\tNOTE: This reflects the percentage of intensity shown by each base across all 150 cycles. The figure can vary widely depending on the enrichment kit used, which is why it must be compared to past sequencing runs of the same panel.\nSelect the \"Indexing QC\" tab within the run navigation panel to find the indexing quality control (QC) histogram, which is on the right-hand side of the page. Ensure that a relatively uniform distribution of % Reads Identified (PF) is observed across all samples.\n\t\tNOTE: If any samples have a much lower % Reads Identified (PF) than the rest of the samples, note that the quality of the sequencing data may be affected.\nFrom the Run Summary page of the cloud-based computing environment, navigate to the quality metrics by clicking \"Metrics\" within the run navigation panel.\n\tNOTE: Metrics cut-offs will depend on the sequencing platform and enrichment kit being used. There are many metrics that can be utilized based on manufacturer's instructions23, with the following steps highlighting three that are highly recommended for quality control.\n\t\nUnder \"DENSITY (K/MM2)\" ensure the cluster density is within the range recommended by the enrichment kit being used (in this case 1,200–1,400 K/mm2).",
    "Under the total \"%≥Q30\" ensure that the value is ≥85%, reflecting the quality of the sequencing reads.\n\t\tNOTE: If lower than this threshold of 85%, note that the quality of the sequencing may be compromised.\nUnder \"ALIGNED (%)\" ensure that the value is similar to the % of positive control that was included in the sequencing run.\n\t\tNOTE: This acts as a measure of positive control, such that only this percentage of total reads were found to align to the positive control genome. If 1% positive control was used it would be expected that the Aligned (%) would be ~1–5%.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57266/57266fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Screenshot of the NGS technology software's (Table of Materials) sample sheet creator application options. For the purposes of ONDRISeq, the FASTQ only application is used. However, if the user would like other files produced, such as VCF files, it is recommended that an application within the targeted resequencing category is used.

Resequencing and Variant Calling\nFor data pre-processing, select appropriate software to align the raw FASTQ files to the human reference genome and to call variants (Table of Materials).\nImport FASTQ sequencing reads into the data pre-processing software.\n\tNOTE: For the purposes of ONDRISeq, the 48 FASTQ files produced from a single sequencing run of 24 samples are imported and processed through the software. The number of samples processed at once can vary depending on the needs of the researcher and size of the NGS panel.\n\t\nWithin the \"Navigation Area\", right click and select \"New Folder\". Name the folder such that there is clarity as to the sequencing run that was performed.",
    "From the toolbar at the top, select \"Import\". From the dropdown list of sequencing platforms shown chose the platform with which the sequencing was performed.\n\t\tNOTE: For the purposes of ONDRISeq, \"Illumina\" is chosen. However, if using a different sequencing platform consult the manufacturer's instructions for the remainder of the FASTQ importing steps24.\nIn the dialog box, navigate to and select the FASTQ files from the sequencing run that is being processed. Ensure that the files being imported are stored in and imported from the local drive, if using a computer with multiple servers.\nFrom the \"General options\" of the dialog box, click the box beside \"Paired reads\" if sequencing used paired end chemistries.\n\t\tNOTE: In this case, there should also be two FASTQ samples imported for each sample - one forward and one reverse.\nFrom the Paired read information of the dialog box, select \"Paired-end (forward-reverse)\" if the forward read FASTQ file appears before the reverse read in the file list. If the files appear in the opposite order, select \"Mate-pair (reverse-forward)\". Set the paired read minimum distance to 1 and maximum distance to 1000, to allow for the detection of small scale structural rearrangements within the sample sequences.\nFrom the \"Illumina options\" of the dialog box, select \"Remove failed reads\", to remove the reads that failed sequencing. If the NGS desktop instrument de-multiplexed the data before exporting the FASTQ files do not select the \"MiSeq de-multiplexing\" box.\nFrom the \"Quality score\" dropdown list, select the NGS Pipeline that was utilized for sequencing. Select \"Next\" at the bottom of the dialog box.\n\t\tNOTE: The pipeline used will affect the format of the FASTQ file quality scores. For more information about which pipeline to select, consult the manufacturer's instructions24.",
    "From the new dialog box, select “Save” and “Create subfolders per bath unit to put each sample's FASTQ files into their own individual folder. Select \"Next\" at the bottom of the dialog box.\nFrom the new dialog box, choose the folder that was created in step 4.2.1. This is where the FASTQ files will be imported. Select \"Finish\" at the bottom of the dialog box and wait until the FASTQ files are imported. Click the \"Processes\" tab to see the status of the file import.\nDesign a workflow within the software to perform resequencing and variant calling, according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: This workflow can vary based on the needs of the researcher, but the following steps encompass what is included for the purposes of ONDRISeq (Figure 2). The steps in this workflow can be applied to other NGS resequencing and variant calling software as appropriate. All bioinformatics processing for the purposes of ONDRI is performed in reference to human reference genome GRCH37/hg19, for consistency of data processing and analysis.\n\t\nMap the sequencing reads to the reference genome.\n\t\t\nWhen configuring, choose the reference genome as appropriate, ensuring that it is the same reference genome that is used for all bioinformatics steps.\nFrom the masking mode drop-down list select \"No masking\" so that no regions of the reference sequence are masked.\nUse the default mapping options assigned by the software. Review the manufacturer's instructions24 to verify that this is acceptable based on the purposes of the research.\nInclude in the workflow local realignment to the human reference genome to resolve any read mapping errors, particularly surrounding insertion-deletion variants.\n\t\t\nUse the default local realignment options assigned by the software. Review the manufacturer's instructions24 to verify that this is acceptable based on the purposes of the research.",
    "Remove duplicated mapped reads produced by PCR within the NGS protocol to reduce the effect of the PCR amplification bias, which may produce false positives25.\n\t\t\nSet the \"Maximum representation of minority sequence (%)\", based on the needs of the research.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A lenient setting, as used for the purposes of ONDRISeq, is 5%; however, the software's default setting is more stringent 20%. When two reads are very similar, this setting determines if the sequence with fewer read counts should be considered a sequencing error from the PCR amplification bias. Therefore, by setting 5%, the minority read count must be ≤ 5% of the majority read count to be corrected to be identical to the majority read.\nExport statistics for the target regions in the form of a coverage summary text file from the read tracks generated in step 4.3.3. Ignore non-specific matches and broken pairs in the settings. Choose a destination on the local drive for these files.\nExport a binary sequence alignment map (BAM) file for each sample from the read tracks generated in step 4.3.3. This contains sequence alignment data, if needed in future analyses. Choose a destination on the local drive for these files.\nChoose a method of variant detection to call variants within the sequence.\n\t\tNOTE: When assumptions can be made about the ploidy of the samples, it is recommended that a fixed ploidy variant detection algorithm be used, as is used for the purposes of ONDRISeq. If this assumption cannot be made, refer to the manufacturer's instructions24 to determine the best algorithm for the purposes of the research.",
    "When configuring, from the fixed ploidy variant parameters options set the ploidy as appropriate for the sample organism. Set the \"required variant probability\", or the probability that a variant has been correctly called in order for it to be retained, at 90.0%.\nUse the following recommended settings for the general filters: \"Minimum coverage\" of 10x, \"Minimum count\" of 2, \"Minimum read frequency\" of 20%, \"Ignore broken pairs\", ignore nonspecific matches based on \"Reads\", and \"Minimum read length\" of 20.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These parameters are based on the purposes of ONDRISeq. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions24 to ensure they are appropriate for the research being done.\nUse the following recommended settings for the noise filters: \"Base quality filters\" with a \"Neighbourhood radius\" mapping quality score of 5, \"Minimum central quality\" mapping score of 20, and \"Minimum neighbourhood quality\" mapping score of 15; a \"Read direction filter\" of 5.0%; and \"Relative read direction filter\" of 1.0% significance.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These parameters are based on the purposes of ONDRISeq. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions24 to ensure they are appropriate for the research being done.\nFilter the variants that have been called based on their overlap with the targeted panel's target regions as specified by the Browser Extensible Data (BED) file, allowing only variants occurring within the genomic regions selected for the targeted NGS panel to be retained.\n\t\tNOTE: The BED file will be unique to the targeted NGS panel that is being utilized, based on the regions of the genome that the panel is able to cover.\nExport a variant report in a variant calling format (VCF) file from the variant track produced in step 4.3.7. Choose a destination on the local drive for these files.",
    "Save and install the workflow according to manufacturer's instructions24, to make it available in the software's \"Toolbox\". Ensure the workflow is named such that it is clear in the future what NGS panel it is appropriate for.\n\t\t\nIn the dialog box with the \"Exporting reference data\" options during installation, set all options to \"Bundle\".\nIn the dialog box with the \"Install location\" options during installation, click \"Install the workflow on your local computer\".\nRun imported FASTQ sequencing read files through the customized bioinformatics workflow designed in step 4.3, according to manufacturer's instructions24.\nIdentify the workflow designed in step 4.3 in the software's \"Toolbox\" and double-click it.\nWithin the dialog box that appears, locate the folders of FASTQ files that were imported in step 4.2 within the \"Navigation Area\". Highlight all folders by selecting them within the \"Navigation Area\" and then click the box beside \"Batch\". Use the right-facing arrow to move the files to \"Selected elements\". Click \"Next\" at the bottom of the dialog box.\nWithin the dialog box, review the \"Batch overview\" to ensure the correct FASTQ files were selected and then click \"Next\".\nReview the following steps of the workflow within the dialog box to ensure the correct files and export locations were selected when designing the workflow in step 4.3: \"Map Reads to Reference\"; Remove Duplicate Mapped Reads\"; \"Create Statistics for Target Regions\"; \"Export BAM\"; \"Export Tab delimited text\"; \"Filter Based on Overlap\"; and \"Export VCF\"\nWithin the final step in the dialog box -\"Result handling\"- select the option \"Save in input folder\". Click \"Finish\" at the bottom of the dialog box.\n\t\tNOTE: This means that the files produced for each sample will be placed into the same folder that stores the FASTQ file within the data pre-processing software.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57266/57266fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Workflow for the resequencing and variant calling of FASTQ files within the data pre-processing software (Table of Materials) customized for the purposes of ONDRISeq.

Variant Annotation\nDownload and customize the Annotate Variation (ANNOVAR)26 script to perform variant annotation upon the VCF file of each sample.\nDownload the following databases from ANNOVAR to be included as annotations: 1) RefSeq27 (August 2015 update); 2) dbSNP13828 (September 2014 update); 3) the Exome Aggregation Consortium29 (ExAC, version 0.3 November 2015 update); 4) the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project European Cohort30 (ESP, March 2015 update); 5) the 1000 Genomes Project European Cohort31 (1KGP, August 2015 update); 6) ClinVar32 (March 2016 update); and 7) Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion33 (CADD), Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant34 (SIFT), and PolyPhen-235.\n\t\tNOTE: Genome coordinates and all databases referenced by ANNOVAR referred to human genome build GRCh37/hg19. Additionally, the database versions listed are those used for the purposes of ONDRISeq, when downloading the databases use the most up to date versions available.\nIf desired, customize ANNOVAR to output the complete list of annotated variants, as well as a reduced compilation of annotated variants using the --filter operation26.\n\t\tNOTE: The reduced list can be customized based on the needs of the researcher. For the purposes of ONDRISeq, the reduced list of annotated variants does not include variants that occur further than 15 bases from the nearest exon or any variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >3% in any of the three databases: 1) ExAC; 2) ESP; and 3) 1KGP. This step is highly recommended.",
    "If desired, customize ANNOVAR to single out specific allele calls based on the needs of the researcher26.\n\t\tNOTE: For the purposes of ONDRISeq, ANNOVAR assesses the sequencing calls made for the APOE risk alleles rs429358(C>T):p.C130R and rs7412(C>T):p.R176C in order to output the overall APOE genotype, of which there are six possible combinations, including: 1) E2/E2; 2) E3/E2; 3) E4/E2; 4) E3/E3; 5) E4/E3; 6) E4/E4. Of these six possible APOE genotypes, E4/E4 is the most commonly accepted genetic risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease36.\nQuery disease mutation databases (Table of Materials) to determine if variants have been previously associated with disease, with reasonable evidence. Consider any variants that have not been previously reported as a novel variant.\nAssess the ANNOVAR annotations from ClinVar, such that the disease-associated variants include any classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic.\nProcess splicing variants through the in silico prediction tools Splicing-based Analysis of Variants37 (SPANR) and Human Splicing Finder38 (HSF, version 3.0).\nIf processing a large number of samples, compare the variant calls within each sample to determine which variants are shared by various samples. Do this manually or with a custom-designed script, allowing for the detection of possible sequencing artifacts and contamination events.\n\tNOTE: For the purposes of ONDRI, a custom script is used to annotate the ANNOVAR output files by comparing them to one another. The script incorporates an annotation, per variant, with the subject ID of any other samples harboring the same variant, otherwise termed the variant's history in the study cohort.\nClassify variants based on the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) Pathogenicity Guidelines39, assigning each variant a classification as one of the following: 1) pathogenic; 2) likely pathogenic; 3) variant of uncertain significance; 4) likely benign; or 5) benign.",
    "NOTE: For the purposes of ONDRI, an in-house designed Python script is used to perform ACMG classification on a semi-automated basis. Although not used for this study, InterVar40 is a similarly designed tool that can be utilized in an analogous manner.\nSanger sequence any variants with a sequencing coverage of <30x and/or variants that have been identified in > 10% of the study cohort to validate that they are not sequencing artifacts41."
