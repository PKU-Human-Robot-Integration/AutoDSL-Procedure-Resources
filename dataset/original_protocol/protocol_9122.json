    "1. Assembly of the Microfluidic Culture Chamber (MCP)\nMCP (Figure 1) are open chambers designed for compartmented cultures of different types of cells 4. It typically has two compartments that are connected through the central channels (3 μm in diameter). Assembly of MCP with glass-bottomed dishes is necessary for preparing cultures and subsequent imaging analysis.\nFirst, coat sterile glass-bottomed dishes with Polyornithine (Sigma-Aldrich, 1 mg/ml) dissolved in sodium tetraborate (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mM pH 8.5) and were incubated overnight at 37 °C.\nOn the following day, the coated glass-bottomed dishes were washed three times with ddH2O and dried under the sterile fume hood. The glass-bottomed dishes were then further coated with laminin (Sigma-Aldrich, 1 mg/ml) and dried under UV light for 1 hour. Coated dishes are ready to use or can be stored at -20 °C until use. These coating are necessary for plating neurons and astrocytes in the co-culture.\nTo assemble the culture platform, microfluidic culture platforms were placed on top of the coated glass-bottomed dishes with central connecting channels on its bottom side to form a tight seal. Regular neuron or astrocyte culture mediums were added (from the cell plating areas) on both sides (Figure 1) into the assembled MCP and incubated for 2-4 hours at 37 °C, to ensure there is no leakage between MCP and the glass-bottomed dish. We have tested with medium before plating cells to ensure there is no leak. The assembly of MCP on the glass-bottomed dish should be freshly prepared before use.\n2. Preparation of Neuronal Culture and Induction of Neuronal Axons in Assembled MCP",
    "Cortical neuronal cell cultures were freshly prepared from embryonic 14-16 day-old mouse brains. The neuron culture medium is composed of neurobasal medium, 2% B27 neurobasal supplement, 2 mM glutamine by adding 1% of 100x GlutaMAX, and 1% Penicillin-streptomysin. Following dissection of the mouse brain, the meninges was removed from the cortex under the dissecting microscope. The tissue was then minced with a razor blade to make small tissue blocks in order to increase the surface area exposed to trypsin. Tissue blocks were trypsinized (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.05% Trypsin) for 10 min in a 37 °C water bath, and then dissociated gently by trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Dissociated cells were filtered through a 70 μm strainer to collect clear neuronal cell suspension.\nNeurons (2-3 x 106/ml, 150 μl) were plated on the cell plating areas on right side (Figure 1) of the assembled MCP so that neurons can attach in the cell retention area (Figure 1). Freshly prepared neurons were plated with neuron plating medium which is supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) into the regular neuron culture medium. Because only the neurons that attach in the cell retention area are able to grow axons into the other side of the assembled MCP through central channels, it is important to plate high density of neurons in the cell plating area to ensure enough neurons are attached to the cell retention area. A representative image of high density of neuronal axons is shown in Figure 2A.",
    "On the following day, the neuron plating medium was replaced by the regular neuron culture medium. Changing medium was accomplished by carefully aspirating the medium from the cell plating area of the chamber, but not from the cell retention area of the assembled MCP, in order to avoid air bubbles in the cell retention area and the central connecting channels. Air bubbles will severely inhibit the axon outgrowth and subsequent entry into the central channels in the MCP. Glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 10-20 ng/ml) was also added on the other (left) side of the chamber on the same day to facilitate the induction of axon outgrowth5 from the neuronal side and cross through central channels of the assembled MCP (Figure 2A). Fair amount of spontaneous neurite outgrowth without GDNF is also observed from the neuronal side and cross through central channels of the assembled MCP. Axons that enter into the central channel are often observed 2-3 days after plating. Once the axons enter into the central channel, they usually enter the other side within one day. Axons are normally intact for at least one week after entering the other side.\n3. Addition of Cultured Astrocytes to MCP to Establish a Compartmentalized Co-culture System\nPrimary astrocyte cultures were prepared from the P1-3 mouse pup brain. The brain dissociation procedure is similar to the neuronal cell isolation procedure described above. Astrocytes were first plated into 10 cm dish that were pre-coated with Polyornithine (Sigma-Aldrich, 1 mg/ml). The astrocyte culture medium (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin-streptomysin) was changed every day for the next two days to remove the debris. After that, the medium was changed every three days.",
    "Astrocytes become 90% confluent and form a monolayer after 7 days. Confluent astrocytes were trypsinized and 150 μl of re-suspended astrocytes (1x106 /ml) were re-plated into the cell plating area of the left side of the assembled MCP when axons are about to enter or have just entered into the left side of the assembled MCP. Astrocytes were usually plated 4-5 days after the neurons were plated. GDNF was first removed before the re-plating of the astrocytes into the left side of the MCP. Re-plated astrocytes were attached in the cell retention area, as shown by the GFAP immunostaining (Figure 1). Only minimal flow of medium between both sides of the chambers (determined by fluorescence dyes) was found in the MCP, as previously shown4,6 .\nAstrocytes become 90% confluent and form a monolayer after 7 days.

    "After the re-plating of the astrocytes, axons that entered the left side of the assembled MCP directly interact with the astrocytes by either direct axonal contact or release of soluble factors. Immunostaining of astroglial plasma membrane glutamate transporter GLT1 and neuronal βIII-tubulin was performed to visualize the interaction between the axons and the astrocytes, as shown in Figure 2D-F.\nSubscription Required.
