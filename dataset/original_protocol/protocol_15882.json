This will load the page shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0004].\nThe Reactome Pathway Browser consists of four key elements:\n1.The header bar, at the top of the page. This has the Reactome logo, which returns users to the home page when clicked. Next to this is a species selector, with a drop-down list of species. Selecting an organism from the species selector will refresh the pathway browser with the inferred pathway diagram from the selected model organism if it is conserved. Reactome data is human-centric. Data for other species is inferred from human pathways and pathway steps may be missing for other organisms if they are not identified by the inference process. The “Analysis” button provides access to the interactive tools associated with the pathway diagrams, described below in Basic Protocols \nBasic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-prot-0006], \nBasic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-prot-0007], \nBasic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-prot-0008], and \nBasic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-prot-0009]. Clicking the “Tour” button in the header opens a brief video tutorial on the key Reactome website functions, while selecting one of the layout buttons in the top right of the header bar allows users to personalize the Web site panels that are displayed to optimize viewing.",
    "2.The pathway hierarchy panel, occupying the vertical rectangle on the far left of the screen, provides a scrolling display of all Reactome pathways in a hierarchy. The plus (“+”) symbol indicates that there are subheadings underneath the pathway headings. Clicking on a plus (“+”) symbol will expand the topic to show its subsections. The subpathways and reactions within each pathway can be hidden by clicking on the minus (“–”) symbol to the left of the pathway name. Next to the plus/minus signs is a small pathway icon in blue or black, indicating the presence or absence of an “Enhanced High Level Diagram” (EHLD, see below) associated with that pathway. A red “N” or “U” next to a pathway name indicates that the pathway is new or has been updated since the last release, respectively. A red cross next to a pathway name indicates that the pathway contains disease annotations.",
    "3.The visualization panel, to the right of the hierarchy panel, displays an interactive pathway diagram that can be panned and zoomed in Google Map style. The visualization panel is synced with the pathway hierarchy on the left, such that selecting pathways or subpathways in the hierarchy will change what is displayed in the visualization panel. There are three primary views that can be displayed in this panel. The first view, “Pathway Overview”, displays the entire pathway hierarchy as interconnected nodes, with nodes representing pathways and edges representing relationships. If a user selects a pathway in the hierarchy or in the graphical display, the corresponding node is outlined in orange. The second view, “Enhanced High Level Diagram (EHLD)”, where available, displays a textbook style interactive illustration of a user-selected pathway (Sidiropoulos et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0022]). The third view, “Entity Level View” (ELV), displays the reaction-level molecular details of the user-selected pathway. The ELV pathway diagrams apply the conventions of the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) format (Le Novère et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0015]) to distinguish the molecules and reactions by shape and cellular location, providing a dynamic framework for pathway visualization and data analysis. Users can toggle between the Pathway Overview and the ELV views by clicking the second of three blue icons beside the search bar at the top left of the visualization panel. EHLDs, where available, appear as a thumbnail in the bottom left of the visualization panel, and can be accessed by clicking the pathway name in the pathway hierarchy at the left of the visualization panel. An alternate view of the entire pathway hierarchy can be accessed by clicking the third blue icon to the right of the search bar from the Pathway Overview view.",
    "This opens a separate window and displays the Reactome pathways as a Voronoi diagram, with sizes of pathway clusters proportional to the number of events the pathway contains (Jassal et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0013]). To move from the Voronoi diagram back to the Pathway Browser, click and hold on a pathway name within the Voronoi image.",
    "At the top left of the visualization panel is a search bar, featuring results grouping and filtering, hit highlighting and text auto-completion (Fabregat et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0007]). The visualization panel also contains an icon (top right, first blue icon) that allows export of the pathway visualization in several different formats, a “compass” icon that provides a pathway overview key (top right, second blue icon) and an expandable panel on the right side which provides information and allows users to customize color preferences.\nAt the bottom right of the visualization panel are navigation arrows and zoom features. Users can also zoom using the mouse wheel and can click and drag the diagram. The thumbnail image, in the lower left corner of the visualization panel, can be used to navigate quickly to a region of interest in the pathway diagram.",
    "4.The details panel is located below the visualization panel, and its contents change in sync with user selections in the visualization panel or the pathway hierarchy. The details panel has 6 tabs, each of which contains a general description of what will be displayed in that panel once an event or entity is selected. The “Description” tab displays molecular details related to the selected event or entity, including inputs and outputs of reactions, catalysts, regulators, preceding, and following events, linkouts to other databases with entity information, etc. This tab also displays event summations, literature references, and editorial information. The “Molecules” tab shows downloadable details of the molecules (proteins, small molecules/chemical compounds, nucleic acid sequences) involved in the selected event. The “Structures” tab shows reaction details from Rhea (Bansal et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0002]) or structural information from ChEBI (Hastings et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0011]) or PDBe (Armstrong et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0001]), as appropriate. The “Expression” tab displays gene expression information from Gene Expression Atlas for genes corresponding to the selected items. The “Analysis” tab displays the pathway-specific results generated by the Reactome analysis tools, and finally, the “Download” tab allows users to download the selected pathway in several different formats.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cc509310-f827-47bf-9660-9f081f95c915/cpz1722-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nThe Pathway Browser, including the event hierarchy (left panel), the details panel (bottom) and the visualization panel displaying the “Pathway Overview” view.\n3. This protocol will illustrate features of the Reactome pathway browser by exploring the events contained within the “DNA Repair” pathway. To begin, click on the “DNA Repair” pathway title in the pathway hierarchy at right.",
    "In response to this selection, the visualization panel zooms in on the DNA Repair node in the Pathway Overview (see Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0005]) and brings up the pathway level information in the “Description” tab of the details panel, including pathway level summation, editorial attributes (authors and reviewers), literature references, GO Biological Process where appropriate, and cellular compartment. Each of these attributes is expandable: clicking on the plus (“+”) symbol on the right reveals further details, including linkouts to PubMed, ORCID, GO, or other cross-referenced resources. The Description tab of the details panel also contains a stable identifier for the event displayed, including the three letter species code (HSA for Homo sapiens is the default unless species is changed). Scrolling down in the details panel to the section labeled “View computationally predicted event in” reveals a species selector bar. Reactome's manual annotations are human-focused but are computationally extended to other species based on protein conservation as described under “Computationally inferred events” in the “Docs” section of the Web site. Selecting a different species from the species selector bar will update the events and information displayed in the visualization and details panel for the selected species. Not that the species may also be changed using the drop-down menu to the right of the Reactome logo in the header of the pathway browser.",
    "Other tabs in the details panel are also updated in response to the selection of “DNA Repair” pathway in the hierarchy (note that the “Structures” tab is not populated with data when a pathway-level event is selected in the hierarchy, and the “Analysis” tab is only populated once an analysis has been performed). The “Molecules” tab is updated to provide information on all the chemical compounds (55 in DNA Repair pathway), proteins (315) drugs (28), sequences (0) or other entities (0) contained in the pathway, and the total number of molecules is displayed as in a red bubble at the top of the “Molecules” header (398). Inside the “Molecules” panel, expandable sections provided detailed information on each of the entities contained in the event linked out to the appropriate reference database. This information is downloadable in full or in part from within the “Molecules” tab. The “Expression” tab displays expression data from Gene Expression Atlas for each of the genes contained within the pathway, and the “Download” tab has pathway reports and diagrams for the selected pathway available for download in a variety of formats.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c5049da0-2263-43cd-a3ba-f45fc69077a5/cpz1722-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nHigh-level view of the DNA Repair pathway in the Pathway Browser, showing pathway-level summation in the details panel, a zoomed-in view of the Pathway Overview and a thumbnail of the textbook-style illustration in the visualization panel.\n4. Double click on the “DNA Repair” pathway title in the hierarchy, or double click on the corresponding node in the visualization panel.",
    "Double clicking on the DNA Repair pathway title in the hierarchy opens the interactive EHLD for this pathway (users know an EHLD is available because the pathway icon between the plus sign and the pathway name in the hierarchy is blue rather than black; pathways with black icons do not have EHLDs but may have static, non-interactive illustrations).\n5. Click on the plus (“+”) symbol beside “DNA Repair” in the hierarchy to reveal the subpathways.\nUsers can navigate to any of the 7 subpathways of DNA Repair by clicking on the plus (“+”) symbol beside DNA Repair in the hierarchy or by clicking on the subpathway name in the EHLD. Clicking on a subpathway name either in the hierarchy or from the EHLD will either open another EHLD, if the selected subpathway itself contains multiple subpathways with ELV diagrams (as is the case for the Base Excision Repair subpathway) or will open an ELV pathway as is the case for the other 6 subpathways of DNA Repair.\n6. Click on the “Nucleotide Excision Repair” pathway either in the hierarchy or from within the “DNA Repair” EHLD.\nAn ELV diagram containing reactions curated at the level of molecular participants appears in the visualization panel, and the details panel updates to reflect information appropriate for this pathway. Note that the total molecules displayed in the “Molecules” tab for this pathway is 119 (9 “Chemical Compounds”, 110 “Proteins”), fewer than the parent DNA Repair pathway, as expected.",
    "ELV pathways open at a fully zoomed out level. Diagram zoom level is controlled either by a mouse or with the zoom icons in the bottom right of the visualization panel. Diagrams can be easily recentered to the fully zoomed out view by clicking on the icon to the immediate right of the search bar at the top of the visualization panel.\nDepending on the diagram size, commonly occurring reaction participants such as H2O or ATP may not be displayed in the diagram at the fully zoomed out level. As the user zooms in, these entities are dynamically added to the pathway diagram.\nNucleotide Excision Repair has two subpathways, both laid out in the same ELV: “Global Genomic NER (GG-NER)” and “Transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER)”. These subpathway names are displayed in the zoomed-out view of the ELV and are contained by colored subpathway boundary boxes. Clicking on either of the NER subpathway names in the hierarchy highlights the events encompassed by that subpathway in the visualization panel in blue, while hovering over a pathway name highlights the corresponding events in yellow.\nThe pathway diagram uses the conventions of the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) format to distinguish the molecules and reactions by shape and cellular location, to provide a dynamic framework for pathway visualization and data analysis. A key to the shapes used in the ELV diagrams is available by clicking on the compass arrow at the top right of the visualization panel; doing so reveals the key shown in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0006].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/91a90bf6-5fa9-4447-9e09-d342dcd0dc94/cpz1722-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nA key to the SGBN-based icons used in the molecular level events in Reactome.",
    "7. Continue to drill down into the hierarchy to reach reaction level events as follows: Click on the pathway title “Global Genomic Nucleotide Excision Repair”. Note that the details panel shows that this pathway contains 92 of the 119 molecules present in the NER pathway (8/9 “Chemical Compounds” and 84/110 “Proteins”). Expand this subpathway in the hierarchy by clicking on the adjacent plus sign to reveal the four subpathways (“DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER”, “Formation of Incision Complex…”, etc.). Continue to expand the hierarchy by clicking the “DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER” pathway in the hierarchy to reveal the five molecular level events contained within, noticing that at each subsequent pathway level the fraction of molecules represented is adjusted relative to the parent NER pathway.\n8. Click on “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2”, the first reaction in the “DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER” pathway, as shown in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0007].\nClicking a reaction in the pathway hierarchy will cause the reaction name and the name of the subpathway(s) and parent pathways to be highlighted, as seen in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0007], above. The visualization panel will recenter on the selected reaction and the reaction will be highlighted in blue. Furthermore, the description tab of the “Details” panel will update to show particulars of the selected reaction, which will include some or all of the following, where appropriate: inputs, outputs, catalysts and positive and negative regulators, preceding event, and “inferred from” reaction.",
    "In the case of the “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2” reaction, there are three inputs, one output, no catalyst or regulators, no preceding event, and no “inferred from” reaction. The inputs to the reaction are the proteins XPC and CETN2 and a set of RAD23 proteins. Reactome sets are groups of molecules that are known or predicted to function in the same way in a given reaction and may either be “member” sets, where each participant is known to have the indicated role, or “candidate” sets, where some participants are verified members, and others are candidates based on sequence or structural similarity. Here the RAD23 set is a “candidate” set, with RAD23B a verified member and RAD23A a candidate. The output of this reaction is the complex formed by the binding of the three inputs (XPC, the RAD23 set, and CETN2).\nClicking on the “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2” reaction simultaneously updates information in the other details panel tabs:\n-The red bubble on the “Molecules” header now indicates that the reaction contains 4/119 molecules from the Nucleotide Excision Repair pathway, all of them proteins, and the “Molecules” panel is updated with information on these four proteins.\n-The “Structures” header has been decorated with a red bubble indicating the fraction of the molecules in the reaction for which structural information is available (here, 4/4), and the panel provides linkouts to those structures in Protein Data Bank. The expression for these four proteins is displayed in the “Expression” tab.\n-The “Analysis” tab continues to be blank unless an analysis has been performed.\n-The “Download” tab: note that although a reaction is selected in hierarchy, the download available from this tab remains the immediate parent ELV pathway (here the “Nucleotide Excision Repair” subpathway of the top-level “DNA Repair”).",
    "In the context of the “DNA Damage and Recognition in GG-NER” pathway, the reaction “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2” is the first in a series of connected reactions, in which the output of one reaction is the input to the next reaction. Because there are no annotated reactions that occur prior to the binding of RAD23 and CETN2 to XPC, there is no indication of a “preceding event” in the “Description” tab of the details panel for this reaction. If the following reaction in the hierarchy (“XPC:RAD23:CETN2 and UV-DDB bind distorted dsDNA site”) is selected, the “Description” tab of the details panel is updated with reaction-specific information. In particular, a new field describing the positive regulator (INO80 complex) is added, as is the new field “Preceding Event”, which lists the “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2[Homo sapiens]” reaction described above. Clicking on the plus (‘+’) symbol to the right of this “preceding event” reaction name expands this field to reveal the summation and literature references associated with the reaction. This allows users to put the current reaction into a more complete biological context.\nThe relationship between the “levels” of the pathway hierarchy on the one hand and the “Preceding event(s)” links, on the other hand, may not be immediately clear. The nested levels of the pathway hierarchy reflect levels of abstraction in the conceptual organization of pathways. As one moves deeper into the hierarchy, the contents of the pathway diagram become more and more specific and move closer to the biochemical reaction level. The “Preceding event(s)” link only appears at the reaction level.",
    "Reactions in Reactome are human-centric. Wherever possible, the molecular events that are depicted in Reactome are supported by direct experiments that make use of human cells, tissues, protein, or other entities. This evidence is cited in the literature references associated with the reaction. Often, however, knowledge of human biology is derived indirectly from work using model organisms. If the direct experimental evidence supporting a given reaction is model organism-based, an “inferring” reaction is created using the molecules from the relevant species, and a corresponding human reaction is inferred from it. Human reactions that are inferred in this way are indicated with a double arrow adjacent to the reaction title in the hierarchy, and by the presence of an “inferred from another species” field in the “Description” tab of the details panel. Expanding the field by clicking on the plus (‘+’) symbol at the right reveals the summation and references for the experiment(s) in the other species. “Inferred from” reactions may also be marked as chimeric if the experiment being cited as evidence contains molecules (proteins, nucleic acids, etc.) from multiple species.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/46090d3a-63dc-496a-b7e9-04e9cbe9ef6e/cpz1722-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nSelection of a particular reaction (“XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2” in the “DNA damage and recognition in the GG-NER” pathway) updates the Pathway Browser appropriately.\n9. There are no inferred reactions within the “Nucleotide Excision Repair” subpathway. To see an example in the “Base Excision Repair” pathway, expand the “Base Excision Repair” hierarchy to reveal the subpathways “Base-Excision Repair, AP Site Formation”, and continue to unfurl its child pathway “Depurination”, and its child pathway “Recognition and association of DNA glycosylase with site containing an affected purine”.",
    "This pathway contains 10 reactions, the ninth of which is “NEIL3 recognizes and binds to spiroiminodihydantoin in telomeric DNA”, with the inferred double arrow indicator beside its event name in the hierarchy. The “Description” tab of the details panel contains an “Inferred from another species” field, listing the corresponding reaction from Mus musculus, along with its summation and literature references, as shown in Figure 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0008].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bfae08b4-2492-4015-a48e-9774b92222bc/cpz1722-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nThe reaction “NEIL3 recognizes and binds to spiroiminodihydatoin in telomeric DNA” is inferred from a corresponding reaction in Mus musculus, as evidenced by the double arrowhead beside the event name in the hierarchy.\n10. In addition to the reaction level information described above (summations, literature references, editorial attributes, etc.), Reactome also provides detailed information about each of the entities involved in a reaction. To explore this, return to the first reaction of the “DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER pathway”, “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2”. Clicking on any of the inputs or outputs of the reaction (or regulators and catalysts where applicable) updates the “Description” tab of the details panel with information and linkouts for the corresponding molecule. In the “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2” reaction, click on the “XPC” entity in the pathway diagram.\nThis will update the Details panel to display information about the protein, including synonyms, cellular compartment (linked out to the GO ontology), external identifiers to resources such as UniProtKB, Ensembl, GeneCards, HMDB Protein, HPA, OpenTargets, Orphanet, PDB, PRO, Pharos, and RefSeq and a selector bar to view the entity in other species. Small molecule inputs or outputs (none in this reaction) are similarly linked to appropriate reference databases and provided with synonyms and cellular compartments in the “Description” tab of the details panel. Small molecules are given species-agnostic identifiers beginning with R-ALL.",
    "Note that in the “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2” reaction, the XPC and CETN2 icons in the visualization panel are decorated with red circles on the upper right corner. This mark indicates the number of interacting proteins in the IntAct database for that entity. Clicking on the red icon displays the interacting proteins in a halo around the pathway entity, as shown for XPC in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0009]; clicking on an interactor takes the user to the UniProtKB record for that protein. In cases where there are too many interactors to display in the context of the pathway diagram, only the top 18 interactors are shown. Users can customize the confidence level for these interactors with the sliding scale at the bottom of the visualization panel; this toolbar also allows users to download all pathway interactors as a CSV file.\nAlthough the interacting protein overlay by default is set to IntAct, users can change the referring database by opening the panel on the right side of the visualization panel as shown in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0009] and selecting one of the other highlighted resources from the middle “Interactors” tab. These interactors are loaded on an on-demand basis through PSICQUIC. Note that at this time, interactors can only be displayed for individual pathway protein entities and not for complexes or molecule sets.\nAlso note that zooming in on XPC or other proteins within the visualization panel reveals within the pathway icon the UniProtKB identifier and, if available, an associated structure from PDB.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7278d7fa-59b1-475b-a1c8-51406e81df30/cpz1722-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nProteins that interact with XPC as described in the IntAct database are displayed as a halo around XPC in the visualization panel.",
    "11. Reactome provides information about the subunits of a complex, as well as the larger ensembles of proteins that a complex participates in. In this example, from the “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2” page, click on the “XPC:RAD23:CETN2” entity in the pathway diagram. This will update the Details panel to display information about this complex.\nThe “Description” tab of the details panel will now include a new field “Components”, in which each of the constituents of the complex are listed, each with an expandable window that links to further information about that entity (synonyms, compartment, reference entities, external identifiers, etc. as outlined above for XPC; in addition, clicking on the icon to the left of the component name—here, the green protein circle for XPC also reveals a window with entity-specific information).\nIn addition, the “Description” tab of the details panel now includes a “Produced by” and a “Consumed by” field, listing events across Reactome as a whole in which the complex is either an output or an input, respectively. These fields are expandable [plus (‘+’) symbol at right] to reveal summation and literature references for the reaction-like-event in question. Clicking on the reaction icon to the left of the “Produced by” or “Consumed by” reaction titles will highlight the reaction node and recenter the visualization panel on the corresponding reaction. Note that this may move the user to a different pathway diagram.\nMore detailed information is also provided about the components of sets; to see this click on the RAD23 set that is an input to the “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2” reaction. Note, however, that sets are not associated with “Produced by” or “Consumed by” fields as complexes are.",
    "12. To explore the information Reactome provides about catalysts, click on the third reaction in the “DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER” pathway, “UV-DDB ubiquitinates XPC”. Catalysts are shown regulating the reaction node by virtue of an edge ending in a circle (see Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0010]). Catalysts may either be independent of other reaction participants, or, as in this case, may be one of the reaction inputs. Reflecting this dual role, the “XPC:RAD23:CETN2:Distorted ds DNA:UV-DDB” complex has both a reaction edge and a catalyst edge associated with it.\nIn addition to the fields described above for reactions without catalysts, the “Description” tab of the details panel for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction also contains the following information about the catalyst (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0010]):\n         \n-Physical Entity: whichever molecule in the pathway diagram is associated with the catalyst activity. This may be a single protein, a set of proteins, or a complex (here the complex “XPC:RAD23:CETN2:Distorted ds DNA:UV-DDB”).\n-Active Unit: in cases such as this one where a complex is the catalyst, the specific component that contributes the catalytic activity is identified. Here, the active unit is the UV-DDB subcomplex consisting of DDB1 and 2, RBX1 and CUL4.\n-Molecular Function: the most appropriate term is taken from (and linked out to) the GO. The catalyst name is a concatenation of the GO Molecular Function and the name of the Physical entity.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a66f3d7a-49b8-42d8-8167-da3da02302a6/cpz1722-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nThe details of a Reactome catalyst are shown in the context of the reaction “UV-DDB ubiquitinates XPC”.",
    "13. Reactome provides inter-pathway connections for physical entities contained within a given pathway diagram. Hovering over any entity in the visualization panel reveals an arrowhead at the right side of the entity icon. Clicking on this arrowhead reveals an interactive information panel (Contextual Information Panel, CIP) with three tabs (see Fig. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0011]): “Molecules”, “Pathways”, and “Interactors”. Similar to the descriptions above, the “Molecules” tab provides the components of the selected entity, and the “Interactors” tab provides a table listing the interacting proteins along with scores and evidence (note that display name of components or interactors can be toggled between common name and reference identifier by clicking on the small “id” button at the top right of the interactive panel; clicking on the pin icon locks the interactive panel to the pathway diagram; to close the panel, click on the “x” icon).\nTo explore the “Pathways” tab, click on the arrowhead revealed by hovering above the XPC protein input in the first reaction of the “DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER” subpathway, “XPC binds RAD23 and CETN2”.\nThe “Pathways” tab lists other Reactome pathways in which the selected entity takes part; here the only other pathway in which XPC has an annotated function in Reactome is the “SUMOylation of DNA damage response and repair proteins” pathway. Clicking on the pathway name within the interactive panel moves the user to the new pathway in which that entity participates.\nThis connection between pathways mediated by shared participants highlights potentially unexpected linkages between disparate areas of biology and illustrates the power of Reactome to bridge the domains.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8060dda3-874d-4983-b657-3c4b03b9430e/cpz1722-fig-0011-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 11\nThe Contextual Information Panel (CIP) displays information about a given pathway entity, including constituent molecules, other Reactome pathways where that entity occurs, and interactors.",
    "In addition to normal human biology, Reactome annotates abnormal or pathological events arising from genetic mutation or interaction with an infectious agent in a separate top-level pathway called “Disease”. Reactome disease pathways are designated with a red “+” symbol to the left of the pathway name and include cancer, metabolic, immune, and infectious diseases, among others. Where possible, Reactome disease pathways also include the interaction of relevant therapeutic drugs.\nConsistent with Reactome's pathway-centric view, disease events (with the exception of infectious processes) are annotated as changes to normal molecular level reactions and are displayed in the context of the relevant non-disease pathway background. As a result, there is no single diagram representing a given disease (e.g., bladder cancer or diabetes) but rather individual events that are perturbed in the course of that disease are labeled with the appropriate disease tag and displayed as overlays to normal pathway events. Events with the same disease tag may, therefore, be distributed across multiple normal pathways and pathway diagrams. Infectious diseases represent novel events that do not have a corresponding normal state and have their own pathway diagrams.\nReactome's disease and drug annotations will be explored using the disease pathways “Signaling by ERBB2 in Cancer” and “SARS-CoV-2 Infection”. This module will highlight where and how the disease pathway annotations diverge from those of normal pathways; many of the key annotation features, however, are functionally equivalent and these will not be detailed here.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nComputer capable of supporting a Web browser and an Internet connection\nSoftware\nAny modern Web browser such as Firefox, Safari, and Chrome will work to display Reactome Web pages\n1. To begin exploring Reactome's disease and drug annotations, point the browser to the Reactome home page at https://reactome.org[href=https://reactome.org].",
    "2. Click on the “Pathway Browser” button on the home page and unfurl the events under the “Disease” top level pathway in the hierarchy by clicking on the “+” symbol to the left of the pathway name.\nNotice that subpathways are grouped by general biological processes (“Diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messengers”, “Diseases of metabolism”, “Infectious diseases”, etc.) rather than by specific diseases (diabetes, bladder cancer, etc.). These groupings generally mirror the pathway groupings of the normal event hierarchy (See Fig. 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0012]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d9f43c8c-3fa9-42a8-8271-346271044ea2/cpz1722-fig-0012-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 12\nThe textbook-style illustration and the pathway summation for the top-level Disease pathway.\n3. Continue to unfurl the disease hierarchy, first expanding the “Diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messengers” pathway, and then the child of that subpathway “Signaling by ERBB2 in Cancer”. This is an EHLD-level pathway with 6 subpathways.",
    "Notice that in the “Description” tab of the details panel for this pathway, there is a new field “Disease”, with “cancer” as the entry. Expanding this field with the “+” at the right reveals a disease definition and synonyms along with a hyperlinked identifier for the disease that refers back to the corresponding page in the Human Disease Ontology at the OLS (Schriml et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0021]). DOIDs are applied to all disease entities and events. In the case of disease entities, such as proteins that arise as the result of genetic mutation, the entity may be labeled with as many separate DOIDs as there is evidence to support; in the case of sets of disease entities AND in the case of disease events, only DOIDs that are applicable to ALL the contained entities/events are applied. For this reason, pathway-level DOIDs are often quite general (“cancer” in this case). Drilling down into the hierarchy usually corresponds to more and more specific disease terms.\n4. Click on the first subpathway “Constitutive Signaling by Overexpressed ERBB2”. This opens an ELV level pathway with molecular level reactions laid out.",
    "Relative to a wild-type pathway, ELV-level disease pathways have two new fields in the “Description” tab of the details panel, “Disease” as described above and “Normal pathway”. The “Normal Pathway” field lists the non-disease pathway from the normal hierarchy upon which the disease events are overlaid - in this case “Signaling by ERBB2”. Expanding the panel reveals the summation for the wild-type pathway, while clicking on the pathway icon to the left of the normal pathway name in the details panel moves the user to the pathway diagram for that normal pathway. To return to the disease ELV from the normal pathway, click on the browser's back button. Notice that the events of the normal pathway, while visible in the disease ELV, are not clickable or interactive. To demonstrate this, hover over or try to click any of the greyed-out reaction lines or entities from the normal pathway.\nDisease entities and disease reaction lines are highlighted in the disease ELV in red, while drugs and drug-containing entities are colored purple and have a small Rx in the bottom right of the icon. All disease and drug entities and events displayed in the ELV are fully interactive as expected.\n5. Click on the first reaction of the “Constitutive Signaling by Overexpressed ERBB2” pathway, “ERBB2 homodimerization”.\nThis reaction has as input a complex of ERBB2 with the protein ERBIN and the chaperone proteins HSP90 and CDC37; during the reaction, 2 such complexes (note the stoichiometry displayed on the reaction line) associate, the chaperone proteins and ERBIN are released and an ERBB2 homodimer is formed (see Fig. 13[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0013]).",
    "Notice that the input complex (“ERBB2:ERBIN”HSP90:CDC37″) and the outputs ERBIN, HSP90, and CDC37 are not colored red. These are all genetically normal proteins or protein complexes, are not labeled with a disease tag and consequently are not colored red. In contrast, the output (ERBB2 homodimer) is colored red, and is associated with a disease tag (although this annotation is not currently displayed in the “Description” section of the details panel when the ERBB2 homodimer is selected in the pathway diagram). In this example, although all the participating input entities are genetically normal, the process is not: disease-associated amplification of the ERBB2 gene leads to protein overexpression. This allows the receptor tyrosine kinase to homodimerize in the absence of ligand, something that does not occur under normal conditions (the corresponding complex under normal conditions would be a heterodimer consisting of a monomer of ERBB2 and a ligand-activated monomeric member of the ERBB family (EGFR, ERBB3, or ERBB4)). For this reason, the ERBB2 homodimer is a disease entity, is marked with a disease tag and is colored red.\nThis reaction represents a gain-of-function or novel reaction, in that the protein is carrying out a new role that is not seen in the normal pathway. Infectious disease events are another example of gain-of-function events, as by definition the presence of an infectious agent is a new, disease-associated attribute.",
    "Although gain-of-function disease reactions are displayed in the context of the normal, grayed-out pathway (and may make use of other components of the normal pathway, as in this case), the actual reaction is generally laid out separately in its own space in the pathway diagram. This is in contrast to loss-of-function disease reactions, described below in point 9, which are overlaid directly on top of the corresponding normal reactions. Exceptions to this “separate space for gain-of-function reactions” rule are explained below in point 8.\nDisease reactions display a new field in the “Description” tab of the details panel relative to normal events: “Functional Status”. This expandable field identifies the disease physical entity, as well as the underlying genetic structural variation and the functional outcome of that variation, with terms pulled from Sequence types and features ontology (SO; Eilbeck et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0006]). This is shown in Figure 14[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0014].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f6ec7224-cff0-4da3-9427-50b7584bb22b/cpz1722-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nA gain-of-function reaction in the “Constitutive Signaling by Overexpressed ERBB2” pathway.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3467689f-02cc-4629-96fc-2c9ec6d97189/cpz1722-fig-0014-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 14\nThe details panel identifies the “Functional Status” of the disease entity (here, p-ERBB2 homodimer), describing the underlying genetic changes that result in abnormal molecular behavior and disease outcomes.\n6. Click on the next reaction in the “Constitutive Signaling by Overexpressed ERBB2”, “Trans-autophosphorylation of ERBB2 homodimer”.",
    "This reaction shows the post-translational modification of the receptor through autophosphorylation, and is highlighted here not to illustrate a disease-specific reaction element, but rather as a demonstration of the ability of Reactome to capture detailed post-translational modifications. Scroll down in the “Description” tab of the details panel for this reaction and unfurl the field for the output, “p-ERBB2 homodimer”. Notice that this complex consists of two copies of the phosphorylated ERBB2 monomer. Phosphorylations are listed under the “Post-translational modification” field, which includes the coordinate(s) of amino acid residues from the reference sequence that are modified and details of the specific modifications with terms taken from PSI MOD (see Fig. 15[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0015]). Notice also that this reaction has two negative regulators, the complexes “ERBB2:TKIs:ERBIN:HSP90:CDC37” and “ERBB2:trastuzumab:ERBIN:HSP90:CDC37”. These therapeutic-containing complexes are appropriately shaded in purple to reflect the inclusion of drug(s) and will be described in more detail in step 7 of this protocol.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d11d7874-bbbd-4c3a-a255-255a766bfe6d/cpz1722-fig-0015-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 15\nThe details panel captures precise information about post-translational modifications to pathway entities.\n7. In the “Constitutive Signaling by Overexpressed ERBB2”, click on the reaction “ERBB2 binds trastuzumab”. Scroll down in the “Description” tab of the details panel and expand the field for the “trastuzumab” reaction input.\nReactome annotates therapeutics in three classes - protein, small molecule, and RNA drugs. Drugs are cross-referenced to Guide to Pharmacology, ChEBI and/or PubChem where possible and applicable, and this information is displayed in the “Description” tab of the Details panel as shown in Figure 16[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0016]. Similar information can also be viewed by clicking on the red circle icon beside the trastuzumab name.",
    "The effect of the drug on the disease pathway is annotated where possible. In this pathway, the complex formed by the binding of the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab to the ERBB2-chaperone complex inhibits the ability of the ERBB2 homodimer to autophosphorylate, thus preventing signaling downstream of the abnormally activated receptor. In the case of the “ERBB2 binds TKIs” reaction, Reactome shows the binding of a set of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to the ERBB2:chaperone complex; this binding inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, similarly preventing autophosphorylation and downstream signaling.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e6435678-e45e-4b35-99cd-347524881719/cpz1722-fig-0016-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 16\nReactome captures the effect of therapeutics on pathway events where possible and links the therapeutics to appropriate external resources in the details panel.\n8. Reactome captures detailed molecular information about individual proteins that are implicated in abnormal biochemical reactions in disease. To explore this, unfurl the second pathway of “Signaling by ERBB2 in Cancer”, “Signaling by ERBB2 KD Mutants”, and click on the first reaction “ERBB2 KD mutants heterodimerize”.\nThis pathway describes ERBB2 proteins with mutations in the kinase domain (KD) that increase the catalytic activity of the enzyme, resulting in elevated autophosphorylation and downstream signaling. In this case, the mutant proteins are performing the same biochemical role as their normal counterparts but at an elevated rate or efficiency. In cases like this, the disease reactions are overlaid directly on top of the corresponding normal ones in the diagram, unlike in the case of novel functions described in step 5, above, for overexpressed ERBB2.",
    "To see the details of the ERBB2 mutants annotated in this reaction, click on the complex “ERBB2 KD mutants:ERBIN:HSP90:CDC37” in the pathway diagram. In the “Description” tab of the details panel, select the set “ERBB2 KD mutants” to reveal the list of member and candidate proteins (Fig. 17A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0017]). Expand the field for the first member, “ERBB2 L775P” with the ‘+’ on the right. This reveals detailed information about the protein including the genetic alteration (here L-leucine 755 replaced with L-proline) (See Fig. 17B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0017]). Clicking on the green circle beside the “ERBB2 L755P” name (indicated with the red square in Fig. 17B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0017]) reveals further information including linkouts to COSMIC (or OMIM, or ClinGen, where appropriate), as well as the literature reference specific for that mutant (scroll down to bottom of the panel to see this) (Fig. 17C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0017]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c37f0b4f-44ac-4a04-8535-26f891a6e529/cpz1722-fig-0017-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 17\n(A) A list of the members and candidates of the “ERBB2 KD mutants” set is revealed by clicking on the “+” symbol on the right side of the details panel after the disease complex is selected in the pathway diagram.

(C) Further cross-references are available by clicking on the green circle to the left of the disease entity name.",
    "9. Reactome also annotates loss-of-function events, where a protein has lost all or most of its normal functional activity. To explore this, unfurl the third subpathway of “Signaling by ERBB2 in Cancer”, “Drug Resistance in ERBB2 KD mutants”. This reveals a further 8 subpathways, each describing the resistance of sets of ERBB2 KD mutants to 8 different drugs. Select the first pathway, “Resistance of ERBB2 mutants to trastuzumab” and unfurl that pathway to reveal the single “failed reaction”, “Resistant ERBB2 KD mutants do not bind trastuzumab” (Fig. 18[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0018]).\nIn a loss-of-function event, the relevant disease entity (here the complex “ERBB2 KD mutants (trastuzumab resistant):ERBIN:HSP90:CDC37”) is outlined with a dashed red line, and products that are no longer made are greyed out with a superimposed red “X”. These loss-of-function events represent “stop points” in the pathway and are overlaid directly on top of the corresponding normal event in the pathway diagram.\nThe “Description” tab of the details panel provides “Functional Status” information for the disease entity and unfurling the complex to reveal the member and candidate proteins will provide access to detailed mutational and linkout information as described above for gain-of-function mutants.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a1672452-4e7d-42df-b21c-a179344201ee/cpz1722-fig-0018-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 18\nLoss-of-function reaction “Resistant ERBB2 KD mutants do no bind trastuzumab” is shown with the loss-of-function entity bordered by a broken red line and the output of the failed reaction crossed out.\n10. Infectious processes are, by definition, novel events that do not occur in the absence of the initiating pathogen. As such, these are represented in their own diagrams with no corresponding normal pathway. In addition to annotating the infection process itself, Reactome also shows how these infectious agents modulate normal biological processes.",
    "To explore this, unfurl the “Infectious disease” child of “Diseases”, then continue to unfurl “SARS-CoV Infections”, “SARS-CoV-2 Infection”, and “SARS-CoV-2-host interactions”. This reveals an ELV pathway diagram displaying five subpathways. Expand the subpathway “SARS-CoV-2 activates/modulates innate and adaptive immune responses” and click on the reaction “SARS-CoV-2 8 binds class I MHC”, shown in Figure 19A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0019].\nThis reaction shows the first of two steps in the formation of a host-CoV-2 complex that has been demonstrated to play a role in immune evasion. In the next step, the output of this reaction is bound by the Beclin-1 complex and the final complex, “8:class I MHC:BECN1 complex”, is shown negatively regulating the normal human reaction “Capturing cargo and formation of prebudding complex”. This cargo capture reaction is part of the normal “Class I MHC mediated antigen processing and presentation” pathway, as indicated by the flow arrow from the normal reaction to the green-bordered interactive pathway icon seen in Figure 19A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0019]. Users can navigate between the normal and disease diagrams by clicking on the encapsulated pathway icon to open the corresponding pathway diagram. In the normal human pathway diagram, a reciprocal view is shown (Fig. 19B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0019]): here, the output of the two-step human-CoV-2 binding reactions is shown negatively regulating the normal reaction in the context of its normal biological pathway and the chimeric complex is associated with the pathway icon for “SARS-CoV-2-host interactions”. Note that pathway connections of this kind are not limited to normal:disease diagrams, but are used throughout Reactome to indicate bridges between any biological processes that are depicted in different pathway diagrams.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/71675f76-4090-404d-a9fb-57f29f3891d6/cpz1722-fig-0019-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 19",
    "(A) Infectious diseases and processes are novel events with no normal counterparts. They are laid out in their own diagrams and are shown interacting with and modulating the function of normal entities and events, as shown here for the SARS-CoV-2 subpathway “SARS-CoV-2 host interactions”.

Reactome supplements its manual disease annotation with an overlay feature that makes use of data from DisGeNet, a public database of associations between human genes or variants and disease (Piñero et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0018]). This overlay is similar to the protein interactor overlay from IntAct described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-prot-0001], Step 10 and shown in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0009].\nTo explore this feature within the “SARS-CoV-2 host interactions” pathway diagram, open the interactive panel on the right side of the visualization panel, select the middle tab with the data overlay options, and select “DisGeNet” from the available data sources.\nProtein icons in the pathway are now decorated in the upper right with a red circle indicating the number of diseases from DisGeNet that are associated with that protein.\n12.

The steps for doing so, using a UniProtKB (SwissProt) accession number, are presented here. The same procedure works for GenBank, Ensembl, Entrez or HGNC identifiers.

    "The Pathway Analysis tool allows one to analyze lists of genes, proteins or small molecules by providing services for ID mapping and pathway assignment and overrepresentation analysis. It is a powerful exploratory tool that is linked to the Reactome Pathway Browser.

Below the tool buttons on the left of the analysis window is a “click to learn more about our analysis tools” option. This takes users to a detailed description of the tools, including some “getting started” tutorials.\n3. Select the UniProtKB accession list sample data from the panel at the right of the analysis window and click the “Continue” button.",
    "The “Analyse Gene list” tool maps a list of identifiers (generally, UniProtKB IDs for proteins, ChEBI IDs for small molecules, and either HGNC gene symbols or Ensembl IDs for DNA/RNA molecules, although other IDs are also supported) to the Reactome pathways that contain them, and overrepresentation and pathway topology analyses are performed. Overrepresentation analysis indicates the probability that the data set contains more of the participants of a given pathway than would be expected by chance, while the topology analysis highlights any reaction whose participants include at least one match to a molecule from the submitted data set.\n4. This moves the analysis panel to the “Options” step, where “project to human” is checked by default. In this mode, any non-human identifiers are converted by the analysis service to their human equivalents. The second option “include interactors” is by default left unchecked; if this option is selected, the analysis will include protein-protein interactions from the IntAct database for all proteins in all pathways, increasing the potential coverage with the query.\nLeaving these options set at their default values, click “Analyse!” to reveal the overrepresentation analysis overlaid on the Pathway Overview diagram, as shown in Figure 23[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-fig-0023].\nNote that the color scheme for the analysis may be customized by clicking on the artist's palette on the pop-out Settings panel at the right. The overview may also be viewed in the space-filling Voronoi diagram by clicking on the right-most icon at the top left of the visualization panel.",
    "A pathway is considered “overrepresented” or “enriched” if the submitted data set has more participants from that pathway than would be expected by chance. The overrepresentation analysis calculates a probability score for each pathway, corrected for false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.722#cpz1722-bib-0003]), and colors the pathways according to the scale shown on the right in the visualization panel. Analysis results are shown in the “Analysis” tab in the Details panel. All Reactome pathways are shown, in groups of 20, ranked by the p-value obtained from the overrepresentation analysis. Visualization may also be set to represent pathway coverage in the query set, by adjusting the toggle in the bottom of the visualization panel.\nThe details panel lists the results by pathway for: “Entities found” (number of submitted entities found: clicking on the number in this column will open a new window displaying the identifiers found in that pathway, including mapping to isoform-specific versions where applicable); “Entities total” (total number of pathway entities); “Entities Ratio” (representing the fraction of entities in the pathway relative to Reactome as a whole); “Entities p-value” (probability score as described above); “Entities FDR” (p-value adjusted for multiple comparisons based on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure); “Reactions found” (the number of reactions in the pathway containing at least one entity from the data set); “Reactions total” (total number of reactions in the pathway); “Reactions ratio” (fraction of pathway reactions relative to Reactome as a whole); and Species name.",
    "In the pathway hierarchy panel, pathway names are labeled with the number of molecules from the data set found in that pathway as a fraction of the pathway total, and FDR values are added to the right side of the pathway names. Results from the Topology analysis are also overlaid onto the hierarchy - any reaction in the hierarchy that contains as a participant at least one identifier from the data set is boxed in orange.\nIdentifiers from the query set that were not found in a Reactome pathway are listed under the “Not found” tab to the left of the ranked pathways list. This list, as well as the analysis results can be downloaded by selecting the files of choice from the “Downloads” tab to the left of the ranked pathway list.
