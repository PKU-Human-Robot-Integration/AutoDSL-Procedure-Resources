    "Verification of conjugation of ubiquitin to phospholipids by phospholipase D\nTiming: 1.5–2.5 h\nTo verify that ubiquitin is conjugated to phospholipids, the sensitivity of hydrophobic ubiquitin to phospholipase D (PLD) can be tested. This section describes on-bead PLD treatment and a delipidation assay using the Triton X-114 fraction in step 3. In the delipidation assay, the purified Triton X-114 fraction is incubated with PLD and subjected to another round of phase partitioning (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). After PLD treatment, delipidated ubiquitin species are remobilized from the Triton X-114 to the aqueous fraction, while hydrophobic proteins (e.g., ubiquitinated membrane proteins) remain in the Triton X-114 fraction.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2268-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Procedure of the delipidation assay\nThe Triton X-114 fraction is incubated with phospholipase D (PLD) followed by another round of phase partitioning.
