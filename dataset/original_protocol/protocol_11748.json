    "All of the procedures performed in fish experiments are in accordance with the regulations of the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Northwest Normal University.\n1. Preparations\nAnimals\n\t\nUse adult female zebrafish with a body length of 4-6 cm.\n\t\tNOTE: We used zebrafish from a local market.\nKeep the zebrafish in a circulated water system with a 14 h light and 10 h dark cycle at about 28 °C.\nFeed fish twice daily with newly hatched brine shrimp.\nPulled glass capillary\n\t\nUse a 15 cm glass capillary and place its head in an alcohol burner to heat it. Hold one end of glass capillary by hand and hold the other end with forceps.\nAfter heating 5-10 seconds, the glass on the fire of alcohol burner become red and soft. Stretch the head of the glass capillary with forceps to make the capillary opening with required diameter.\n\t\tNOTE: The diameter depends on the follicle diameters: previtellogenic (PV; about 0.30 mm in diameter), early vitellogenic (EV; about 0.40 mm in diameter), midvitellogenic (MV; about 0.50 mm in diameter), late vitellogenic (LV; about 0.60 mm in diameter) and full grown but immature (FG; about 0.65 mm in diameter).\nStretch the opening of glass capillary to the appropriate diameter, which is slightly smaller the size of separated follicles. The glass capillary with an opening much bigger than the size of ovarian follicles cannot perform separation, but the much smaller ones would break the follicles during separation. Practice the stretching of the glass capillary several times.\n\t\tNOTE: Heating time depends on the size of glass capillary. Do not directly stretch the glass capillary on the fire of alcohol burner. It will break the glass capillary.\nCut the glass capillary with an ampoule cutter and break the glass capillary with forceps to obtain a smooth incision.",
    "NOTE: A sharp or broken opening of the glass capillary would damage the follicles.\nUsing a 30 cm plastic tube, insert a 1 mL pipette tip with a filter element at one end, insert the pulled glass capillary at the end of the pipette, and connect a 200 µL pipette tip at another end.\n2. Separation of zebrafish oocytes and follicular cells at different stages\nDissection of the zebrafish ovary\n\t\nFill an ice bucket to 4/5 full with slurry ice and add sufficient fish water to let slurry ice float. Wait 2-5 minutes, check the water temperature, and make sure the temperature is between 2-4 °C.\nAnesthetize adult females by placing fish in the ice water for at least 2-5 minutes, until fish stop gill movement. Decapitate the fish by severing the spinal cord using a sharp scissors to ensure death.\nPlace the fish on the dissecting plate with forceps.\nUse dissecting scissors to cut as follows. Dissect from the cloaca to the gills along the midline of the abdomen. Cut from the back of the cloaca. Cut from the anterior tip to the dorsal side. Gently remove the skin and muscles on one side of the body. Expose the internal organs and take out the entire ovary with forceps.\nImmediately, place the ovaries gently into a 100 mm culture dish containing 60% Leibovitz's L-15 (L-15) medium.\nIsolation of ovarian follicles\n\tNOTE: The staging system that we have adopted is based on the original definition of Selman et al.4.\n\t\nManually isolate follicles of different stages using a pair of fine forceps as described previously8.\nGroup the ovarian follicles into the following stages: PV, EV, MV, LV and FG stages.\nSeparation of follicular cells and oocyte from ovarian follicles",
    "Put the ovarian follicles at different stages into a clean Petri dish containing 60% L-15 medium.\nUsing the pulled glass capillary from step 1.2, suck the follicles into the glass capillary 2-3 cm and blow them out.\n\t\tNOTE: When the opening diameter of the glass capillaries is appropriate, the follicle can be separated from the oocyte by inhalation once.\n\t\t\nIf the follicular cell layer is attached to the oocyte firmly, repeat 2-3 times to accomplish a complete separation. Avoid multiple attempts to force a follicle through a smaller capillary, which would damage the follicle.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In the process of inhalation and blowing out, the follicular layer falls off and separates from the oocyte, and finally, follicular cells and denuded oocytes are separated (Figure 1).\nPool the denuded but intact oocytes and collect the surviving denuded oocytes for further assays.\nTo investigate whether the follicular cells were separated from intact follicles, stain the intact follicles and separated oocytes with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).\n\t\t\nFix the samples in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. Wash several times by PBS.\nStain by DAPI at RT for 30 min. Washed several times with PBS. View and photograph with a fluorescence microscope (e.g., Leica DFC7000 T).\nTo confirm the completed separation, fix the intact follicles and separated oocytes in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, and embed intissue-freezing medium (e.g., Leica) at -25 °C.\n\t\t\nCut the fixed tissues on a microtome, and mount onto glass slides.\nWash the sections in PBS and visualize the cell nuclei with DAPI. View and photograph on a fluorescence microscope.\n3. In vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro fertilization (IVF)\nNOTE: The procedure of IVM of IVF was followed as described previously with minor modification 11,12,13.",
    "Prepare fresh maturation medium (+DHP medium) before ovary dissection from adult zebrafish female. To prepare the fresh maturation medium, add 9 mL of Leibovitz's L-15 medium, pH 9.0, to 15 mL conical tubes. Add 10 µL of 17α-20β-dihydroxy-4 pregnen-3-one (DHP) (5 mg/mL), 490 µL of dH2O, and 500 µL of 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA).\nPrepare Hank's solution and E3 solution in advance. Prepare Hanks' solution as described by Baars et al.14. Prepare E3 medium: 5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, and 1-5% Methylene Blue.\nPerform dissection of zebrafish ovary and isolation of ovarian follicles as in steps step 2.\nCollect full grown stage follicles and use as immature oocytes. For each adult female zebrafish, at least 150-200 full grown stage follicles can be isolated. Select the intact and healthy follicles for IVM.\nIncubate the full-grown stage follicles in +DHP medium in 12-well plates, checking periodically to ensure that the oocytes remain intact. Remove any lysing oocytes with a Pasteur pipette.\n\tNOTE: During the oocyte maturation, the oocytes will become progressively translucent. A majority of the oocytes become translucent after treatment of DHP for 2 h. This can be observed under a dissecting microscope with transmitted light optics.\nRemove the outermost follicular cells from each matured oocyte as described in step 2.3.\nTransfer the denuded oocytes to a Petri dish with a few drops of culture medium and proceed to fertilization.\nPrepare the fresh sperm solution using testes dissected from at least three males in 500 µL of Hanks' solution. Put the sperm solution on ice, where it can keep its potency of fertilization for up to 2-3 h.",
    "Add 100 µL of sperm solution to denuded & matured oocytes on a Petri dish. Gently add the sperm solution among the eggs, and swirl the sperm and eggs together using a pipette tip.\nImmediately add 1 mL of E3 medium solution to activate the eggs and again gently swirl eggs and sperm using a pipette tip.\nAfter around 1 minute post-fertilization (mpf), flood the plate with E3 medium solution. Full chorion expansion can be observed within 10-15 mpf.\nBetween 35-45 mpf, select the embryos that are undergoing symmetrical cleavage into the 2-cell stage, and which are therefore fertilized. Remove embryos that are not undergoing cell cleavage.\nAllow embryos to develop in the Petri dish at 28 °C, with a limit of 80 embryos per 10 cm plate. View and photograph the embryo development.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
