    "NOTE: The protocol described here is designed for screening library plasmids contained in ten 96-well plates but can be scaled up or down accordingly. The protocol needs to be repeated to complete the whole library screening. Usually, screening against 10 plates of library genes each time can be comfortably handled by 1 person.\n1. Preparation for 96-well Yeast Transformation\nNOTE: This step is done as previously described7,10.\nAliquot 5 µL (about 50–100 ng) of plasmid DNA from an arrayed plasmid library into each well of a round-bottom 96-well plate.\n\tNOTE: An example of such a library would be a yeast gene overexpression library10.\nInoculate 150 mL of yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) media in a 500 mL flask with a colony (2–3 mm diameter) of the haploid yeast strain W303α. Incubate them overnight at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm).\nThe following morning, measure the OD600 of the overnight culture and dilute the yeast culture to OD600 = 0.1 in (up to) 2 L of YPD. Incubate it at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm) for ~5 h until the culture reaches OD600 = 0.4–0.6.\n2. Yeast Transformation\nHarvest the yeast culture by filling 8 sterile 250 mL centrifuge bottles and centrifuging them at room temperature at 3,000 x g for 10 min. Pour off the supernatant without disrupting the pellet.\n\tNOTE: Carry out all centrifugation steps at room temperature.\nWash the yeast with sterile-distilled H2O. For this, add 100 mL of sterile H2O to each centrifuge bottle and vortex it to resuspend the cell pellet. Combine the washed cells into 2 bottles and centrifuge them at 3,000 x g for 5 min. Pour off the supernatant.",
    "Wash the cells in each bottle in 100 mL of 0.1M LiOAc/1XTE (100 mM LiOAc; 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA) and centrifuge them at 3,000 x g for 5 min. Pour off the supernatant.\nWhile centrifuging, boil 5 mL of salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/mL) at 100 °C using a block heater for 3 min and then cool it on ice.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 25 mL of 0.1M LiOAc/1XTE in each bottle, combine the resuspended cells and transfer them to a 150 mL flask. Add 5 mL of the pre-cooled salmon sperm DNA and incubate it at 30 °C with shaking (225 rpm) for 30 min.\nPour the cell mixture into a sterile disposable reagent reservoir and, using a multichannel pipette, transfer 35 µL of the cell mixture to each well of the round-bottom 96-well plate containing the library plasmid DNA. Vortex the 96-well plates using a plate vortexer for 1 min at 1,000 rpm. Incubate the plates for 30 min at 30 °C without shaking.\n\tNOTE: Do not stack the plates, so the heat can transfer more efficiently. We have found that vortexing the 96-well plates at 1,000 rpm does not cause liquid to spill out of the wells, but a safe vortex speed should be tested before performing the step.\nIn a flask, prepare 200 mL of the transformation buffer containing a final concentration of 40% PEG3350, 10% DMSO, and 0.1M LiOAc. Prepare the transformation buffer immediately before use and mix it thoroughly by shaking.\nRemove 96-well plates from the 30 °C incubator and mix them for 30 s at 1,000 rpm using the plate vortexer. Add 125 µL of the transformation buffer to each well and then vortex the plates for 1 min at 1,000 rpm.",
    "Incubate the plates at 30 °C for 30 min and then heat shock the yeast by placing the plates in a 42 °C incubator for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Do not stack the plates.\nCentrifuge the plates for 5 min at 3,000 x g. Remove the transformation buffer from the wells by inverting the plates over a waste bin and forcefully dumping the buffer from the plates. Quickly blot the inverted plates on a clean paper towel to remove any liquid on the top of the plates.\nRinse the cells by adding to the plates 200 µL of minimal dropout medium corresponding to the selectable marker on the library plasmid.\n\tNOTE: We used a synthetic Ura- medium.\nCentrifuge the plates for 5 min at 3,000 x g and remove the supernatant over a waste bin as in step 2.10.\nAdd 160 µL of minimal Ura-medium containing 2% glucose. Vortex the plates for 1 min at 1,000 rpm and incubate them at 30 °C for 48 h without shaking. After 48 h, note that a pellet of transformed yeast is visible at the bottom of each well.\nUsing a liquid dispenser, add 100 µL of Ura-media containing glucose into each well of a new set of 96-well plates.\nVortex the plates containing the transformed yeast (from step 2.13) at 1,000 rpm for 30 s. Using a sterile plastic 96-pin replicator, place the pins into the wells containing the transformed yeast and then inoculate them into the corresponding wells of the new plates filled with media. Incubate the new plates at 30 °C for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: If working with 10 plates, the medium can also be dispensed manually using multi-channel pipettes.",
    "After 24 h, a pellet of yeast should be visible in the bottom of each well containing successfully transformed yeast. To save these yeast strains as glycerol stocks, add 50 µL of 50% glycerol to each well, vortex the plates for 30 s at 1,000 rpm, seal the plates with sealing tape and freeze them at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: The above steps only need to be performed once. Future screenings of different yeast models against the same library disposable reagent reservoir can start from the glycerol stocks and proceed immediately from the steps below.\n3. Mating Between Cells Containing Library Genes and Query Yeast\nTo revive the library strains from the glycerol stock, take the 96-well plates out of the -80 °C freezer, remove the sealing tape, and let the yeast thaw at room temperature for approximately 30 min.\nOnce the yeast has thawed, use a sterile plastic 96-pin replicator to inoculate the glycerol stocks to 160 µL of fresh Ura-media containing 2% glucose in 96-well plates and incubate them at 30 °C for 24 h. Immediately after the library strains are used, seal the plates with sealing tape, and return them to the -80 °C freezer.\nOn the same day the library strains (W303α) are thawed, inoculate the query yeast strain (here, FUS in W303a) to 50 mL of YPD and grow it overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm.\nThe next morning, pour the query yeast strain to a sterile disposable reagent reservoir, and aliquot 160 µL of the query strain to each well of a 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.\nUsing the liquid dispenser, dispense 160 µL of YPD media into each well of ten 96-well plates. Use these plates later for mating the query yeast strain with the library yeast.",
    "Briefly vortex the 96-well plate containing the query strain and then use a sterile 96-pin replicator to transfer the query strain to the YPD plates.\nBriefly vortex the library strain plates and, for each library strain plate, use a new sterile 96-pin replicator to transfer the library strains to the YPD plates that have been inoculated with the query strain.\n\tNOTE: Cells in glycerol lose their viability after multiple thaw-freeze cycles. Returning the library strains to the long-term storage (-80 °C freezer) as soon as possible will keep the library in good quality, and ready for future use. Properly maintained, the glycerol stock can be frozen and thawed at least 10 times. We also strongly recommend keeping a working copy and backup copies of the glycerol stock. When the working stock does not work, immediately make a new working copy from the backup copy.\nIncubate the YPD plates at 30 °C for 24 h. Note that a pellet of yeast will be visible in the bottom of each well after 24 h.\nFill 96-well plates with a minimal dropout medium containing 2% raffinose, corresponding to the selectable markers on the plasmid in the query strain as well as on the library plasmid (e.g., here Ura-His-).\nUse a sterile 96-pin replicator to transfer yeast from the YPD mating cultures to the selective media. Incubate the 96-well plates at 30 °C for 48 h; only yeast cells that have mated and formed diploid cells and, therefore, contain both the query plasmid and the library plasmid will be able to grow in this media. After 2 days, observe that a pellet is visible on the bottom of the wells.\n4. Spotting Assay\nAfter 48 h of growth in the raffinose-containing selective media, spot the yeast on agar plates.",
    "Prepare 2 sets of Ura-His- dropout plates containing 2% agar using clear polystyrene plates, one containing 2% galactose and the other containing 2% glucose.\nVortex the 96-well plates for 1 min at 1,000 rpm, then spot the yeast to the Ura-His- dropout plates containing 2% galactose and 2% agar (FUS and library genes are induced) and to the Ura-His- dropout plates containing 2% glucose and 2% agar (FUS and library genes repressed) using a robotic spotting machine, by which the culture in each well is spotted onto the agar plates in quadruplicate (i.e., the culture in 1 well is spotted to 4 spots on the agar plate).\nAfter spotting, let the agar plates dry, and then place them upside down in a 30 °C incubator. Photograph the agar plates every 24 h to record a faster/more yeast growth in which the toxicity to the query strain is rescued or to record a slower/less growth in which the toxicity to the query strain is exacerbated. Incubate the plates for 4 days.\n\t\tNOTE: The culture in each well can be spotted on agar plates 1-to-1, as shown in a previous transformation-based method10. However, the 1-to-4 spotting here (which can be conveniently set up using the robotic spotting machine) significantly increases the robustness of the assay by reducing the number of false positives. Positive hits are only considered when all 4 colonies from the same well show a similar phenotype.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
