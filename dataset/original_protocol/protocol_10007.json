    "1.General hCMEC/D3 cell culture\nResuscitation of frozen cells\n\tNOTE: All cell culture maintenance and experiments were performed inside a sterile biosafety hood. Culture media, supplements and reagents were either purchased as sterile products or sterilized via filtration using a 0.22 µm membrane filter to prevent microbial contamination.\n\t\nAdd 8.5 mL of collagen solution (0.15mg/mL) in a tissue culture flask (75 cm2 growth area; referred henceforth as T75) and place it in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 1 h.\nRemove the collagen solution and gently wash the flask with sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Add 15 mL of complete growth medium to the flask and leave in the CO2 incubator for 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The complete medium (final concentration) contained Endothelial Cell Growth Basal Medium-2 (500 mL) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (5%), penicillin-streptomycin (1%), hydrocortisone (1.4 µM), acid ascorbic (5 µg/mL), chemically defined lipid concentrate (1/100), HEPES (10 mM) and basic fibroblast growth factor (1 ng/mL).\nMove a cryovial of frozen hCMEC/D3 cells from the liquid nitrogen tank and rapidly thaw the vial in a 37 °C water bath (< 1 min).\nOnce only a tiny flake of ice is visible, quickly aspirate and transfer the cells to the flask containing pre-warmed medium. Gently shake the flask to allow mixing of the cells with the growth medium.\nPlace the flask in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) and observe the cells under a light microscope after 2 h to make sure that the cells are attached.\nOnce the cells attach to the bottom of flask, remove the old growth medium and add 10 mL of fresh pre-warmed growth medium to replace dimethylsulfoxide in the old growth medium24.",
    "After 24 h, check under a light microscope to observe spindle-shaped cells and replace the old growth medium with pre-warmed fresh growth medium.\nCell culture maintenance\nReplenish the growth medium every other day until 100% confluence. Check the cells under the microscope before removing the old growth medium and also after adding fresh growth medium. Take out the flask from the incubator and examine hCMEC/D3 cells under phase contrast microscope to ensure they appear healthy.\n\t\tNOTE: The majority of cells should be attached to the bottom of the flask, have a spindle-shaped morphology and often times, light refracting around their membranes is also seen. Growth medium should be transparent (non-cloudy) and pinkish-orange in color.\nRemove old growth medium from the flask and transfer 10 mL of pre-warmed fresh medium into the flask.\n\t\tNOTE: The medium should be added to the top side of the flask and not directly on the surface of the cells to avoid affecting cell attachment.\nTurn the flask back into horizontal position and gently rock it several times and check hCMEC/D3 cells under the microscope before returning the flask to the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nObserve the cells under an inverted light microscope each time before and after handling the cells, both during regular culture work and during experiments. Record any noticeable changes in cell number or morphology in the laboratory notebook.\nCell passaging\nIncubate a new T75 flask with 8.5 mL of collagen solution for 1 h in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nRemove the collagen solution and gently wash the flask with sterilized PBS. Add 10 mL of pre-warmed hCMEC/D3 medium to the new flask and place the flask in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).",
    "Take out the flask from the incubator and examine hCMEC/D3 cells under a phase contrast microscope to check if the cells are 100% confluent.\nRemove hCMEC/D3 cell medium from the flask containing cells and wash hCMEC/D3 cells with 10 mL of PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: FBS added to growth medium contains protease inhibitors such as α1-antitrypsin and α2-macroglobulin. These inhibit the trypsinization process. Thus, it is essential to wash the cells with PBS to remove traces of FBS to prevent the inhibition of the trypsinization process.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin solution containing 0.02% EDTA and trypsinize for 2-5 min in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) (tap the flask gently on the sides to help detachment).\n\t\tNOTE: Never leave the cells on trypsin/EDTA for more than 6 min.\nAdd 10 mL of pre-warmed hCMEC/D3 medium to stop the trypsinization process and resuspend hCMEC/D3 cell by pipetting up and down several times. Then, remove the entire cell suspension from the flask into a 15 mL tube.\nTransfer 1 mL of the cell suspension from the 15 mL tube to the new flask with pre-warmed fresh medium (splitting cells 1:10) and return the new flask back to the incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Before transferring to the new flask, pipette the cell suspension up and down several times to minimize cell concentration gradients.\n2. Cell plating\nPlace tissue culture inserts with microporous membranes (pore size: 0.4 µm, material: polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) into a 24-well culture plate.\nAdd 400 µL of collagen type I (0.15 mg/mL) in each tissue culture insert and incubate for 1 h in the CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Rock the 24-well plate gently to allow even spreading of the collagen solution over the microporous membrane in the tissue culture inserts.",
    "Remove the collagen solution and gently wash the microporous membrane with 0.4 mL of 1x PBS buffer.\nPlate hCMEC/D3 cells with the density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in the cell inserts (15,000 cells in 500 µL of medium).\n\tNOTE: In order to minimize the differences in cell number in each tissue culture insert, the cell suspension was resuspended with a 10 mL pipette before adding cells to the inserts.\nPlace the 24-well plate with tissue culture setup in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) to allow cell attachment and proliferation.\nIncubate the plate for 7 days to allow the cells to reach 100% confluency. Remove the growth medium every other day and transfer 0.5 mL of pre-warmed fresh media into tissue culture inserts.\nRepeat the plating procedure (steps 2.2-2.6) on a 12-well plate, 48-well plate and 96-well plate. Use the 12-well plate for Western blotting to determine changes in ZO-1 expression. Use the 48-well plate for DNA NP transfection. Use the 96-well plate for the ATP assay to determine cell viability in transfected cells.\n3. Kinetics of cell growth.\nSeed the cells at a density of 50,000 cell/cm2 in a collagen-coated 24-well tissue culture plate.\nOn each day of the experiment, remove the growth medium and gently wash the cells twice with 500 µL of 1x PBS. Then, add 30 µL of 0.25% trypsin solution containing 0.02% EDTA and leave the plate for about 2-5 min in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\n\tNOTE: Gradual formation of confluent monolayer may affect the extent of cell detachment and it is necessary to increase the volumes of trypsin/EDTA as indicated here: 30 µL for 1-5 days post-seeding, 60 µL for 6-7 days post-seeding and 100 µL for 8-10 days post-seeding.",
    "Add either 470 µL, 440 µL or 400 µL of growth medium based on the volume of trypsin/EDTA solution added in the step 3.2 to prepare 500 µL of cell suspension in each well.\nSuspend the cells by pipetting up and down in each well several times and observe the cells under a microscope to make sure all cells are suspended in the growth medium. If some cells are still attached to the plate bottom after pipetting several times, gently scrape the cells using a plastic cell scraper to facilitate cell detachment.\nRemove 0.1 mL of cell suspension from 500 µL cell suspension in step 3.3 and add to a 1.5 mL tube. Then, add 0.1 mL of 0.4% Trypan blue solution to the cell suspension and mix well.\nClean a hemacytometer with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Add 20 µL of mixture from step 3.5 on each side in the V-groove and locate the 16 squares under the microscope. The 16 squares are considered as one grid. Locate two random grids on each side of the hemacytometer and count all the living, non-blue cells.\n\tNOTE: Cells that appeared blue in color from excluded from counting, <1% of the cells stained blue at all time points.\nCalculate the cell density (cells/cm2) based on following formulas.\n\tAverage # of cells/grid = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58900/58900eq1.jpg  (Eq.1)\n\tDilution Factor=  imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58900/58900eq2.jpg (Eq.2)\n\tCell density (viable cells/cm2) =\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58900/58900eq3.jpg\n\t(Eq.3)",
    "Equations 1-3. Viable cells are the number of cells counted in each grid, number of grids correspond to the number of grids located under the microscope, Volume of mixture of cell suspension and 0.4% Trypan blue is the volume prepared in step 3.5, volume of cell suspension removed is the volume removed from 500 µL cell suspension in step 3.5, the volume of cell suspension in each well is the 500 µL cell suspension from step 3.3, growth area of tissue culture plate is the growth area of single well in 24-well plate.\n4. Lucifer yellow apparent permeability (LY P app ) assay\nFor determining LY Papp on each day post-seeding, follow steps starting 4.3. For determining the Papp in transfected hCMEC/D3 cells, add 8.3 µL of the transfection formulation (Figure 1) mixed with 50 µL of complete growth medium and incubate for 4 h. Transfection formulations are described in section 5.\nAfter the 4 h transfection, gently wash the apical side twice using sterile 1x PBS buffer to remove any residual transfection mixture. Varying volumes of PBS buffer left behind after removal can affect the concentration of LY in the apical side. Take care to ensure that residual PBS buffer in tissue culture inserts is completely removed. Carefully aspirate residual reagents and medium to minimize cell detachment.\n\tNOTE: This step is skipped when measuring every-day apparent permeability (Papp) of hCMEC/D3 cells.\nRemove the growth medium and add 1.5 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) transport buffer (25 mM HEPES, 145 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM glucose, pH 7.4) to the basolateral side.\n\tNOTE: The volume of transport buffer in all basolateral compartments should be equal to ensure accuracy of permeability coefficient calculation.",
    "Add 58.3 µL of 20 µM LY solution to the apical side of each transwell insert. Save 50 µL of the 20 µM LY solution for fluorescence measurements. After removing residual PBS buffer from apical side completely, add LY solution as quick as possible to avoid drying hCMEC/D3 cells. Ensure accurate volumes of LY solution in the apical side.\n\tNOTE: To minimize the decay of LY fluorescence intensity, light exposure should be limited. Once the LY powder is reconstituted, the solution should be stored at 4 °C, protected from light.\nIncubate in a rotary plate shaker (37 °C, 100 rpm) for 60 min. Then, remove 30 µL of the LY sample from each apical compartment. Then transfer the 20 µM LY solution and the apical side samples to pre-labeled tubes and dilute the sample 10-fold using transport buffer.\n\tNOTE: It is required to dilute the 20 µM LY stock solution and the apical side samples because the high fluorescence intensity of these samples may potentially overload and damage the fluorescence detector of the fluorescence microplate reader.\nRemove 500 µL from each basolateral compartment and transfer the sample to pre-labeled tubes.\n\tNOTE: Samples are removed from separate transwell at indicated time points. The time points are each day post-seeding starting on day 1 until day 10.\nPrepare a series of LY standards for the standard curve (39.00 nM, 78.13 nM, 156.25 nM, 312 nM, 625 nM, 1250 nM, 2500 nM).\nAdd 100 µL of each standard (in duplicate), apical and basolateral sample to each well in a black 96-well plate (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Black plates absorb light and reduce background and fluorescence crossover among wells.",
    "Use a fluorescence microplate reader (set points: excitation 428 nm, emission 536 nm) to measure the LY fluorescence intensity to calculate the Papp. A fluorescence plate reader is used for this study.\nCalculate the Papp and %LY recovery values as described in the manuscript text.\nEquation 4.

This experiment was always done using cells under passage number 35 and was conducted four independent times.\n5. Calcium depletion\nRemove the growth medium from the transwell inserts and 12-well plate and gently wash the apical side and 12-well plate using pre-warmed calcium-free medium (Minimum Essential Medium Eagle Spinner (S-MEM) medium) to remove calcium ions from the transwell inserts and 12-well plate.",
    "Add 500 µL or 2 mL of pre-warmed S-MEM 1xmedium to the inserts or 12-well plate and incubate for 24 h in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). After incubation, remove the S-MEM 1x medium and wash the cells once using pre-warmed 1x PBS buffer.\nFollow steps 4.4-4.10 described in section 4 for LY treatment and subsequent steps. Follow steps 8.1.2-8.2.4 described in section 8 for Western blotting and subsequent steps.\n6. Transfection\nPreparation of DNA nanoparticles (DNA NPs).\nDilute the stock solution of gWIZ-Luc plasmid in 10 mM sodium acetate (NaAc) buffer (pH 5.0) and allow the DNA solution to stand for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\n\t\tNOTE: The DNA NP containing predominantly single DNA molecules can be prepared at DNA concentrations 20-40 µg/mL23. Thus, gWIZ-Luc plasmid stock solution needs to be diluted. The frozen gWIZ-Luc plasmid stock needs to be thawed completely on ice to minimize temperature stress. Gently vortex the diluted DNA stock solution for 30 s on a standard benchtop vortexer set at knob position 3-5.\nCalculate the desired N/P ratios, used here as a numerical parameter to reflect NP composition.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58900/58900eq7.jpg",
    "Equation 6. N/P ratio calculation: the ratio of moles of the amine groups of cationic polymers to those of the phosphate groups of DNA. Mass of cationic polymers means total weighed amount of cationic polymer; (Mass/Charge)cationic polymers refers to the molecular weight of cationic polymer (poly (ethyleneglycol)5k-block-polyaspartamide with 48 diethylenetriamine side chains (PEG-DET)) normalized to the number of charged primary amines (48) per cationic polymer (mol/mol), this value for our polymer is 306 Da; Mass of DNA means total amount of DNA used in the formulation obtained by multiplying the volume and concentration in mg/mL; (Mass/Charge)DNA refers to the molecular weight of DNA normalized to number of phosphate group per double-stranded DNA (325 Da per nucleobase).\n\t\tNOTE: The DNA NP preparation table (Table 1) contains the formulation recipe for the different samples tested in our experiments. DNA NP were prepared using a rapid titration technique. The PEG-DET polymer solution was added along the walls of the tube while holding the tube in a horizontal position. Then the tube was switched to a vertical position, followed by quickly vortexing at maximum speed for 10s. The DNA NP were allowed to stand for 30 min at RT prior to use. The rule-of-thumb for DNA NP dosing is 0.5 µg DNA for ca. 1 cm2 growth area. So, for each transwell insert/each well in a 48-well plate/each well in a 96-well plate, prepare DNA NP at N/P 10 containing 0.157/0.5/0.195 µg/well of gWIZ-Luc DNA.\nFor samples containing indicated concentration of Poloxamer P84 (P84), add P84 to DNA NP and vortex for 5 s. The final concentration of P84 in each sample is either 0.01% or 0.03% wt.\nDNA NP transfection in a 48-well plate setup",
    "Seed the cells with the density of 50,000 cell/cm2 in a 48 well plate and grow until confluence in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nFor each treatment group, mix 25 µL of the indicated sample (transfection formulation) and 150 µL of complete growth medium and 175 µL of this mixture to each well.\nObserve the hCMEC/D3 cells under a microscope to ensure the cells appear healthy and are 100% confluent at the time of the experiment.\nRemove the growth medium from wells and 175 µL transfection mixture to each well. Then, incubate the plate for 4 h in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nAfter 4 h, remove the transfection mixture and wash the hCMEC/D3 cells with pre-warmed sterile 1x PBS buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: To minimize the accidental detachment of hCMEC/D3 cells from the plate/insert surface during the washing steps, carefully pipette enough sterile PBS along the walls of the wells and remove any nanoparticles in the residual culture media.\nGently rock the plate a few times and carefully aspirate and discard the PBS wash and add 500 µL of hCMEC/D3 pre-warmed culture medium.\nMicroscopically examine the cells and record observations on cell morphology and any possible effects of transfection.\nIncubate for 24 h in the 37 °C cell culture incubator to allow luciferase production.

Luminescent ATP assay\nSeed the cells with the density of 50,000 cell/cm2 in a 96 well plate and grow until confluence in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nTransfect the cells with 9.7 µL of the transfection formulation (preparation details are in section 6) and 58.4 µL of complete growth medium for 4 h.\nRemove the transfection mixture and gently wash the cells with pre-warmed PBS 1x buffer twice to remove the treatment reagents completely.\n\tNOTE: Different volumes of residual buffer could dilute the ATP assay reagents to different extent and can potentially affect the data.\nMix 75 µL of fresh pre-warmed medium and ATP assay reagent in a 1:1 dilution using a multichannel pipette. Make sure that the liquid level in all the multichannel pipette tips is the same.\nPlace the plate on a nutating shaker for 15 min at room temperature. After 15 min of adding the reagents, transfer 60 µL of each sample into a white 96-well plate.\n\tNOTE: White plates are better to reflect output light than clear or black plates.\nPop any air bubbles using a needle prior to reading the plate. Read the plate on a luminometer with a 1 s integration time. Read the plate within 20 min after adding of ATP assay reagents. Timing is critical for comparison across different plates, because the luminescence signal is transient with a fast decay rate.",

Western blotting for measurement of tight junction protein ZO-1\nCell lysis and protein extraction\n\tNOTE: All the steps for protein extraction from cells must be carried out at 2-8 °C.\n\t\nSeed the cells at a density of 50,000 cell/cm2 in a collagen-coated 12-well tissue culture plate.\nOn day 3, day 5, day 7, day 10 post-seeding and on day 7 (cells pre-incubated with calcium free medium), remove the growth medium and gently wash the cells twice with 2 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS. Then, add 300 µL mixture of ice-cold 1x RIPA lysis buffer containing 3 µg/mL aprotinin in each well.\n\t\tNOTE: The mixture should be freshly made and kept on ice. Aprotinin is used to inhibit proteases present in lysates from degrading the protein of interest.\nAfter two freeze-thaw cycles (-80 °C), scrape the cells using a cold plastic cell scraper. Collect the cell lysates in microfuge tubes. Then, centrifuge the tubes at 200 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant into clean tubes and place them on ice.

Use 70% isopropanol-washed plastic forceps to handle the membrane. In order to successfully transfer the ZO-1 protein (MW 200 kDa) to the membrane, pH should be around 8.3-8.5. If the transfer buffer is more acidic than that, transfer would not happen. If the ladder bands are visible still on the gel, it would be helpful to increase transfer time and SDS concentration.\nAfter washing the membrane by using Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%Tween 20 (T-TBS), use blocking solution (1:1 LiCOR-Odyssey Block: 1x Tris buffered saline) to block the membranes for 60 min.\nCarefully cut the membrane into two strips. Incubate with two primary antibodies (ZO-1 monoclonal antibody, dilution, 1: 900, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody, dilution, 1: 10,000) overnight at 4 °C. Then, incubate the ZO-1 and GAPDH membranes with donkey anti-mouse IgG (dilution, 1:50,000).
