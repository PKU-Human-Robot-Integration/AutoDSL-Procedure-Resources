    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nParallel CAR vector design\nTiming: 3–7 days depending upon the method used to generate the required DNA fragment for cloning\nThis protocol outlines the cloning strategy used to insert one or more transgenes into the SFG γ-retroviral vector.\nNote: All constructs described in this manuscript are expressed using the SFG γ-retroviral vector (Rivière et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The transgene(s) start codon coincides with the start codon of the endogenous env gene and expression is driven by the viral long-terminal repeat (LTR). In constructs containing more than one transgene (e.g., pCAR-A/T, Trunc. CCR in pCAR, Trunc. CAR in pCAR and Trunc CAR & CCR in pCAR), a sequence encoding a furin cleavage site (RRKR), short serine glycine linker ([SG]2) and an intervening ribosomal 2A skip peptide from the Thosea Asigna plant virus (T2A) (Szymczak et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) was placed between the two coding sequences.\nAlternatives: As an alternative to the steps described below, double stranded synthetic DNA fragments encoding the transgene to be cloned can be ordered from commercial suppliers, such as Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT – gBlockTM) or Genscript Inc, or they may be generated by overlap extension PCR or HiFi assembly (Xiong et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). It is advisable to codon optimize sequences using Gene Designer software for expression in the appropriate species. Alternatively, if the transgene is flanked by the appropriate restriction sites, it can be cloned directly from a donor plasmid. This approach is detailed for the generation of the pCAR-A/T and Trunc. CAR in pCAR constructs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) in the step-by-step protocol provided below.\nLinearise the SFG plasmids containing the 2G-A (CD28) and 2G-A (CD28 trunc.) constructs (Whilding et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) with NcoI as detailed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1671-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(1) Sequence of the A20 peptide which binds with high affinity to αvβ6 integrin. In the scrambled peptide control, the key RDGL motif within A20 has been mutated to AAAA, thereby abrogating affinity for αvβ6 integrin. (2) The A20 peptide has been introduced into a conventional CD28-containing 2G CAR to confer specificity for αvβ6 integrin (2G-A (CD28)). The scrambled peptide has been used to construct a control CAR that lacks specificity for αvβ6 integrin (2G-Scrambled (CD28)). An endodomain truncated control has also been constructed to abrogate CAR signaling capacity (2G-A (CD28 trunc.)). (3) The 2G-A(CD28) CAR has been converted to a pCAR designated pCAR-A/T by co-expression of a CCR in which the pan-ErbB-specific T1E peptide is coupled via a CD8α spacer and transmembrane domain to a 4-1BB endodomain. Controls have also been engineered in which the CAR or CCR endodomains have been truncated to abrogate signaling capacity (Trunc. CCR in pCAR, Trunc. CAR in pCAR and Trunc. CAR & CCR in pCAR). Note that all CARs contain an embedded MYC epitope tag within the CD28 spacer region to facilitate their detection by flow cytometry.

    "For the 2G-A (CD28) and 2G-A (CD28 trunc.) plasmids only, dephosphorylate the 5′ ends of the linearized plasmid to avoid self-annealing of the SFG backbone. Add 2.5 μL Quick CIP, mix well and incubate for an additional 10 min at 37°C. Do not de-phosphorylate the digested pCAR-H/T reaction as this will prevent subsequent ligation to the linearized 2G-A (CD28)/2G-A (CD28 trunc.).\nHeat inactivate the NcoI and Quick CIP simultaneously by incubating at 80°C for 20 min.\nAdd 10 μL of 6× DNA loading dye to each 50 μL reaction and mix well.\nLoad each reaction onto a 1% agarose gel containing SYBR Safe, which is used to stain digested DNA bands. Also load a 1 kB DNA ladder to allow assessment of fragment sizes in the gel.\nRun the gel at 100 V until a suitable separation between the required bands has been achieved.\nVisualize the bands on an UV transilluminator and carefully cut around the required bands using a scalpel.\nNote: For the pCAR-H/T, the required TBB_T2A band should be 654 bp in size. The linearized 2G-A (CD28) and 2G-A (CD28 trunc.) bands may appear slightly bigger than the expected size of 7174 bp and 6724 bp, respectively, due to the lack of supercoiling.\nCritical: Minimize UV exposure to avoid DNA damage during fragment excision.\nRecover the DNA fragments from the agarose gel using the Monarch DNA Gel extraction kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions, ideally eluting the DNA in 10 μL elution buffer: https://international.neb.com/products/t1020-monarch-dna-gel-extraction-kit#Protocols,%20Manuals%20&%20Usage[href=https://international.neb.com/products/t1020-monarch-dna-gel-extraction-kit#Protocols,%20Manuals%20&%20Usage].

Snap cap tube lids should be kept loose to allow sufficient oxygenation of the culture.\nNote: Typically, we collect 6 colonies since this number provides a high likelihood of identifying a clone that yields the correct insert.\nIsolate the plasmid DNA from the E.coli using the Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions: https://international.neb.com/products/t1010-monarch-plasmid-miniprep-kit#Protocols,%20Manuals%20&%20Usage[href=https://international.neb.com/products/t1010-monarch-plasmid-miniprep-kit#Protocols,%20Manuals%20&%20Usage]. Accessed 27Th December 2021.\nUndertake a diagnostic restriction digest aimed at confirming the successful insertion of the TBB_T2A fragment. As the TBB_T2A fragment is flanked by overhanging NcoI ends and can thus anneal in either orientation, select restriction enzymes that allow the orientation of the insert to be ascertained.\nNote: Steps 12–14 can be replaced by undertaking a colony PCR on selected colonies. Design primers to amplify over a ligation junction.",
    "Note: To determine the importance of signaling through the CCR for the improved function of pCAR T cells compared to 2G CAR T cells, two additional controls were generated, namely Trunc. CCR in pCAR and Trunc. CAR & Trunc. CCR in pCAR. To achieve this a codon-optimized (Gene Designer) double stranded DNA fragment encoding the CSF1R signal peptide, the T1E peptide, amino acids 137–206 of CD8α, a furin cleavage site, [SG]2 linker, T2A ribosomal skip peptide, the IL-4 receptor signal peptide, the A20FMDV peptide (shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (Whilding et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and an [A]3 linker was synthesized (IDT) with a 5′ NcoI restriction site and a 3′ NotI restriction site. This fragment was cloned using NcoI-NotI into 2G-A (CD28) and 2G-A (CD28 trunc.), to give Trunc. CCR in pCAR and Trunc. CAR & Trunc. CCR in pCAR respectively (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Predicted structures of CARs, pCARs and controls used in this protocol together with a schematic of accompanying SFG retroviral vectors are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nProducing transient retrovirus\nTiming: 5 days\nThe step of transfection allows the introduction of plasmid DNA into eukaryotic cells. This protocol uses GeneJuice® Transfection Reagent, a non-liposomal formulation, to introduce DNA into HEK293T cells. This method results in transient expression of the vector genome and the critical proteins (gag, pro, pol and env) required for the production of functional, yet replication incompetent, retroviral particles (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1671-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Workflow of retrovirus production\n(1) Seed HEK293T cells. (2) Transfection. (3) (Optional) Replace medium if a toxic transfection reagent was used. (4) Aspirate 48 h viral supernatant and store at 4°C for 18 h. Replenish medium. (5) Aspirate 72 h viral supernatant and pool with 48 h viral harvest. (6) Prepare 1.5 mL aliquots of viral supernatant and snap freeze. Store at −80°C.",
    "Alternatives: There are other protocols available to efficiently produce retroviral particles that contain the transgene(s) of interest. Should such methods already be established in the users’ laboratory, these can be used as a suitable alternative method.\nAt least four days before the transfection:\nThaw a vial of HEK293T cells for 2 min in the water bath at 37°C.\nTransfer the contents of the tube to 9 mL of D10 medium (pre-warmed in a 37°C water bath) and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of D10 medium (pre-warmed in a 37°C water bath), and transfer to a 75 cm3 culture flask.\nIncubate at 37°C & 5% CO2.\nIf there are significant numbers of dead cells present, gently replace the medium after 24 h with 10 mL of fresh D10 medium (pre-warmed in a 37°C water bath).\nCells should be ready for passage in 2–3 days. Passage cells when at 80% confluence using the following steps.\nRemove and discard culture medium from HEK293T cells.\nRinse the 75 cm3 flask with 5 mL PBS to remove residual serum and discard.\nAdd 3 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate at 37°C & 5% CO2 for 5–15 min.\nConfirm the cell layer has detached by looking at the cells under an inverted microscope.\nAdd 7 mL D10 medium to inactivate the trypsin.\nCells are split to a 1:10 ratio. Add 1 mL of the trypsinized cells to 9 mL fresh D10 in a new 75 cm3 culture flask.\nNote: Transfection can also be performed with HEK293T cells already in culture. However low passage number HEK293T cells more reliably produce higher viral titers following transfection. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].",
    "Note: HEK293T cells detach very easily meaning that procedures such as medium exchange must be carried out very gently.\nOne day prior to transfection, seed HEK293T cells into 10 cm2 tissue culture treated dishes.\nRemove and discard culture medium from HEK293T cells.\nRinse the 75 cm3 flask with 5 mL PBS to remove residual serum and discard.\nAdd 3 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate at 37°C & 5% CO2 for 5–15 min.\nConfirm the cell layer has detached by looking at the cells under an inverted microscope.\nAdd 5 mL of I10 medium (IMDM + 2 mM L-glutamine + 10% fetal bovine serum) and count the cells using trypan blue and a hemocytometer.\nRe-suspend cells to a final concentration of 1.5 × 105/mL in I10 medium.\nAdd 11 mL of cell suspension to each 10 cm2 culture dish (1.65 × 106 cells per dish).\nGently rock the dishes from side to side to aid even distribution of cells.\nPlace dishes in an incubator at 37°C & 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nNote: Each 10 cm2 culture dish will produce 22 mL viral supernatant, which is enough to transduce 4 million T cells.\nOn the day of transfection, prepare as described below for each 10 cm3 dish of HEK293T cells.\nMix 470 μL serum-free IMDM medium with 30 μL GeneJuice® in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube. GeneJuice® is a nonlipid-based transfection reagent which exhibits low levels of cytotoxicity on a wide variety of cell types.\nPipette up and down and incubate at room temperature (approximately 20°C–22°C) for 5 min.\nAdd 4.6875 μg PeqPam3 plasmid, 3.125 μg RDF plasmid and 4.6875 μg of the appropriate retroviral vector plasmid.\nMix gently using pipette and incubate for 15 min at room temperature (approximately 20°C–22°C) (do not vortex).",
    "Add total volume dropwise to the HEK293T plate and swirl contents to thoroughly mix.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C & 5% CO2 for 48 h.\nOptional: If using alternative transfection reagents that are toxic to HEK293T cells (e.g., FuGene or PEI), change medium on HEK293T cells 24 h after transfection by adding 11 mL of fresh I10 medium pre-warmed to 37°C.\n48 h after transfection:\nLabel a 50 mL Falcon tube for each transfected dish of HEK293T cells.\nPlace Falcon tubes on ice for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant from HEK293T cells and place into the pre-chilled 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nReplenish 11 mL of I10 medium (pre-warmed to 37°C) to each dish and return to the incubator.\nStore the Falcon tubes containing 48 h supernatant in a 4°C refrigerator for 24 h (to be pooled with 72 h tube).\nNote: Since replication-defective retrovirus is present in these supernatants, they should be handled at the appropriate biosafety level (containment level 2 in our Institution).\n72 h after transfection:\nTo enable snap freezing of retroviral vector-containing supernatant, prepare an ethanol bath by adding 100% ethanol into a rubber container containing a tube rack until the rack is submerged. Add dry ice to the bath until level with the ethanol.\nRemove 72-h supernatant from HEK293T cells and combine with 48-h supernatant on ice, filter using a 0.45 μm sterile filter (optional – please see below).\nPrepare 1.5 mL aliquots of supernatant into labeled tubes and put into the ethanol bath rack until completely frozen.\nTransfer tubes to −80°C storage as soon as possible once frozen.\nNote: Viral supernatant can be used fresh from harvest to transduce T cells.",
    "Critical: The 0.45 μm sterile filter will remove any HEK293T cells which may have detached during the supernatant harvest step. This step is critical if fresh viral supernatant is used for transduction. However, it may be omitted if virus is snap frozen since HEK293T cells will not survive this step.\nNote: If snap-freezing virus, it is imperative to label the tubes using printed labels. The ethanol in the freezing mix will dissolve any labeling written in permanent marker.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation and activation\nTiming: 3 h\nThis method results in the generation of activated T cells that are suitable for retroviral transduction (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1671-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Workflow for isolation and activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\n(1) Peripheral blood withdrawal. (2–4) Transfer blood onto Ficoll-Paque containing Falcon tubes for density gradient centrifugation. (5) Isolation of PBMC layer. (6–7) Washing of pooled PBMCs. (8) Activation of PBMCs using phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-L.\nPeripheral blood is acquired by a trained phlebotomist or clinician from healthy consenting donors into 9 mL lithium heparin-coated vacuette tubes.\nUse the following equation to determine the volume of blood needed:\n  Volume  of   blood   ( mL )  = (   Number  of  activated  PBMCs  required  at  transduction  step   1 ×  10 6   PBMCs/mL  blood   ) × 2  \nNote: This assumes an average density of 1 × 106 PBMCs per mL of blood and accounts for a contingency of a 50% reduction in PBMCs number between the activation and transduction steps.\nNote: All steps following the blood draw are performed in a laminar flow hood using aseptic technique.\nPool blood from 9 mL vacuette tubes into 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nWash each vacuette tube with 5 mL sterile PBS and add to the pooled blood.",
    "Aliquot 15 mL Ficoll-Paque PLUS into 50 mL Falcon tubes (1 Falcon tube per 35 mL whole blood).\nHold the Ficoll-Paque Plus tube as close to horizontal as possible and layer 30 mL of PBS-diluted whole blood on top using a pipette aid and a 25 mL stripette.\nNote: Whilst layering the blood, slowly reduce the angle of the Falcon tube until it is upright.\nRepeat step 24 until all whole blood is used.\nNote: Use pipette aid on lowest speed setting to layer whole blood onto the Ficoll-Paque PLUS to prevent the blood and Ficoll from mixing.\nCentrifuge all tubes at 800 × g for 35 min with brake and acceleration both set to zero.\nUsing a Pasteur pipette, carefully remove the PBMC layer from the Falcon tubes and transfer into a fresh 50 mL Falcon tube.\nNote: Using a Pasteur pipette rather than a Gilson pipette decreases the risk of mixing layers.\nCritical: take care not to draw up Ficoll-Paque PLUS when removing the PBMC layer. Excessive Ficoll will prevent cells from pelleting during subsequent centrifugation.\nAdd sterile PBS to a final volume of 50 mL per Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 10 min at room temperature (approximately 20°C–22°C).\nRemove supernatant, being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nAdd 1 mL PBS to each pellet, re-suspend, and combine in a single fresh 50 mL Falcon tube.\nWash all tubes with 5 mL sterile PBS and combine with the previously harvested PBMCs to maximize retrieval of cells.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 10 min at room temperature (approximately 20°C–22°C).\nAspirate PBS, being careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nRe-suspend cell pellet in 10 mL R5 medium (RPMI + 2 mM L-glutamine + 5% human male AB serum).",
    "Mix 10 μL PBMC suspension with 10 μL trypan blue and count using a hemocytometer.\nDilute PBMCs using R5 medium to achieve a final concentration of 3 × 106 cells/mL.\nSeed cells into tissue culture-treated 6 well plates containing 4 mL per well.\nAdd phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-L to T cells to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL and mix well.\nNote: Numbers of PBMC between 3 – 100 million can be routinely activated in this manner. However, for scalable manufacture with a view to clinical application, alternative culture vessels and activation stimuli should be used (van Schalkwyk et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nIncubate at 37°C & 5% CO2 for 48 h.\nDo not add or change medium over this period since some T cell loss typically occurs and medium is conditioned with cytokines derived from activated T cells.\nAfter 24 h, add 100 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2 to activated PBMCs.\nOptional: Prior to activation, T cells can be isolated from the PBMC population (for example in the event of leukemic cell contamination). Count the cells from the PBMC fraction and proceed according to the manufacturer’s protocol: (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/pan-t-cell-isolation-kit-human.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/pan-t-cell-isolation-kit-human.html#gref], accessed December 23rd, 2021).\nNote: Phytohemagglutinin works best when antigen presenting cells are present. Consequently, when dealing with purified T cells, it is recommended to use a T cell specific activation stimulus such as CD3/CD28 Human T-Activator DynabeadsTM (manufacturer’s protocol: https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/references/protocols/proteins-expression-isolation-and-analysis/t-cell-activation-and-expansion/dynabeads-human-t-activator-cd3-cd28.html#prot2[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/references/protocols/proteins-expression-isolation-and-analysis/t-cell-activation-and-expansion/dynabeads-human-t-activator-cd3-cd28.html#prot2], accessed December 18th, 2021.

Incubate for 72 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\n24 h before transduction:\nAdd 200 μL RetroNectin® (1 mg/mL stock solution) to 18 mL sterile PBS in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nUsing a Pasteur pipette, aliquot 3 mL into each well of a non-tissue culture-treated 6 well plate.\nWrap the 6 well plate in Saran Wrap and store for 18 h in a refrigerator at 4°C.\nNote: Optimally, 1 million activated PBMC are transduced in each well of the RetroNectin®-coated 6 well plate. Calculate how many wells are needed for each construct to be transduced.\nCritical: RetroNectin® can stick to certain plastics. Use polypropylene Pasteur pipettes to minimize protein loss during reagent preparation.\nOn the day of transduction:\nRapidly thaw 1.5 mL aliquots of viral supernatant in a 37°C water bath for the constructs of choice.\nNote: A total of 4.5 mL viral supernatant is required per 1 × 106 T cells to be transduced, of which 1.5 mL will be used to pre-load the appropriate well of the RetroNectin®-coated 6 well plate. For routine experimental work using transiently produced viral vector, titer is not determined. This is because of the relatively small volumes of virus produced and the fact that titers typically lie between 4 × 105–1.0 × 106 viral particles per mL. This ensures a typical multiplicity of infection of between 1.8 – 4.5.\nSpray cryovials containing viral supernatant with 70% ethanol and transfer into a laminar flow hood.\nPre-load the RetroNectin®-coated 6 well plate with viral vector by removal of RetroNectin® from each individual well and prompt addition (to avoid drying) of 1.5 mL of thawed viral supernatant.",
    "Incubate virus coated six well plate for 2 h at approximately 20°C–22°C (or 18 h at 4°C).\nRetrieve activated T cells from 6 well plate and transfer into a Falcon tube. After gentle mixing by inversion, count using a hemocytometer and Trypan blue.\nAspirate the 1.5 mL viral vector from the preloaded RetroNectin®-coated 6 well plate.\nAdd 3 mL of freshly thawed viral supernatant to each well.\nFor non-transduced control T cells, add 3 mL D10 medium (DMEM + 2 mM L-glutamine + 10% fetal bovine serum).\nAdd 1 × 106 activated T cells per well of the 6 well plate. These are taken directly from the activated PBMC culture (step 39) in the appropriate volume, without any adjustment of their concentration.\nAdd IL-2 to each well to a final concentration of 100 IU/mL.\nIncubate cells at 37°C & 5% CO2 for 72 h.\nNote: Activated T cells should not be washed prior to transduction as this will remove potentially stimulatory factors present in the medium that they have conditioned.\nNote: Do not use all activated T cells for transduction. Untransduced T cells will later be required, for example, as a control for flow cytometry analysis and/ or functional studies.\nExpansion and assessment of transduction efficiency of pCAR T cells\nTiming: 6–14 days\nThis method results in the production of sufficient pCAR, CAR and control T cells for functional analysis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1671-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Workflow of expansion and assessment of transduction efficiency of CAR and pCAR T cells",
    "(1) T cells are supplemented with medium and IL-2 every 2–3 days to expand in culture. (2) Cell surface expression of CAR and pCAR is quantified by flow cytometry. In this representative example, CAR expression is detected by staining with 9e10 (detects a MYC epitope tag within the CAR ectodomain) while expression of the CCR component of the pCAR is detected using anti-EGF (binds to the T1E peptide in the CCR).\nEvery 2 days (3 days if leaving over weekends), feed T cells with 100% volume increase of R5 medium, with the addition of recombinant human IL-2 to a final concentration of 100 IU/mL.\nMaintain T cell concentration at below 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nOver this interval, maintain T cells at 37°C and 5% CO2. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nNote: If T cell density is below 5 × 105/mL, add 100 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2 only. This is because T cell growth is density-dependent, so it is undesirable to maintain cell density that is below this level.\nNote: Assessment of gene transfer is typically performed on day 10 post gene transfer, but it may be undertaken as early as 72 h after retroviral transduction.\nTransfer 2.5 × 105 T cells for each CAR construct into separate 5 mL flow cytometry tubes.

However, fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls generated using transduced cells may alternatively be used to determine where to set gates.\nOptional: Additional T cell markers and a viability dye can be added to the staining panel to aid gating on live T cells.\nIn vitro cytolytic activity and cytokine release by pCAR T cells\nTiming: 5 days\nThis method demonstrates the kinetics of tumor cell killing and cytokine production by pCAR T cells (24–72 h post activation), making comparison with 2G CAR T cells and controls that are predicted to lack specificity for αvβ6 integrin or lack signaling capacity (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1671-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Comparison between pCAR-A/T and 2G-A(CD28) T cells is shown.\nNote: It is necessary to validate tumor cell surface expression of the target antigen(s) recognized by the pCAR under study prior to co-culture experiments.

    "Note: Using the methods and kits described above, supernatants for the assessment of IL-2 are diluted 1:5 in reagent diluent. Supernatants for the assessment of IFN-γ are diluted 1:10 in reagent diluent. However, it should be noted that alternative dilutions may be required using other ELISA kits in order to ensure that optical density readings lie on the linear part of the standard curve.\nNote: In this example, pCAR-A/T T cells demonstrate broadly similar in vitro cytolytic activity to 2G-A (CD28) CAR T cells. Cytokine release by pCAR T cells is generally greater than that seen using 2G CAR T cells (Muliaditan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Function of the CAR is dependent upon the intact A20 peptide and signaling endodomain, indicated by the lack of activity of the 2G-Scrambled (CD28) and 2G-A (CD28 trunc.) controls.\nIn vitro pCAR T cell tumor re-stimulation assay\nTiming: Undetermined due to unknown persistence of T cell restimulation capacity\nIn cancer, persistent antigen exposure leads to progressive T cell dysfunction (Wherry and Kurachi, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), a process that can be modeled using tumor re-stimulation assays (Vardhana et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). This method quantifies T cell expansion, tumor cell killing and (optionally) cytokine production by pCAR T cells following iterative stimulation on tumor cells that express cognate antigen (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). In this example, twice weekly stimulation cycles are undertaken. Timing may be adjusted to allow for weekends (e.g., alternating 3 day and 4 day stimulation cycles). Alternatively, weekly stimulation cycles may be undertaken although this typically extends the duration of the experiment. Comparison is made with 2G CAR T cells and controls that are predicted to lack specificity for CAR target antigen (in this example, αvβ6 integrin) or signaling capacity.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1671-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "Note: Group sizes should be calculated in advance of undertaking the experiment. A minimum group size of 5 mice per group can provide useful information and is convenient since 5 animals can be subject to BLI simultaneously. However, this design may compromise power, especially in the event of incidental loss of one or more mice during the experiment. If variability (e.g., standard deviation) of tumor growth are known, a power calculation can be performed (strongly advised), for example using http://www.biomath.info/power/ttest.htm[href=http://www.biomath.info/power/ttest.htm] (accessed March 12th, 2022). See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nNote: To minimize risk of bias, it is recommended that animal work is undertaken in a blinded fashion (e.g., where one staff member prepares pCAR, CAR and control T cells as coded samples for administration by a second staff member who is unaware of which treatment has been administered to each group). Treatment groups and their order of treatment should also be randomly assigned.\nDay -2 – Isolation and activation of PBMCs.\nPerform steps 21–61 to expand sufficient numbers of transduced T cells for each treatment group.

Weight loss greater than 15% caused by tumor burden is a humane endpoint and mice must be sacrificed.\nNote: Mice should also be humanely killed using an appropriate procedure (referred to in the UK as a Schedule one procedure; https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/14/schedule/1[href=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/14/schedule/1], accessed January 2nd, 2022) if the tumor total flux reading equals or exceeds 1 × 1010, or if the tumor ulcerates, limits normal behavior, impedes a vital function (e.g., locomotion, vision, mastication, excretion etc.), or causes clinical signs such as jaundice. Increase in body girth (similar to a pregnant mouse), dyspnoea, neurological signs, lameness or general signs of ill-health (e.g., piloerection, hunched posture, inability to groom, inactivity, inappetance) are all additional humane end points.\nDay 1 (continued) – Transduce T cells.\nPerform steps 20–60 to generate sufficient numbers of pCAR, CAR and control T cells for each experimental group.\nDay 6 – Bioluminescence imaging of mice.\nMice are injected i.p. with 150 mg/kg D-luciferin.\nPlace mice into an anesthetic induction chamber (isoflurane 2.5%, with flow rate 2Lmin) until fully anesthetized.\nPrecisely 15 min after the D-luciferin injection, using an IVIS Spectrum Imaging platform (Perkin Elmer) with Living Image software, image the mice using the auto-exposure function.\nTotal flux (photons/second) is determined by creating a region of interest over each entire mouse.\nAfter imaging, return the mice to their cages and monitor until they have fully regained consciousness.",
    "Critical: Prior to starting experiments, follow Perkin Elmer protocols to determine the D-luciferin kinetic curve for your model (https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/SOP_Determine_Luciferin_Kinetic_Curve.pdf[href=https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/SOP_Determine_Luciferin_Kinetic_Curve.pdf], accessed January 2nd, 2022). Because bioluminescence signal production can be tissue dependent, Perkin Elmer recommend optimal timings between injection of D-luciferin substrate and imaging is determined prior to starting experiments. Serial imaging is performed every 5 min until 40 min post substrate injection. Total flux is plotted against time and this curve is used to determine an imaging time point to produce maximum total flux (usually between 10–20 min post injection).\nDay 11 – Bioluminescence imaging of mice.\nMice that have total flux values greater than the enrollment threshold (usually >1 × 107 photons/second) are distributed into treatment groups with similar average tumor burden.\nDay 12 – Administration of T cells and PBS.\nNote: Each mouse should receive the appropriate dose of transduced T cells (4 × 106 cells in this example). If the transduction efficiency is lower than 100%, the total number of T cells is adjusted to bring the transduced population up to 4 × 106 cells. Illustrating this, if the transduction efficiency is 66.6%, 6 × 106 total T cells would be injected into each mouse.\nCount transduced and non-transduced T cells.\nPrepare transduced T cells in PBS at a concentration of 2 × 107 transduced T cells/mL.\nWeigh mice.\nInject 200 μL of either pCAR, CAR or non-transduced T cells i.p. into the mice.\nInject 200 μL PBS into control mice.\nIf untransduced T cells are used as an additional control, infuse the same total T cell number in this group as was employed in the pCAR or CAR treatment group that received the highest total T cell number.",
    "Mice are monitored daily for signs of ill health and weighed twice weekly. Reduced weight, piloerection, ruffled coat, poor appetite, and reduced locomotion can all be signs of graft versus host disease (GvHD). Animals should be humanely killed if they show these signs without improvement for 48 h; if they lose >15% of body weight or if they develop other GvHD related signs such as diarrhea (>48 h).\nTo monitor tumor status, weekly bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is performed for the duration of the study.\nMice with total flux (p/s) values reaching the humane endpoint threshold (1 × 1010 p/s) are humanely sacrificed by cervical dislocation or asphyxiation in CO2. Tumors are fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded for future analysis.\nNote: Parallel CAR T cells manifest enhanced in vivo anti-tumor activity compared to linear CAR cells. An important underlying mechanism is superior functional persistence of pCAR T cells in vivo (Muliaditan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nIn vitro evaluation of pCARs that utilize alternative members of the tumor necrosis receptor family\nTiming: Undetermined due to unknown persistence of T cell restimulation capacity",
    "All pCARs described above and in our earlier work (Muliaditan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) deliver co-stimulation by CD28 and the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFr) family member, 4-1BB. The method described here compares in vitro anti-tumor activity of this pCAR with alternatives in which CD28 is paired with another TNFr family member (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). Specifically, the 4-1BB endodomain within pCAR-A/T CCR has been replaced by CD27, CD30, OX40, DR3, GITR or HVEM. The pCAR-A/T pCAR is used as positive control, given its superior anti-tumor activity compared to 2G CARs and other controls. The Trunc. CCR in pCAR construct is used as negative control since it retains full ligand binding activity but lacks a functional TNFr endodomain. Tumor re-stimulation assays were used to make this comparison in the example shown, although any of the other in vitro or in vivo assays could similarly be employed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1671-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.
