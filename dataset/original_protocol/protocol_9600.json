    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, reagents, equipment, and software used in this protocol.\n1. Preparation of the fluid gel suspension bed\nPrepare 1,000 mL of dispersed agarose (0.5% w/v) by adding 5 g of agarose powder to 1,000 mL of ultrapure water (Type 1, >18 mΩ·cm-1) in a 2,000 mL glass bottle.\nAdd a 70 mm magnetic stirrer bar to the aqueous mixture and secure the bottle cap by first fully tightening and then loosening by a quarter turn.\nDissolve and sterilize the mixture by placing the glass bottle into the basket of the autoclave, closing the lid, and running a cycle for 15 min at 121 °C and 1 Bar.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is always used for autoclaving solutions in further steps.\nRemove the bottle from the autoclave once the autoclave has cooled to 80 °C and place it on a magnetic stirrer (unheated), with the stirring set to 800 rpm.\n\tCAUTION: The bottle and the liquid remain hot.\nCool the sol under ambient conditions, while maintaining constant stirring, until the temperature is lower than its Tgel (gelling point), 32 °C.\nRemove the bottle from the stirrer and store it at 4 °C.\n\t​NOTE: The fluid gel can be stored until needed.\n2. Preparation of bioinks\nPrepare a gellan-based bioink using a 1% (w/w) sol of low acyl gellan gum in ultrapure water (Type 1, >18 mΩ·cm-1).\n\t\nWeigh out 0.5 g of gellan powder into a weighing boat.\nAdd 49.5 g of ultrapure water into a 100 mL glass bottle, along with a magnetic stirrer.\nFold the weighing boat containing gellan power in half and add the powder to the water slowly, while constantly stirring.\nDissolve and sterilize the sol using an autoclave and allow it to cool to 20 °C.",
    "Store the bioink at 4 °C until further use.\nPrepare a pectin-collagen blended bioink in ultrapure water (Type 1, >18 mΩ·cm-1).\n\t\nPrepare stock 5% (w/v) low-methoxy pectin solutions by weighing out 2.5 g of pectin powder into a weighing boat.\nAdd 50 mL of ultrapure water into a 100 mL glass bottle, along with a magnetic stirrer.\nFold the weighing boat containing pectin power in half and add the powder to the water slowly, while constantly stirring.\nAutoclave the aqueous mixture and cool to 20 °C.\nPrepare 1:1 and 2:1 pectin-collagen blends by either adding 3 mL of the pectin solution to 3 mL of collagen solution or by adding 4 mL of the pectin solution to 2 mL of collagen solution, respectively. Gently mix the blends using a pipette, by withdrawing and dispensing the mixture 10x.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure is best undertaken using cold materials on ice to prevent premature gelation of the collagen. Precooling of pectin and collagen can be achieved by storing at 4 °C prior to mixing.\nStore at 4 °C until further use.\nPrepare an alginate-collagen blended bioink in ultrapure water (Type 1, >18 mΩ·cm-1).\n\t\nWeigh out 2 g of alginate powder into a weighing boat.\nAdd 50 mL of ultrapure water into a 100 mL glass bottle, along with a magnetic stirrer.\nFold the weighing boat containing alginate power in half and add the powder to the water slowly, while constantly stirring.\nHeat the dispersion to 60 °C, under constant stirring, until the alginate is fully dissolved (clear, slightly brown liquid), and then cool to 20 °C.\nDilute the alginate solution with cell culture medium such as Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) by adding 25 mL of the alginate solution to 25 mL of DMEM.",
    "Prepare alginate-collagen blends (1:1) by adding 3 mL of the alginate/DMEM solution to 3 mL of collagen solution. Gently mix the blends using a pipette by withdrawing and dispensing the mixture 10x and store at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: This procedure is best undertaken using cold materials on ice to prevent premature gelation of the collagen. Precooling of pectin and collagen can be achieved by storing at 4 °C prior to mixing.\n3. Rheological characterization of bioinks\nTurn on the rheometer, insert 40 mm serrated geometries, and allow to stand for 30 min.\nZero the gap height of the rheometer using the zero-gap height function.\nAdd ~2 mL of sample on the bottom plate and lower the top geometry to create a gap height of 1 mm.\nTrim the sample by removing excess material expelled from between the plates. To do this, use a flat, non-abrasive edge to pull excess fluid away from the gap and soak up with tissue paper.\n\tNOTE: Steps 3.2-3.4 are repeated to change the sample before each of the following steps.\nUndertake viscometry profiles to determine the injectability of the bioink.\n\t\nSelect viscometry test from the user options.\nInput the parameters for a shear rate-controlled ramp test: 0.1 to 500 s-1, with a 1 min ramp time.\nRepeat the viscometry ramp test on new samples under stress control, using the upper and lower stresses determined from the shear rate-controlled ramp test in step 3.5.2.\nUndertake small deformation tests to determine the gelling characteristics of the bioink.\n\t\nSelect oscillatory testing from the user options.\nInput parameters into a single frequency test under constant strain: frequency 1 Hz, strain 0.5% over 1 h, while the ink gels.\nUndertake in situ amplitude and frequency measurements on gelled samples.\n\t\nSelect oscillatory test from the user options.",
    "Select amplitude sweep and input the parameters for an amplitude sweep test that is strain-controlled: 0.01 to 500%, at a constant 1 Hz frequency.\nLoad a new sample and select oscillatory test from the user options. Then, select frequency test, and input frequency parameters between 0.01 and 10 Hz and a strain that is within the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) of the spectra determined from the amplitude sweep data obtained in step 3.7.2 (typically a value between 50% and 80% of the LVR).\n4. Designing and printing 3D structures using a 3D bioprinter\nLaunch CAD Software to start the generation of a CAD model.\n\t\nSelect Tools | Materials in the CAD software to define the printing parameters for the chosen bioink.\nInput printing parameters relevant to the printer being used; for example, for the 3D Discovery, input the estimated filament diameter (~200-500 µm for most bioinks) in the thickness tab to determine the Z thickness of each layer.\n\t\tNOTE: Delamination of the final construct is indicative of a need to increase the thickness value, while loss of resolution highlights the need to reduce thickness.\nDesign the desired structure layer by layer using the Layer tabs in the software. Group the layers using the Group tab and assign each layer to a level on the Z plane using the Level tab.\n\t\t\nFor example, to generate a lattice structure (using an alginate-collagen blended bioink prepared in step 2.3), create one layer with the filaments along the x axis and a second layer with the filaments along the y axis. Assign both to a separate Level.\nUnder the Group tab, determine the build height by selecting the number of repeated units in the structure.\nClick the Generate tool to create a G-code for the design and view a 3D render of the structure.",
    "Close BioCAD and launch the 3D Discovery human-machine interface (HMI) software to initiate the printing process.\n\t\nAssemble the printhead according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mount the microvalve to the printhead and screw in the chosen extrusion nozzle.\nClick the Needle Length Measurement function to calibrate the printhead.\nLoad a culture vessel (e.g., a 6-well plate) onto the printing platform.\nAliquot the bioink into the printing cartridge and screw into the printhead above the micro-valve.\nConnect the assembled printhead to the pneumatic pressure system and select printhead on the HMI to engage.\nClick check pressure to allow tuning of the extrusion pressure.\nOnce an appropriate pressure has been selected (~30-120 kPa depending upon the desired resolution), open the G-code generated previously and click Run to initiate the printing process.\n5. Preparation of skin analogues\nCulture human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10%), HEPES buffer (2.5%), and penicillin/streptomycin (1%) in T75 flasks until 90% confluency is reached. Culture human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) in keratinocyte growth media (KGM) until 70%-80% confluency is reached. Keep all cells under conditions of 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% air in an incubator during culture.\nFor the preparation of HDFs and ADSCs for dermal and adipose bioinks, wash the cells by gently pipetting 3 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into flasks, tilt the flask to swirl the PBS over the cells, and aspirate, taking care not to disturb the attached cells.\n\t\nTo lift the cells, pipette 3 mL of 1x cell dissociation enzyme into the flask to cover the cells and place the flask in an incubator for 3 min, firmly tapping the flask against the palm of the hand to dislodge the cells. Neutralize the action of the enzyme using 6 mL of complete DMEM.",
    "NOTE: Incubate for a further 2 min if the cells remain attached after tapping.\nFor the preparation of the dermal and adipose bioinks, pipette the cell suspensions into separate 15 mL tubes and take 10 µL from each for cell counting using a hemocytometer. Centrifuge the remaining cell suspensions at 300 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant, being careful not to disturb the pellet, add the appropriate polymer solution (prepared in step 2.2), and mix using gentle stimulation by pipetting at the following densities:\n\t\t\nFor the adipose layer, pipette 5 × 105 ADSCs mL-1 per 1:1 collagen to pectin blend.\nFor the papillary layer, pipette 3 × 106 HDFs mL-1 per 2:1 collagen to pectin blend.\nFor the reticular layer, pipette 1.5 × 106 HDFs mL-1 per 2:1 collagen to pectin blend.\nTo print, load each bioink into a separate cartridge and print the construct in the supporting fluid gel in a glass Petri dish according to the instructions in section 4.\n\t\nOnce printing is complete, inject 2 mL of 200 mM CaCl2∙2H2O around the construct and 3 mL of adipogenic media (complete DMEM supplemented with 500 µM isobutyl-methylxanthine [IBMX], 50 µM indomethacin, and 1 µM dexamethasone) into the fluid gel using a syringe and needle. Place in an incubator overnight.\nThe following day, remove the construct from the support bath using a spatula, gently wash in PBS, and culture for 14 days in adipogenic medium in a 6-well plate.\nAfter 14 days, remove enough medium to create an air-liquid interface at the surface of the construct and seed 2 × 106 keratinocytes atop the construct to create an epidermal layer.\nCulture further for 1 week prior to analysis.\n6. Preparation of carotid artery model",
    "Load the gellan gum bioink solution (as prepared in step 2.1) into a printer cartridge.\nPrint the carotid artery model within a Petri dish containing the fluid gel support material according to the printing instructions in section 4.\nOnce printing is complete, inject 2 mL of 200 mM CaCl2∙2H2O around the construct using a syringe and needle.\nAfter a minimum of 3 h, remove the construct from the support bath using a spatula and gently wash in PBS."
