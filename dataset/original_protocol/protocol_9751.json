    "1. Introduction of expression plasmids into competent Pro-auxotrophic E. coli cells\nMix 1 ng of each sample plasmid, pQE-80L H6-EGFP, pQE-80L H6-NowGFP, and pQE-80L H6-KillerOrange, with 50 µL of chemically competent or electrocompetent cells of the Pro-auxotrophic E. coli K12- derived strain JM83 (Addgene #50348, or ATCC #35607) for transformation by the heat shock method or electroporation according to the protocols available46,47.\n\tNOTE: The expression vector pQE-80L EGFP-H6 encodes a C-terminally 6xHis-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), the expression vectors pQE-80L H6-NowGFP and pQE-80L H6-KillerOrange encode an N-terminally 6xHis-tagged NowGFP48 or an N-terminally 6xHis-tagged KillerOrange49, respectively, each in a pQE-80L plasmid backbone. All target genes are under the control of a bacterial T5 promoter regulated by the lac operator. Ampicillin resistance was used as a selection marker and colE1 as the origin of replication. See the Table of Materials for further information on the pQE-80L plasmid. Alternative Pro-auxotrophic E. coli originating from strains K-12 and B can be used for expression as well and should yield similar results. The calculated molecular mass of the H6-tagged singly protonated ([M+H]+) wild-type proteins (after chromophore maturation) are 27,745.33 Da (EGFP- H6), 27,931.50 Da (H6-NowGFP), and 27,606.09 Da (H6-KillerOrange). The primary structures of the target proteins are given in Table 1 (His-tag underlined). The glutamine (Q) within the His-tag sequence of NowGFP was identified by DNA sequencing after subcloning of the NowGFP cDNA received from Pletnev et al.51 into the pQE-80L plasmid. It does not impede protein purification or the properties of the fluorescent protein.\nRecover the cells in 950 µL of SOC medium at 37 °C for 1 h.\nSpread 50 µL of the recovered cells onto Luria Agar (LA) medium plates (see Supplementary Material) containing glucose (10 g/L) and ampicillin (100 µg/mL).",
    "Incubate the LA medium plates at 37 °C overnight or 30 °C for 24 h.\n2. Production of recombinant wild-type fluorescent proteins (harboring canonical proline) and procedure for selective pressure incorporation (SPI) to produce fluorescent proteins with proline analogs (S-Flp, R-Flp, Dfp, Dhp)\nOvernight culture of Pro-auxotrophic E. coli K12-derived strain JM83 harboring pQE-80L EGFP- H6, pQE-80L H6-NowGFP, and pQE-80L H6-KillerOrange\n\t\nUse a sterile pipette tip or inoculation loop to select a single colony from an LA medium plate and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (see Supplementary Material; containing 10 g/L glucose, 100 µg/mL ampicillin) in a sterile 14 mL polystyrene culture tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Freshly transformed colonies are recommended for inoculation. Cells on LA medium plates (from step 2.2.) stored at 4 °C should be used within a few days.\nGrow the cell culture overnight at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 200-250 rpm.\nProduction of recombinant EGFP- H6, H6-NowGFP and H6-KillerOrange with native proline and the corresponding protein variants with proline analogs\n\t\nInoculate 200 mL of fresh NMM medium (7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM K2HPO4 and 22 mM KH2PO4, 8.5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 20 mM D-glucose, 1 µg/mL FeCl2, 1 µg/mL CaCl2, 10 µg/mL thiamine, 10 µg/mL biotin, 0.01 µg/mL trace elements (CuSO4, ZnCl2, MnCl2, (NH4)2MoO4), pH ~7.2) with all canonical l-amino acids (50 mg/L); see Supplementary Material) supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin with 2 mL of the overnight culture in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the type of protein, alternative cultivation media like MOPS medium52, glucose-mineral salts medium53, Davis minimal medium54, M9 minimal medium55, or GMML56 can be tested to optimize protein yield.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 220 rpm for ~3 h 30 min.",
    "Measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) in a spectrophotometer every 30 min until an OD600 value of ~ 0.7 is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: For OD600 determination in a spectrophotometer, the cuvette should have a path length of 1 cm. The corresponding cultivation medium is used for the reference (\"zero\") measurement. The incubation time until an OD600 value of ~ 0.7 is reached may depend on culture volume. 3 h 30 min is an approximate value. In a variation of the protocol substeps 2.2.1-2.2.3., the culture from substep 2.1.2. is used to inoculate fresh NMMΔPro medium (see Supplementary Material) supplemented with a limited concentration of proline (e.g., 5 mg/L instead of 50 mg/L), and the cells are grown overnight at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 220 rpm. The next day, the OD600 determination is performed every 30 min until the differences between the measurements are less than 0.05. The maximum OD600 value should be around 1 (± 0.3). The initial, limited proline concentration can be adjusted depending on the expression strain and cultivation medium (see Discussion).\nSpin down the cell suspension for 10 min at 3,000 x g and 4 °C.\nGently decant the supernatant into waste.\nWashing step: Resuspend the cells in 50 mL of ice-cold NMMΔAA (without any amino acid, see Supplementary Material) or NMMΔPro (without proline, see Supplementary Material) medium by careful pipetting.\n\t\tNOTE: For this washing step, either of the two stated buffers can be used, since it is only important to get rid of residual proline in the incubation medium.\nSeparate the cells from the medium by sedimentation at 4 °C in a centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 10 min.\nGently decant the supernatant into waste.",
    "Gently pipette up and down to resuspend the cell pellet in 200 mL of NMMΔPro medium supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin into a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask.\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting cell suspension can be separated into several samples of equal volume to obtain identical start cultures for comparing protein expression in the presence of Pro or proline analogs (e.g., separation into 4 x 50 mL in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks).\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 220 rpm for the complete depletion of Pro.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is critical to completely deplete Pro from cells.\nAdd an appropriate volume of either L-proline or R-Flp, S-Flp, Dfp, and Dhp from 50 mM stock solution to adjust 1 mM final concentration in the cell suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: As a general rule, fresh 50 mM stock solutions of Pro or proline derivatives should always be prepared prior to use. Only if hydrolysis of the particular canonical or non-canonical amino acid in an aqueous solution is not a concern, frozen stocks may be used as well.\nAdd 0.5 mM IPTG from a 1 M stock solution to induce target protein expression.\nExpress the target protein overnight (12 h) at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 220 rpm.\nMeasure OD600 on the next day.\n\t\tNOTE: OD600 determination is done to quantify the amount of cells after protein expression. A lower OD600 value compared to the value measured before the washing step 2.2.3 indicates cytotoxicity of the supplied amino acid. In this case, the procedure should be repeated with the concentration of the supplied amino acid minimized (down to 0.1 mM).\nCentrifuge and collect the bacterial cells at 5,000 x g and 4 °C for 10 min and decant the supernatant into waste.",
    "Washing step: Resuspend the cells by careful pipetting in 50 mL of binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 10% glycerol and transfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL conical polystyrene tube.\nCentrifuge and collect the bacterial cells at 5,000 x g and 4 °C for 10 min and decant the supernatant into waste.\nStore the cell pellet in a 50 mL conical polystyrene tube at -20 °C or -80 °C until further use (protein purification, see below).\n3. Purification procedure of protein samples by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)\nBacterial cell lysis\n\tNOTE: Perform all steps of cell lysis on ice or at 4 °C to prevent degradation of the target protein.\n\t\nThaw the bacterial cell pellet on ice or at 4 °C in a 50 mL conical polystyrene tube for 10-20 min.\nAdd 10 mL of ice-cold binding buffer (see Supplementary Material) and gently pipette up and down to resuspend the cell pellet.\nAdd 100 µL of 50 mg/mL lysozyme, 100 µL of 1 mg/mL DNase I, 100 µL of 1 mg/mL RNase A, 30 µL of 1 M MgCl2. Carefully invert the cell suspension five times, and keep the closed tube on ice or at 4 °C for 60 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Lysozyme induces chemical cell lysis by disrupting the bacterial cell wall.\nSonicate the sample for cell disruption using an ultrasound homogenizer (e.g., 3 times for 3 min in a 50 mL polystyrene tube on an ice-water mixture, pulse 2 s/pause 4 s, 45% amplitude).",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, other cell disruption methods can be used, e.g., high-pressure homogenization in 20 cycles at 14,000 psi. If necessary, dilute using a binding buffer (see Supplementary Material) to reach the minimal instrument volume. Moreover, protein extraction reagents can be used for cell disruption. See the Table of Materials for examples.\nCentrifuge for 60 min at 18,000 x g, 4 °C.\nNote down the liquid volume for substep 3.1.9. and pour the supernatant into a fresh 50 mL polystyrene tube.\nClear the supernatant using a membrane filter with 0.45 µm pore diameter.\nTake a sample of \"lysate\" for SDS-PAGE (see section 4. below); this corresponds to \"soluble protein fraction\", the supernatant from substep 3.1.6.\nAdd an equal volume of ddH2O as determined in substep 3.1.6. to resuspend the cell debris in order to maintain the same dilution of the samples for subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis.\nTake a sample of \"pellet\" for SDS-PAGE (see section 4. below); this corresponds to \"insoluble protein fraction\", the cell debris suspension from substep 3.1.9.\nImmobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification\n\tNOTE: Purification of the target fluorescent protein can be performed at 4 °C or at room temperature (RT). For the latter option, wait for the lysate, column, and all buffers to equilibrate at RT to prevent air bubble formation due to vaporization of air trapped in cold solution upon placement into a warm column.\n\t\nPurify the sample using a 1 mL prepacked or self-packed IMAC FPLC (fast protein [or performance] liquid chromatography) column according to the manufacturer's instructions; set maximum column pressure to 0.3 MPa, and flow rate to 1 mL/min; use binding buffer (see Supplementary Material) for column equilibration, wash buffer (see Supplementary Material) for the wash step, and elution buffer (see Supplementary Material) for target protein elution.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, an automated FPLC system can be applied to elute the target protein with elution buffer running a linear imidazole concentration gradient (20-200 mM).\nCollect and pool the eluate fractions with fluorescent proteins (choose by visible green or orange color).\nTransfer the pooled fractions into a dialysis membrane (molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 5,000-10,000) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyze at least three times against dialysis buffer or MS buffer (see Supplementary Material). For instance, perform dialysis of a 1-mL sample three times against 100 mL of buffer for at least 2 h each round. For a detailed protocol, refer to Budisa et al.34.\nPrepare a 1:100-fold dilution of the dialyzed elution fraction in PBS buffer (see Supplementary Material).\nRecord the absorbance spectrum of the diluted samples in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nCalculate the protein concentration based on the Lambert-Beer law as follows, using literature values of the molar extinction coefficients ε at specific wavelength (for EGFP at 488 nm ε488 = 55,000 cm-1·M-1, NowGFP at 493 nm ε493 = 53,600 cm-1·M-1, KillerOrange at 514 nm ε514 = 22,600 cm-1·M-1):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63320/63320eq01.jpg (Lambert-Beer law)\n\t\tcprotein = protein concentration [mg/mL]\n\t\tA = absorbance at specific wavelength\n\t\tε = molar extinction coefficient at specific wavelength [M-1·cm-1]\n\t\td = cuvette path length, here 1 cm\n\t\tMW = molecular weight of protein [g/mol]\n\t\tUse dialysis buffer (see Supplementary Material) for the reference (\"zero\") measurement.\nTake a sample of \"eluate\" for SDS-PAGE (see section 4 below), load 1-10 µg of protein (calculated according to the previous step) per sample well for Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust SDS sample amounts depending on the applied staining method and sensitivity of the dye if compounds different from Coomassie Brilliant Blue are used for protein band staining.",
    "Freeze and store the protein sample in dialysis buffer (see Supplementary Material) at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Under this storage condition, protein samples should be stable for at least 6 months. Alternative laboratory UV-Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometers can be used for the recording of absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of target proteins. The following excitation wavelengths can be applied for fluorescence emission measurements: 488 nm (EGFP), 493 nm (NowGFP), and 510 nm (KillerOrange).\n4. SDS-PAGE sample preparation\nDetermine absorbance A at 280 nm (A280nm) for samples \"eluate\", \"lysate\" and \"pellet\" from section 3. Adjust the probe volume to achieve A280nm = 2 by adding an appropriate amount of elution buffer (final probe volume should be at least 80 µL).\nMix the sample at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v) with 5x SDS loading dye buffer (see Supplementary Material) by pipetting, e.g., 80 µL of the sample with 20 µL of 5x SDS loading buffer.\nBoil the SDS samples at 95 °C for 5 min in a water bath or heat block to denature the proteins.\nAllow the samples to cool down to RT and spin down the probes at 13,000 x g for 1 min in a microcentrifuge prior to loading onto the gel.\nUse 5-10 µL for Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. For details of the SDS-PAGE procedure, consult57.",
    "NOTE: Adjust the SDS sample amounts depending on the applied staining method and sensitivity of the dye. The result of the SDS-PAGE should be checked carefully to ensure that the samples contain more than 95% of the total protein in a band corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the desired protein. For this, take a photograph of the Coomassie-stained gel and compare the intensity of the protein band of desired molecular weight with the intensity of all other bands in the lane (if any) by densitometry. For densitometric evaluation of band intensities, the software ImageJ can be used58. To experimentally prove the incorporation of the desired ncAAs into the protein of interest, intact protein mass analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-TOF-MS) should be carried out as described59 (see protocol section 5 and Table of Materials therein for exemplary equipment).\n5. Fluorescence emission of protein variants\nPrior to the procedure, check the result from the SDS-PAGE experiment to make sure that sample purity is >95% (see the NOTE after step 4.5.)\nAdjust the samples of each purified protein variant to a concentration of 0.3 µM, taking the calculated absorbance value at the appropriate wavelength as a reference (substep 3.2.5.). Ensure that the approximate final sample volume is 200 µL.\nLet the diluted samples equilibrate for 1 h at RT.\nTransfer the samples into a 1-cm quartz cuvette and measure a fluorescence emission spectrum of the samples using a fluorescence spectrometer (see Table of Materials) applying the following excitation wavelengths: 488 nm (for EGFP), 493 nm (for NowGFP), 510 nm (for KillerOrange).\n6. Denaturation and refolding of EGFP variants",
    "Prior to the procedure, check the result from the SDS-PAGE experiment to make sure that sample purity is >95% (see the NOTE after step 4.5.)\nPrepare for each purified protein variant two samples of 2 µL final volume at a concentration of 300 µM (see protein concentration determination in substeps 3.2.4-3.2.6).\nAdd 18 µL of 1.11x PBS buffer (see Supplementary Material) containing 8.89 M urea and 5.56 mM DTT to 2 µL of each purified protein variant (to obtain 1x PBS containing 8 M urea and 5 mM DTT) to induce denaturation.\n\tNOTE: For steps 6.4-6.6, process each sample separately.\nIncubate the samples for 5 min at 95 °C.\nDilute the 20 µL samples 100-fold by adding 1980 µL of 1x PBS (see Supplementary Material) containing 5 mM DTT to induce renaturation, yielding 0.3 µM final protein concentration and immediately transfer 200 µL of the samples into a 1-cm quartz cuvette.\n\tNOTE: It is very important to work fast here since renaturation starts immediately.\nInsert the quartz cuvette into an appropriate fluorescence spectrometer (see Table of Materials) and monitor protein refolding in the samples by acquiring a fluorescence spectrum every 3 s over 30 min. For each protein variant, use 295 nm fluorescence excitation for the first sample and 488 nm fluorescence excitation for the second one.\nTransfer the refolding samples into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, close the lid and store the samples at RT in the dark for 24 h to allow complete refolding of EGFP variants.\nMeasure fluorescence emission of refolded protein samples according to step 6.6 using the same excitation wavelength as before to capture the temporal endpoint of fluorescence recovery."
