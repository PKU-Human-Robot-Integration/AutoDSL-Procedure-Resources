    "In order to precisely modify a genome at a desired target region, homologous recombination can be used. Here plasmid-based donor repair templates with homology arms are utilized. Homology arms are usually defined as genomic fragments flanking the transgene. The length of the homology arms can vary, but should include around 500 bp, if the modification is large and comprises reporter genes like fluorescent proteins. Most targeting vectors are typically used to replace a part of the coding sequence of an endogenous gene or all of it. This leads to loss-of-function mutations on at least one allele. With the use of 2A-sites, it is possible to preserve the gene function on both alleles of the modified cells and additionally integrate and co-express multiple reporter genes in one gene locus. For this purpose, reporter genes need to be placed in frame with the endogenous genetic code prior to the endogenous stop-codon (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-fig-0001]). The endogenous gene and the reporter genes ought to be separated with 2A-sites. With the addition of a 2A-site, 15-20 amino acids are added to the C-terminus of the prior gene. There are several 2A-sites available, the four most widely used are P2A (derived from porcine teschovirus-1), F2A (derived from foot-and-mouth disease virus), E2A (derived from equine rhinitis A virus) and T2A (derived from Thoseaasigna virus). The cleavage efficiencies of the different 2A-sites vary according to their position and combination in the construct (Liu et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-bib-0009]); hence, the choice of the 2A-site needs to be considered for each repair vector individually. In addition, a positive selection gene present on the repair vector is needed for the selection of cells that have integrated the repair template via homologous recombination. This positive selection gene must not be driven by the endogenous promoter and needs to precede its own promoter.",
    "Since widely used viral promoters such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV), can be efficiently silenced in pluripotent stem cells (Wolf & Goff, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-bib-0023]), the choice of the promoter is of particular importance. Therefore, tissue-specific promoters or tetracycline-regulated promoters are the promoters of choice (Hartman et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-bib-0007]; Vieyra & Goodell, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-bib-0021]). The positive selection gene and its promoter are supposed to be floxed to enable their depletion via the Cre-lox system (Missirlis, Smailus, & Holt, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-bib-0012]; Sternberg, Hamilton, & Hoess, 1981[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-bib-0017]). Restriction sites can be added flanking each genetic element of the repair vector to permit the replacement of the resistance gene and/or the reporter genes. Restriction sites flanking the whole construct excluding the homology arms gives the feasibility to easily transfer constructs for the use in other gene loci.",
    "In our protocol, we use the CRISPR-Cas system derived from Streptococcus pyogenes (SPCas9). Crucial for the Cas9 nuclease accuracy is a 20-nt guide sequence within the gRNA. The guide sequence in the target DNA locus must precede a PAM-sequence (NGG in this system), but the PAM-sequence is not a part of the 20-nt guide sequence within the gRNA. The coordinate function of two catalytic domains, RuvC and HNH, of Cas9 nuclease are responsible for its cleavage activity. RuvC cleaves the non-target strand whereas HNH cleaves the target strand. Together these domains generate blunt-ended double-strand breaks (Cong et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-bib-0005]). The D10A mutant Cas9 nickase (Cas9n) produces a single DNA strand cleavage (a nick) on the target strand. Only the combination of Cas9n and two gRNAs targeting opposite DNA strands in a defined proximity leads to a staggered double-strand break (DSB) with overhangs. Cas9n nicks the DNA at ∼3 bp upstream of the PAM-sequence. For high-editing efficiency, the gRNAs should be orientated in PAM-out orientation (Ran et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-bib-0014]) and the nick-sites should have a distance of 37-68 nt (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-fig-0002]). The DSB should occur approximately 8-20 bp around the stop-codon of the target gene to integrate your transgenes so that the transgenes can be expressed along with the endogenous target gene. To ease the process of finding suitable target sequences, it is beneficial to use online tools such as CCTOP (https://cctop.cos.uni-heidelberg.de[href=https://cctop.cos.uni-heidelberg.de]) or others for calculation. If you are not able to find suitable gRNA-pairs, the non-mutated Cas9 with only one gRNA for DSB may be used.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5f8f2a67-d276-41fa-b507-2c044c180d69/cpsc116-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nCombination of Cas9n with gRNA pairs in configuration of PAM sites facing outwards (PAM-out) or inwards (PAM-in). The resulting DSB should occur near to the stop-codon of the target gene. For HDR PAM-out configuration is preferable.\nMaterials",

    "Transfections are used to introduce plasmid DNA into cells. In this protocol, we use electroporation, which yields high amounts of transient transfected cells by high-voltage shocks that increase the permeability of cell membranes. The procedure is relatively simple and quick to perform. Cells are converted into single-cell suspension in an electroporation buffer and plasmid DNA is added. The cell-DNA-mixture is transferred to an electroporation cuvette and then exposed to a high-voltage electrical pulse. The magnitude and length of the electrical pulse needs to be adjusted to every cell line particularly to optimize transfection rate and avoid high amounts of cell death. This optimization can be done by optimization protocols, which can be found in the manufacturer's instructions of your electroporation system. Successfully transfected cells need to be cultured under selection pressure. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the optimal concentration of the antibiotic whose resistance gene was transmitted along with the transgenes by transfection. The concentration should be as low as possible and as high as needed to selectively kill non-resistant cells. The antibiotic concentration should lead to cell death of all non-edited cells within 1 week. After transfection, clonal cell lines can be expanded under selective pressure and genotyped (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/af35ed67-8360-407e-8668-b2cd424068b7/cpsc116-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nExperimental setup for transfection, selection, expansion and genotyping of PSCs.\nMaterials\nHuman pluripotent stem cells (PSCs)\nPBS w/o Ca2+/Mg2+ (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

    "Positive selection markers such as antibiotic-resistance genes can be used to remove non-edited cells. However, antibiotic selection can incorrectly select for cells with multiple aberrant transgene insertions. In order to identify cell clones harboring the transgene insertion in the desired region, it is required to confirm the correct transgene insertion via genotyping. In order to screen the generated cell clones, primer pairs have to be designed. Cell clones need to be tested for correct transgene insertion and also for the wildtype allele. For genotyping the forward primer 1 needs to bind 5′ upstream of the 5′-homology arm of the transgene. The reverse primer 1 needs to bind in the transgene somewhere downstream of the 5′-homology arm. The distance between forward and reverse primer should span 500 to 2000 bp. To test for the wildtype allele, the same forward primer 1 can be used. The reverse primer 2 should bind downstream of the 3′-homology arm. Since the transgene spans several 100 bp between the homology arms, there should be no PCR-product for the wildtype allele due to the size restrictions during the PCR run. PCR-products can then be visualized by an agarose-gel (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-fig-0004]). PCR-products of transgene insertions can be sent for sequencing. If transgene insertion PCR and wild-type PCR are both positive, the clone is heterozygous. No wildtype PCR product implies for a homozygous clone and only wildtype bands imply for negative clones. It is advisable to test several different primers and/or primer combinations to increase the likelihood of functional primer pairs.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d92ddc25-5b0d-4b70-a560-5806809269b0/cpsc116-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nPrimer localization for PCR of wildtype and edited target gene loci (A) and resulting PCR products for wild-type, homozygous and heterozygous cell clones (B).\nMaterials\nGenerated clonal cells (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.116#cpsc116-prot-0002])\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS) w/o Ca2+/Mg2+ (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

    "1 μl,10 μM reverse primer\n1 μl,50 ng/μl genomic DNA\n0.5 μl,5 U/μl Taq DNA polymerase\n18.5 μl,PCR grade H2O\n25 μl,total.\nFor standard PCR, use the following program:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\n1 cycle:,5 min,95°C (initial denaturation)\n40 cycles:,30 sec,95°C (denaturation)\n,30 sec,60°C (annealing)\n,1 min 10 sec,72°C (extension)\n1 cycle:,5 min,72°C (final extension)\nFinal step:,Cool down to,4°C.\nFor Q5 PCR conditions prepare the following mix:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1\n5 μl,5× Q5® Reaction Buffer\n0.5 μl,10 mM dNTPs\n1.25 μl,10 μM forward primer\n1.25 μl,10 μM reverse primer\n2 μl,50 ng/µl genomic DNA\n0.25 μl,Q5® high-fidelity DNA Polymerase\n5 μl,5× Q5® high GC-Enhancer (optional)\n9.75 μl,PCR grade H2O\n25μl,total.\nFor Q5 PCR conditions, run the following program:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\n1 cycle:,30 sec,98°C (initial denaturation)\n35 cycles:,10 sec,98 (denaturation)\n,30 sec,60°C (annealing)\n,40 sec,72°C (extension)\n1 cycle:,2 min,72°C (final extension)\nFinal step:,Cool down to,4°C.\n9. Prepare a 1% agarose gel for the visualization of the PCR products as follows:\n         \nFor 25 ml agarose gel, mix 25 ml TBE Buffer with 250 mg agarose in an Erlenmeyer flask.\nWarm the mixture, e.g., in the microwave oven until all of the agarose is solved, avoid boil over.\nAdd a DNA visualizing reagent to the liquid gel (e.g., Midori Green) and pour it into a suitable gel chamber provided with a suitable gel comb.\nLet the gel polymerize for about 20-30 min.\nTransfer the gel into the electrophoresis chamber filled with TBE Buffer.\n10. Load the PCR products with loading dye to the agarose gel and start the electrophoresis.\n11. After electrophoresis, control if the size of the received DNA bands matches with the expected size of your desired PCR products.\nTransgene insertion PCR products of positive clones can be sent for sequencing."
