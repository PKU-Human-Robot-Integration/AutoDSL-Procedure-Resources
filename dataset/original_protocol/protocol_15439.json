    "1. Preparation of Protein Sample\nFormulate the stability screens as 500 µL aliquots in 96-well blocks and seal for storage. Transfer 10 µL of each condition of a stability screen into the corresponding well of a 96-well plate using a multi-channel pipette to save time (Figure 4A).\nPrepare 1 mL of an approximately 1 mg mL-1 protein solution in an appropriate buffer system. While the composition of an appropriate buffer varies with each protein sample, a good first buffer to try is 10 mM sodium phosphate with 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.2.\n\tNOTE: Acceptable protein concentrations vary case-by-case, but concentration ranges of 0.5 - 5 mg mL-1 typically produce analyzable curves. Dilute buffers are recommended for use with the stability screens to avoid masking the effects of each condition. Typical buffer compositions are approximately 10 mM buffer with around 100 mM NaCl.\nIf performing a TSA experiment, add SYPRO Orange dye to the protein sample to a final concentration of 20x. Mix either by inversion or brief vortexing.\nTransfer 10 µL of the protein solution into each well of the 96-well plate prepared in Step 1.1 (Figure 4B).\nSeal and centrifuge the 96-well plate for 2 min at 600 x g to ensure the protein sample and screen component are mixed (Figure 4C).\nRe-seal the stability screen deep well block and store the screen at 4 °C for up to 4 months. Store the salt screen in darkness, as some components are photosensitive.\nIf performing a nanoDSF experiment, continue to step 2. If performing a TSA experiment, skip to step 4.\n2. Preparing a nanoDSF Experiment\nEnsure that the equipment is clean, paying particular attention to any dust near the sample rack. If the system has a backscattering mirror, clean it using ethanol and a lint-free tissue.",
    "Open the sample drawer by pressing the Open Drawer button. (Figure 5A).\nLoad the capillaries with approximately 10 µL from each well of the 96-well plate by touching one end of the capillary into the solution, then place them into the corresponding capillary holders of the sample rack (Figure 5B). Be careful not to contaminate the middle of the capillaries with fingerprints, etc., as this could interfere with fluorescence readings throughout the experiment.\nImmobilize the capillaries with the magnetic sealing strip (Figure 5C).\n3. Programming a nanoDSF Experiment\nLaunch a preliminary scan to detect the position and intensity of each capillary by pressing the Start Discovery Scan button in the Discovery Scan tab. Increase or decrease the incident excitation strength from an initial power of 10% until the peak of every capillary scan is between 4,000-12,000 units (Figure 5D).\nTo ensure the sample is folded and sufficiently concentrated, an initial melt scan with a steep temperature gradient is recommended. In the Melting Scan tab, program a melt scan by setting the Temperature Slope option to 7.0 °C min-1, Start Temperature to 25 °C and End Temperature to 95 °C, then launch the nanoDSF experiment by pressing the Start Melting button. If the resulting melt curves do not show a detectable inflection point, consider concentrating the sample further or checking if the protein is folded properly.\nRepeat steps 2.1-2.4 to prepare the samples for a full experiment.\nIn the Melting Scan tab, program a melt scan by setting the Temperature Slope option to 1.0 °C min-1, Start Temperature to 25 °C and End Temperature to 95 °C, then launch the nanoDSF experiment by pressing the Start Melting button.\n4. Performing a TSA Experiment",
    "Open the sample drawer by firmly pressing the indent on the right-hand side of the drawer. Place the 96-well tray in the RT-PCR system with well A1 to the back-left (Figure 4D).\nClick the New Experiment button to begin setting up a TSA experiment.\nIn the Experiment Properties tab, click the Melt Curve option when asked What type of experiment do you want to set up? and the Other option when asked Which reagents do you want to use to detect the target sequence?\nIn the Plate Setup/ Define Targets and Samples tab, enter a target name then set Reporter as ROX and Quencher as None.\nIn the Plate Setup/ Assign Targets and Samples tab, assign every well of the 96-well plate to the target name entered in the previous step. In the same tab, set Select the dye to use as the passive reference as None.\nIn the Run Method tab, delete steps until there is a total of three. Set the first step to 25.0 °C, ramp rate 100%, time 00:05; the second step to 95.0 °C, ramp rate 1%, time 01:00; the third step to 95.0 °C, ramp rate 100%, time 00:05. Choose to collect data using the Collect Data dropdown menu or by pressing the Data Collection icon (Figure 6).\nSet the Reaction Volume Per Well to 20 µL.\nPress the Start Run button to begin the TSA experiment.\n5. Data Analysis\nChoose a wavelength to plot a melt curve with. For nanoDSF experiments, the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 330 nm and 350 nm (corresponding to tryptophan in nonpolar and polar environments, respectively)13 is commonly used. For most TSAs, the dye emission maximum is suitable for melt curve plotting (the emission maximum of SYPRO Orange is 569 nm)12.",
    "Calculate the Tm values of each condition by determining the inflection point(s) of each melt curve. Most nanoDSF systems automatically calculate Tm values by numerical differentiation of melt curves after data acquisition. If the software used does not automatically calculate Tm values, free, alternative GUI-driven software such as NAMI11 can automate data analysis and downstream processing, giving the option to produce a heatmap summarizing Tm values for the entire 96-well experiment (the accompanying reference provides guidance and resources for data processing with NAMI).\nCompare Tm values of all conditions surveyed. The stability screens contain two wells in each screen (A1 and A2) that contain only water. Taking the water-only values as a benchmark allows calculation of ΔTm values, addressing systematic errors and allowing easy comparison of stabilizing effects. Higher Tm values indicate thermally stabilizing conditions which are recommended for downstream use. Promising conditions often show a concentration dependence in their stabilization."
