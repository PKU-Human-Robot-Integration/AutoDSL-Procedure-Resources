    "Design, assemble, and clone an RGR (ribozyme-gRNA-ribozyme) unitWe design an artificial gene named RGR, whose primary transcripts would be flanked by ribozymes at both ends (Figure 1) (Gao and Zhao, 2014).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170219/20170219122646_8038.jpgFigure 1. A schematic presentation of a ribozyme-flanked gRNA (RGR, ribozyme-gRNA-ribozyme) molecule. Once transcribed, the corresponding RGR DNA will produce an RNA molecule with a ribozyme at both the 5’- and 3’-end. The primary transcripts will undergo self-cleavage to release the mature gRNA. The RGR design allows the production of a functional gRNA molecule from any promoter, enabling production of gRNA molecules in vitro, in vivo, and in tissue/cell specific manner.Select a target sequence for editing the gene of interestThe target should be 23 bp long and should contain the NGG Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) site at the 3’-end. However, the NGG PAM site should not be included in the gRNA sequence itself. N refers to any nucleotide in the target N1N2N3N4N5N6N7N8N9N10N11N12N13N14N15N16N17N18N19N20NGG. Multiple web-based resources are publically available for selecting appropriate gRNA targets (http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/crispr/[href=http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/crispr/]; http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/[href=http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/]; http://www.genome.arizona.edu/crispr/CRISPRsearch.html[href=http://www.genome.arizona.edu/crispr/CRISPRsearch.html]).  Design an Ribozyme-gRNA-Ribozyme (RGR) unit We place a Hammerhead ribozyme at the 5’-end of the gRNA and a HDV ribozyme at the 3’-end of the gRNA (Figure 2). The complete sequences of the ribozymes were described in the plasmid pRS316-RGR-GFP (Gao and Zhao, 2014). Both the plasmid and the complete sequence of pRS316-RGR-GFP are available at Addgene[href=https://www.addgene.org/51056/]. The RGR unit can then be placed under the control of a promoter for the production of the designed gRNA molecules. Any promoters including both RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III promoters can be used. For in vitro production of gRNAs, the RGR unit can be driven by an SP6 or T7 or T3 promoter, which can be transcribed using commercially available RNA polymerases (Gao and Zhao, 2014).",
    "Linearize the vector of your choice with a restriction enzyme and determine an 18 to 24 bp overlapping region (termed adaptor sequence) based on the Gibson assembly principle (Gibson et al., 2009). Gibson assembly method seamlessly assembles overlapping DNA molecules into one molecule by the concerted action of a 5’ exonuclease, a PHUSION DNA polymerase and a heat-stable Taq DNA ligase (Gibson et al., 2009). Additional information about Gibson assembly can be found at Addgene (http://www.addgene.org/protocols/gibson-assembly/[href=http://www.addgene.org/protocols/gibson-assembly/]). Assembly kits are commercially available at New England Biolabs (https://www.neb.com/products/e5510-gibson-assembly-cloning-kit[href=https://www.neb.com/products/e5510-gibson-assembly-cloning-kit]).If the adaptor sequences are XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (upstream adaptor) and YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY (downstream adaptor), design two forward primers and one reverse primer as shown below. Adaptor sequences including X and Y provide the necessary overlapping sequences with your linearized vector so that the RGR unit can be assembled into the vector through Gibson assembly principle. The length of adaptor sequences varies depending on the actual sequences, but usually 17 bp to 24 bp is sufficient as long as the Tm value is above 50 °C.Forward primer 1: GENE-RGR-F1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXM6M5M4M3M2M1CTGATGAGTCCGTGAGGACGAAACGAGTAAGCTCGTCThe sequence X (bold) refers to the upstream adaptor sequence, which is complementary to the vector sequence.

N1N2N3N4N5N6 and M6M5M4M3M2M1 are reverse complementary to ensure the correct secondary structure of the Hammerhead ribozyme. We designed the two overlapping PCR primers to avoid the synthesis of expensive long primers. The target sequence is N1N2N3N4N5N6N7N8N9N10N11N12N13N14N15N16N17N18N19N20NGG.

Molecular design of an RGR unit and the assembly of a complete RGR unit by PCR. The top panel shows the complete sequence of an RGR unit that produces a gRNA that targets (N)20NGG sequence. The underlined sequences are adaptor sequences from the vector and are used for cloning the RGR unit into the final CRISPR vector. Note that the adaptor sequences vary accordingly if different vectors are chosen. N1 to N20 (in red) are the target sequence prior to the NGG PAM site. It is essential that the M6M5M4M3M2M1 and N1N2N3N4N5N6 are reverse complementary so that the ribozyme can undergo self-cleavage as designed. Sequence highlighted in green is the core gRNA sequence. Sequence highlighted in yellow is the Hammerhead ribozyme. The HDV ribozyme is highlighted in purple. The primers are marked by different colors: black (Gene-RGR-F1), light blue (Gene-RGR-F2), and Red (UNIVERS-RGR-R). The Universal primer depends on the vector sequences and needs to be changed if different vectors are used. The complete RGR unit can be easily assembled by two over-lapping PCR reactions.Assemble the Ribozyme-gRNA-Ribozyme (RGR) unitAn RGR unit for targeting a new gene is assembled through two rounds of overlapping PCR reactions (Figure 2). There is a 21-bp overlap between the two forward primers (Figure 2).First PCR (PCR1): Use primer pair GENE-RGR-F2 + UNIVERS-RGR-R. Template: any existing RGR construct (e.g., pRS316-RGR-GFP, available from Addgene[href=https://www.addgene.org/51056/]. The expected PCR product is 233 bp).The second-round PCR (PCR2): Use primer pair GENE-RGR-F1 + UNIVERS-RGR-R. Gel-purified PCR product from PCR1 is used as the template.",
    "The expected PCR2 product is 277 bp, which is the complete RGR unit (Figure 2).A routine PCR reaction is set up according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (https://www.neb.com/protocols/1/01/01/pcr-protocol-m0530[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/1/01/01/pcr-protocol-m0530]). Briefly, the PCR components are mixed as described in Table 1.Table 1.

Note that the PCR primers GENE-RGR-F1 and UNIVERS-RGR-R contain sequences that match part of the sequences in the vector to facilitate the in vitro assembly of the RGR unit into the vector (Figure 2).Incubate the DNA assembly mixture (Table 3) for 1 h at 50 °C. DNA assembly was conducted by following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol (Table 3). (https://www.neb.com/products/e2611-gibson-assembly-master-mix#tabselect2[href=https://www.neb.com/products/e2611-gibson-assembly-master-mix%23tabselect2]).Table 3. In vitro DNA assemblyimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170219/20170219122839_2414.jpgThen transform 3 µl ligated product to E. coli DH5α competent cells.The ligated plasmid could be transformed into E. coli competent cells following routine cloning procedure (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).Transform E. coli DH5α competent cells (homemade or commercially available products) using 3 μl of ligation product.  Inoculate 2 to 4 colonies in LB medium with appropriate antibiotics. Purify plasmids from the transformed DH5α cells using QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit.Verify the positive clones by Sanger sequencing before introducing the final plasmid into your cell/organism of choice (Yoshioka et al., 2015).An example of constructing an RGR unit for CRISPR-mediated gene editingSelect a target gene and a vectorWe show the construction of an RGR unit to target the Arabidopsis gene Auxin Binding Protein 1 (ABP1) (Figure 3) as an example (Gao et al., 2015). We use pHDE-35S-Cas9-mCherry-UBQ plasmid as our CRISPR vector (Gao et al.",
    ", 2016), which has been used for editing genes in Arabidopsis (the plasmid can be obtained through Addgene[href=https://www.addgene.org/78932/]). Linearize the plasmidWe digest pHDE-35S-Cas9-mCherry-UBQ plasmid with MfeI (Figure 3). The MfeI-linearized plasmid is used for assembling the RGR unit into the vector through Gibson assembly. The complete plasmid can express the ABP1-RGR unit from the Arabidopsis UBQ10 promoter in plants (Figure 3). Table 4. Linearize the vector by restriction digestionimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170219/20170219122905_4486.jpgMix the components shown in Table 4 and digest the vector overnight at 37 °C. Then heat inactivation the enzyme at 80 °C for 15 min. The linearized plasmid was16,084 bp.Design the PCR primersThe upstream adaptor sequence is GTTTTTCTGATTAACAGCTCGC. The downstream adaptor we used is GACCTAACTGAGTAAGCTAGC (Figure 3).Forward primer 1: ABP1-RGR-F1:GTTTTTCTGATTAACAGCTCGCAGCTCCCTGATGAGTCCGTGAGGACGAAACGAGTAAGCTCGTC. The 6 bp sequence in bold is reverse complementary to the first 6 bp of the gRNA target. The underlined sequence is part of the Hammerhead ribozyme.Forward primer 2: ABP1-RGR-F2:GACGAAACGAGTAAGCTCGTCGGAGCTCCTTGTCCCATCAAGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG. The underlined sequence is part of the Hammerhead ribozyme. Sequence in bold is the gRNA target sequence, and the italicized sequence is part of the core gRNA sequence.Note: The bold sequence in ABP1-RGR-F1 is reverse complementary to the first 6 bp of the bold sequence in ABP1-RGR-F2. ABP1-RGR-F1 and ABP1-RGR-F2 share the following overlapping sequences: GACGAAACGAGTAAGCTCGTC, which allows us to conduct two overlapping PCR reactions.For cloning the ABP1-RGR unit into the MfeI site in 35S-Cas9-mCherry-UBQ plasmid using Gibson assembly, the UNIVERS-RGR-R primer is: GCTAGCTTACTCAGTTAGGTCGTCCCATTCGCCATGCCGAAGCNote: The bold sequence is complementary to the downstream adaptor sequence. The italicized sequence matches the 3’ end of the HDV ribozyme.The complete RGR unit for producing a gRNA targeting the ABP1 gene is shown in Figure 3. The RGR unit has led to successful isolation of several null alleles of abp1 in Arabidopsis (Gao et al., 2015 and 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170219/20170219122923_6779.jpgFigure 3.",
    "A Molecular design of an RGR unit for targeting the ABP1 gene in Arabidopsis. The RGR unit is cloned into the pHDE-35S-Cas9-mCherry-UBQ plasmid at the MfeI site using Gibson assembly. The adaptor sequences are underlined. Note that the downstream adaptor sequence has to be converted to reverse complementary sequence when designing the Universal primer. The target sequence is in red. The Hammerhead ribozyme and the HDV ribozyme are highlighted in yellow and purple, respectively.Guide RNA production by in vitro transcriptionOnce an RGR unit is assembled and cloned into the final vector as described above, gRNAs can be easily produced by in vitro transcription using T7, SP6, or T3 RNA polymerases, which are commercially available. Prepare a DNA template for in vitro transcriptionThe templates for in vitro transcription are ampliﬁed by PCR from the assembled RGR constructs using two universal primers (any RGR units cloned into the same vector can be amplified using the same pair of primers). For example, RGR units cloned into the MfeI site in pHDE-35S-Cas9-mCherry-UBQ can be amplified using the following pair of primers:SP6-P1: GTCACTATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGCGGTTTTTCTGATTAACAGCTCGC and Univers-P2: GCTAGCTTACTCAGTTAGGTC.The Underlined sequence is the SP6 promoter and the bolded G in primer SP6-P1 is the transcription initiation site for SP6 RNA polymerase. If T7 or T3 RNA polymerases are used, the underlined 5’-end of the primer SP6-P1 needs to be changed to GTCACTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA and GTCACAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAGA respectively.PCR conditions are described in Table 1 and Table 2.In vitro transcriptionAdd the following reagents at room temperature in the order listed in Table 5:Table 5.

    "5 M EDTA to terminate the reaction.Note: There is no need to further purify the RNA transcripts for in vitro CRISPR cleavage assays (for in vitro cleavage assay example, follow the link: https://www.neb.com/products/m0386-cas9-nuclease-s-pyogenes[href=https://www.neb.com/products/m0386-cas9-nuclease-s-pyogenes]. The quality of in vitro transcription and self-processing can be analyzed by electrophoresis in 12% denaturing urea polyacrylamide gels. The RNA bands are stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using a UV transilluminator. To analyze the DNA cleavage products generated by Cas9 and the gRNA from the in vitro transcription, regular 1% agarose gel is adequate.Transformation of the RGR plasmid into ArabidopsisThe final plasmid with the RGR construct was transformed into Arabidopsis through Agrobacterium-mediated floral dipping method (Clough and Bent, 1998). The transgenic T1 plants were identified either as hygromycin-resistant or producing mCherry fluorescence (Gao et al., 2015 and 2016). T1 plants were screened for editing events using PCR and restriction digestion as described in Gao et al., 2015 and 2016."
