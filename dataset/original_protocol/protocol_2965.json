Larger\n      veins are easier to inject. This step should be undertaken in the dark to\n      enable clear visualization of veins with a candling torch. For reptilian\n      species that we have tested (including the Nile crocodile and various\n      tortoise species), veins are typically visible from approximately halfway\n      through the total incubation period. We have previously injected chicken\n      embryos between E10 and E14, and we have injected tortoise and crocodile\n      embryos between E40 and E60. See ‘Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]:\n      Protocol for the rapid intravenous in-ovo injection of developing amniote\n      embryos’ for a clear demonstration of the entire protocol.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2709-Fig1.jpg\n          Figure 1. Preparing eggs for intravenous injection into the\n          chorioallantoic veins\n        \n          (A) Eggs are candled to identify a suitable chorioallantoic vein to\n          inject (Ai-ii), and a small window is drawn around this vein (Aiii).\n        \n          (B) This window is then removed using a detailing saw, whilst leaving\n          intact the membrane underneath the egg (Bi-iii). After the application\n          of mineral oil, the vein becomes clearly visible when illuminated with\n          a candling torch (Biv-vi). Images presented here show the preparation\n          of a chicken egg for intravenous injection.\n        \n        Remove eggs from the incubator, ensuring that the upward facing side\n        remains in the same orientation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Ai).\n      \n        Place the egg in the paraffin egg mount covered with damp tissue paper.\n      \n        Clean the upper surface of the egg by wiping gently with a 70% EtOH\n        solution.\n      \n        Use a candling torch to illuminate the egg, thereby visualizing the\n        chorioallantoic veins (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Aii).",
    "Note: Moving the torch around the egg will\n      illuminate different veins, allowing the largest veins to be selected.\n    \n        Once an appropriate vein has been selected, draw a triangular window\n        around the vein using a pencil, approximately 6 × 6 × 6 mm in size (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Aiii).\n      \n        Repeat this process for all eggs, and then return them to the incubator\n        until you are ready to proceed to the next stage.\n      \n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \n          Methods video S1. Protocol for the rapid intravenous in-ovo injection\n          of developing amniote embryos\n        \n          Video demonstrating all steps required for the successful execution of\n          this protocol.\n        \n      Step 2: Use a detailing saw to remove an eggshell window and apply mineral\n      oil\n    \nTiming: Approximately 4 min per egg\n    \n      Using the detailing saw, carefully cut through the eggshell without\n      damaging the underlying membrane (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\n      Directing light from the candling torch perpendicular to the surface of\n      the egg should help to visualise when the membrane has been reached, as\n      there is a sudden change in material texture once the membrane has been\n      reached, with a visible increase in material roughness once the eggshell\n      has been fully penetrated.\n    \n        Remove an egg from the incubator and use the detailing saw to carefully\n        cut through the window that was drawn around a selected vein in the\n        previous step (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bi).\n      \nNote: When the membrane has been reached,\n      its surface will appear whiter and rougher in texture than the eggshell\n      (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bii).\n    \nCritical: Ensure that the egg membrane\n      is not damaged. It is advisable to incubate more eggs than required to\n      allow for wastage during this step.\n    \nNote: Piercing of the membrane can enable\n      air bubbles in enter the egg, which may dislodge the chorioallantoic\n      veins.\n    \n        Carefully remove the eggshell window with fine forceps, thereby exposing",
    "the underlying membrane (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Biii).\n      \nRepeat this process for all eggs.\n        Using a cotton bud, gently apply a small amount of mineral oil to the\n        exposed membrane of the windowed eggs.\n      \nNote: This will increase the transparency\n      of the membrane, enabling clear visualization of the vein (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Biv to 1Bvi). For reptilian eggs (such as crocodiles and tortoises) with\n      thicker membranes, more mineral oil and persistent rubbing of the membrane\n      will be required to achieve transparency. We have not observed adverse\n      effects of mineral oil upon embryonic development.\n    \n      Step 3: Intravenous injection into the selected chorioallantoic vein\n    \nTiming: Approximately 5–10 min per egg\n    \n      Windowed eggs can now be injected with a chosen drug, directly into the\n      chorioallantoic vein underlying the egg membrane (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). For injections in chicken eggs, a long and flexible Hamilton needle\n      (e.g., 32G) is suitable as the membrane is very thin. However, for species\n      with thicker membranes (such as tortoises and crocodiles), shorter and\n      less flexible hypodermic needles can be used (see\n      key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). This step should\n      be undertaken in the dark to enable clear visualization of the veins with\n      the candling torch.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2709-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2. Intravenous injection of windowed eggs\n        \n          Place the windowed egg on the paraffin egg mount underneath a\n          dissecting microscope and load the micro-manipulator with the drug\n          (i). Use the micro-manipulator to position the needle directly above\n          the chorioallantoic vein (ii). By illuminating the egg with a candling\n          torch, the vein will be visible (iii). Use the micro-manipulator to\n          carefully penetrate the vein (iv) and deliver the required drug dose\n          (v), before removing the needle from the vein (vi). See also\n          Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]. Images presented here show the\n          intravenous injection of a chicken egg.\n        \n        Place the egg in the paraffin egg mount on the stage of a dissecting",
    "microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]i).\n      \nNote: The addition of damp tissue paper to\n      the egg mount helps to increase egg stability.\n    \n        Hold the candling torch against the side of the egg, in the position\n        that most clearly illuminates the chorioallantoic vein selected for\n        injection, when viewed through the dissecting microscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]ii and 2iii).\n      \nNote: If required, re-apply mineral oil to\n      the membrane to increase transparency.\n    \n        Load the syringe with your chosen drug solution, ensuring that no air\n        bubbles are present, as bubbles may cause blockage of blood vessels and\n        subsequent embryonic mortality.\n      \nNote: For chicken embryos from E10\n      onwards, 30 μL of solution can be injected whilst avoiding adverse\n      effects. For crocodile and tortoise eggs, 30–50 μL of solution can be\n      injected. Use the micromanipulator to position the needle directly above\n      the vein, so that it will enter at an angle of approximately 45° (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]ii and 2iii).\n    \nCritical: Use the micromanipulator to\n      move the needle forwards and penetrate the vein (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]iv), ensuring that the needle does not exit the lower surface of the\n      vein. Use the syringe to deliver the required dose of your chosen drug;\n      the patent blue dye will allow clear visualization of the solution\n      entering the vein (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]v and\n      Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n    \n        Use the micromanipulator to gently retract the needle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]vi).\n      \nNote: For large veins which are typically\n      more elastic, bleeding from the site of injection is generally minimal.\n    \n        Clean around the window by wiping with 70% EtOH to remove excess mineral\n        oil.\n      \n        Use clear adhesive tape to cover the window and exposed membrane,\n        thereby preventing infection. Ensure that the eggs are clearly labeled\n        with a pencil and return to the incubator.\n      \nNote: If chicken embryos are incubated\n      until the hatching stage, it is important to turn off the incubators",
    "rocking function from E18 onwards and maintain humidity throughout.\n    \nStep 4: Embryo dissection and fixation\nTiming: Approximately 5 to 10 min per\n      embryo\n    \n      Embryos should be fixed at the desired developmental stages. For example,\n      to investigate the emergence of ectopic feather buds resulting from SAG\n      treatment at E11 1, embryos were fixed at either E16 or E20, or\n      allowed to hatch. If required, embryos can also be injected with EdU to\n      label proliferating cells prior to fixation. Similarly, we have injected\n      and fixed both crocodiles and tortoises between E40 and E60 to investigate\n      scale formation.\n    \n        Remove eggs from the incubator and use fine forceps to remove the\n        adhesive tape.\n      \n        If required, EdU solution can be injected directly into the chicken\n        embryo through the original window, using a disposable insulin syringe.\n        If access to the embryo through the original window is insufficient, the\n        window can be enlarged using fine scissors. Injection of 150 μL of a\n        10 mg/mL EdU solution, followed by incubation for 2 h prior to fixation,\n        is sufficient to label proliferating cells in chicken embryos between\n        E16 and E20. Injection of 200 μL of a 10 mg/mL EdU solution followed by\n        3 h incubation is sufficient to label proliferating cells in crocodile\n        and tortoise embryos from E45 until hatching.\n      \n        Use small scissors to remove the top of the egg, starting from the\n        window. The embryo can then be carefully removed using a blunt\n        instrument such as a metal spoon, and placed into a dish of PBS (at room\n        temperature). Embryos should immediately be decapitated following\n        removal from the egg.\n      \nNote: Hatched animals should be euthanized\n      in accordance with local legislation, for example with injection of Sodium\n      pentobarbital.\n    \n        Dissect the tissue of interest and rinse in fresh PBS before placing the",
    "sample into a fixative, if required. After fixation, continue with\n        subsequent analysis as required.\n      \nNote: Overnight fixation in 4%\n      paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by graded dehydration into ethanol is\n      sufficient for the fixation of chicken, tortoise and crocodiles.\n      Additionally, fixation and long-term storage in 10% neutral buffered\n      formalin can be used to avoid subsequent dehydration of samples, which may\n      result in some morphological deformation of embryonic samples."
