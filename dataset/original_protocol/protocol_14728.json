    "All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Colorado State University, and all adult participants provided written informed consent prior to completing any study procedures. Written informed consent was provided by parents of participants under 18, and minor participants also provided written assent prior to completing any study procedures.\n1. Revised Dual Task Screen (DTS)\nLower Extremity (LE) Subtask\n\t\nStart the single motor condition.\n\t\t\nPlace three yoga blocks in a horizontal position exactly 4.5 m apart along an 18 m walkway.\nFirmly attach smart devices to each ankle to detect heel strikes and obtain gait characteristics.\nBegin video recording with a camcorder on a tripod.\nInstruct participants to walk as quickly as possible while stepping over obstacles. Start data collection on the smartphones and sharply tap the devices simultaneously for subsequent time alignment of the two separate data streams from the left and right legs. \nMeasure the time-to-complete with a hand-operated stopwatch.\nStop video recording.\nStart the single cognitive condition.\n\t\t\nTell the participant his/her allocated time for this condition, using the time-to-complete from his/her single motor condition (rounding up to a full second).\nBegin video recording with a camcorder on a tripod.\nInstruct participants to state as many words as they can that begin with a particular letter (A or F).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Letters are counter-balanced between participants and between the single and dual task conditions. Numbers are counter-balanced between participants and between the single and dual task conditions.\nStop video recording.\nStart the dual task condition.\n\t\t\nBegin video recording with a camcorder on a tripod.\nInstruct participants to walk as quickly as possible while stepping over obstacles while simultaneously stating as many words as they can that begin with a particular letter (A or F). Rapidly tap both accelerometers to start the condition.",
    "Measure the time-to-complete with a hand-operated stopwatch.\nStop video recording.\nUpper Extremity (UE) subtask\n\t\nStart the single motor condition.\n\t\t\nMeasure a distance of 1.5 m away from a wall, mark with masking tape, and instruct the participant to stand behind the tape.\nPlace a basket of tennis balls next to the participant.\nBegin video recording with a camcorder on a tripod.\nInstruct the participant to complete a wall-toss with alternating hands for 30 s. Tell the participant that if he/she fails to catch a ball, to acquire a new ball from the basket of tennis balls. Measure time elapsed with a stopwatch.\nStop video recording.\nStart the single cognitive condition.\n\t\t\nBegin video recording with a camcorder on a tripod.\nTell the participant that he/she will be asked to sequentially subtract by 7 from a given number (100 or 150) for 30 seconds. Measure time elapsed with a stopwatch.\nStop video recording.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Letters are counter-balanced between participants and between the single and dual task conditions. Numbers are counter-balanced between participants and between the single and dual task conditions.\nStart the dual task condition.\n\t\t\nAsk the participant to stand 1.5 m away from a wall.\nPlace a basket of tennis balls next to participant.\nBegin video recording with a camcorder on a tripod.\nInstruct the participant to complete a wall-toss with alternating hands for 30 seconds. Inform the participant that, while throwing and catching the balls, he/she will be asked to sequentially subtract by 7 from a given number (100 or 150) for 30 seconds. Tell the participant that if he/she fails to catch a ball, to acquire a new ball from the basket of tennis balls. Measure time elapsed with a stopwatch.\nStop video recording.",

Numbers are counter-balanced between participants and between the single and dual task conditions.\n2. Neuroimaging-Compatible Dual Task Screen (DTS)\nSet up the DTS\n\t\nPlace yoga blocks in a vertical position to mark the start and end of a 15 m walkway.\nPlace two yoga blocks in a horizontal position exactly 5 m apart along the 15 m walkway.\nMeasure and mark with masking tape a distance 1.5 m away from a smooth wall surface.\nSet up a tripod at the beginning of the 15 m walkway.\nPlace the fNIRS device on participant’s head.\n\t\nMeasure the participant’s head circumference and select appropriately sized fNIRS cap (Table of Materials) with pre-placed optodes and short-channel detectors.\nTurn on a dedicated acquisition laptop and connect to the fNIRS device’s WiFi network.\nOpen the fNIRS acquisition software and select the fNIRS device.\nPerform calibration to optimize light intensity and check optode signal levels. Signal levels should be acceptable or excellent.\nFix all optodes with less than acceptable signal level by removing the optode from the cap and parting the participant’s hair to ensure a direct connection of the optode to the participant’s scalp.\nPlace accelerometers on the participant’s ankles.\n\t\nFirmly attach smart devices to each ankle to detect heel strikes and obtain gait characteristics.\nBegin LE subtask data acquisition.\n\t\nOpen the stimulus presentation software (Table of Materials).\nSelect the LE subtask file.\nAsk the participant to sit in a chair in preparation for a 60 s quiet rest period.\nReturn to the fNIRS acquisition software and click the Start button to begin collecting fNIRS data. Enter subject ID_LE, age, and sex into the pop-up window and click Start.",
    "Return to the stimulus presentation software, inform the participant that quiet rest will begin, and press Space to start the 60 s rest period.\nAt the end of the rest period, identify which LE Subtask condition (single motor, single cognitive, or dual task) has been selected for the 1st trial. Provide participant with instructions for that trial.\n\t\t\nSingle Motor Instructions: Instruct the participant to walk as quickly as possible, while stepping over the obstacles, for 30 s. Tell participant that he/she will start when the primary researcher says “Start”. This will occur immediately after a secondary researcher taps the accelerometers. Instruct the participant that he/she should stop walking when the primary researcher says “stop.” Additionally, when the primary researcher says “stop,” the participant should put his/her feet together and remain as still as possible. At this time, the secondary researcher will tap the accelerometers a second time and place a marker (sticky note) on the floor where the participant stopped.\nSingle Cognitive Instructions: Instruct the participant to remain standing at the start of the 15 m walkway. While standing, he/she will be asked to state as many words as possible that begin with a particular letter.",
    "Dual Task Instructions: Instruct the participant to walk as quickly as possible while stepping over the obstacles and simultaneously stating as many words as possible beginning with a particular letter. Inform him/her that he/she will also have 30 seconds for this condition. Tell participant that he/she will start when the primary researcher says “start”. This will occur immediately after a secondary researcher taps the accelerometers. Instruct the participant that he/she should stop walking when the primary researcher says “stop.” Additionally, when the primary researcher says “stop,” the participant should put his/her feet together and remain as still as possible.

Monitor the 30 s timer on the stimulus presentation software; tell the participant to stop when 30 s have elapsed.\nIdentify the 2nd trial and provide the participant with instructions. Repeat the process until the participant has completed 15 randomized trials of the LE Subtask.\nStop video recording.\nInform the participant that he/she will complete another 60 s seated rest period. Once the participant is seated, press Start to begin the rest period.\nFollowing the rest period, exit out of the LE subtask file in the stimulus presentation software. Stop data acquisition in fNIRS data acquisition software, but do not exit the software.",
    "NOTE: Letters are randomized (by the stimulus presentation software) between trials and counter-balanced between participants and between single and dual task conditions. Letters are similar in level of difficulty and include: W, D, F, T, S, H, M, A, B, and P.
