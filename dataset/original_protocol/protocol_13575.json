    "All mouse procedures described herein were approved by the Animal Studies Committees at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. The radiation protocol was approved by the Radiation Safety Advisory Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.\n1. Amino acid uptake in cells (Protocol I)\nPlate 5 x 104 ST2 cells in each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate. Plate cells in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 µg/mL streptomycin (Pen/Strep). Plate extra wells of cells to quantify the cell number per condition for the normalizations in step 1.12. Incubate cells in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nCulture the cells for 2-3 days until confluent.\nOn the day of the experiment, prepare the following solutions: 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), pH 7.4 and Krebs Ringers HEPES (KRH) buffer, pH 8.0: (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, NaHCO3, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM D-Glucose). Prewarm to 37 °C.\nAspirate the medium and wash the cells twice with 1 mL of 1x PBS, pH 7.4.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is also appropriate for rapidly dividing non-confluent cells. In this case, it is important to normalize the radioactivity to either absolute cell number or DNA content. In addition, consider increasing the size of the culture plate or flask to increase the overall cell number and cpm values. This is important to determine empirically on an individual basis.\nAspirate 1x PBS and wash the cells once with 1 mL KRH.\nMake 4 µCi/mL L-[3,4-3H]-Glutamine working media by diluting 4 µL of [1 µCi µL-1] L-[3,4-3H]-Glutamine stock per 1 mL of KRH.",
    "NOTE: Before using radioactive materials, please contact the Office of Radiation Safety at your home institution to obtain approvals. All the procedures related to radiation must be performed behind the plexiglass shield.\nIncubate cells with 0.5 mL of KRH containing 4 µCi/mL L-[3,4-3H]-Glutamine working media for 5 min.\nCollect the radioactive medium and dispense into the liquid waste container. Wash the cells three times briefly with ice-cold KRH to terminate the reaction. Collect and discard all the washes in the radioactive liquid waste container.\nAdd 1 mL of 1% SDS to each well and triturate 10x to lyse and homogenize the cells. Transfer the cell lysates to 1.5 mL tubes. Discard cell culture plates, serological pipettes, and pipette tips in the solid radioactive waste container.\nCentrifuge at >10,000 x g for 10 min. Transfer the supernatants to scintillation vials containing 8 mL of the scintillation solution. Mix by shaking the scintillation vials vigorously. Discard tubes and pipette tips in solid radioactive waste container.\nRead radioactivity in counts per minute (cpm) using a Scintillation counter. Discard scintillation vials in scintillation vial waste container.\nTrypsinize, resuspend, and count the cells from the remaining non-radioactive plates of cells (see step 1.1) to estimate the number of cells in the lysed, radioactive cultures. Using a hemocytometer, count the number of cells per non-radioactive well for each experimental condition. Normalize the cpm from step 1.11 to the estimated cell number from the non-radioactive plates.\nAfter completion of the experiment, decontaminate the cell culture hood, bench, and all instruments with a radioactivity decontaminant spray. Finally, perform wipe tests to ensure the working area is radiation-free.\n2. Amino acid uptake in freshly isolated bone tissues (Protocol II)\nPrewarm KRH to 37 °C.",
    "Euthanize a 3-day-old mouse and remove the skin on the arms. Disarticulate the humeri from the shoulder using scissors and dissect out both humeri. Remove all extemporaneous tissues using a scalpel and forceps. Remove the epiphyses from the bone.\n\tNOTE: In addition to humerii, this protocol can be adapted to neonatal femora, tibiae and calvariae as well as humerii, femora and tibiae isolated from 2- and 4-month-old mice (unpublished data).\nFlush out marrow from the bone and weigh the bone shafts to normalize in step 2.14.\nBoil one humerus in 1x PBS at 100 °C for 10 min to decellularize the bone. The decellularized boiled bone is used as a negative control.\n\tNOTE: As a quality control, paraffin embed the boiled and non-boiled bones for histological stains to visually confirm that boiling was efficacious in decellularizing the bone.\nEquilibrate both humeri in 1 mL of KRH for 30 min in the cell culture incubator at 37 °C.\nMake a working solution of 4 µCi/mL L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arginine in KRH by diluting 4 µL of 1µCi/µL L-[2,3,4-3H]- Arginine stock per 1 mL KRH.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is appropriate to evaluate the uptake of whichever radiolabeled nutrient is chosen. L-[2,3,4-3H]-glutamine, L-[14CU]-alanine, and L-[2,3-3H]-proline have been tested with similar results. Arginine data is shown to highlight the utility of this protocol.\n\tCAUTION: All the procedures using radiation must be performed behind the plexiglass shield while using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).\nIncubate both the experimental and boiled control bone separately in KRH containing 4 µCi/mL L-[2,3,4-3H]-Arginine for up to 90 min at 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: It is important to empirically determine the incubation times for different conditions including the age of the mice, different skeletal elements and the types of radiolabeled amino acids by performing a time course. Saturation mostly occurs after approximately 3-4 h. Uptake should be evaluated at a timepoint in the linear rage of uptake.\nRemove the radioactive medium and discard in the liquid radioactive waste container. Wash humeri three times using ice cold 1 mL of KRH to terminate the reaction. Discard all the washes in the liquid radioactive waste container.\nTransfer each bone into a 1.5 mL tube. Add 500 µL of RIPA buffer [150 mM NaCl; 5 mM EDTA; 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0); 0.5% NP40 (v/v); 0.5% DOX (w/v); 0.1% SDS (w/v)]. Discard the culture plates, serological pipettes, and pipette tips in a radioactive solid waste container.\nHomogenize the humeri by chopping 100 times with scissors in a RIPA buffer.\nSonicate (Amplitude: 35%, Pulse 1 s) the resulting homogenized bone for 10 s.\n\tNOTE: Sonication is also known to produce aerosols. Sonication steps can be performed in a biological safety cabinet. To reduce aerosol formation, it is important to not overfill the tubes. Sonication of small sample volumes can result in incomplete sonication or sample loss due to foaming. If foaming occurs, centrifuge the sample for 5 min to settle.\nClarify the lysate by centrifugation for 10 min at >10,000 x g at room temperature. Transfer 200 µL of the supernatant to scintillation vials containing 8 mL of the scintillation solution. Mix by shaking the scintillation vials vigorously. Discard all solid radioactive waste (e.g., used tubes, pipette tips, plates, etc.) in the solid radioactive waste container.\nRead radioactivity (cpm) using the Scintillation counter. Discard used scintillation vials in the radioactive waste container designated for scintillation vials.",
    "Subtract the cpm of boiled bone (basal value) from the cpm of experimental bone. Normalize the radioactivity with bone weight from step 2.3.\nSpray the cell culture hood, instruments, and bench with radioactivity decontaminant. Perform wipe tests to confirm the working area is radiation-free.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
