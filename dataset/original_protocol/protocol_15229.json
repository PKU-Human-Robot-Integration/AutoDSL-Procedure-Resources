    "1. Experimental Animals\nObtain a Local Ethics Committee approval for all experiments which will be performed, in accordance with the animal protection FELASA guidelines.    \nUse female Sprague-Dawley rats available to purchase from any commercial breeder (e.g. Charles River Wiga GmbH, Sulzfeld, Germany). We used 21 animals divided in three groups of 7 animals each that were sacrificed at 3, 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. At the time of purchase, the animals should be 12 weeks of age and weigh 250-300 g.\nKeep the animals in climate-controlled rooms having an ambient temperature of 21 °C, 60% relative humidity and a 12-hr light-dark cycle with free access to food and water. \n2. Anesthesia and Operative Preparation\nInduce general anesthesia by using a Plexiglas box connected to the anesthesia machine, set at an oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min, and an isofluorane vaporizer with 5 % anesthetic gas.    \nMaintain the anesthesia with the isofluorane vaporizer at 1.5 % as soon as the deep sensory reflexes of the animals are suppressed. \nFix the rats in supine position on a body warming plate. \nPrepare the operation region of each animal by removing its fur with a depilation cream, from the jaw angle down to 2 cm below the manubrium sterni. \nPrepare a sterile surgical field by paying attention to the surgical area, the area prepared on the animal and the front of the surgeon: \n  \nClean the benchtop with a disinfectant.      \nPrepare the incision site by using multiple applications of surgical scrub solution (e.g. Chlorhexidine and 70% isopropyl alcohol). Apply the Chlorhexidine first, the alcohol second and, finally, the scrub solution.      \nWear a disposable surgical gown and surgical gloves, or alternatively, exam gloves that have been previously washed with a surgical disinfectant. \nUse sterile microsurgery instruments in the operation procedure.",
    "Use an operation microscope (Wild Heerbrugg M650, Gais, Switzerland) in 10-20-fold magnification. \n3. Anatomy\nFigure 1 depicts the anatomy of the rat's neck:\n1a) Situs before transection of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle.\n1b) Situs after transection of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle.\n4. Cuff Preparation\nCut the cuffs in a length of 3 mm by hand from a plastic tube (Portex, inner diameter 0.75 mm, outer diameter 0.94 mm, Smiths Medical, UK). These cuffs consist of a tubular cuff body including the complete volume of the plastic tube, and a cuff handle consisting of half of the cuff volume. Both the cuff body and the cuff handle should be equally long. The cuff handle is essential for manipulating the cuff during the surgical procedure. After the cuff is slipped over the vessel, a mini Bulldog  clamp is placed simultaneously on the cuff handle and the vessel, in order to prevent from bleeding, keep the cuff in position and ensure stability.\n5. Cuff Technique\nSlip the cuff over the vessel.  \nImmediately afterwards, evert the vessel, pull it over the outside of the cuff body and fix it with a 7-0 silk ligature. In this manner, the lumen of the cuff is covered with endothelium. Thereafter, slip the venous graft over the cuff body and fix it with a new 7-0 silk ligature. To prevent thrombus formation, it is essential to fasten the vein graft tie very close to the cuff margin in order to avoid the blood from contacting the tie holding the artery in place. This is crucial for the distal anastomosis due to the blood flow direction. However, according to the authors, it is not considered essential for the proximal anastomosis for the same reason. \n6. Surgical Procedure\n6.1 Preparation of the right external jugular vein",
    "Make an approximate 2.5 cm-long median cervical incision direct above the manubrium sterni.\nCompletely separate a 1 cm-long segment of the right external jugular vein from the surrounding tissues \nLigate the venous tributaries with 7-0 silk sutures. \n6.2 Preparation of the right common carotid artery\nPrepare the sternocleidomastoid muscle and transect it in the middle.\nPrepare the right common carotid artery carefully, making sure not to compress the artery or the Vagus nerve. Mobilize it from the carotid bifurcation down to the brachiocephalic trunk. \nSubsequently, ligate it twice in the middle with 7-0 silk sutures before transection. \nSlip a nylon cuff consisting of a body and a handle (Figure 2a) over the distal end of the common carotid artery, whereby it is important to ensure that the cuff handle is behind the vessel (Figure 2b).\nClamp the cuffed end of the distal common carotid artery with a mini Bulldog  clamp exactly on the cuff handle to ensure stability (Figure 2c). \nSubsequently, cut the artery directly behind the ligature, whereby the resulting arterial stump should be as long as the cuff body.\nRinse the arterial lumen with heparin-saline solution (20 IU heparin/ ml 0.9% NaCl). Set a ligation loop aside in the proper position for later use. \nPull the arterial stump up and slip it like a sleeve over the cuff body. \nSubsequently, pull the ligation loop and knot it tightly.\nTo prevent the artery from slipping out of its sleeve, you may implement a trick: grasp both the arterial wall and the suture with the right hand simultaneously and with the left-hand forceps (Figure 2d) make the knot (Figure 2e). \nRepeat the same procedure for the proximal arterial stump (Figure 2f). \n6.3 Venous graft positioning\nExcise a 1 cm-long segment of the clamped external jugular vein",
    "Since the two cuffed arteries are too far apart from each other for the venous interposition, approximate the correct distance for this procedure using a 3-0 Vicryl-suture which you should loop around each mini Bulldog clamp. \nCriss-cross both sutures.\nSubsequently, pull the sutures in opposite directions, enabling the proper positioning of the cuffed arterial stumps (Figure 2g) \nRinse the vein segment with the heparin-saline solution. \nSlip one end of the previously reversed vein segment over the cuffed distal carotid artery and secure it in the correct position with a silk 7-0 ligature. \nIt is important to note here that the circumference of the vein must be completely and evenly grasped. \nRinse the vein segment with heparin-saline-solution, and slip the other end of the vein segment over the proximal carotid stump. \nComplete the ligation (Figure 2h); \nRemove the mini Bulldog clamps one after the other, first on the distal carotid artery stump and then on the proximal one, thereby allowing unobstructed blood flow and the arterialization of the venous graft (Figure 2i).\n    The surgery is considered successful if blood flow and pulsation are observed within the graft and the common carotid artery (assessed visually). \n6.4. Wound closure\nFor the subcutaneous running suture, use  4-0 Vicryl. For a cutaneous running suture, use 3-0 Vicryl.\n7. Recovery and Postoperative Management\nLet the animals recover from anesthesia on a flat paper bedding under an infrared warming lamp. Do not return the operated animals to the animal holding area until all animals appear normal.    \nPostoperatively administer Buprenorphine (Temgesic) in the concentration of 0.03-0.05 mg/kg b.w. sc every 8-12 hr for 2 days. Buprenorphine can be administered just before isofluorane induction. \nMonitor animals postoperatively for their general condition and signs of illness or infections. \n8. Blood Flow Measurement",
    "The postoperative patency of the graft was proved by blood flow measurement, by using a research Transonic blood flow measurement system (Model: TS420, Transonic Systems Europe B.V., Maastricht, The Netherlands) with a perivascular flowprobe (3 mm, MA3PSB). The system is based on the Doppler principle.\n9. Representative Results\nBy faithfully keeping the instructions aforementioned, the mean duration of the surgical operations was about 65 min. The animals presented an excellent physical condition and gained weight as expected throughout the whole experiment:   at the starting point of operation the animals weighed 312±20.39 g. At the sacrifice time point of 3 weeks post-operatively the animals weighed 325.2±28.7 g, at 6 weeks 333±39.9 g and at 12 weeks 362.22±29 g. \nNo infections were observed at the operation site and no sores developed.  The operation wounds healed completely at the expected time. The neurological control showed no signs of brain infarction or motoric deficiency. The later was an important point since the animals were operated in the carotid artery and one of the two external jugular veins was removed and used as auto-transplant. No allergic reactions to the postoperative pain alleviation therapy were observed. \nAll animals were vigilant and social throughout the whole experiment. Their habits concerning receiving food and water remained unchanged throughout the whole time.\nThe survival rate of all experiments was 100 % at the time point of sacrifice. The graft patency rate was 60 % for the first 10 operated animals and accordingly 82 % for the remaining 11 animals. The total graft patency was 71 %. The blood flow in the arterialized venous grafts was measured at the time point of sacrifice and was 8±3 ml/min without any statistically significant differences between the three sacrifice time points.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4124/4124fig1.jpg",
