The dissection may be performed at room temperature, with sterile conditions.\nEmbryo proper, yolk sac and placenta are taken out of the uterus from a pregnant mouse.\nChose EGFP placentas by fluorescence microscopy.\nSeparate the placenta from embryo proper and yolk sac (Pereira et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nRemove out maternal decidua attached placenta by inserting the two pairs of forceps between fetal and maternal sides and forcing them apart (Ottersbach and Dzierzak, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nPlacentas are placed in DPBS in a 60 mm dish on ice.\nNote: Fresh placental tissue should be used to isolate HE cells for co-culture.\nPreparation of cell suspension\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nThis step is to disaggregate the placentas and prepare a single-cell suspension ready for flow cytometry analysis (Gekas et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPlacentas are washed in DPBS twice on ice.\nNote: To minimize contamination with maternal blood cells, the placenta is placed in a 60 mm dish and is rinsed several times with DPBS until no obvious blood clots observed. About 8–10 mL DPBS is needed to wash the blood clots of placentas.\nTransfer per placenta into 1.5 mL tubes with pre-warmed digestion medium containing 1mL 1 mg/mL Collagenase Type I-A that add 0.04% DNase I, followed by mechanical dissection with 20G and 25G needles.\nNote: For each placenta at E11.0, prepare 1 mL Collagenase Type I-A, and a suitable volume should be adapted depending on the size of the placenta. Before dissecting per placenta with 20G and 25G needles, it is better to cut the placenta into fragments with ophthalmic scissor.",
    "Digest placentas at 37°C for 30 min in a shaking incubator with 100 revolutions per minute.\nCentrifuge tubes at 310 g for 5 min at 4°C and carefully discard the supernatant.\nPlacentas are washed in DPBS and centrifuged, and added 500 μL Accutase for 6–8 min at 37°C in a shaking incubator with 100 revolutions per minute.\nAdd 500 μL 2% FBS/DMEM and centrifuge tubes at 310 g for 5 min at 4°C and carefully discard the supernatant.\nRBC lysis buffer (1 mL) treatment for 5–10min at room temperature.\nThen tissues are centrifuged and washed in 1 mL 2% FBS/DMEM.\nFilter the cells using single-use cell strainers (BD Falcon, 352235) to make a single-cell suspension. Wash the strainer with 300 μL 2% FBS/DMEM into original tubes.\nCentrifuge tubes at 310 g for 5 min at 4°C and prepare for antibody staining.\nNote: If you used this protocol for other hematopoietic tissues, such as yolk sac or AGM region, the digestion steps, especially digestion time, may need to be optimized. Transfer per yolk sac or AGM tissue into 1.5 mL tubes with pre-warmed digestion medium containing 300 μL 1 mg/mL Collagenase Type I-A adding 1.2 μL DNase I, followed by mechanical dissection with 25G needles, and then digest it at 37°C for 15–20 minutes.\nCritical: It is important that all tissues should be digested. Make sure that there are no visible clumps of tissue after these steps.\nStain with antibody for surface antigen\nTiming: 40–50 min\nThis step is to label cells of single-cell suspension for surface antigens.\nPrepare enough antibody dilution to stain all samples, according to antibody operating instruction. Prepare antibody dilution in 2% FBS/DMEM. For example, we dilute CD45-APC-eFluor 780 antibody into 1:100 for one test.",
    "Note: Appropriate volume of antibody dilution should be prepared according to the concentration of cell. Cell number should be determined empirically, and can range from 106 to 108 cells/mL.\nFor each test, the cells are incubated with antibody mix for 30 min at 4°C, protected from light.\nNote: For per 100 μL antibody mix, it is composed of 1.25 μL anti-CD44-PE, 0.25 μL anti-CD45-APC-eFluor-780, 1.25 μL anti-Ter119-PE-Cyanine 5, 2.5 μL anti-CD31-PE-Cyanine 7 and 95 μL 2% FBS/DMEM.\nCentrifuge tubes at 310 g for 5 min at 4°C and carefully discard the supernatant.\nResuspend in appropriate volume of DPBS. And then the cells are incubated with 5 μL 7-AAD (in 100 μL DPBS) for 10 min at 4°C, protected from light.\nCentrifuge tubes at 310 g for 5 min at 4°C and carefully discard the supernatant.\nResuspend in appropriate volume of 2% FBS/DMEM.\nCritical: For all samples, the volume of resuspended medium should depend on the cell number. Make sure the cell density is ranging from 106 to 108 cells/mL.\nCo-culture HE cells with OP9-DL1 cells\nTiming: 1.5–2 h, depending on number of samples and cells\nThis step is to identify the hematopoietic potential of placental HE cells.\nThe HE cells (GFP+CD44+CD31+CD45-Ter119-) are sorted from the EGFP+ placentas using a flow cytometer. The live cells are gated as 7-AAD-negative cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1099-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Experimental strategy and data example\n(Left) Experimental strategy for FACS analysis (A), co-culture analysis (B) and hematopoietic potential analysis (C). (Right) Representative experimental data. Scale bars, 50 μm.\nNote: To eliminate the RBC, Ter119-negitive cells are gated. To eliminate the contamination of maternal cells, GFP-positive cells are gated. Then the hematopoietic cells, CD45+ cells were eliminated. HE cells are gated as GFP+CD44+CD31+CD45-Ter119- cells.",
    "Change the OP9-DL1 culture medium to co-culture medium (500 μL/well), which is composed of MEM α, 10% FBS, 1% PS, 1% LG and cytokines, 100 ng/mL SCF, 100 ng/mL Flt3L and 100 ng/mL IL3 (Li et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCritical: Fresh co-culture medium should be used.\nSort 100 HE cells to pre-prepared 24-well plate which has been cultured OP9-DL1 stromal cells 1 day before.\nNote: The ratio of HE cells to OP9-DL1 stromal cells is 1: 200–400.\nPut the 24-well plate into the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNote: Stop here and renew co-culture medium the next day.\nColony-forming unit cell (CFU-C) assay\nTiming: 12–20 days\nThis step is to detect the hematopoietic function of cells derived from HE cells.\nRenew half of the co-culture medium (250 μL) every day.\nNote: After 5 days, HE cells co-cultured with OP9-DL1 stromal cells are collected for further analysis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: Only remove the top of co-culture medium. Do not remove the entire medium, as this will lead to the loss of HE or hematopoietic cells.\nGently blow and collect all co-culture medium into 1.5 mL tubes and then centrifuge tubes at 310g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Hematopoietic cells are semi-adherent, and gently blowing of each well with a pipette gun can gain most of hematopoietic cells.\nFilter the cells using single-use cell strainers to make a single cell suspension.\nIncubate surface antibody (anti-CD45-APC-eFluor-780) for 30 min at 4°C, protected from light, as above mentioned.\nCentrifuge tubes at 310 g for 5 min at 4°C and carefully discard the supernatant.\nResuspend in appropriate volume of DPBS, and then the cells are incubated with 7-AAD, protected from light, as above mentioned.\nCentrifuge tubes at 310 g for 5 min at 4°C and carefully discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend in appropriate volume of 2% FBS/DMEM.\nThe CD45+ hematopoietic cells are harvested by FACS, and the live cells are gated as 7-AAD-negative cells.\nAdd 1000 collected cells into MethoCult GF M3434 medium (500 μL) in ultra-low attachment 24-well plates for CFU-C assay.\nNote: To avoid contamination, PS (5 μL) should be selectively added into the medium. 1.0 mL injection syringe without a needle is used to mix the cells and medium.\nAfter cultured for 7–15 days at 37°C in 5% CO2, the number of colonies, including CFU-granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM) and CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, and megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) are distinguished based on the morphology and counted with an inverted microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C)."
