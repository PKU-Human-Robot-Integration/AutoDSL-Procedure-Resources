    "Our study was performed with permission of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Landesverwaltungsamt Halle, according to section 8 of the German law for animal protection. (§ 8, paragraph 1 of the German law for animal protection from 18.05.2016 - BGBI. I S. 1206, 1313, § 31 TierSchVersV from 13.08.2013).\nNOTE: For the experiments here, 8 to 12 week old male BALB/c mice were used, and human monocytes from blood donors were used for the visualization of monocytes via intravital microscopy.\n1. Cell Preparation\nNOTE: For the isolation of monocytes, please see our previous published video on JoVE for instructions: \"Isolation and Intravenous Injection of Murine Bone Marrow Derived Monocytes\" by Wagner et al.4\nNOTE: When working with the cells all steps must be sterile to avoid contamination.\nCell Staining with 3,3'-Dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine Perchlorate\nResuspend the cells in serum free culture medium with a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Only serum free medium enables an efficient staining, since the lipophilic dye would otherwise already be captured by lipophilic components of the serum.\nAdd 5 µL of 1 mM 3,3'-Dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate in dimethylformamide to 1 mL of the cell suspension and resuspend carefully.\nIncubate the cell solution at 37 °C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the cells at 37 °C and 500 x g for 5 min.\nDislodge the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 37 °C warm fetal calf serum supplemented medium.\nRepeat the steps 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 twice.\nCount the cells with the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56290/56290eq1.jpg\nResuspend the cells with 150 µL sterile 0.9% NaCl solution.\nInject the cells into the tail vein.\n2. Anesthesia\nInhalation Anesthesia\nVaporize isoflurane with the help of a vaporizer using a concentration of 5% in a closed bin under a chemical safety hood.\nHandle the mouse carefully and put it into the bin.",
    "Handle the animal by the skin of the posterior neck after it has stopped moving.\nIntraperitoneal Anesthesia\n\tNOTE: Use isoflurane anesthesia, described under step 2.1, to perform an intraperitoneal injection. With the fast recovery and short-acting narcotic effect of the isoflurane anesthesia, it is easier to handle the mouse and inject intraperitoneal anesthesia.\n\t\nUse a solution of 2.4 mL Ketamine (10%), 0.8 mL Xylazine (2%), and 6.8 mL NaCl (0.9%) for the intraperitoneal injection.\nWeigh the animal before applying anesthetic.\n\t\tNOTE: The formula for the anesthetic is:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56290/56290eq2.jpg\nUse a 1 mL insulin syringe with a 30 G needle to inject the solution into the left underbelly.\nPlace the mouse in its cage and wait for narcotic effect.\n\t\tNOTE: The narcotic effect normally appears within 5 min if the injection was successful. The correct depth of the anesthesia can be determined by the absence of either the lid reflex or reaction to toe pinch, as well as a regular, controlled rate of breathing.\n3. Implantation of Basement Membrane-like Matrix\nNOTE: This method is used by our group to study tumor angiogenesis after monocyte injection. Depending on the experiments, growth factors can be added to the basement membrane-like matrix. We performed femoral artery ligation before injecting the tumor in the flank of the mouse. The matrix must have a temperature of 4 °C for the injection. At this temperature, the matrix is fluid; the gel hardens to a solid at body temperature (37 °C). For better visibility of the subcutaneous matrix plug, shave the skin of the mouse at the injection site.\nNote:Optional: Add 100 ng basic fibroblast growth factor, 300 ng vascular endothelial growth factor, and 26 I.U. heparin under sterile conditions to the basement membrane-like matrix.",
    "Load 1 mL of matrix into a 30 G insulin syringe and store on ice until use.\nLay the animal on the table and hold the skin of the mouse next to the injection site on the flank.\nInject 500 µL of the basement membrane-like matrix subcutaneously.\n\tNOTE: For practical reasons, it is necessary to inject the basement membrane-like matrix compactly at one location to avoid subcutaneous dispersion. It will be easier to dislodge the artificial tumor from the tissue after sacrificing the mouse at the end of the experiment.\n4. Tail Vein Injection\nNOTE: Practice the tail vein injection with NaCl solution on test animals before experimentation. If the monocytes cannot be adequately injected in the tail vein, there will be no systemic effect on the collateralization. In this protocol, we injected 2.5 million monocytes. Try to inject no more than 5 µL/g of bodyweight.\nUse the monocyte solution prepared under step 1.1.8 containing 2.5 million monocytes.\nUse a 30 G needle and a 1 mL insulin syringe for the injection.\nCarefully handle the mouse, restrain the animal in the restrainer, and make sure the mouse is not harmed and has adequate space for breathing.\nPut the restrainer on the heating pad so that the tail can contact the plate.\nIdentify the tail veins, which are located on the lateral side of the tail.\nTurn the tail 90 °, so the tail vein appears on the upper side of the tail.\nDisinfect the injection side before injecting the monocytes.\nTry to inject the monocyte solution in a flat angle with the bevel of the needle facing up.\n\tNOTE: Stop the injection if a blister appears, as this is a sign of a failed injection. Attempt the procedure again more proximally.",
    "Stop bleeding at the injection site by applying gentle pressure on the tail for about 60s.\nObserve the animal for 30 min to monitor for systemic side effects and place the mouse in its cage after the animal has fully recovered.\n5. Intravital Microscopy\nPreparation\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on the heating pad (37 °C) to keep a constant temperature and fix the paws in place with adhesive tape.\nDisinfect the skin at the site of the leg or flank that is used for microscopy.\nShave the region of interest for better handling and to avoid interference with hair.\nExcise the skin with a sterile scalpel and fine forceps in a square area of 0.5 x 0.5 cm.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to keep the region of interest moist; otherwise, the quality of images and tissue will be compromised. NaCl solution can be used to moisten the area.\nPlace the leg between two adjustable stamps and position a cover glass on top of the stamps.\nEnsure the tissue is wet and is in contact with the glass.\nInject 50 µL rhodamine dextran retrobulbar into the venous system for better visibility of the vessels.\nStart microscopy and adjust the position of the leg if needed.\nIntravital microscopy settings\nTurn on the microscope, computer, electronic interfaces, and lasers.\nTurn on the heating unit of incubation chamber and/or heating stage (plate/pad), and set the temperature to 37 °C.\nStart the acquisition software. If the microscope is equipped with a resonant scanner, select this fast scanning mode.\nWait until the temperature reaches a constant level (35 - 37 °C)",
    "NOTE: A stable temperature is important for: (a) the mouse, which under anesthesia cannot control its body temperature, and (b) avoiding or at least minimizing focal drift. This could take 1 h to several hours, depending on the surrounding conditions (e.g., air conditioning system and the number of heat sources in the room, including people). If immersion objectives are used, the contact zone between the lens and cover glass (or tissue) is a typical source of instability. Heating the lens with an objective heater may help; alternatively, a microscope with an autofocus system is highly recommended.\nSelect a magnification lens with a high numeral aperture that fulfils the resolution requirements of the experiment (see note at the end of this section).\nOptimize the microscope settings with respect to gain, channel settings, scan speed, pixel resolution, depth volume, step size, and averaging before placing the experimental animal on the stage.\nScan bidirectionally to reduce acquisition time.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on the prewarmed microscope stage after the microscope has reached stable conditions and the settings have been tested with the help of a dummy.\nBring the region of interest within the basement membrane-like matrix into focus by using bright light illumination and inspect briefly the capillaries by ultraviolet light with adequate filter settings for the applied fluorophores.\nSwitch to scanning mode; start scanning at low resolution 256 x 256 mode and enhance gain and laser power until a signal is observed on the monitor.\nFocus on the structure of interest. Zoom in until all details are visible.\nDefine \"start\" and \"end\" positions in the axial direction.\nStop scanning.\nDefine stepping size (e.g., 0.5 µm) and number of focal planes (e.g., 10 - 20).",
    "Switch to the final pixel resolution (512 x 512 or 1,024 x 1,024) depending on the speed of the moving subcellular structures or cells and select the scan speed (scan frequency) that fits best to the movements. Bidirectional scanning is recommended to fasten the acquisition of stacks.\n\t\tNOTE: Select the highest scan rate of scanning that gives sufficient image quality. Typical point scanners provide speeds between 400 Hz and 1.4 kHz. Resonant scanners provide an additional 8 kHz or 12 kHz. By reducing the number of lines in the y-direction, the scan rate can be further increased (typical values are 512 x 512, 512 x 256, or 512 x 200 pixel resolution). Depending on the signal-to-noise ratio, one can try to improve the image quality by adding line averaging between 2 and 4. Typically, a setting of 512 x 200 with no averaging results in an acquisition time/frame of 18 ms in the bidirectional mode with an 8 KHz resonant scanner; with 512 x 200 and 4x averaging, it slows down to 56 ms per frame.\nSubscription Required.
