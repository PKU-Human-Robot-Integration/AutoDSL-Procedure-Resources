    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThawing PBMCs\nTiming: 45 min\nThis section describes how PBMCs are thawed before starting the staining procedure. This step must be fast to allow good sample recovery.\nThawing PBMCs.\nPrepare and warm complete RPMI in a water bath at 37°C.\nIn a biological safety cabinet add 5 mL of warm complete RPMI in a 15 mL tube.\nTake PBMC vials from the Liquid Nitrogen tanks and transfer them to the water bath on dry ice.\nCritical: Do this quickly. If the liquid nitrogen is not close to the water bath, cells can be temporarily kept in dry ice before the thawing.\nSlightly open the PBMC vials and swivel them in the water bath until no ice crystals are seen.\nTransfer the vials into the biological safety cabinet and add 1 mL of complete warm RPMI to each vial dropwise, resuspending the cell-medium solution very well using a pipette.\nTransfer the single cell suspension with leukocytes cells in the previously prepared 15 mL tube with the warm medium.\nCritical: Add warm complete RPMI to minimize the risk of osmotic shock dropwise. However, don’t take too long to complete this process. PBMCs that are stored in liquid nitrogen have cryopreservatives (like 10% DMSO) that can be toxic to the cells once thawed so be relatively fast to avoid cell death.\nTop up the tube with complete RPMI and wash the cells at 400 g for 10 min at Room Temperature (RT).\nDiscard the supernatant carefully without losing the pellet.",
    "Resuspend the cells in appropriate volume and count the number of cells. Consider reaching a concentration suitable for counting (typically 0.5–1 x 106 cells/mL). Frozen PBMCs aliquots normally range from 5 × 106 to 20 × 106 total cells, so this means that a suitable resuspension volume could be from 5 to 20 mL (10 mL as a starting point would be a perfect choice). In case cells are too dense to allow proper counting, dilute them more.\nNote: Any cell counter or traditional trypan blue cell counting methods can be conducted.\nCritical: Each washing step may lead to losing cells. In this assay we started with about 5 × 106 live cells per donor in order to have 1 × 106 cells acquired per donor. This number of cells was more than enough to detect the populations of interest. The starting number of cells can be scaled down to 1 × 106 live cells, if necessary.\nIn vitro H2O2 and menadione treatment of human PBMCs to generate redox-positive controls\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to generate positive controls to confirm that the assay can detect superoxide anion changes. Additionally, resting cells after thawing is also important as thawing can be a stressful process to PBMCs.\nTreating PBMCs\nOnce counted, resuspend the cells in RPMI 2% FCS at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL and split the suspension into 3 flasks, tubes, or plates.\nLabel two flasks as the oxidative controls.\nIn one control allow the H2O2 reagent to reach a 50 μM final concentration and the Menadione control to also reach a 50 μM final concentration.\nKeep the other flask untreated and place both flasks in an incubator for 1 h at 37°C.",
    "Note: To find the optimal H2O2 and Menadione concentration and time of treatment for your experiment and type of cells, conduct appropriate test experiments. Here we tested a variety of concentrations and times and found that a 1 h treatment and a 50 μM concentration of H2O2 was enough to demonstrate a redox related shift after staining with redox related markers. We start from a H2O2 stock concentration of 0.9 M (3 wt% ), thus we take 1 μL of this stock solution, dilute it 1:9000 in RPMI 2% FCS to generate an intermediate dilution of 100 μM and accordingly dilute 1:2 with the cell suspension to reach a final concentration of 50 μM. For Menadione, we start from a stock concentration of 100 mM and accordingly dilute 1:500 with the cell suspension to reach a final concentration of 50 μM.\nSample and staining control preparation\nTiming: 10 min\nThis section of the protocol lists the samples and the controls necessary for the assay. Together with the full stained samples, additional staining controls have to be prepared. A Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) or a Fluorescence Minus X (FMX) control is a tube of cells labeled with all but one of more fluorophores respectively. In multi-color immunofluorescent investigations, FMO or FMX controls are employed to define the cut-off point between background fluorescence and positive populations during analysis. In this assay, we used an FMX control labeled for all the marker with the exception of MVG, MSG, Nrf2, TTV, SOD1.\nPreparing Controls.\nCollect treated and untreated cells in 15 mL tubes.",
    "From the untreated sample take about 0.5 × 106 cells, place them into a separate 15 mL tube and label it as a FMX tube. The other cells (about 2 × 106 cells in our case) will be used for the full staining, to detect the redox status in the population of interest.\nFrom the treated sample, keep aside about 0.5 × 106 cells to use for compensation controls (see step 12).\nNote: The other treated cells (about 2 × 106 cells in our case) will be used for the full staining in treated sample, as positive controls of the redox markers in the population of interest. Please refer to the illustration in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] to clarify this step.\nLive/dead staining\nTiming: 40 min\nThis section of the protocol describes the staining procedure for excluding dead cells from the analysis.\nLive/dead staining.\nTop up all the samples with complete RPMI to wash the cells.\nSpin at 400 g for 10 min at RT.\nPrepare Viability mix: 1:1000 dilution of LIVE/Dead Fixable Blue (1 μL LIVE/Dead Fixable Blue stock solution and 999 μL of DPBS).\nDiscard supernatant carefully not disrupting the pellet.\nNote: Use a pipette to remove ALL the residual supernatant\nStain pelleted cells with 100 μL of viability mix (diluted Live/Dead Fixable Staining Solution) directly in the 15 mL tubes.\nVortex cell pellet with viability mix and stain for 15 min at RT protected from light.\nWash cells with 2 mL of washing/staining buffer (like BSA) and centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min.",
    "Critical: Live/Dead staining is essential as to most flow cytometry-based investigations. Use it to exclude debris and dead cells from analysis especially after optimal H2O2 treatment. Viability dyes are sensitive to light and can lose their fluorescence, so make sure to keep the dyes very well protected from light.\nCell staining assay\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section of the protocol describes the staining procedure of immune cells subsets and redox markers using Dyes and Monoclonal antibodies.\nCCR7 staining.\nDiscard supernatant and transfer the cells into FACS tubes.\nPrepare CCR7 mix as indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], by using the brilliant stain buffer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3048_11.csv\nNote: The brilliant stain buffer solution is added to mixtures of specific fluorescent reagents. It was made to go along with polychromatic flow cytometry tests that make use of staining agents coupled to BD Horizon Brilliant fluorescent polymer dyes.\nNote: The preparation provided here is for 1 tube. The volume has to be multiplied by the number of tubes: for one sample you would have to make the surface mix times 3 (fully stained untreated sample, FMX untreated sample, fully stained treated sample). In case of a higher amount of samples, it is suggested to prepare a master mix with at least 10% extra volume (e.g., if 10 tubes are required, calculate on the basis of 11), so that even the last tube is filled properly avoiding the effect of sample loss when dosing.\nThe mAbs have to be titrated for identifying the best concentration that allows to distinguish the populations of interest.\nStain both treated, untreated and FMX control cells with 100 μL cell suspension of CCR7 mixture for 20 min at 37°C, protected from light.",
    "Critical: CCR7 is a molecule better detected at 37°C due to plasma membrane recovery, hence why it is vital to stain CCR7 separately at 37°C.18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]\nNote: An incubator can be used to keep cells at 37°C, during the CCR7 staining.\nSurface staining.\nAfter staining cells with CCR7, wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant carefully without disrupting the pellet and prepare a mix for all the other surface Abs using Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3048_12.csv\nThe preparations provided here is for 1 tube.

For one sample you would have to make the redox markers staining times 2 (fully stained untreated sample, fully stained treated sample). Here we prepared 1 mL of Mix, enough for 9 tubes with 10% of extra volume.",
    "Vortex well and prepare fresh before using.\nOnce surface markers are stained wash with 1 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant being careful not to disrupt the pellet.\nStain dry pellets, except the FMX tube, with 100 μL of ThiolTracker & MitoSOX RED Dye Mix immediately.

Acquire within 4 h after staining completion.\nPreparation of compensation controls\nTiming: 40 min\nCompensation controls for flow cytometry are very important. Compensation is a mathematical calculation that removes unwanted fluorescence signal that is coming into a primary channel and overlapping in a secondary channel.
