    "Herein we describe a protocol for the measurement of ROS production from total MDSCs and isolated PMN-MDSCs. Production of ROS has been previously shown to induce DNA damage, leading to the contribution of cancerous transformation over time. Moreover, MDSC accumulation in the tumor microenvironment is well established, and they are known ROS producers. Thus, measuring ROS production by MDSCs represents an important method to assess their suppressive features.\nThis method uses luminol to detect initial and rapid intracellular and extracellular ROS accumulation kinetics over a period of 1 hr. For the detection of only extracellularly secreted ROS, replace luminol with isoluminol, which does not penetrate the cell membrane.\nMaterials\nIsolated PMN-MDSCs or total MDSCs (see companion Current Protocols article by Reuven et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-bib-0013])\nHanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) with Ca2+ and Mg2+, without phenol red (e.g., Biolab, cat. no. 009015237500)\n250 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli O26:B6 (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. L3755)\nROS detection solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-rec-0007])\nMicroplate reader capable of detecting luminescence between 370 and 700 nm (e.g., Tecan Spark)\n96-well flat-bottom plate, white polystyrene (e.g., Millipore Sigma, cat. no. CLS3917-100EA)\nLuminol-based reactive oxygen species production over time\n1. Program ROS template in the microplate reader: Set temperature to 37°C. Define experimental wells, and read luminescence with a 1000-ms kinetics loop and 30-s interval over a 1-hr period.\nCalibrate the exact reading time course, depending on the ROS secretion pattern of the chosen cells. It is recommended, if possible, to add shaking before each reading interval to ensure uniformity in the wells. The template can be saved for further use.\n2. Wash isolated PMN-MDSCs or MDSCs twice with HBSS, and bring concentration to 2–4 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS.\n3. Load 100 μl cells (0.2–0.4 × 106 cells) in each sample well of a 96-well plate.",
    "It is recommended not to read too many samples at once to maintain uniformity in the time between the first and last samples since the reading is performed sequentially.\n4. To each well, add 80 μl of 250 ng/ml LPS (100 ng/ml final), and 20 μl ROS detection solution.\nThe final volume in each sample well is 200 μl. This will allow the components of the reaction to reach the final concentrations as described within the protocol.\nVerify the plate reader has reached 37°C before adding the activation and ROS detection solution because the reaction begins rapidly.\n5. Place plate in preheated microplate reader, and immediately read samples.\nAnalysis of results\n6. Average replicates for each sample.\n7. Plot average luminescence values for each sample as a function of time.\nThe expected results are reflected by increased luminol luminescence following the addition of LPS and can be presented in two ways: (1) the production of ROS over time as the value of luminescence at each time point through the experiment or (2) as an accumulation of ROS production over time in which the luminescence value is added to the previous value.",
    "Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-prot-0002] represents a second method for ROS detection using the substance 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (H2DCFDA), which penetrates and remains inside the cells, allowing detection of intracellular late-phase ROS formation by flow cytometry. H2DCFDA can also be used for ROS imaging using microscopy.\nMaterials\nSplenocytes, total MDSCs, or isolated PMN-MDSCs (see companion Current Protocols article by Reuven et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-bib-0013])\nRPMI 1640 full medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-rec-0008])\n80 ng/ml LPS from E. coli O26:B6 (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

D6883)\n96-well U-bottom cell culture plate (e.g., Grenier Bio-One, cat. no. 655180)\nCell culture incubator, 37°C, 5% CO2\n70-μm mesh\nMulticolor flow cytometer with a plate loader module equipped with 488-nm laser (e.g., Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX V-B-R series or equivalent)\nFlow cytometry data analysis software (e.g., CytExpert, version 2.4 or similar)\n1. Adjust cell concentration to 2–4 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 full medium.\n2. Load 100 μl cells (0.2–0.4 × 106 cells) in each sample well of a 96-well plate.\n3. Add 50 μl of 80 μg/ml LPS (20 μg/ml final) and 50 μl of 20 μM H2DCFDA (5 μM final) for a final volume of 200 μl/well.\nFor baseline fluorescence intensity, replace LPS with 50 μl RPMI 1640 full medium.\nThe recommended working concentration of H2DCFDA is in the range of 1 to 10 μM, and the optimal concentration must be determined empirically. The effect of different treatments can be assessed in this step. In addition, H2DCFDA must be prepared fresh for every use.\n4. Place plate in a cell culture incubator for 4 to 6 hr.\n5. Resuspend and strain cells using a 70-μm mesh to ensure a single-cell suspension, and analyze immediately by flow cytometry.\nCells should not be washed before analysis by flow cytometry.",
    "Adjust measuring fluorescence of the dye for emission and excitation to 492 to 495 nm and 517 to 527 nm, respectively.\n6. Analyze results using flow cytometry data software. Create a fold-increase graph by extracting mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and subtracting baseline control fluorescence intensity from each sample.\nThe obtained results represent the accumulated fluorescence signal of H2DCFDA in the cells over time. If using a total single-cell suspension of splenocytes, the strongest fluorescence signal is expected in PMN-MDSCs, as they are the major ROS-producing cells. When calculating fold-change of ROS production, a significant increase in ROS production is expected in activated PMN-MDSCs compared with nonactivated PMN-MDSCs or other cell populations.",
    "One of the suppressive mediators of MDSCs is NO, which is generated by the enzyme inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Elevated levels of iNOS detected within MDSCs are related primarily to M-MDSCs and are associated with increased production and secretion of NO. Elevated levels of NO can lead to alterations in T cells responses due to their direct effect on T cells or indirect effect of inhibiting antigen presentation to T cells by dendritic cells. In this assay, the activity of iNOS in MDSCs is measured using the Griess reagent, which creates a colorimetric reaction with nitrites and nitrates to produce magenta azo product. Creating a calibration curve using sodium nitrite allows for the calculation of nitrite concentration in the medium according to optical density (OD) values.\nMaterials\nIsolated M-MDSCs or total MDSCs (see companion Current Protocols article by Reuven et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-bib-0013])\nRPMI 1640 full medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-rec-0008])\nLPS from E. coli O26:B6 (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Plate isolated MDSCs in RPMI 1640 full medium with an activator such as 100 ng/ml LPS, and incubate for 48 to 72 hr.\n2. After incubation of activated cells, centrifuge plate 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C.\n3. Collect 100 μl supernatant from each sample well, and transfer to a new 96-well flat-bottom transparent plate suitable for OD readings.\nYou may also plate 50 μl sample to a final volume of 100 μl in each well after the addition of Griess reagent (1:1 ratio).\n4. Thaw Griess reagent aliquot at room temperature.",
    "5. Add 100 μl Griess reagent (1:1 ratio) to each sample and calibration curve wells.\nPreparation of calibration curve\n6. Dilute 100 mM sodium nitrite stock with the same medium used for culturing the cells (e.g., RPMI 1640 full medium) at a ratio of 1:200 to final concentration of 500 μM.\nPrepare enough to plate triplicates of each concentration.\n7. Make ten serial dilutions until reaching a concentration of ∼1 μM.\nMake the dilutions in the same medium used to culture cells. This will allow detection of NO secreted in the medium without interfering with the OD readings.\n8. Plate triplicates of each concentration of the calibration curve in the same plate containing samples.\nTo minimize noise in the readings, it is recommended to read the sample wells and the calibration curve wells within the same plate.\n9. Add 100 μl Griess reagent (1:1 ratio) to each sample and calibration curve wells.\nObtaining results\n10. Read plate containing sample wells and calibration curve using a plate reader capable of detecting OD at wavelength of 540 nm.\n11. Add trendline to the calibration curve samples, and use it to calculate the concentration of nitrites in the medium by converting OD values to concentration of nitrites.\nCalculation of the trendline for this protocol is similar to that calculated for the activity of arginase, which is presented in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-prot-0004]. Significant increase in NO production is expected in activated cells, as indicated by higher OD values.",
    "Increased levels and activity of the enzyme arginase-1 in MDSCs, primarily in the M-MDSC subpopulation, can lead to deprivation of arginine from the surrounding, thus altering T cells responses. In this assay, the activity of arginase-1 in MDSCs is measured by the ability of MDSC lysate to catalyze the conversion of L-arginine to urea and ornithine. Urea reacts with its substrate α-isonitrosopropiophenone (ISPF) to generate a colored product, in which the levels are proportional to the amount of urea produced. The obtained readout can be interpreted as the arginase-1 activity in the cell lysate.\nMaterials\nIsolated M-MDSCs or total MDSCs (see companion Current Protocols article by Reuven et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-bib-0013])\nLysis buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-rec-0005])\n25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (e.g., Biolab, cat. no. 20092391)\n10 mM manganese (II) chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2•4H20; e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

    "The cell surface TCR is composed of six different transmembrane subunits: the α and β subunits, which recognize peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) present on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells, and the CD3 ε, δ, and γ and CD247 ζ subunits, which serve as signaling molecules. Binding of the TCR to the peptide-MHC complex leads to activation of intracellular pathways within the T cell mediated by the signaling subunits that bear immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). These motifs comprise consensus sequences containing the amino acid tyrosine, which is phosphorylated upon activation and ultimately leads to the activation of cells and internalization of the TCR. Of the TCR subunits, CD247 possesses a higher number of ITAMs and thus is considered vital for T cell activity. Under chronic inflammation, it was shown that expression of CD247 is downregulated by MDSCs, whereas levels of the rest of the TCR subunits, such as CD3ε, remain unchanged (Ezernitchi et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-bib-0007]). Flow cytometry analyses measuring expression levels of CD3ε, TCR-β, and CD247 molecules can distinguish between a suppressive state of T cells due to MDSC activity and an activated state via the TCR. Moreover, IFN-γ production is associated with optimal CTL function and has been shown to be affected by MDSCs. Therefore, determining IFN-γ expression in T cells when surrounded by MDSCs could enable determination of MDSC suppressive activity that could then be translated for in vivo testing. In a similar manner, MDSC functions can be determined in vivo by testing T cell or natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic capacity. As previously noted, the presence of MDSCs is closely associated with the severity of cancer, in particular, due to their effect on T and NK cell cytotoxic functions.",
    "Therefore, a fast and simple examination of the capacity of MDSCs to interfere with the activity of effector CD8 T cells and NK cells can clarify the impact of modifications to experimental models in vivo.",

However, in some cases it might be necessary to add 0.2 μg/ml anti-CD28 to the activation cocktail.\nFor the stimulation of isolated T cells, plate-bound anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 are required. Follow Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-prot-0008] steps 1 to 6 for the preparation of plate-bound antibodies.",

Add 100 μl activation cocktail (from step 5) to wells for splenocytes.\n9. Gently mix MDSCs, and add 50 µl (0.3 × 106 cells) to wells designed for testing suppression.\nThe final volume in each sample well is 200 µl.\nWhen total splenocytes obtained from control mice are used, the addition of an equal number of MDSCs to splenocytes at a 1:1 ratio can be considered as a 1:3 ratio of T cells to MDSCs, since the average percentage of T cells within a control spleen is 25%.\nGradually increasing the number of MDSCs within the wells will further enhance the suppressive impact of MDSCs on T cells. Using too high a number of MDSCs might mask the experimental results. It is recommended to choose several ratios when establishing a protocol for various MDSC subpopulations, since the efficiency of their suppression on CD247 can vary.\n10.

    "One of the hallmarks of the suppressive functions of MDSCs is their ability to inhibit T cell responses to activation, which enables assessment by measuring T cell proliferation arrest. The in vitro activation methodology may differ depending on the experiment, but it must include two activating signals: one that works through the CD3ε subunit of the TCR complex and the second that works via the costimulatory receptor CD28. In our laboratory, two different methods for T cell activation have been calibrated: (1) splenocyte single-cell suspension activation using soluble anti-CD3ε antibody (with the costimulatory signal provided by antigen-presenting cells within the spleen) and (2) activation of isolated T cells using plate-bound anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28. The presented method describes a flow cytometry–based analysis to study the proliferation of T cells following their activation. The cells in this protocol are labeled with a fluorescent cell-permeable dye that covalently couples to intracellular molecules. Upon cell division, the dye is divided equally between the two daughter cells. Cells displaying lower fluorescence intensity reflect a successful proliferation process, and cells with higher intensities depict arrested nonproliferating cells.\nMaterials\n50 mM borate buffer, pH 8.5, sterile\nAntibodies:\n               \nPurified anti-mouse CD3ε antibody (e.g., BioLegend, cat. no. 100340)\nPurified anti-mouse CD28 antibody (e.g., BioLegend, cat. no. 102116)\nAPC anti-mouse CD90.2 (Thy-1.2), clone 30-H12 (e.g., BioLegend, cat. no 105311)\nPurified anti-mouse CD16/32, Fc blocker, clone 93 (e.g., BioLegend, cat. no. 101302)\nRPMI 1640 full medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-rec-0008])\nSplenocyte single-cell suspension or isolated T cells (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-prot-0005] and companion Current Protocols article by Reuven et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-bib-0013])\nTrypan blue\nDPBS, without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (e.g., Biological Industries, cat. no. 02-023-1A)\nCarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) cell proliferation dye (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

For each sample well, prepare 100 µl of 50 mM borate buffer containing 3 μg/ml anti-CD3ε and 3 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibodies.\nFor example, for an assay that contains 30 sample wells, prepare 3 ml of 50 mM borate buffer with 9 µl of 1 mg/ml anti-CD3ε and 9 µl of 1 mg/ml anti-CD28 antibodies.\n2.

    "8. Prepare 2× CFSE in DPBS. For splenocytes prepare 2.5 μM CFSE, and for isolated T cells prepare 1.25 μM CFSE.\nCFSE should be dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 25 mM to prepare stock aliquots.

Good experimental planning is imperative to reduce the risk of errors.\nTo ensure homogeneity of replicates within the experiment, it is recommended to prepare technical replicates in a microcentrifuge tube and then divide equal volumes into the sample wells.

    "Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-prot-0009] describes the suppressive effect of MDSCs on the function of cytotoxic CD8 T cells isolated from PMEL mice and stimulated with the peptide gp100. CD8 T cells from PMEL mice recognize the specific peptide gp100, allowing for the selective activation of cells when introducing the peptide to the mice. Several conditions, such as peptide concentration and MDSC number, should be adjusted according to experimental specifications. Using this protocol, expansion of 2 × 106 naive PMEL CD8 T cells (at day 0) yields ∼50–60 × 106 cells (at day 7), with a maximum of 10% dead cells and purity of 98%. The initial duration of T cell activation (day 0 to 2) is an orientational time marker, which can be adjusted for convenience according to the time of isolation, with an average time of 24 to 36 hr.\nTo stimulate isolated T cells, plate-bound anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 antibodies are used. When using total splenocytes, specific peptides (e.g., gp100) can be added directly into the cell culture for T cell activation.

    "6. Perform i.v. injection of 200 µl cells in DPBS per each control and chronically inflamed mouse, and wait until MDSCs in the inflammatory environment affect T cells in vivo, which varies depending on the mouse model (e.g., 6 to 24 hr).\nThe time period required for MDSCs to suppress CTLs in vivo depends on the experimental model for chronic inflammation. Therefore, before injecting the mixture of target + nontarget cells, it is recommended to perform a basic kinetics experiment to assess expression levels of CD247 for the injected CTLs to empirically determine the necessary time for in vivo suppression of CTLs and the duration for CTLs, which is similar to the endogenous T cell population.

    "The final concentration of mixed target + nontarget cells per 200 µl of the injection solution depends on the ratio of CTLs and the number of mixed target + nontarget cells desired. Moreover, when choosing the concentration of mixed target + nontarget cells for injection, the type of experimental model and the tissue selected for the analysis should be considered, owing to migration and accumulation of MDSCs in, for example, the spleen, which will dilute the signal accordingly. Therefore, the minimum number of cells necessary to acquire an optimal number of events (e.g., 2000 events) during flow cytometry should be experimentally determined.\n11. Perform i.v. injection in the tail by injecting 200 µl cells per mouse, and then wait the desired amount of time.\nThe waiting period necessary to properly visualize the capacity of MDSCs to suppress cytotoxic activity of CTLs depends on the choices and conditions selected in previous steps and needs to be determined experimentally.

    "Under normal conditions, immature myeloid cells migrate to peripheral lymphoid organs and differentiate into mature cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. In contrast, under pathologic conditions, these cells undergo differentiation arrest, expand, and exhibit immunosuppressive functions. Investigating the mechanisms by which MDSCs stay in an undifferentiated state and expand, as well as finding new targets to modulate their differentiation and maturation, are key demands for understanding MDSC biology and how they could be manipulated. It has been suggested that promoting MDSC differentiation into mature myeloid cells can serve as a therapeutic strategy as they lose their suppressive features and functions. Herein, we propose an in vitro assay to study differentiation and the maturation state of the M-MDSC subpopulation using GM-CSF or M-CSF stimulation. GM-CSF was shown to drive bone marrow–derived monocytes into mature dendritic cells, whereas stimulation with M-CSF was shown to prime monocytes into macrophages.\nMaterials\nIsolated M-MDSCs or total MDSCs (see companion Current Protocols article by Reuven et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-bib-0013])\nRPMI 1640 full medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.557#cpz1557-rec-0008])\nRecombinant murine GM-CSF (e.g., PeproTech, cat. no. 315-03)\nRecombinant murine M-CSF (e.g., PeproTech, cat. no. 315-02)\nOptional: effector molecules of interest\nDPBS, without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (e.g., Biological Industries, cat. no. 02-023-1A)\n1× Accutase (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.
