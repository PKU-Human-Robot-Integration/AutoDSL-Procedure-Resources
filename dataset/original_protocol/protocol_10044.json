    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n1. Scaffold Manufacturing\nPrepare a polymer nanofiber precursor solution by: 1) dissolving 8 wt% PET in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol and heating the solution to 60 °C and by 2) dissolving 3 wt% PU in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol at room temperature.\nOnce cooled, combine the solutions to create a final polymer mixture of PET and PU (20:80).\nElectrospin the PET+ PU solution onto a stainless steel rod (1 mm diameter) utilizing a 20G blunt tip needle on a 60 mL syringe filled with the PET:PU solution using a high-voltage DC power supply set to +14 kV on the needle, another high-voltage DC power supply set to -3 kV, a 5 mL/h flow rate, and a 20 cm tip-to-substrate distance. Rotate the rod at 350 rpm during fiber deposition.\nContinue electrospinning until the desired scaffold wall thickness of 300 µm is achieved. Slide the scaffold off the rod, then hold it under vacuum overnight to remove any residual solvent.\nSterilize the scaffold using an ultraviolet light dosage of 350 mJ/cm2 prior to implantation.\n2. Bone Marrow-Derived Mononuclear Cell (BM-MNC) Harvesting\nEuthanize a 6-8 weeks old, female, C57BL/6 mouse with a cocktail of ketamine (200 mg/kg), xylazine (20 mg/kg) and ketoprofen (10 mg/kg). Check for complete euthanasia by tail-pinch method. Be sure to follow local guidelines for euthanasia.",
    "Under sterile conditions, remove the skin over the femurs and tibias to expose bone using fine scissors and micro-Adson forceps. Use Dumont #5 forceps and Dumont #5/45 forceps to remove the fascia and the tendons. Separate the bones and cut each of them on both the ends. Using a 5 mL syringe and a 25G needle, flush the bone marrow in a Petri dish containing 30 mL of Rosewell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) media. Filter this RPMI with bone marrow through a 70 µm nylon cell strainer into a 50 mL tube.\nIn a Biosafety Cabinet, place 5 mL of polysurcrose and sodium diatrizoate in a 15 mL tube. Gently add the RPMI containing bone marrow mononuclear cells down the side of the tube to avoid mixing of the two layers. Centrifuge at 461 x g for 30 min with \"Brake 1\" at 24 °C.\n\tNOTE: On our centrifuge, brake 1 stands for the longest run out time during deceleration.\nOut of the three layers formed, discard the top (pink) layer of plasma and collect the middle (clear) layer consisting of the bone marrow mononuclear cells. Discard the precipitate of red blood cells.\nDilute the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a 1:1 ratio and centrifuge at 461 x g for 10 min with \"Brake 9\" at 24 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and dilute the pellet with 5 mL of PBS. Centrifuge at 461 x g for 10 min with \"Brake 9\" at 24 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and dilute the pellet with ~10 mL of RPMI.",
    "Dilute 10 µL of the BM-MNC solution with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue in a 1 mL tube. Place 10 µL of the solution in a cell counting chamber slide. Count the cells using an automated cell counter. Repeat the step and calculate the average number of cells.\n\tNOTE: An average cell count of 1 X 108 cells was obtained from the use of two donor mice. This would be equivalent to two femurs, and two tibias that bone marrow is isolated from.\nCentrifuge the BM-MNC solution at 461 x g for 10 min with \"Brake 9\" at 24 °C. Remove the supernatant and dilute the cell concentration to 107 cells/graft.\n\tNOTE: We have studied seeding efficiency between 1, 10 and 100 million cells and found that 10 million cells per graft yields the highest seeding efficiency.\n3. Cell Seeding on the Grafts\nMeasure the lengths of the scaffolds and if needed, cut them to a length of 5 mm.\nPre-wet the scaffold with 5 µL of RPMI for 5 min. Remove the RPMI.\nAdd 5 µL of the BM-MNC solution to the lumen of the scaffold for 10 min.\nPass a 21G needle through the lumen of the graft and incubate the graft in 1000 µL of RPMI overnight at 37 °C in an incubator.\n4. Graft Implantation\nNOTE: Care should be taken to maintain aseptic technique during the graft implantation procedure.\nUse 6-8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice as recipients for the cell seeded grafts. Inject enrofloxacin (10mg/kg) subcutaneously 24 h before surgery and just before incision.\nWeigh the mouse and administer a 0.1 mL/10 g dose of the anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg), xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) as analgesia intraperitoneally.",
    "Check if the plane of anesthesia has been achieved by tail-pinch method. On confirming the level of sedation, apply a sterile ophthalmic ointment to the eyes and clip the hair on the surgical site from chin to clavicles. Place the animal on a pad in a dorsal recumbent position. Disinfect the surgical site using first a povidone-iodine prep pad, followed by an alcohol prep pad (70% alcohol), and once more a povidone-iodine prep pad.\nPlace the animal under the dissecting microscope with its head away from the surgeon. Make a midline incision ranging from the clavicles to the hyoid bone with the help of fine scissors and micro-Adson forceps. Clean the fascia with Dumont #5 and Dumont #7 fine forceps, along with a sterile cotton swab if needed, and insert a self-retaining Colibri retractor.\nOpen the strap muscles (Figure 3A) with Dumont #5 and Dumont #7 fine forceps to expose the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage and the trachea. Bluntly separate the trachea from the recurrent laryngeal nerves running parallel on either side, followed by circumferential separation of the trachea from the esophagus (Figure 3B).\nUsing a 20G needle and surgical marker, stain the anterior portion of the trachea.\nIdentify the trachea and make an incision below the third tracheal cartilage ring and transect the trachea using a pair of Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors and a pair of Dumont #7 fine forceps. Holding it with the fine curved forceps, secure the distal trachea to the sternum using sterile 9-0 nylon suture to create a temporary tracheostomy (Figure 3C). NOTE: An alternative suture material that can be used is the 9-0 PDS for tracheal implantation and muscle reapproximation. \nWith a 20G needle and a surgical marker, stain the graft to represent the anterior portion.",
    "Implant the graft inserting the proximal-posterior, proximal-lateral and proximal-anterior sutures, in that order using 9-0 sterile nylon suture (Figure 3D), Dumont #7 fine forceps and a needle holder.\nTurn the animal 180° to place its tail away from the surgeon. Release the temporary tracheostomy. The distal trachea is incompletely transected to permit the use of the resected segment as a stump for retraction. When no longer needed, the 5 MM trachea segment is removed completely.\nComplete the distal anastomosis by placing the sutures in the similar fashion as the proximal anastomosis.\nRe-approximate the graft position and the strap muscles. Close the incision using 9-0 sterile nylon sutures in a running pattern.\nInject 0.1 mL of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously and place the animal in a recovery cage placed on a heating pad without other animals in the cage.\nObserve the mouse until it is conscious and able to ambulate, then transfer the mouse to a new cage with soft bedding, moist chow and medicated water (ibuprofen, 30 mg/kg) for 48 h. After this time period, return the mouse to a normal cage with other mice.\n\tNOTE: Mice that maintain respiratory distress or decreased activity after implantation are observed by laboratory and/or animal staff in a 32 °C incubator. If this continues for more than 48 h, then the mice should be euthanized.\n5. Histology and Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: Hematoxylin and eosin stains were performed using standard technique by Nationwide Children's Hospital Morphology Core. Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the below steps.\nDeparaffinize the slides using 1) xylene for 5 min, 2) xylene for 5 min, 3) 100% ethanol for 5 min, 4) 90% ethanol for 5 min, 5) 70% ethanol for 5 min, 6) distilled H2O (dH2O) for 5 min.",
    "Submerge the slides in citrate buffer and place in water-filled pressure cooker. Heat for 10 min then allow to cool to room temperature. Wash with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (BSA-PBS) for 5 min. Rinse with dH2O.\n\tNOTE: Heating can also be done with a hot water bath or microwave for 15 min.\nIncubate the slides with 3% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Wash with 0.1% BSA-PBS for 5 min. Incubate in primary antibody with concentrations for keratin 5 (1:1000)6, keratin 14 (1:250)6 and F4/80 (1:100)7 for 18 h overnight at 4 °C.\nWash with 0.1% BSA-PBS twice for 10 min each wash. Incubate with appropriate secondary antibody at concentration of 1:500 for K5/K14 and 1:300 F4/80 for 1 h at room temperature. Wash with 0.1% BSA-PBS twice for 10 min each wash.\nMount using 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenolindole (DAPI) containing mounting media and glass cover slips. Allow to sit for 30 min before imaging.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
