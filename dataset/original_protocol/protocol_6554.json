    "Preparation of healthy and uremic human serum poolHealthy Serum Pool: Collect blood samples (20 ml) from 20 healthy volunteers in tubes with anticoagulants and centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Note: The supernatant should be separated in aliquots, put in a box and storage in vertical freezer at -80 °C. Uremic Serum Pool: Collect blood samples with anticoagulant tubes from 30 patients in hemodialysis treatment immediately before the beginning of the second session of the week. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Store the supernatant in a -80 °C freezer.Exclusion criteria: patients that had any type of infections, have used any immunosuppressive drugs, vitamin D supplementation or had diabetes mellitus or neoplasia.U937 (human monocytic lineage) culture assayCulture 1 x 105 U937 cells (human monocytic lineage) in 25 cm cell culture flask (Sigma) with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 culture medium, pH 7.4, supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, BRL, Life Technologies) and 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum). And then incubate in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Change the culture medium (RPMI 1640) each 24 h until the culture achieves confluence.Remove old RPMI from cell culture flask and add a 10 ml of fresh culture medium RPMI with 5 µM/ml of PMA (add 10 µl of 5 mM/ml PMA-stock solution to 10 ml fresh RPMI 1640 culture medium). Maintain the culture in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h until U937 cells differentiate into monocytes cells.After differentiation, wash the cells with 10 ml of PBS (Sigma) to remove the PMA. Then incubate in 5 ml of trypsin 0.",
    "5% for 3 min at room temperature, in order to detach the cells from the surface of the cell culture flask to obtain a homogeneous cell suspension.Next wash with 5 ml of RPMI 1640 culture medium for trypsin neutralization. Transfer cells from the cell culture flask to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g, 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and add 10 ml of fresh RPMI 1640 to test cell viability using Trypan Blue.Trypan blue viability assayClean the hemocytometer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200802/20200802232205_2086.jpgFigure 1. Fill 5 or 10 µl cell suspendsion into both sides of the chamber in HemocytometerMoisten the coverslip with water or exhaled breath. Slide the coverslip over the chamber back and forth using slight pressure until Newton’s refraction rings appear (Newton’s refraction rings are seen as rainbow-like rings under the coverslip).Under sterile conditions take out 100-200 µl of cell suspension, transfer it in a micro tube and staining with an equal volume of Trypan Blue solution (dilution factor = 2) and mix by gentle pipetting. The maximum time of trypan blue staining is until 30 seconds (Figure 1).Fill both sides of the chamber with cell suspension (approximately 5-10 µl) (Figure 1) and view under an inverted phase contrast microscope using 20x magnification.Count the number of viable (seen as bright cells) and non-viable cells (stained blue). Ideally >100 cells should be counted in order to increase the accuracy of the cell count (see note below) (Figure 2).Note: The number of squares counted to obtain your count of > 100.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200802/20200802232146_1436.jpgFigure 2.

Hemocytometer areaCalculate the concentration of viable and non-viable cells and the percentage of viable cells using the example below and as illustrated above:Volume hemacytometer = 1 × 1 × 0.1 = 0.1 mm3Calculate the concentration of viable and non-viable cells per ml.For example: there are 120 counted viable cells or non-viable cells on the hemacytometer, thenthe concentration of viable cells per ml = 120 cells /0.1 mm3 × 2 × 1,000 mm3/1 ml =2.4 × 106 cells/mlwhich 2 is the dilution factor (V cell suspension/V trypan Blue);1 ml corresponds 1,000 mm3.Percentage Viability=(N0 of viable cells)/(Total N0 of cells)×100 Treatment with or without 25(OH)D and with or without uremic pool serum assayAfter calculating the viability (that must be around 95%), use the tube of 15 ml with cell suspension in the RPMI (that is used to calculate viability) and transfer 1 x 106 cells for each condition to cell culture flask described allow: (In order to adjust the 1 x 106 cell to each condition of treatment described below, it is needed cell count by hemocytometer).Treatment with healthy pool serum: Transfer 1 x 106 cells to 25 cm2 cell culture flask with 2.5 ml of RPMI 1640 and with 2.5 ml of healthy pool serum. Incubate for 24 h with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Treatment with 25(OH)D and healthy pool serum: Transfer 1 x 106 cells to a 25 cm2 cell culture flask with 2.5 ml of RPMI 1640 and 2.5 ml of healthy pool serum and add 50 ng/ml of 25(OH)D.

Centrifuge and discard the supernatant. Add 300 µl of 1% azide PBS solution. Ready to analyze in flow cytometry.Note: This protocol may be simplified if you have a flow cytometer that can detect five or more parameters of fluorescence. For this, you can put 3 x 105 cell only in one tube and stain with all monoclonal antibodies conjugated with different fluorescence to be detect in each channel of detection by flow cytometry.Flow cytometry analysis (BD FacsCanto I)Use a forward scatter plot versus side scatter plot to make a gate for the CD14+ (monocytes cells) and to exclude debris (Figures 3A-3D). Use DOT-PLOT graphs to analyze the CD14+ (Figure 3E), CD14+TLR4+ (Figure 3F) and CD14+VDR+ (Figure 3G).Use DOT-PLOT graphs to analyze the CD14+ (Figure 4A) and use histograms to analyze the CYP27+ (Figure 4D) and CYP24+ (Figure 4E). Describe results as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), such that the higher the MFI the greater the expression of these receptors. For each sample, acquire 30,000 events/cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200802/20200802232721_1054.jpgFigure 3.
