    "Preparation of -80 °C cell pelletsGrow R. palustris cultures as required by the experimental design. Typical growth conditions that we use are given in Kim and Harwood (1991). However, the composition of the cultivation medium is not important for the protocol we describe here. It also does not matter if cells are grown aerobically or anaerobically. For one typical sample, we usually use 50-70 ml of culture at Abs660 ~1 (medium is used as blank).Add 10 ml of RNase-free water to one 50-ml centrifuge tube. Place the tube horizontally in a freezer (any sub-zero °C freezer would work) to form a thin sheet of ice (we usually do this a few days in advance to make sure ice is formed). One tube with ice sheet would be used collect ~35 ml of cell culture. Prepare as many tubes as required in advance.When the culture reaches the desired growth state, pour the culture directly into the tube containing the ice sheet and place the tube on ice. The purpose of this step is to minimize the time required for the culture to cool down and thus capture the native form of ribosomes. It is also referred as “fast-cool” in some literature (         Lawrence et al., 2016        ).Invert the tubes with culture gently from time to time to facilitate the cooling down of the culture. We usually transfer the now cold culture into a pre-chilled centrifuge tube. This process usually takes 5-10 min in our experience.Spin at ~5,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the cell pellets.Discard the supernatant and freeze the pellets with liquid nitrogen. The frozen cell pellets can now be stored at -80 °C. In our experience, the ribosome profile of the sample can be preserved for 6 weeks at least.",
    "Note: For each sample, we usually collect cells from ~70 ml culture and store the pellets in two 50-ml centrifuge tubes. This can be easily scaled up or down depending on the need of sampling and the availability of equipment. Purification of ribosomesPrepare two screw-capped 2 ml centrifuge tubes for each sample (assuming the pellets are collected in two 50 ml centrifuge tubes, see the Note in Procedure A). Add ~500 µl Zirconia/Silica beads to each tube and autoclave all of the tubes.Resuspend the cell pellet in 1.2 ml cold lysis buffer in each 50 ml centrifuge tube. Use pipet to mix well and transfer the resuspended sample to the 2 ml screw-cap tube containing Zirconia/Silica beads.In a 4 °C room, lyse the resuspended cells with a Biospec Mini-Beadbeater-24 at 3,500 rpm for 1 min and then chill them on ice for 1min. Repeat 3 more times, 4 times in total.Note: The setup of beadbeater cycle, speed and time may need to be adjusted according to the species of interest. Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,000 x g with a tabletop microcentrifuge at 4 °C to remove the beads and cell debris.Collect 1 ml of supernatant from each tube. Combine supernatants from the same sample if needed (2 ml of supernatant for each sample in our setting, see the Note in Procedure A). Centrifuge for 30 min at 30,000 x g at 4 °C with an ultracentrifuge to further clarify the lysates. Collect the supernatant.Centrifuge the supernatant from last step at 100,000 x g with an ultracentrifuge for four hours at 4 °C to pellet the ribosomes.After the spin, carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting without disturbing the pelleted ribosomes. The pelleted ribosomes, when abundant, visually resemble a contact lens.",
    "Without disturbing the pellets, carefully add 200-500 µl Buffer A1 to the centrifuge tube containing the pelleted ribosomes. Leave the samples on ice overnight to allow the ribosomes to dissolve in the buffer.On the next day, gently mix the dissolved ribosomes. Take a sample and determine the absorbance at 260 nm (A260). The volume of the sample taken depends on the concentration and the setup of spectrometer. The sample can also be diluted if necessary. In our experience, a typical yield from one sample is 400 µl of 20 relative units (R.U.) of A260 in total. Note that the yield can vary significantly depending on the experiment.Adjust all the samples to the same concentration. The minimum concentration of ribosome for the following analysis is 50 R.U. of A260/ml. Freeze the purified ribosomes with liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C for further analysis. The purified ribosomes are suitable for further assays such as separation on a sucrose gradient or for isolation and analysis of rRNA associated with ribosomes.Analyze rRNA by electrophoresis and Northern blot.This procedure can be applied to total RNA isolated from cultures or from purified ribosomes. RNA is purified following either a QIAzol-based method (see Yin and Harwood, 2020) or the commercially available protocol for the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For the QIAzol-based method, we typically start with 400 µl of an 0.1 absorbance (RU of A260) preparation of ribosomes and the method yields a 15 µl volume of approximately 500 ng RNA/µl.    An optional step is to use an RNA ScreenTape System (Agilent) to get a snapshot of the rRNA profile[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/ScreenTape_RNA_QG.pdf]. To specifically detect rRNA by Northern blot, rRNA has to be first separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel.",
    "Since agarose gels are usually too thick to be used in the commonly used electro-transfer system, this calls for a capillary transfer system (upward or downward) to transfer RNA from the gel to a membrane for subsequent Northern blot detection. This procedure will be described here in detail. For Northern blot detection, we use a non-radioactive system and follow its commercially available manual (DIG). This greatly saves time and effort as described in detail in the accompanying protocol “Charging state analysis of transfer RNA from an α-proteobacterium” (Yin and Harwood, 2020). The principle of designing and generating a DIG-labeled probe is also described there.In a 50-ml centrifuge tube, add 0.2 g agarose to 20 ml 1x TBE buffer. Melt agarose in a microwave and pour the gel.Mix 1 µg total RNA with 2x loading dye. Heat at 70 °C for 10 min. Immediately chill on ice for 3 min. Spin briefly.Analyze the sample on an agarose gel with a running buffer of 1x TBE buffer. For a gel of ~10 cm in length, a one-hour run at 100 V usually achieves satisfactory separation. After electrophoresis with a setting like this,16S rRNA is usually in the middle of the gel.After the electrophoresis, immerse the gel in 20x SSC twice, each time for 10 min.Assemble the transfer apparatus as follows:Top Light weight such as a pipet tip box1 Whatman filter paper connecting to the reservoir, immersed in 20x SSC1 Whatman filter paper, slightly bigger than the gel, immersed in 20x SSCAgarose gel, the side with RNA facing downMembrane cut to gel size, pre-immersed in 20x SSC2 Whatman filter papers, slightly bigger than the gel, immersed in 20x SSCDry paper towels (~20 sheets at least)Bottom Note: This describes the transfer apparatus for downward transfer. Slightly modified setup can be used for upward transfer.",
    "Set up the capillary transfer system as shown in Figure 1. Leave on bench overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3835/bioprotoc-10-23-3835-g001.jpgFigure 1. Capillary transfer system (RNA transferred downward from gel to membrane) The membrane can be cross-linked the next morning. One option to cross-link is to place the membrane 1-2 cm from a shortwave UV light, the side with sample facing UV light, and expose it to UV for 10 min. Next, follow commercially available protocol for DIG system for Northern blot (Sessions in Hybridization and Immunological detection in https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Roche/Bulletin/1/12039672910bul.pdf[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Roche/Bulletin/1/12039672910bul.pdf])."
