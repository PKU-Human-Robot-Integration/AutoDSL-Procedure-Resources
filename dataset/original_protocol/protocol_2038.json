Let it grow at 32°C for 24 h to reach saturation.\nNote: Timing should be adjusted depending on media, strain and growth rate, in order to obtain a saturated culture. Ideally, a concentration of 1 × 108 cells/mL should be reached.\nNote: Use colonies of similar size for each strain and between biological replicates. Maintaining the same timing from streaking out your strains from the −80°C to inoculation helps. If mutants form bigger or smaller colonies as compared to control/wild-type strain, adjust the amount of biomass for each inoculate.\nCritical: Always include at least one negative control. Either a non-tagged strain or a strain containing another, unrelated protein tagged with the same epitope can be used. We recommend using both when performing RIP for the first time or when testing a bait for the first time. The former gives an idea of the non-specific binding of RNAs to antibody-coated beads. The latter serves as a control for non-specific binding due to stickiness of nucleic acids to proteins and epitopes. If using antibodies against an endogenous protein, a deletion mutant can be used as a negative control.",
    "Measure OD at 595 nm and dilute the culture in 60 mL of fresh media to reach a cell concentration of 1.5 × 107 cells/mL at the time of harvesting the culture (step 10), aiming for at least 4–5 doubling. Incubate at 32°C.\nNote: Beware that if additional conditions are required, such as testing cotranslational interactions by using EDTA and/or puromycin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), the volume should be adjusted accordingly. For example, to check the cotranslational dependency of the interaction using puromycin, inoculate 120 mL of media per strain.\nNote: To allow proper oxygenation of the culture, its volume should be less than about 20% of the flask.\nCritical: If using slow- or fast-growing mutants, adjust the cell number to guarantee that all cultures reach the concentration of 1.5 × 107 cells/mL at the same time. Performing prior proliferation assays is recommended to optimize this step.\nPrepare IP buffer. Keep on ice.\nFor each sample: Wash 100 μL of Pan mouse IgG magnetic beads 3 times with 500 μL IP buffer each time:\nTake 100 μL slurry of beads into a 1.5 mL tube.\nRemove the supernatant using the magnetic stand.\nAdd 500 μL ice-cold IP buffer.\nMix by constantly inverting the tube for 1 min.\nRemove IP buffer using the magnetic stand.\nRepeat steps c-e twice.\nResuspend the beads in 500 μL ice-cold IP buffer.\nAdd 3 μL (3 μg) of your favorite mouse monoclonal primary antibody.\nIncubate overnight at 4°C rotating.\nCell harvesting, lysis, and immunoprecipitation (part 1)—Day 3\nTiming: 3–4 h\nGoal: To obtain sufficient material for subsequent RNA isolation and immunoprecipitation.\nPrepare complete IP buffer. Keep on ice.",
    "Note: If assessing cotranslational interactions using EDTA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), also prepare complete IP buffer containing 25 mM EDTA (from a 0.5 M pH 8.0 stock in distilled water; filter sterilized). Always use this buffer (complete IP buffer+EDTA) instead of complete IP buffer for EDTA-treated samples during the rest of the protocol. For a more rigorous assessment of the cotranslational nature of protein-RNA interaction, we recommend using either puromycin or an ATG mutant version of a known target gene, if possible.\nCount and annotate the concentration of the cultures. It should be about 1.5 × 107 cells/mL.\nTransfer 50 mL of culture to a 50 mL tube.\nNote: Adjust small differences in the required volume for each strain. Use the less concentrated culture at first and adjust the other cultures accordingly. To minimize variability and/or allow comparisons, it is recommended to use a similar number of cells for each sample and subsequent replications of the experiment.\nOptional: When using puromycin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), transfer 2 × 50 mL of culture to two different flasks. Then add 1 mL of puromycin hydrochloride stock solution (50 mg/mL in sterile distilled water) to one of them and 1 mL of sterile distilled water to the other one. Incubate for 15 minutes at 32°C before harvesting them as indicated in step 10.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 2,500 g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\nWash: add 5 mL cold (4°C) distilled water, resuspend and centrifuge for 3 min at 2,500 g, 4°C.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend into 500 μL of ice-cold complete IP buffer and transfer to 2 mL screw-cap tubes.\nCentrifuge 1 min at 2,500 g at 4°C. Discard supernatant. Keep pellets on ice.\nAdd 100 μL of ice-cold complete IP buffer and 10 μL RNasin and resuspend by pipetting.",
    "Add acid washed glass beads (stored at 4°C) up to the meniscus of your liquid sample.\nLyse cells in a fast prep (MP Biomedicals) set at 6.5 power setting, for 3 cycles consisting of 40 s ON and 3 min OFF. Chill the tube holder using grinded dry ice.\nNote: Cell lysis can be performed differently depending on strain background requirements, equipment, or yeast model. At least 90% of lysed cells are recommended to proceed with the protocol. See troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] for further details.\nAdd 500 μL of ice-cold complete IP buffer and vortex.\nHeat up a needle under the Bunsen lighter (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and poke a hole within the cap and the bottom of the tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Place it immediately into a 5 mL tube, on ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1631-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Scheme of steps 19–21 for sample recovery after cell lysis\n(A) Heat up a needle (G25) under the Bunsen burner until incandescence.\n(B) Using the ablaze needle, make a hole in the cap of 2 mL screw-cap tube containing the sample. Then repeat the process to make a hole in the bottom of the tube.\n(C) Immediately place the 2 mL screw-cap tube into a 5 mL tube on ice. Centrifuge for 1 min at 300 g and 4°C to recover the sample. Put back the 5 mL tube on ice and remove the 2 mL screw-cap tube containing glass beads. Transfer the supernatant into a 1.5 mL tube and continue with step 22. Original images were obtained and modified with permission from smart.servier.com[href=http://smart.servier.com].\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 300 g at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: For centrifugation in step 20, use 15–50 mL tube centrifuge buckets to accommodate the 2 mL screw-cap tubes inserted into the 5 mL tubes.",
    "Transfer each sample (supernatant and any pellet formed) to a 1.5 mL tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCentrifuge 5 min at 7,500 g at 4°C.\nTransfer supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube. Discard the pellet.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 13,300 g at 4°C.\nTransfer supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube. Keep on ice. Discard the pellet.\nOptional: If performing puromycin treatment, add 12 μL of puromycin stock solution (50 mg/mL) and 6 μL of GTP stock solution (200 mM) to puromycin treated samples. Mix and incubate 15 minutes on ice before proceeding to step 26.\nCritical: Save 10 μL for Western blot (input). Add 10 μL of 2× Laemmli buffer (0.15 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue).\nNote: If the protein bait contains a N-terminal tag or a long C-terminal tag (such as HA3-TAP2 and you use anti-HA antibodies for IP), you will be able to check if your IP worked by testing binding of the bait to its own mRNA. In these cases, Western blot is optional (see second “Note” after step 88).\nMeasure protein concentration using the Bradford method.\nNote: This protocol was optimized using 4 mg of total protein for RNA immunoprecipitation and 400 μg of total protein for total RNA extraction (10% of the amount used for IP). Thus, you will need at least 4.4 mg of total protein for each sample to continue the experiment. See troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] for further details.\nCritical: It is essential to use the same amount of total protein for IP and total RNA extractions between samples. If one or more of the samples contain less than 4.4 mg of total protein but nevertheless decide to proceed with the procedure, adjust the concentration of the other samples accordingly.",
    "For each sample, wash 100 μL of antibody-coated Pan mouse IgG magnetic beads 3 times with 500 μL ice-cold IP buffer:\nTransfer 100 μL of beads to a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 500 μL of ice-cold IP buffer.\nConstantly invert the tube for 1 min at room temperature.\nRemove supernatant using a magnetic stand.\nRepeat b-d twice.\nAdd 4 mg of total protein extract to the beads.\nIf needed, fill the volume up to 500 μL using ice-cold complete IP buffer.\nAdd 5 μL RNasin (40 U/μL) and 5 μL PMSF (100 mM).\nIncubate 2 h at 4°C, rotating.\nNote: During step 31, you can proceed with the “Total RNA extraction” step.\nTotal RNA extraction—Day 3\nTiming: 1 h\nNote: If using other RNA extraction kits, please refer to manufacturer’s instructions.\nGoal: To recover total RNA that will be used as input in the final qPCR assay.\nNote: If instead of qPCR, a transcriptome analysis is performed, such as microarrays or high-throughput sequencing, please see the “limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]” section below and supplemental information.\nPrepare lysis buffer (provided in the kit) by addition of β-mercaptoethanol (not provided in the kit). Add 10 μL of β-mercaptoethanol 13.4 M per 1 mL of lysis buffer.\nTake the appropriate volume of sample to get 400 μg of total protein extract and complete with complete IP buffer up to 50 μL final volume.\nAdd 250 μL of lysis buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol.\nAdd 250 μL of ethanol 100%.\nLoad onto a column.\nCentrifuge 30 s at 16,100 g.\nDiscard flow through.\nAdd 700 μL of wash buffer I.\nCentrifuge 30 s at 16,100 g.\nDiscard flow through.\nAdd 500 μL of wash buffer II.\nCentrifuge 30 s at 16,100 g.\nDiscard flow through.\nAdd 500 μL of wash buffer II.\nCentrifuge 2 min at 16,100 g.",
    "Transfer the column to a new tube.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 16,100 g.\nTransfer the column to a collection tube.\nAdd 30 μL of RNase-free water.\nIncubate for 1 min at 20°C–30°C.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 16,100 g.\nReload the eluate into the column.\nIncubate for 1 min at 20°C–30°C.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 16,100 g.\nMeasure concentration.\nKeep the samples on ice until proceeding with DNase treatment and reverse transcription.\nPause point: Total RNA samples can be stored at −80°C before proceeding with DNase treatment and reverse transcription.\nImmunoprecipitation (part 2-washes)—Day 3\nTiming: 2–3 h\nGoal: To immunoprecipitate the bait and all associated RNAs.\nNote: Per sample, you will need 3,033 μL W1 buffer [To 3,000 μL of W buffer, add 3 μL heparin (50 mg/mL) and 30 μL PMSF (100 mM)], 1501.5 μL W2 buffer [To 1,500 μL of W buffer, add 1.5 μL heparin (50 mg/mL)] and 1,500 μL W buffer.\nNote: To prepare sequencing libraries from the IP RNA do not add heparin to the washing buffers since it can impact downstream steps during library preparation. We use heparin in washing buffers as a cheaper alternative to commercial RNase inhibitors and we have systematically and successfully used it when performing RIP followed by qPCR (Toullec et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nAfter the 2 h incubation at 4°C (step 31), place the IP on a magnetic stand and remove the supernatant.\nCritical: Keep 10 μL for Western blot (flow through). Add 10 μL of 2× Laemmli buffer.\nNote: Remember that Western blot is optional if the bait contains N-terminal or long C-terminal tags (See second “Note” after step 88).",
    "Note: For washing the beads (steps 59–61), please follow these instructions. Each wash step involves addition of buffer, either long or short incubation, buffer removal. Short washes are performed by constant inversion of the tubes for 1 minute at room temperature. Long washes are performed by rotating the tubes for 10 minutes at 4°C.\nWash 4 times with 750 μL of W1. 2 short washes, followed by 1 long wash and 1 short wash.\nWash 2 times with 750 μL of W2. Long washes.\nWash 2 times with 750 μL of W buffer. 1 long wash, then 1 short wash.\nBriefly spin down and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 110 μL W buffer.\nCritical: Take 10 μL (from the 110 μL in step 63) for Western blot, to which add 10 μL of 2× Laemmli buffer, heat up at 90°C for 5 minutes and centrifuge 5 minutes at 16,100 g. Store supernatant at −20°C (IP sample) or immediately proceed with SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. When possible, we recommend probing the blot with a different antibody from the one used for the IP, or TrueBlot secondary antibodies, to avoid detection of heavy and light chains.\nNote: As stated above, Western blot could be optional if the bait contains a N-terminal or a long C-terminal tag (see second “Note” after step 88). In such case, if Western blot is not performed, resuspend the beads of step 63 in 100 μL of W buffer.",
    "Note: If using the PureLinkTM RNA Micro Kit for the following steps (see next heading), resuspend in 55 μL W buffer in step 63 (or 50 μL if Western blot is not performed) and use 5 μL for Western blot, to which add 5 μL of 2× Laemmli buffer, heat up at 90°C for 5 minutes and centrifuge 5 minutes at 16,100 g. Store supernatant at −20°C (IP sample) or immediately proceed with SDS-PAGE and Western blot.\nIsolation of immunoprecipitated RNA—Day 3\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h\nGoal: To recover RNAs bound to the bait.\nNote: We have successfully used both the PureLinkTM RNA Mini and Micro kits. If using other RNA extraction kits, please refer to manufacturer instructions. The following instructions (from step 64) are for the Mini kit. If using the Micro kit, adjust the volumes as follows. In step 63, resuspend in 55 μL W buffer (save 5 μL for Western blot). In step 79, use 15 μL for elution. In step 86.a, take 13 μL of the IP RNA (adjust to 13 μL with RNase-free water if needed). In step 86.a.i, add 2 μL of 10× reaction buffer and 4 μL of RNase-free water. In step 86.a.vii, transfer 15 μL of the supernatant to a PCR tube. In step 86.b.i, add 1.25 μL of 10 mM dNTPs. In step 86.b.ii, add 0.21 μL of random primers and 0.54 μL of RNase-free water.

    "Transfer 15 μL of the supernatant to a new tube.\nCritical: Do not transfer any of the pellet (containing DNase inhibitor and DNase) to the new tube.\nTransfer 3 μL (1 μg) of the DNase-treated total RNA for reverse transcription into a PCR tube:\nNote: Use another 3 μL (1 μg) of the DNase-treated total RNA samples to be used as control for genomic DNA contamination in the qPCR (see next heading). Proceed these samples exactly the same way in the reverse transcription reaction, but without adding reverse transcriptase in step 85.b.vii).\nAdd 8.83 μL of RNase-free water.\nAdd 0.17 μL of random primers.\nAdd 1 μL of 10 mM dNTPs.\nPre-set the following program in the thermocycler:     65°C/5 min.     4°C/90 s.     50°C/60 min.     4°C/infinite hold.\nPut the tubes in the thermocycler, start the program and let it run for the 65°C/5 min step and just 30 s from the 4°C/90 s step.

The relative binding frequency is estimated by calculating the fraction of input cDNA recovered in the IP.",
    "Note: This protocol was designed to test for interaction between a specific bait and candidate RNAs. For an unbiased screen, use a RIP-chip or RIP-seq protocol, in which cDNAs are analyzed either through microarray hybridization or high throughput sequencing, respectively (see Costello et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Here, we also provide a quick guide on how to proceed with a global approach in the “limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]” section below. Regardless, whenever possible, we recommend performing an initial check by qPCR using a positive control RNA.\nNote: For qPCR, we typically use a 50-fold dilution of total cDNA and a 3-fold dilution of IP cDNA samples, but higher dilutions of IP cDNA up to 10-fold work equally well. We used 10× home-made SYBR Green Master Mix (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]), 96 well plates and Stratagene MX3000P and MX3005P qPCR machines. Our amplicons are typically below 200 bp in size. Optimization might be required when using other dilutions, qPCR reagents, machine or amplicon length.\nFor each primer pair, prepare dilutions of one of the input cDNAs in sterile distilled water to make a standard curve and calculate primer pair efficiency.\nNote: To prepare the standards, we use input cDNA from a non-tagged strain which has grown and has been processed in standard conditions. For an initial standard of a first-time used pair of priming oligonucleotides, we recommend making 4, 20, 100, 500, 2,500 and 12,500-fold dilutions of one of the input cDNAs. Once the primers are validated, we reduce the number of dilutions for the standard down at least three.",
    "Alternatives: We strongly recommend using the same type of material for the standard as for the samples that are analyzed. However, if this is not possible, dilutions of genomic DNA can be used to prepare the standard for all primer pairs. 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005 and 0.0005 ng/μL concentrated genomic DNA samples could be used in a first try to prepare the standards. Always use clean, high-quality genomic DNA preparations.\nNote: We include a standard curve for each primer pair in the same plate than the samples.\nPrepare a master mix for each primer pair that you want to test in your qPCR experiment, by mixing the reagents indicated in the table below.\nNote: Primers specific for a negative control should be included. For example, a gene which has no functional relationship with the bait and does not interact with it. If there is no previous information, include several potential negative controls for your first assay.\nNote: As a positive control, primers targeting the mRNA of the bait itself can be used. We have successfully used this type of control for proteins with N-terminal epitope tag used for immunoprecipitation, as well as with long C-terminal tags, such as HA3-TAP2 using an HA antibody for IP. Beware that if using a short C-terminal tag in the bait, this positive control might not work because the native polypeptide quickly detaches from polysomes, hence its own mRNA, upon synthesis of the C-terminal epitope tag. If using an antibody against an endogenous protein, the success of this strategy depends on where the epitope is in the sequence.\nNote: To calculate the volume needed for each primer pair master mix consider the number of samples you have, 3 technical replicates and the standard (also performed in triplicates).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1631_6.csv",
    "Prepare a 50-fold dilution of the input cDNAs and a 3-fold dilution of your IP cDNA into sterile distilled water.\nPrepare an equivalent dilution of the control DNase-treated total RNA samples in which reverse transcriptase was not added during the reverse transcription reaction (see Note in step 85.b) to be used as control for genomic DNA contamination. We will name these samples No-RT samples.\nDistribute 20 μL of the master mix prepared in step 88 per well. Mix well before dispensing.\nDistribute 5 μL of the diluted cDNA or No-RT samples in each of the corresponding wells. Mix well before dispensing.\nCover the PCR plate with compatible tube caps or a transparent film as required by the qPCR machine instrument and mix by hand.\nBriefly spin down the qPCR plate in a centrifuge at 200 g.\nRun the plate into the qPCR machine using the appropriate program according to the primer pairs used and machine instructions. We used the program below for our assays described in Toullec et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1631_7.csv\nNote: It is possible to keep the plate at 4°C in the dark. We have had successful runs after up to 2 hours.\nNote: A melting curve at the end of the program is important to obtain the dissociation curve of the PCR product. Only a single specific product should form.\nCalculate the efficiency of the primers. Most qPCR machine software do this automatically. The efficiency should be between 90%–110% (−3.6 ≥ slope ≥ −3.1) to proceed with quantification.",
    "Note: To manually calculate the efficiency of your primers, first calculate the equation of their standard curve to obtain the slope. The slope is derived from a graph that plots the cycle threshold (Ct) values against the Log10 of a given amount of DNA template. Efficiency (%) = [10ˆ(-1/slope) – 1] × 100. A slope of -3.32 indicates an amplification efficiency of 100%.\nAfter exporting the data in the selected format, calculate the starting quantities by relying on the standard curve of each primer pair. Most qPCR machine software do this automatically and allow to directly export these data.\nCalculate the mean of the starting quantities of each sample by averaging the three (or more) technical replicates.\nCorrect each input and IP value for the corresponding dilutions and calculate a “percent IP” value, which is a proxy of the RNA IP efficiency relative to the amount of RNA in the input and calculated by dividing each IP value by its corresponding input value (see tables below).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1631_8.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1631_9.csv\n∗For each IP, we use 0.00076-times less input (0.076%). Thus, the IP/IN ratio must be multiplied by 0.00076 ([IP value] × 1)/([input value] × 7.6 × 10-4)]"
