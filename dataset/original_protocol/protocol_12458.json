    "All procedures involving animals were approved by the Michigan State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Experimental Setup\nUse an operant conditioning box which consists of a five-hole nosepoke wall on one side and a food delivery trough on the opposite side.\n\t\nThe center nosepoke hole is considered as a \"fixation\" hole and the four other holes (two on each side of the fixation hole) are considered motor target holes. Each hole is equipped with a tri-color LED and an infrared beam emitter-detector system that detects when the animal enters and retracts from the fixation hole.\nUse a programmable tone generator to generate single frequency tones with millisecond precision and connect it to a speaker mounted inside the operant box. Control the tone generator and nosepokes through the behavioral tracking system using the appropriate software. Use a hardware and software system that provides millisecond timescale monitoring of behavioral events and control of cues and responses.\n\t\tNote: The amplitude of both tone and noise cues should be kept around 60 ± 3 dB SPL.\n2. Early Habituation\nRestrict the subject's food intake gradually to ~5 g per 100 g of the subject's normal weight (e.g. over the course of 3 days). The subject should maintain 85-90% of their ad libitum weight.\nHabituate the subject to handling by the experimenter and familiarize the subject with the apparatus from the first day of starting the food deprivation protocol. Start handling the animal and place it in the operant conditioning box while providing food pellets in the pellet trough to encourage the subject to explore the cage and get familiar with the reward delivery location.\n3. Subject Training\nGeneral notes",
    "The task suggested here needs precise coordination between perception of an auditory cue, minimizing movements during the delay period and movement execution.\nGradually train the subject step-by-step to prepare them for the final desired behavior.\nMake sure that at the end of each step, the subject maintains >75% behavioral performance for at least three consecutive sessions before progressing to the next stage.\nOnce the final stage is reached, keep the subject on the protocol for a week to ensure the performance is maintained at the desirable level.\nStart: Familiarize the subject with the nosepoke holes, food delivery port and the association between the flashing holes and reward.\n\t\nSelect one out of the four targets on a random schedule.\nPlay the Go cue (a white auditory noise) and keep the LED inside the hole flashing (0.3 sec pulse duration).\nSet the software to reward the subject upon visits to the hole.\nTime-out the trial after 30 sec if the hole is not visited and start a new trial.\nDo not reward any visits to the incorrect holes.\nTarget Selection: Punish erroneous visits to the nonselected holes.\n\t\nUpon visits to incorrect holes, terminate the trial followed by 5 sec of black-out.\n\t\tNote: During a black-out epoch, the fixation hole LED is turned off in the cage. This means that the subject cannot initiate a trial and needs to wait until the fixation hole LED starts flashing.\nSelect a new hole and start a new trial.\nNosepoke: Train the subject to poke inside the fixation hole to start a trial.\n\t\nFlash a yellow LED inside the fixation hole.\nUpon visiting the fixation hole immediately play the Go cue and start a new trial.\nPenalize incorrect visits by 5 sec of black-out.",
    "Delay: Teach the subject to maintain their nose inside the fixation hole for a set period of time (delay period) that is increased gradually as training progresses.\n\t\nWait for the subject to visit the fixation hole.\nTerminate the trial if the subject retracts within 500 msec. Otherwise, play the Go cue.\nPenalize premature retractions by a black-out period for 7 sec.\nReward the correct visits by delivering a food pellet.\nTwo Cues (with Light): Increase and randomize the delay period length and introduce the auditory instruction cue.\n\t\nIncrease the length of the delay period to an average of 1.5 sec.\nChoose a random delay period length at each trial based on a uniform density between 1.3-1.8 sec.\nIntroduce the instruction cue as a single frequency auditory tone pulsed in triplets, with a pulse duration of 150 msec and interpulse interval of 100 msec.\n\t\t\nPlay the instruction cue immediately after the subject enters the fixation hole.\nAssign two instruction cues to each of the targets.\nOnly use one cue associated for each target at this stage.\nLet the subject use both auditory and visual cues to select the target hole.\nTwo Cues (without Light): Train the subject to only use auditory cues.\n\t\nTurn off the flashing LEDs inside the target holes so that the subject would only use auditory instruction cues.\nFour Cues: Introduce the two other cues to the sequence of randomly presented instruction cues and repeat sections 3.5.3-3.6.1.\n4. Behavioral Data Analysis\nSuccess Rate: Define success rate as the percentage of correct visits to the targets divided by the total number of trials.\n\t\nMeasure the success rate at each stage of training.\nError types:\nPremature retraction: measure the percentage of trials timed-out due to early retractions from the fixation hole.",
    "Comission error: Calculate the percentage of failed trials when the subject visits an uninstructed target\nOmission Error: Calculate the percentage of errors when the subject does not visit any of the targets after trial initiation.\nMeasured variables:\nReaction Time (RT): For each trial, measure the delay between the onset of the Go cue and the subject retracting from the fixation hole.\nTime to Target (TT): Measure the duration between the subject retraction from the fixation hole and entering the target hole.\nSubscription Required.
