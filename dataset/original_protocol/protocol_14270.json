  "procedures": [
    "1. Cell culture\nCulture SMA patient fibroblasts in the growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium 1:1 F-12 (Ham) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin) in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nDetermine cell concentration using an automated cell counter and dilute cells to 1 x 105 cells/mL in the growth medium, then seed on the appropriate plate. Use 12-well plates (1 mL per well) for RT-PCR or qPCR.\nIncubate the plates for 24 h in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\n2. LNA/DNA mixmer transfection\nEnsure cell confluency of around 65 - 80% for optimal transfection efficiency.\nThaw 10 μM LNA/DNA mixmers slowly on ice.\nIn a 1.5-mL tube, prepare a 20x mixmer solution by adding the mixmers to serum-deprived media so that the final volume reaches 50 μL.\nMix the mixmer solution with 50 μL of serum-deprived media containing 3% transfection reagent (1:1 ratio).\nIncubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.\nAdd 900 μL serum-deprived medium with 5% FBS to each tube.\nAspirate the old media from the plate and replace with 1 mL LNA/DNA mixmer solution containing the transfection reagent.\nIncubate the cells for 24 - 48 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.\n3. RNA extraction\nRemove the medium and add 1 mL of guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform reagent to the cells. Wash the bottom of the well several times with guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform and collect it into 1.5-mL tubes.\nVortex at high speed for 30 s and store at -80 °C for 1 h or overnight.\nThaw the samples at room temperature and vortex well.\nAdd 200 µL chloroform, shake vigorously for 15 s, and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.",
    "Collect the top clear aqueous phase into a new tube. Make sure to avoid collecting any of the white interphase that forms between the upper and lower phases.\nAdd 500 µL isopropanol and 1 µL 8 µg/µL glycogen (RNA grade). Vortex for 10 s and incubate at room temperature for 10 min or at -20 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove all of the supernatant. A white pellet will form at the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 1 mL cold 75% ethanol and centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove all the ethanol and dry the pellet at room temperature until no ethanol is left in the tube.\nDissolve the pellet in 30 µL DNase/RNase free water, and incubate for 10 min at 60 °C.\nMeasure RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer (at 260 nm), and adjust RNA concentration to 50 ng/µL.\n4. One step RT-PCR to measure the exon inclusion rate of SMN2\nMix 12.5 µL of 2x RT-PCR reaction buffer, 1.0 µL of one-step RT-PCR enzyme mix, 0.5 µL of each primer (SMN2 forward: 5'-CTGCCTCCATTTCCTTCTG-3', SMN2 reverse: 5'-TGGTGTCATTTAGTGCTGCTC-3', GAPDH forward: 5'-TCCCTGAGCTGAACGGGAAG-3', GAPDH reverse: 5'-GGAGGAGTTTGGTCGCTGT-3', 2 µL of total RNA (50 ng/µL), and 8.5 µL of RNase/DNase-free distilled water.\nAfter cDNA is synthesized at 50 °C for 15 min, start the PCR reaction. Amplify the SMN2 exon 6-8 with 30 PCR cycles (94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 25 s). Amplify the GAPDH with 20 PCR cycles (94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 20 s).",
    "Add 5 μL 6x loading dye to the PCR product, and load 5 µL of the mixture into a 2% agarose gel and run for 40 min at 100 V.\nImage the gel and analyze it using ImageJ software.\nMeasure the intensity of full-length bands and Δ7 bands. Calculate the rate of exon 7 inclusion by the intensity value of (full-length)/ (full-length + Δ7 SMN2).\n5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the exon inclusion rate of SMN2\nFor cDNA synthesis, mix 1 µL Oligo dT, 1 µL 10 mM dNTPs, and 11 µL total RNA (50 ng/µL). Incubate at 65 °C for 5 min.\nPlace the samples on ice and add 4 µL 5x buffer, 1 µL 0.1 M DTT, 1 µL RNase inhibitor, and 1 µL reverse transcriptase to each sample.\nIncubate at 50 °C for 60 min, and heat up to 80 °C for 10 min to stop the reaction. The cDNA can be stored at -20 °C.\nDilute the cDNAs with RNase-free water (1:5 dilution). Mix 10 µL 2x SYBR Green qPCR enzyme mix, 0.8 µL 10 µM each primer (full-length SMN2 forward: 5′-GCTATCATACTGGCTATTATATGGGTTTT-3′, full-length SMN2 reverse: 5′-CTCTATGCCAGCATTTCTCCTTAAT-3′, Δ7 SMN2 forward: 5′-TCTGGACCACCAATAATTCCCC-3′, Δ7 SMN2 reverse: 5′-ATGCCAGCATTTCCATATAATAGCC-3′, GAPDH forward: 5′-GCAAATTCCATGGCACCGT-3′, GAPDH reverse: 5′-AGGGATCTCGCTCCTGGAA-3′), 3 µL diluted cDNA, and 5.4 µL RNase-free water.\nStart the qPCR reaction. Use the conditions: 95 °C for 30 s, then a 40 cycle repeat at 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 20 s.\nCalculate the relative expression of full-length SMN2 to GAPDH or Δ7 SMN2, and normalize to the non-treated cells with the ΔΔCt algorithm.\n6. Western blotting\nRemove transfection medium from cells and wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once.\nAdd 100 µL lysis buffer with a protease inhibitor.",
    "Detach cells from the bottom of each well using a sterile cell scraper, and collect into 1.5-mL tubes. Incubate samples on ice for 30 min.\nPass cell lysate through 21-G needle 10 times to crush the cells.\nCentrifuge at 20,800 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant into new 1.5-mL tubes.
