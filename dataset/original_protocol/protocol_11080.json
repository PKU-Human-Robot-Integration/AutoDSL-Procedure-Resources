    "AU565 (HER2+) and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were used for the present study (see Table of Materials).\n1. Preparing tumor aggregates\nPrepare AU565 (HER2+) breast cancer cell growth media using Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 basal medium (+) in L-glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell growth media using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM of L-glutamine (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare 70%-90% confluent cell cultures of both cell lines (~3-4 days of preparation) in standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity). Detach cell monolayers from their culture flasks following standard trypsinization method.\n\tNOTE: Prevent overexposure of cells to the trypsin, affecting their viability.\n\t\nFor AU565 cells, aspirate cell media from the flask using a pipette (or, if available, using a vacuum pump connected via tubing to an autoclaved glass pipette tip) and replace with 2 mL Trypsin-EDTA. Leave the flask for 3 min at room temperature, and then move to the incubator for 4 additional minutes. Afterward, add 6 mL of growth media to the flask to neutralize the trypsin.\nFor MDA-MB-231 cells, aspirate cell media from the flask in the same manner as performed in step 1.3.1 and replace with 1.5 mL Trypsin-EDTA. After 7 min of incubation, add 8.5 mL of growth media to the flask to neutralize the trypsin.\nAdd 10 µL of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer to determine the number of cells in the suspension24. Resuspend cells in media at the desired concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/mL.",
    "Dispense 50 µL of cell suspension into each well of a round-bottom, non-adherent, 96-well plate. For suspensions prepared without Matrigel (basement membrane matrix, see Table of Materials), add 50 µL of plain growth media to each well.\n\t\nFor suspensions prepared with the basement membrane matrix, remove the matrix vial from -20 °C storage and place it in the refrigerator to thaw overnight. Prepare a container with growth media and refrigerate for 10 min to chill.\nUsing a frozen pipette tip, add the matrix to chilled media such that the final concentration of this solution is 5%. Add 50 µL of this media to each well, such that the final concentration of matrix in these wells is 2.5%3.\n\t\tNOTE: In prior work, the aggregate morphology was assessed for these cell lines10,25, and found that MDA-MB-231 aggregates form spheroids with the addition of the membrane matrix, while MDA-MB-231 cultures without the matrix and AU565+/- matrix all form disk-shaped aggregates. Quantified sphericity of >0.8 on a scale from 0 (plane) - 1.0 (perfect sphere) was used to identify sufficiently spherical aggregates and thus expected to have the requisite surface-to-volume ratio for in vivo-like behavior26,27.\nCentrifuge the plates at 123 x g for 10 min at room temperature immediately following seeding to ensure the collection of a cell pellet at the bottom of each well.\n\tNOTE: This step must take place as quickly after seeding as possible. The authors observed that too much time in between these steps allows the cells to settle across the bottoms and sides of each well, inhibiting their ability to collect and aggregate at the bottom of the well.\nIncubate the plates for 4 days, at which point the cell aggregates are considered to be matured.",
    "NOTE: AU565 aggregates prepared with the basement membrane matrix require an additional 5-day culture period for the drug response study (9 days total, media change on day 4).\n2. Administration of Trastuzumab (TZM) to AU565 cell aggregates\nPrepare 500 µg/mL of TZM solution (see Table of Materials) in AU565 growth media. On Day 4, add 10 µL of this solution to each well, such that the final concentration within each well is 50 µg/mL.\nCulture aggregates for 5 additional days following the addition of TZM and assess at key time points.\n\t​NOTE: For the present study, time points of 0 h (immediately prior to drugging), 24 h, and 120 h post-drug were used to analyze the drug.\n3. Optical Coherence Tomography imaging\nNOTE: Samples herein were imaged with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) during each day of maturation (1-4), and then again on day 5 (24 h post-drug-addition) and day 9 (120 h post-drug-addition) for selected drugged aggregates. A commercial Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SDOCT, see Table of Materials) system for OCT imaging was used for the current study. Although this approach is amenable to almost any OCT system, and the procedure followed will be generally similar between different systems, some of the detailed steps that follow are specific to the present equipment.\nUtilize an OCT system for structural imaging. Set the A-scan rate to 5.5 kHz for high-resolution image collection. Set the index of refraction to 1.33 for samples in a liquid medium. Set the voxel size to 1.10 x 1.10 x 2.58 µm3.\nIn the Image Parameters window on the right side of the screen, set the field of view (FOV) by inputting X, Y, and Z values (in mm) such that the sample is encompassed within this region of interest.",
    "NOTE: FOV for these studies was typically set to 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 mm3. Ensure that the sample fits within this region by alternating the 'Angle' input between 0 and 90 degrees and performing visual confirmation.\nClick on 3D Acquisition Mode, and then click on Record to collect the 3D volume scan of the sample.\n4. Image analysis\nExport the OCT file into the software format (Imaris, see Table of Materials).\n\t\nOpen the OCT file in the software development kit. Click on Export, set the file type to .jpg, and export the images into an empty folder.\nOpen the image processing software (FIJI, see Table of Materials) and import the image sequence from the folder where the exported JPEGs are stored. Use software to stitch the image sequence together, and then save this file as a TIFF image.\nCreate a volume reconstruction following the steps below.\n\t\nOpen Imaris and navigate to the converted TIFF file within the Arena. Go to Edit > Image Properties and input the voxel size (in µm) from the OCT image into the corresponding XYZ boxes. Then, click on OK.\n\t\tNOTE: Within the sample object tree on the left-hand side of the screen, deselect the Volume tab to prevent software lag.\nClick on Add New Surfaces above the objects tree. In the menu below the tree, click on Skip Automatic Creation and edit manually. Within the Display Adjustment window, manually slide the red and black arrows to enhance the contrast between the sample and the background and improve sample visualization.",
    "Adjust the 'Slice position' to the slice at one edge of the sample, i.e., where the sample signal first appears. Use the escape key to change the mouse from the Navigation mode to the Select mode, and then click on Draw. Manually trace the outline of the region displaying the signal.\nAdvance the slice position by entering the next position into the input box. This next position must be ≤100 slices further into the sample than the prior one. Manually trace the region displaying the signal.\nRepeat Step 4.2.4 through the thickness of the sample until the opposite edge of the sample is reached. Then, click on Create Surface in the left menu to stitch these slices together and complete the volume reconstruction.\nClick on Edit, and then click on Mask Selection. This creates a new channel in the Display Adjustment window containing only the isolated sample. Morphologic characteristics of the sample can now be found in the Statistics > Detailed tab.\n\t\tNOTE: This approach was followed to determine the sphericities and volumes reported within this current study.\nObtain a sample's total cell density following the steps below.\n\t\nAbove the object tree, select Add New Spots. In the Algorithm Settings menu, deselect all boxes. Click on the Blue Arrow to move to the Source Channel screen.\n\t\t\nFrom the drop-down menu that appears, select the masked channel created in step 5.2.8, typically named Channel 2. Input the average cell diameter for the sample in the XY diameter box. Ensure that Background Subtraction is checked.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For this work with AU565 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the diameter was set to 10 µm. This selection is based on cell size (explained in the Discussion section).",
    "Click on the Blue Arrow to move to the Classify Spots screen. In the graph at the bottom of the menu, click and drag the left edge of the yellow threshold to the left edge of the graph, such that all objects are included in the yellow shaded threshold. Then, click on the Green Arrow to complete the spot creation.\nObtain the number of objects identified (i.e., sample cell count) by clicking on Statistics > Overall > Total Number of Spots.\nTo determine average aggregate cell density, divide the aggregate's cell count (measured in step 4.3.3) by aggregate volume (determined in step 4.2.6).\nAssess the regional density in concentric layers of spherical aggregates (Figure 1A).\n\t\nFollowing morphologic and cell density analysis, assess the regional density. Click on the surface created in step 4.2.5 and navigate to the Surfaces Style/Quality tab. Change selection to Center Point and change pixel width to ≤20 for best visibility. Navigate to Statistics > Detailed > Position and record the location of the center spot.\nSelect Add New Reference Frame from the menu above the object tree. Check the Visible and Fix boxes next to XY in the menu. Click and drag the center of the reference frame icon such that it is in line with the center spot. Deselect the XY Visible and Fix boxes and select them for XZ.\n\t\t\nOnce again, click and drag the center of the reference frame icon such that it is in line with the center spot. Lastly, repeat this for the YZ plane, alternating between these three fixed planes until the reference frame perfectly aligns with the center spot. Double click on the reference frame in the object tree and rename it Center or Similar.",
    "Click on the spots created in step 4.3 and navigate to Statistics > Detailed > Position Reference Frame. Click on Position X Reference Frame until it sorts from highest to lowest value. Record the highest value - this indicates the furthest edge of the sample, i.e., sample radius.\n\t\tNOTE: Since the samples used here are circular in the XY plane, calculations can be performed along the X or Y axis with similar results. For samples that do not exhibit X-Y symmetry (asymmetric, ellipsoid, irregular geometries, etc.), it is recommended to perform these analyses along multiple axes.\nNavigate to Statistics. In the bottom-right corner of the menu, click on Export All Statistics to File and save data into a spreadsheet.\nPerform manual calculations to identify concentric layers along the X-axis.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples used in this study were approximately 500 µm in diameter; thus, there are two outer 200 µm thick concentric zones and one inner 100 µm thick central zone. It is recommended to maintain zones that are 200 µm thick because the diffusion behaviors are expected to change over this distance7,28,29,30. In keeping with this reasoning, it is also recommended to use more concentric zones for larger samples and vice versa for smaller samples.\nSet a 200 µm outer layer region by subtracting 200 µm from the outer radius found in step 4.4.3. Thus, the outer region will encompass spots with X-positions between Xradius and Xouter,inner-edge (Figure 1A, orange region).\nSet a transitional region by subtracting 200 µm from Xouter,inner-edge. The transitional region will encompass spots with X-positions between Xouter,inner-edge, and Xtransitional,inner-edge (Figure 1A, pink region).\nSet a central core region encompassing the remaining spots between the sample center and Xtransitional,inner-edge (Figure 1A, blue region).",
    "Open the saved spreadsheet file created in step 4.4.4. Navigate to the Distance from Origin Reference Frame tab.\nCalculate the number of spots in the core region using the function' COUNTIF (Columnx, \"< Xtransitional,inner-edge\"), where Columnx is the 'Distance from Origin Reference Frame' column. The resulting value is the cell number in this region. Divide this value by the volume of the region to obtain cell density.\nIn a similar manner, calculate the number of cells in the transitional region using 'COUNTIF (Columnx, \"< Xouter,inner-edge\") - COUNTIF(Columnx, \"> Xtransitional,inner-edge\").\nCalculate the number of cells in the outer region using 'COUNTIF (Columnx,\"> Xtransitional,inner-edge\").\nAssess the regional cell density in non-spherical samples via 'Regional Plugs' (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: For non-spherical samples that do not have concentric layers, the 'Regional Plug' method is developed to sample local cell density at various radial depths throughout the aggregate.\n\t\nRepeat steps 4.4.1-4.4.3 to set the central reference frame (Figure 1B, central yellow circle) and obtain the total sample radius.\nPerform manual calculations to identify the placement of reference frames within the transitional and outer regions such that cell density can be assessed in the sample at these locations.\n\t\t\nTo calculate the outer location, subtract 50 µm from the sample radius value from step 4.5.1 and use this value as the X-position.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use the same Y and Z position values recorded in step 4.5.1 for all plugs within a given sample to measure cell density along the X-axis of the sample (Figure 1B, leftmost yellow circle).",
    "Above the object tree, click on Add New Spots and click on Skip Automatic Creation, Edit Manually. With the pointer in 'select' mode, hold shift+click to place a spot on the screen. In the left menu, input the XYZ position values calculated above. Adjust the XY and Z diameters to ≤20 for best visibility.\nRepeat step 4.4.2 to add a reference frame at this spot location. Rename this reference frame in the object tree outer or similar.\nTo calculate the transitional (midpoint) location, find the average of the Xcenter position value and the Xouter position values. Use this value as the X position for the transitional reference frame. As above, use the same Y and Z values recorded in step 4.5.1 for all plugs within a given sample to measure cell density along the X-axis of the sample (Figure 1B, middle yellow circle).\nRepeat step 4.4.2 to place the middle reference frame at this location, renaming it 'transitional' or similar once created.\nClick on the spots created in step 4.3 and navigate to Statistics. In the bottom-right corner of the menu, click on Export All Statistics to File and save data into a spreadsheet.\nOpen the spreadsheet. Navigate to the Distance from Origin Reference Frame tab. Each object’s distance to the reference frames is shown in column A, and the grouping of reference frames for each object is shown in column G. Use the ‘MOD’ function to numerically assign each distance to its corresponding reference frame, where 0 is the center frame, 1 is the transitional, and 2 is the outer.",
    "Filter the values in this column to work with the distances in each reference frame. For each of the reference frames, calculate the number of objects within 50 micrometers of the frame using the function 'COUNTIF (Columnx, \"≤50\"), where Columnx is the 'Distance from Origin Reference Frame' column for each group. The resulting value corresponds to the number of cells in that regional plug. Divide this value by the volume of the 100-μm plug to obtain cell density.\nPerform the Spatially-Refined Regional Plug method (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: This approach was used to assess regional cell viability in response to drug application. Including more reference frames improves the resolution of cell densities able to be calculated throughout the model thickness.\n\t\nRepeat steps 4.4.1-4.4.3 to set the center reference frame (Figure 1C, central yellow circle) and obtain the sample radius.\nPerform manual calculations to determine additional locations of interest. To do this, add 100 µm to the Xcenter value, and then use the Y and Z values of the center point to define the first location along the center axis. Add a reference frame to this position as in step 4.4.2 (Figure 1C, yellow circle adjacent to center circle).\n\t\tNOTE: Add fewer µm at this step if seeking higher resolution density tracking.\nRepeat steps 4.6.2, adding 100 µm (or desired number of µm) to each sequential X-location to establish an axis of equally-spaced plugs through the thickness of the sample. Place the last reference frame ≤50 µm away from the outer radius of the sample (Figure 1C, yellow circles).\nRepeat steps 4.5.3-4.5.5 to obtain cell counts within each 100 µm diameter plug. Divide these values by the volume of each corresponding plug to obtain local cell density.",
    "Repeat all steps in this section for OCT data collected at each timepoint of the drug trial. Comparing cell count at each location through the treatment time course should reveal where cell density is decreasing (i.e., regions experiencing cell death) and, consequently, how deep the drug is penetrating (i.e., which layers see a drop in cell density vs. those that maintain or display an increase in cell density levels).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64030/64030fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic illustration.
