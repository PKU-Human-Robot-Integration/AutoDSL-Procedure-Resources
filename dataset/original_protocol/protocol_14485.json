    "All animal experiments have been approved by the local animal care and ethical committee. The entire protocol from induction of anesthesia in the mouse until the end of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp takes approximately 2 h.\n1. Microsurgical Preparation\nInduce anesthesia along with analgesia in a male mouse weighing 20-25 g after a 14 h or overnight fasting with an intraperitoneal injection of a Fentanyl (0.31 mg/kg), Midazolam (6.25 mg/kg) and Acepromazine (6.25 mg/kg) (FMA anesthesia) and place it on a rectal-temperature-controlled homeothermic heating pad which maintains body temperature at 37 °C.\nDisinfect the operation table and the equipment several times using an alcohol-based solution.\nAttach a 27 G needle to a 10 cm long polyethylene tube (PE-20) and attach the tube to a 4-way connector. Insert the needle in the tail vein and fixate it using tissue adhesive gel. This cannula will be used for infusion of microbubbles, insulin, glucose and anesthesia.\n\tNote: Adding Heparin (5 U/mL) in sterile saline during the cannulation process to flush the tail vein (approximately 10 µL) reduces the possibility of clogged cannulas.\nThroughout the surgical procedures and experimental protocols, maintain anesthesia by a continuous intravenous infusion of FMA anesthesia via the tail vein cannula at rate of 33.75 µL/kg/min.\nPlace the mouse with the ventral side up and fix the feet using a thermostable tape to expose the upper thigh area. Use a slight exorotation of the hip joint (hindlimb paws facing up) and a 40-60° angle at the knee joint to standardize the stretch of the muscle at the adductor compartment of the thigh.\nRemove the hair at the groin and upper thigh areas bilaterally using a depilatory cream. Collect all the loose hair with a moist cotton swab.",
    "Place the mouse under a stereomicroscope and perform the following surgical steps using 10X to 16X magnification.\nMake a 2 cm incision using skin scissors running parallel to the inguinal ligament, just lateral to the abdominal curvature (Figure 1). Apply traction on the distal side of the incision distally using a bulldog clamp (Figure 1D). This will help to adjust the window as needed and help hold the paraffin oil (described in 1.12).\nDissect the adipose tissue away from the abdominal wall. To avoid bleeding, gently separate the fat pad from the wall instead of dissecting directly through the pad. Gentle traction at the fat pad in the distal direction will facilitate the process (Figure 1C).\nIdentify the femoral artery and follow it down to the first major branches (the epigastric artery and the gracilis artery) (Figure 2). The gracilis artery is the first major branch of the femoral artery running on the adductor magnus muscle and then runs deep to the gracilis muscle. The gracilis artery will be used for IVM.\nIdentify the transparent deep fascia covering the muscles and the vessels. Using sharp forceps, pull the fascia upwards and cut it using a microscissor.\nCover the exposed muscle with a drop (200 µL) of medicinal liquid paraffin (room temperature, or pre-warmed to 37 °C) to prevent the prepared tissue from drying out. Make sure that the oil drop does not leak away. Adjust the skin folds of the incision using the bulldog clamp to create a small cavity to hold the paraffin oil that bathes the vessels.",
    "Place the mouse under a previously calibrated microscope (16X optical magnification) in such a way that the gracilis artery is vertical on the computer screen. Attach the microscope to a camera and computer based analysis system that can extract the vessels' diameter from the image data set. The diameter is the distance between the two luminal sides of the vessel. Continuous monitoring and measurement of the artery diameter is desirable.\nPlace the light source at a sufficient distance (minimum 20 cm) from the hindlimb to reduce head conduction from the light.\nApply prewarmed ultrasound transduction gel to the upper contralateral hindlimb. Place the ultrasound probe perpendicular to the long axis of the femur bone.\nCarefully adjust the angle and direction of the ultrasound probe to get a cross-sectional view of the adductor muscle group. Take care to keep the position of the ultrasound probe in relation to the mouse stable to keep the same imaging plane for baseline and hyperinsulinemic measurements.\nLet the mouse stabilize for 30 min. The diameter of the gracilis artery should be stable for 10 min before documenting the baseline diameter.\n2. Baseline and Hyperinsulinemic Measurements\nMake sure that the baseline gracilis artery diameter is saved by the computer program used for the IVM.\nPrepare the microbubbles in advance as described35 and count with Coulter counter to a concentration of 2.5 x 109 bubbles/mL just before the experiment.\nAs the microbubbles can only be viewed in the contrast-mode of the ultrasound machine, control the parameters which affect the image and the contrast data collected (described in 2.3.1) and use consistently during acquisition.",
    "Use the following settings on the ultrasound machine: contrast gain at 35 decibels; the time gain compensation to OFF; Line Density to HIGH; Number of Focal Zones to WIDE; Transmit Power to 4%; Transmit Beam width to STANDARD; SV Gate to 4; Sensitivity to 1; Persistence to OFF. Level the location of Focal Zones to the center of the region of interest.\nSave a short (5 s) clip. This will be used to calculate the background signal.\nShake the vial containing the microbubbles by hand to have a uniform suspension. Start infusing the microbubbles using the tail vein cannula at a 5 µL/min rate. Place the infusion tube on a vibrating vortex (200x per min) to maintain a uniform suspension of microbubbles.\nAllow 5 min of continuous infusion of microbubbles so that a steady-state level is reached. Proceed with obtaining the time-intensity curves of the bubbles using the microbubble destruct function (MBD) on the ultrasound machine at 5 min and at 10 min after the start of microbubbles infusion (Figure 3A). Take the average signal of these two measurements to get the baseline perfusion data.\nAfter obtaining the baseline data, start the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp as described34. Use the tail cannula (placed in 1.3) to administer the insulin and glucose (and anesthesia).\nIn short, induce a hyperinsulinemic state by introducing a 200 mU/kg insulin bolus followed by continuous insulin infusion (7.5 mU/kg/min) for 60 min. Use a variable infusion of 20% D-glucose to maintain euglycemia.\nAssess blood glucose from the tail vein every 5 min with a Glucose Monitoring Device, and maintain at 5 mM by adjusting the variable glucose infusion rate. Determine insulin sensitivity by averaging the mean glucose infusion rate during the last 30 min.",
    "Make sure that the diameter of the gracilis artery is documented at the desired time periods (for example at 10, 30 and 60 min) of the start of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with the computer program.\nAfter 25 min and/or 55 min of the insulin clamp, start the second (hyperinsulinemic) CEUS measurement to document the MBV at 30 and/or 60 min, respectively. Follow the same steps described in 2.4 and 2.5. Detach and use the anesthesia port of the 4-way connector to infuse the microbubbles. Reattach the anesthesia tube after the end of the microbubbles infusion.\nAfter completion of IVM and the CEUS measurements 60 min after the start of insulin infusion, withdraw blood from the mouse by a heart puncture procedure for later analysis. This will also euthanize the mouse. Carefully dissect the gracilis and femoral arteries and store them for further desired experiments (for e.g., Western blots, Immunohistochemistry, ex vivo pressure myography experiments36,37,38).\n3. Offline Analysis\nNOTE: The analyses of IVM and CEUS measurements should be performed offline by a blinded investigator. CEUS offers the possibility to distinguish the microcirculation from larger vessels by temporarily destructing the microbubbles by high intensity ultrasound waves using the MBD function. The signal (measured in arbitrary units (a.u)) in larger vessels is restored quicker than those in the microcirculation because of the microbubbles speed in the corresponding vessels.\nUse an offline workstation or the software on the ultrasound machine to do the analyses.\nDraw a region of interests (ROI) to include the microcirculation. Draw a separate ROI to include the larger femoral vessels (Figure 3A).\nDuplicate the microcirculation's and larger vessels' ROIs for the background, baseline and hyperinsulinemic measurements by using the ROI copy function built in the software.",
    "Subtract the intensity signal of the background measurement from the baseline and the hyperinsulinemic measurements.\nDivide the intensity signal of the microcirculation by the intensity signal of the femoral vessels. Baseline and hyperinsulinemic MBVs can now be compared."
