  "procedures": [
    "​When used in a research capacity, the protocol provided below strictly follows guidelines established by the UCLA human research ethics committee.\nNOTE: The methods described here are those used at UCLA for performing targeted biopsy of the prostate using the Artemis system. All patients undergoing fusion biopsy have had mpMRI of the prostate, which has been interpreted by an experienced uro-radiologist who has read over 3,500 prostate MRIs. Lesions visible on mpMRI have been classified as PI-RADS 1-5, with PI-RADS 3-5 lesions selected for targeted biopsy. Prior to the procedure, MRI images are uploaded to software for prostate and target contouring by the radiologist. All patients undergoing targeted biopsy also undergo systematic biopsy, guided by a template generated by the fusion device software. If no discrete targets are seen on MRI, only software-guided systematic biopsy is performed. Patients with suspected or previously-diagnosed prostate cancer are considered eligible for MRI/US fusion biopsy. Patients with bleeding diathesis or inability to tolerate biopsy without sedation are considered ineligible.\n1. Machine Initiation and Biopsy Plan Selection\nPower on the workstation computer and the workstation cart.\nEnter the new patient's information or select a patient if the patient has already been registered within the software system. Import the MRI data that have been uploaded via the device's contouring software.\nSelect biopsy plan type (e.g., MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy, revisit biopsy, or systematic biopsy). Select all three biopsy plan types to allow for biopsy of new targets, resampling of prior locations, and the performance of a systematic sextant biopsy. The fusion system prompts the physician to select either 6 or 12 biopsy locations to be proposed if choosing systematic biopsy (i.e., either 1 or 2 cores from each anatomic sextant).",
    "NOTE: In the UCLA practice, all patients undergoing targeted biopsy also undergo simultaneous systematic biopsy. Twelve systematic biopsy cores rather than six are usually taken for the sake of thoroughness.\n2. Patient Preparation\nPrescribe an enema and direct the patient to use it the morning of biopsy for rectal vault cleaning.\nAdminister antibiotics one hour prior to the start of the procedure. Administer either fluoroquinolones, first, second, or third generation cephalosporins, or aminoglycosides as recommended by the American Board of Urology.\nNOTE: It is critical to review the local antibiogram when selecting the antibiotic to be used. At UCLA, 1 g of Ertapenem is administered intramuscularly one hour prior to the procedure. This decision was made based on the UCLA antibiogram. There have been no post-biopsy septic episodes for the last 1,500 MRI-US fusion biopsies performed.\nPlace the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Place the patient's back nearly parallel to the edge of the bed, with the patient's legs pulled toward the chest to provide maximum range of motion for the biopsy device's tracker arm. Ensure that the patient's buttocks are positioned slightly off the edge of the bed.\nPrepare the patient's anus. Soak a sponge stick in the preferred antiseptic solution and swab the perineum and anus, starting away from the anus and moving toward the anus.\nPerform a digital rectal examination. Insert a gloved and lubricated index finger into the rectum and direct anteriorly to palpate the prostate.\n\tNOTE: If a nodule or induration is palpated, biopsy of the abnormality should be performed.\n3. TRUS Probe Preparation\nAttach the needle guide to TRUS probe.\nApply ultrasound jelly directly to a clean TRUS probe.\nNOTE: At UCLA, all TRUS probes are disinfected via an automated system that uses vaporized hydrogen peroxide solution.",
    "Fit a condom cover onto TRUS probe directly over the ultrasound jelly and secure it in place with a rubber band.\n4. Administer Periprostatic Nerve Block\nGently insert the lubricated end-fire TRUS probe into the patient's rectum. Advance the probe until a two-dimensional (2D) transverse view of the prostate is clearly visible on the monitor and adjust the probe until the approximate center of the prostate is visible.\nObtain an estimated prostate volume by measuring prostate height, width, and length. Calculate prostate specific antigen (PSA) density if desired by dividing PSA value by prostate volume.\nTurn on the on-screen biopsy guide in order to visualize needle trajectory.\nRotate and advance the probe until the junction between the prostate and seminal vesicle is visualized, representing the area where the prostatic neurovascular bundle enters the gland.\nInsert a 22 G spinal needle through the needle guide channel on the TRUS probe. Advance the needle into the junction between prostate and seminal vesicle.\nInfiltrate this space with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine, creating an ultrasonic wheal.\nNOTE: Correct infiltration will cause a separation of the seminal vesicles and prostate from the rectal wall.\nReadjust the TRUS probe to administer the periprostatic nerve block on the contralateral side. Wait 1 min for adequate anesthesia to be achieved.\n5. Dock the Tracking Arm\nAdjust the TRUS probe such that the prostate's greatest diameter is visible in transverse orientation.\nPosition the workstation cart next to the patient in order to visualize the workstation screens while also observing the patient.\nEnsure that the tracking arm is in the \"park\" position. Place the two tracking arms approximately 90° from each other.\nUnlock the tracker arm and position it directly underneath the TRUS probe while holding the TRUS probe in place within the patient's rectum.",
    "Lift the tracker arm to place the TRUS probe into the cradle of the tracking arm and secure the clasp. The TRUS probe is now secure.\nLock the stabilizing arm.\n6. Three-dimensional Image Acquisition\nSlowly rotate the TRUS probe clockwise along its long axis for approximately 200°.\nNOTE: The ultrasound system will acquire 2D images and reconstruct them to create a 3D ultrasound model that is stored within the software platform.\nOutline the prostate by placing 6−8 green digital markers along its border in both the transverse and sagittal images displayed on the workstation screen. A 3D reconstruction of the prostate will then be created by the software and displayed.\nReview the 3D ultrasound model of the prostate to ensure the prostate is visible in all slices.\nRefine the proposed boundaries of the prostate on the 3D ultrasound reconstruction by clicking the correct prostate boundary on the grayscale image. Only perform refinement if there is a discrepancy between the green contour and the true boundary of the prostate.\n7. MRI Registration\nPerform rigid registration in the saggital orientation of the MRI, which will be presented on the display screen. Select two landmarks on the MR image (eg: superior-most point and inferior-most point of the prostate along the rectum wall) and place a digital marker on each. Place two digital markers on corresponding landmarks on the displayed ultrasound image.\nPerform rigid registration in the transverse orientation. Again, select two landmarks on the MRI image (e.g., anterior-most point and posterior-most point of the prostate) and place a digital marker on each. Place two digital markers on corresponding landmarks on the displayed ultrasound image.\n\tNOTE: Elastic registration is automatically performed after selecting the “Next” button on the display screen.\n8. Target Acquisition",
    "NOTE: Contoured targets from the mpMRI as well as digital markers denoting a template for systematic biopsy are now superimposed onto the 3D prostate model created during the acquisition step.\nSelect the first ROI to be biopsied.\nDepress the clutch near the tracker arm handle to release the tracker arm braking system. Gently move the tracker arm toward the desired target. Once the yellow digital marker is in the desired location over the target — now highlighted in red — release the clutch to reengage the brakes on the tracker arm. The tracker arm is now secure in space.\nDisengage the rotation brake by pushing the lever just left of the tracker arm handle forward. Gently rotate the tracker arm to align the yellow digital marker until it is superimposed onto the desired target. Pull the lever to reengage the rotational brakes.\n9. Motion Compensation\nPrior to each biopsy, assess whether the live ultrasound images remain registered within the ultrasound reconstruction. If the border of the prostate on live ultrasound is contained within the series of green digital markers, proceed to section 10. If the green digital markers no longer correctly demarcate the border of the prostate, carry out motion compensation.\n\t\nSelect the motion compensation option on the monitor.\nChoose three landmarks on the 3D prostate reconstruction and place a digital marker on each. Place digital markers on the corresponding landmarks on the live ultrasound view of the prostate in order to bring the 3D model back into registration with the live ultrasound.\n10. Prostate Biopsy and Needle Recording\nPlace the 18 G biopsy gun into the needle guide mounted on the TRUS probe.",
    "While observing the monitor, advance the biopsy needle toward the red bowtie-shaped visual aid that is displayed over the live ultrasound image. Advance the needle tip to intersect the middle of the bowtie-shaped marker.\nDepress the footswitch pedal to begin recording the sequence of 2D ultrasound images for 3D biopsy location recording, which will be used to mark the site of the completed biopsy and can be revisited at a later time for future review.\nFire the biopsy needle by depressing the button on the biopsy gun. Pay careful attention to the streak of the needle on the ultrasound.\nRelease the footswitch to stop needle recording and then remove the biopsy gun from the needle guide.\nHand the biopsy gun to the assistant. Let the assistant open the sheath and deposit the biopsy core into its own labeled specimen cup containing 10% buffered formalin.\n11. Needle Segmentation\nReview the needle trajectory recording and observe the white streak the needle creates when viewed by ultrasound. Compare the streak on the recorded ultrasound frames to the red needle auto-segmentation line that appears as an overlay within the pop-up window. Save the needle auto-segmentation if it is accurate in order to permanently store the location data for this biopsy core.\nIf needle auto-segmentation is inaccurate, correct the trajectory manually.\nUse the toggle arrows to scroll through the needle recording sequence until the needle image frame is found.\nDefine the needle tip and trajectory by marking the points corresponding to beginning and end of the needle streak. Click on the tip of the streak to define the needle tip and click on the bottom of the streak to define the needle trajectory.\nSave this needle segmentation or readjust once again.",
    "NOTE: Saving will permanently store the location data for this biopsy core and overlay it onto the 3D model.\n12. Remaining Tissue Extraction\nRepeat sections 8−11 until tissue is extracted from all desired locations.\nDetermine the number of cores to obtain from each mpMRI-recognized ROI. In order to ensure that each ROI is well-sampled, consider obtaining cores at set intervals (e.g., every 3 mm), or from both the center and the periphery.\n13. Conclude the Biopsy Session\nUnlock the stabilizer arm. Gently remove the TRUS probe from the patient's rectum. Apply pressure with gauze pads for 5 min in order to facilitate hemostasis."
