    "1. Animal Perfusion and Cerebellum Dissection\nDepending on the protein, perfusion may be essential for successful staining1,2. Transcardiac perfusion is an invasive, non-survival procedure that requires the proper use of anesthetics. Correct training, institutional approval, and IACUC approval are all necessary before attempting the procedure. It is always a good idea to consult the institution's veterinarians to get help in identifying experimental requirements and acquiring the correct training. Before the procedure, the animal should be deeply anesthetized and not responsive to stimuli such as foot or tail pinch. Using scissors make a cut in the abdominal skin and muscle wall and then continue to open the rib cage by cutting just adjacent to the sternum on each side. In addition, the experimenter can create a larger internal working space by cutting the fascia surrounding the diaphragm. By lifting the abdominal and thoracic wall superiorly, the heart will now be exposed. Make a small cut in the right atrium to allow blood to flow out and immediately insert the perfusion needle into the left ventricle. A basic hydrostatic pump is preferred to deliver the perfusion solutions (see Table 1 for details). First, flush the blood out with 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, see Table 3) until the fluid runs clear. Then, turn off the hydrostatic pump, quickly switch the solution delivery tube to a container of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, see Table 3) diluted in PBS and then turn the pump back on to deliver the fixative. The use of a pump is not necessary: with practice, two syringes filled with the PBS and 4% PFA can be used to slowly deliver the solutions.",
    "It is critical to carefully dissect the brain out of the skull without introducing any lesions to the tissue. Even small lacerations to the brain during dissection will gradually expand into visible crevices that trap antibodies and cause artifactual staining during the processing of the tissue (e.g. red asterisks in Fig 2). For cerebellar dissections, it is typical to cut the skin down the middle of the head and then gently tease the flaps apart to expose the skull. Cut the skull from anterior to posterior along the dorsal midline, and also laterally along both sides of the skull. Do not cut beyond the bregma as this runs the risk of nicking the cerebellum. Using forceps gently lift the front of the skull away from the brain being careful not to tear away brain tissue that is attached to the meninges. Sever the cranial nerves on the ventral side of the brain.",
    "Separation of the cerebellum from the rest of the brain is important for two reasons. First, it allows for exploration of expression patterns in the anterior lobules, which are hidden from view by the colliculi in situ. The second is that separating the tissue into smaller, isolated regions allows for more complete fixation, which can facilitate the staining of some proteins. Throughout this final dissection step, care should be taken to not touch the cerebellum with the tips of the forceps. Insert the tips of a pair of forceps into the middle of the superior and inferior colliculi. With a second set of forceps slowly tease away the inferior colliculi from the cerebellum. Then, lay the cerebellum so that its anterior side is facing down and the brainstem is pointing upwards. Insert the forceps into the fourth ventricle between the brainstem and lobules IX/X of the cerebellum. Cut the peduncles by pinching with the forceps on both sides and then gently lift the cerebellum away from the brainstem. Once the cerebellum is isolated, post-fix it by immersion in 4% PFA at 4 °C for a minimum of 24-48 hours. The cerebellum can be stored in 4% PFA for an extended period of time. The meninges should be removed either before or after staining for better visibility of the expression patterns. If the experimenter chooses to remove the meninges before staining there is a strong possibility that the cerebellum will be nicked during the process. Peeling away the meninges at the end of the staining procedure is much simpler because they become easier to locate after they acquire weak background staining and become frail post-processing.\n2. Processing the Tissue for Wholemount Staining",
    "Because the wholemount staining approach takes longer than immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections, it is helpful to plan the timeline for each of the experiments as shown in the example calendar provided (Table 2). Before starting, there are several key things to keep in mind. 1) The microtubes containing the tissue should be rotated on a nutator at all times, except during the freeze/thaw process. 2) Several solutions must be made fresh for each experiment (See Table 3 for solution recipes). 3) Throughout the protocol, when changing solutions, gently pour out the spent solution rather than removing the cerebellum with forceps, to avoid touching the cerebellum. Then, after mixing the new solution in another container, use a pipette to gently add the fresh solution to the tube.\n2.1 Day 1:\nFix the cerebellum in Dent's fix3 at room temperature for 6-8 hours rocking gently on the nutator. If methanol is destructive to your antigen, consider replacing steps 2.1a through 2.3a with an antigen retrieval method. The heat and buffers used for antigen retrieval will help prepare the tissue for antibody penetration.\nBleach the cerebellum in Dent's Bleach3 overnight at 4 °C.\n2.2 Day 2:\nDehydrate the cerebellum in two rounds of 100% MeOH at room temperature for 30 min each.\nThen, to enhance the penetration of the solutions, subject the tissue to a series of freeze/thaw cycles. Carefully place the tube in a container with dry ice and freeze for 30 min. Then, remove the tube and leave it at room temperature on the bench for 15 minute. The freeze/thaw step should be performed four times (at least).\nAfter the last thawing of the tissue, place the tube into a -80 °C freezer overnight.",
    "The tissue can be stored for prolonged periods of time at -80 °C either immediately before or after the freeze/thaw steps. Otherwise, the protocol should be continued.\n2.3 Day 3:\nRehydrate the cerebellum by washing it in 50% MeOH/50% PBS, 15% MeOH/85% PBS, and 100% PBS for 60-90 minutes each at room temperature.\nNext, for adult mouse cerebella, subject the tissue to enzymatic digestion with 10μg/ml Proteinase K in PBS for 2-3 minutes. No digestion step is necessary for cerebella of young animals (P5 or younger in mouse). Longer digestion is suggested for larger brains. For instance, digestion could be as high as 5-6 minutes for primate brains4.\nAfter digestion, immediately wash the cerebellum in PBS three times for 10 minutes each at room temperature to remove the Proteinase K.\nBlock the tissue in PMT (see Table 3) overnight at 4 °C. Milk powder is often the first choice when selecting a blocking agent for protein work because it is inexpensive, effectively lowers background staining, and typically does not interfere with antibody binding or access to the antigen. Animal serums can also be used, although the experimenter should be aware of the added cost and must first test the serum quality for cross-reactive immunoglobulins and ability to produce an optimal signal to noise ratio.\n2.4 Day 4-5:\nIncubate the tissue in primary antibodies diluted in PMT supplemented with 5% DMSO for 48 hours at 4 °C (larger cerebella will require increased incubation times).\n2.5 Day 6:\nWash the cerebellum 2-3 times for 2-3 hours each in PMT at 4 °C to remove unbound primary antibodies.\nThen, incubate the tissue in secondary antibodies in a solution containing PMT with 5% DMSO at 4 °C overnight (larger cerebella may require increased incubation times).\n2.6 Day 7:",
    "Wash the cerebellum 2-3 times for 2-3 hours each in PMT at 4 °C.\nGive the tissue a final wash with PBT (see Table 3) for 1-2 hours. This step removes excess milk and enhances the clarity of the staining.\nFinally, incubate the tissue in DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) solution until the optimal staining intensity is reached. The brown reaction product should be clearly visible within ~10 minutes. It is best to use DAB in the dark as light causes the chromogen to precipitate, which can increase background staining.\n2.7\nWhen the optimal staining intensity is reached, stop the reaction by placing the cerebellum in PBS with 0.04% sodium azide. The tissue may be stored long-term in this solution. Sodium azide is a potent inhibitor of bacterial growth but should be avoided until this step as it also inhibits horseradish peroxidase.\n2.8 Optional amplification procedure:\nfollow normal protocol but these steps should be performed in place of steps 2.5b-2.7 above.\nIncubate the tissue overnight at 4 °C in biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBST (see Table 3) with 5% DMSO.\nRinse the tissue for 2-3 hours each in 3-4 changes of PBST at room temperature.\nIncubate the cerebellum overnight at 4 °C in ABC complex solution in PBST.\nRinse the tissue for 2-3 hours each at room temperature in 3-4 changes of PBS.\nIncubate the tissue in freshly-prepared DAB solution, as described above.\nWhen the staining is optimal, stop the reaction by washing the cerebellum in PBS with 0.04% sodium azide.\n3. Imaging the Stained Tissue",
    "Wholemount images can be captured by using, for instance, a Leica DFC3000 FX camera mounted on a Leica MZ16 FA stereomicroscope running Leica Application Suite FX software. If desired, deconvolution microscopy can be used to acquire multiple consecutive images in different focal planes, with each image having only a single lobule in crisp focus. Then, the images can be compressed into a single stack and software rendered to remove distortion. The final composite image will illustrate cerebellar surface expression patterns with all visible patterning in clear focus.\nWholemount stained tissue should be imaged while immersed in PBS (or another medium that will give an optimal refractive index). In order to easily position the wholemount for imaging, make a 1% agar gel in a plastic Petri dish. Cut small holes into the gel. The holes will allow the cerebellum to be wedged into the desired orientation.\nRaw data are imported into Adobe Photoshop CS4 and adjusted for contrast and brightness levels.\nAnimals\nAll animal studies were carried out under an approved IACUC animal protocol according to the institutional guidelines at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Male and female outbred Swiss Webster (Taconic, Albany, NY) mice were maintained in our colony and used for all studies. Euthanized adult rats were kindly provided by Dr. Bryen Jordan (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). All animals were at least one month old.\n4. Representative Results",
    "The cerebellum is compartmentalized by molecular expression into four transverse zones: the anterior zone (AZ: ~lobules I-V), the central zone (CZ: ~lobules VI-VII), the posterior zone (PZ: ~lobules VIII-dorsal IX) and the nodular zone (NZ: ~lobules IX ventral and X)5. Each zone contains a unique array of parasagittal stripes1,2,5,6 (Fig. 1). ZebrinII expression in Purkinje cells reveals stripes in the AZ and PZ (Fig. 2) and uniform expression in the CZ and NZ (Fig. 2). The parasagittal organization of Purkinje cells is mirrored by the terminal field topography of afferent fibers. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide is expressed in subsets of climbing fibers (Fig. 3a) that project to stripes of Purkinje cell dendrites in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex7 (Fig. 3b). With the appropriate modifications, such as amplification7, the wholemount protocol allows for the visualization of olivocerebellar patterns without the need for a laborious, time consuming reconstructions from staining tissue sections (Fig. 3b).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4042/4042fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
