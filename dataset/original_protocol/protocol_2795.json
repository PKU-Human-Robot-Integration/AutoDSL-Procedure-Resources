    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPurification of DNA oligonucleotides using denaturing PAGE and ethanol precipitation\nTiming: 3 days\nOligonucleotides are heat denatured in the presence of formamide and then resolved through a preparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel (steps 1–3). After electrophoresis, the full-length product is identified by staining (step 4), eluted from the gel by diffusion (steps 4–5), and concentrated by ethanol precipitation (steps 6–8). The purpose of this step is to obtain highly pure full-length oligonucleotides that are free of contaminating shorter oligonucleotide species. This is critical to obtain high-quality and reproducible results.\nDenaturing polyacrylamide gels can resolve oligonucleotides from 2 to 300 bases, depending on the percentage of polyacrylamide used (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). In this section, we describe how to purify synthetic oligonucleotides using 15% denaturing PAGE and ethanol precipitation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2493_16.csv\naAdapted from Green and Sambrook.26[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]\nbThe numbers provided are the approximate sizes (in base pairs) of double-stranded DNA with which the dye co-migrates.\nPrepare the 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.\nAssemble the equipment that you will need for casting the gel, including the glass plates (16 × 20 cm gel size), 1.5 mm spacers, and a 5-well comb, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nCritical: This protocol involves loading large amounts of DNA into each well of the polyacrylamide gel. To prevent cross-sample contamination, it is important to leave 1 empty well between consecutive samples. We recommend using a 5-well comb and loading 50 nmol to 2 μmol of DNA per lane. The total sample volume should be ≤ 350 μL of sample per lane (maximum volume per lane ≈ 400 μL).\nPrepare the 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel solution, as described above.",
    "Note: Once the polyacrylamide gel solution has cooled to room temperature, it can be removed from the fume hood and the gel can be cast at room temperature.\nImmediately after adding the 10% APS and TEMED to the gel solution, swirl gently to mix and then use a 25 mL serological pipette to transfer the 15% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gel solution into the glass plates. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nAllow the gel to polymerize at room temperature for at least 1 h.\nOnce the gel has polymerized, assemble the electrophoresis unit according to the manufacturer’s instructions and fill with 1× TBE buffer.\nCarefully remove the comb. Flush the wells with 1× TBE buffer using a 30 mL plastic syringe and 21-gauge needle to remove unpolymerized gel solution and settled urea.\nPre-run the gel at 15 W for 90 min at room temperature in 1× TBE buffer.\nPrepare oligonucleotides for denaturing PAGE.\nIf working with lyophilized oligonucleotides, resuspend in 2× or 1× denaturing loading dye to a final concentration of 50 mM. Vortex to mix.\nIf the oligonucleotides are already in solution, mix the volume needed for 1–2 μmol DNA with an equal volume of 2× denaturing loading dye. Vortex to mix.\nNote: We recommend loading a maximum of 2 μmol DNA per lane when using the 5-well comb (see step 1a above).\nHeat the samples for 5 min at 95°C.\nCritical: The purpose of heating the oligonucleotides in denaturing loading dye is to remove DNA secondary structures. As such, samples should be loaded quickly after heating to prevent the reformation of DNA secondary structures.\nPerform electrophoresis.\nBefore loading the samples, flush the gel wells with 1× TBE buffer using a 30 mL plastic syringe and 21-gauge needle to remove the settled urea.\nCarefully load the samples.",
    "When purifying fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides, cover the electrophoresis tank with aluminum foil to prevent quenching (photobleaching) the fluorophore.\nElectrophoresis is performed at room temperature for approximately 2.5 h at 15 W, or until desired separation is achieved (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: In a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, bromophenol blue migrates around 15 nt and xylene cyanol FF migrates around 60 nt (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). If the oligonucleotide migrates at the same position as the dyes, the loading buffer can be prepared with a different tracking dye or without the tracking dyes. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nDNA staining and elution by diffusion.\nAfter electrophoresis, carefully transfer the gel to a glass tray. Submerge the gel in Stains-All Solution and mix with gentle rocking or agitation for 10 min at room temperature.\nDestain the gel by submerging in nuclease-free ddH2O and mixing with gentle rocking or agitation for 15 min at room temperature (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2493-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Purification of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides by preparative denaturing PAGE\nRepresentative results showing the separation of 100 nmol oligonucleotide 1 (60 nt) by 15% denaturing PAGE. Electrophoresis was performed for 2.5 h at 15 W, after which time DNA was detected by immersion in Stains-All staining solution. The predominant band represents the full-length oligonucleotide, of which the upper half was excised (indicated by the dashed lines) and eluted from the gel by diffusion. See step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]: purification of DNA oligonucleotides using denaturing PAGE and ethanol precipitation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] (steps 1–4) for further details.\nNote: You should observe one predominant product, representing the full-length oligonucleotide, and a series of shorter oligonucleotides that co-migrate as a smear of lower molecular weight products (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Using a clean scalpel for each product, excise the upper half of the most intense band to avoid shortened DNA products. Transfer the gel slice to a 15 mL conical tube.\nElute each oligonucleotide in at least 500 μL TE buffer, depending on the size of the gel piece. There should be enough TE buffer to completely submerge the gel, with a visible layer of solution (≥ 200 μL) on top. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nTo facilitate diffusion, crush the gel into small pieces using the end of a plastic inoculating loop or spreader. To do so, press the gel fragments against the sides of the tube several times.\nIncubate the conical tubes at room temperature (25°C) overnight (12–16 h), either on a spinning wheel or with end-over-end rotation.\nCritical: It is important to minimize the exposure of fluorescently labeled DNA to light. Users should cover the glass tray and all conical or microfuge tubes in aluminum foil.\nAlternatives: After the oligonucleotide of interest is excised from the gel, the DNA can also be eluted by electroelution, as described by Lopez-Gomollon and Nicolas.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]\nSeparate the eluted DNA from the polyacrylamide gel fragments by centrifugation.\nOn the following day, centrifuge the conical tubes containing the gel/DNA solution at 3,220 × g for 2 min (4°C).\nCarefully pipette the supernatant, such that no gel pieces are transferred, into another 15 mL conical tube that can withstand high centrifugal force (≥ 18,000 × g). See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nWash the crushed gel with 0.5–1 mL of TE buffer and mix by gentle inversion.\nCentrifuge the conical tubes containing the crushed gel solution at 3,220 × g for 2 min (4°C).\nCarefully transfer the supernatant into the 15 mL conical tube containing the eluted DNA solution (step 5.a.i). Mix by gentle inversion.",
    "Discard the conical tube containing the crushed gel as hazardous chemical waste.\nProceed to the next step with the eluted DNA.\nPerform ethanol precipitation.\nTo the eluted DNA solution, add 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 to a final concentration of 0.3 M (i.e., 1/10th of the total supernatant volume). Mix by gentle inversion.\nAdd 3 volumes of ice-cold absolute ethanol and mix by gentle inversion.\nIncubate the tubes upright at −20°C overnight (12–16 h), protected from light.\nPause point: The DNA/ethanol solution can be stored at −20°C for several days.\nThe next day, retrieve the conical tubes from the −20°C freezer and spin down at 18,000 × g for 1 h (4°C).\nNote: Take note of the orientation of the tubes in the rotor and the approximate location of the DNA pellet after centrifugation. Users may find it useful to draw a circle around the DNA pellet.\nCarefully pour off the supernatant, taking care not to dislodge the pellet.\nGently wash the pellet with 3–5 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol (made from absolute ethanol) taking care to not dislodge the pellet.\nCentrifuge at 18,000 × g for 30 min (4°C).\nCarefully pour off the supernatant, taking care not to dislodge the pellet.\nInvert the tube on a Kimwipe for 5–10 min to drain off the ethanol and then turn the tube upright to air dry the pellet for 10 min (room temperature).\nUse a wide-bore pipette tip to resuspend the pellet in 200–500 μL of TE buffer. Do not pipette up and down more than 2 times. Instead, resuspend by tapping or gentle agitation. See troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nAlternatives: If wide-bore pipette tips are not available, users can cut the tip off of a 1 mL pipette tip.\nTransfer the purified oligonucleotide solution into an appropriate microfuge tube.",
    "Note: Unlabeled oligonucleotides can be stored in regular 1.5 mL microfuge tubes, whereas fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides should be stored in amber or black 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nDetermine oligonucleotide concentration using spectrophotometry (A260).\nNote: The final yield will vary depending on the length of the oligonucleotide, but users can generally expect to recover 20%–70% of the starting material.\nStore purified oligonucleotides at −20°C.\nAnnealing and purification of fluorescently labeled DNA substrates\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, we describe how to anneal PAGE-purified oligonucleotides to form the DNA substrate. The unlabeled oligonucleotides are added in excess of the fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide. As such, the fluorescently labeled DNA substrate must be purified from the excess unlabeled oligonucleotides. This is accomplished using anion exchange chromatography. The final yields range from 30% to 50%, depending on the DNA substrate.\nAnneal PAGE-purified oligonucleotides.\nPipette 2.5 nmol of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide and 3.75 nmol of each unlabeled oligonucleotide into a black 1.5 mL microfuge tube (i.e., 1:1.5 mol ratio of fluorescently labeled to unlabeled oligonucleotides).\nAdd 50 μL of 10× DNA hybridization buffer and bring the volume up to 500 μL using DNase-free H2O. Mix well.\nFill a glass beaker with H2O and place on a heat plate set to 100°C. Bring to 95°C (with gentle stirring).\nPlace the annealing reactions in a Styrofoam microfuge tube holder and immerse in boiling water for 2 min.\nAfter 2 min, turn off the heat source.\nLeave the microfuge tubes in the beaker and allow to slowly cool to room temperature overnight (12–16 h). See troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nCritical: Steps 10 and 11 are performed at 4°C. All solutions must be filtered through a 0.2 μm PES membrane prior to use to prevent particulates from entering the FPLC.\nPurify the annealed DNA substrate using anion exchange chromatography.",
    "Connect a 1 mL HiTRAP Q HP column to an FPLC system, such as the ӒKTA™ Pure, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nEquilibrate the column with 5 column volumes (CV) of ddH2O, followed by 5 CV of DNA elution buffer (i.e., buffer B), and 5 CV of DNA binding buffer (i.e., buffer A) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nAttach a 500 μL sample loop to the injection valve.\nWash the sample loop with 2.5 mL (5 loop volumes) of ddH2O, followed by 2.5 mL of DNA storage buffer, flow rate = 1 mL/min.\nNote: Our protocol describes a 500 μL annealing reaction, which is loaded into a 500 μL sample loop (i.e., filled-loop mode). Users can adjust the volume of the sample loop according to the volume of the annealing reaction.\nProgram the sample run using the following parameters:\nEmpty the sample loop with 1 mL of DNA binding buffer, flow rate = 1 mL/min. Collect the flow-through from an FPLC outlet line.\nWash the column with 10 CV of DNA binding buffer, flow rate = 1 mL/min.\nElute the DNA in 500 μL fractions with a 20 CV linear gradient from 100% DNA binding buffer (i.e., buffer A) to 100% DNA elution buffer (i.e., buffer B), flow rate = 1 mL/min.\nExtend the elution with a 5 CV step at 100% DNA elution buffer (i.e., buffer B), flow rate = 1 mL/min. Continue to collect 500 μL fractions during this step.\nIf the FPLC is equipped with a variable wavelength UV detector, set the detector to monitor at 260 nm and the excitation wavelength of your fluorophore (e.g., 498 nm for FAM).",
    "Using a plastic syringe, slowly inject the annealing reaction into the sample loop, ensuring that no air is injected into the FPLC. Do not remove the syringe from the FPLC.\nStart the sample run.\nIdentify the peak fractions by absorbance at 260 nm and the excitation wavelength of your fluorophore or native PAGE analysis (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C).

The total volume should be approx. 1.5 mL.\nBuffer exchange into DNA storage buffer.",
    "Attach a 5 mL HiTRAP Desalting column to an FPLC system, such as the ӒKTA™ Pure, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nEquilibrate the column with 5 CV of ddH2O, followed by 5 CV of DNA storage buffer, flow rate = 5 mL/min.\nAttach a sample loop to the injection valve. The loop volume should be selected according to the sample volume.\nWash the sample loop with 5 loop volumes of ddH2O, followed by 5 loop volumes of DNA storage buffer, flow rate = 5 mL/min.\nNote: The HiTRAP Desalting column is packed with Sephadex G-25 Superfine resin (fractionation range approx. 800 to 5,000 Da), which provides for fast separation of high- and low-molecular weight species. The recommended sample volume for the 5 mL HiTRAP Desalting column is 0.1–1.5 mL per run. We recommend using a 1 mL sample loop and injecting the DNA sample (step 10.g) in 1 mL increments (i.e., filled-loop mode). However, users can adjust the size of sample loop according to the sample volume.\nProgram the sample run using the following parameters:\nAfter sample injection, empty the sample loop with 1 mL of DNA storage buffer, flow rate = 5 mL/min. Collect the flow through in 500 μL fractions.\nElute the DNA in 500 μL fractions with 1 CV of DNA storage buffer, flow rate = 5 mL/min.\nRe-equilibrate the column with 2 CV of DNA storage buffer, flow rate = 5 mL/min. This step is needed to reduce the salt concentration before the next sample injection.\nIf the FPLC is equipped with a variable wavelength UV detector, set the detector to monitor at 260 nm and the excitation wavelength of your fluorophore.",

For nuclease activity assays, we concentrate the solution to approximately 1 μM.\nTransfer the concentrated DNA substrate into an appropriate microfuge tube.\nNote: Unlabeled DNA can be stored in regular 1.5 mL microfuge tubes, whereas fluorescently labeled DNA should be stored in amber or black 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nDetermine the DNA concentration by spectrophotometry (A260).\nStore the purified DNA substrates at −20°C. Users may choose to aliquot the substrate to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles, depending on the final volume and concentration.",
    "Note: The extinction coefficient of the DNA substrate is the sum of the extinction coefficients of the component oligonucleotides. Extinction coefficients can be determined using one of several freely available online tools, including OligoAnalyzer™[href=https://www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/oligoanalyzer] (Integrated DNA Technologies) or OligoCalc[href=http://biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu/OligoCalc.html] (Northwestern University).25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]"
