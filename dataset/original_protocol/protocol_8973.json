  "procedures": [
    "All experiments were completed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Université de Sherbrooke and with the Canadian Council on Animal Care. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Research Ethics Review Board (protocol #011-09).\n1. Brain Anatomy with MRI\nLet rats acclimatize in the animal facility for a minimum of 7 days prior to the protocol. Perform brain MRI scans 1-2 weeks prior to the dual tracer PET protocol to allow full recovery from the anesthesia.\nAnesthetize the rat in an induction chamber. Use 2% isoflurane and 1.5 L/min oxygen throughout the protocol for anesthesia. Pinch the hind leg to ensure the animal is fully anesthetized. CAUTION: inhalation of isoflurane can cause headache, dizziness, or unconsciousness in some cases; it should always be used in the presence of an air exchange system in a suitably ventilated room.\nPosition the rat on the MRI examination table in the head-first prone position with a nose cone for isoflurane. Position the respiration and rectal probes. Monitor the respiration rate during the experiment and maintain body temperature at 37 °C with an automated air warming system.\nAcquire T2-weighted MR images using a fast spin-echo pulse sequence with acquisition parameters as detailed previously11. Place the rat on a heated mat during recovery from anesthesia.\n2. Dual Tracer PET Acquisitions\nUse a small-animal PET scanner equipped with avalanche photodiode detectors, an axial field of view of ~7.5 cm and an isotropic spatial resolution of 1.2 mm17. Due to its short physical half-life, prepare 11C by proton bombardment of natural nitrogen (through the 14N(ρ,α)11C nuclear reaction) in a cyclotron on-site before each experiment.\nFast the rat for 18 hr prior to PET scanning. Fasting allows higher brain uptake of 11C-AcAc and 18F-FDG, thereby improving signal-to-noise ratio.",
    "Anesthetize the rat in an induction chamber. Transfer the rat onto a heating mat with a nose cone for isoflurane. Start 11C-AcAc synthesis at this time. The synthesis takes 18 min from the end of bombardment, as previously described1.\nPosition the rat on its side. Prepare a PE50 polyethylene catheter filled with heparinized 0.9% sodium chloride solution (saline). Install the catheter in the tail vein for tracer injection. Install a second catheter in the mid-ventral tail artery for blood sampling throughout the acquisitions.\nRapidly transfer the rat to the scanner table in the head-first prone position with a nose cone for isoflurane. Position the respiration and rectal probes. Monitor the respiration rate during the experiment and maintain body temperature at 37 °C with an automated warming air system. Move the scanner table forward into the scanner to ensure the appropriate imaging of the brain and the heart simultaneously. As an anatomical landmark, position the edge of the field of view on the rat's eyes (with the help of laser lines).\nUsing a concentrated 11C-AcAc solution (~1 GBq/ml), prepare a syringe of ~50 MBq of radioactivity (a range of 45-55 MBq is acceptable). Adjust the volume to 300 μl with saline. CAUTION: Radioactivity can be harmful for the health. It should always be handled behind a lead shield. The experimenter should be wearing a body and ring dosimeter. A Geiger counter should also be on during the experiment.\nInstall the syringe on an injection pump. Start the bolus injection of 11C-AcAc at a rate of 1 ml/min (injection duration: ~19 sec). On a second pump, immediately after terminating the 11C-AcAc injection, start the injection of 300 μl of saline at a rate of 1 ml/min, which is important for an optimal injection of tracer into the blood circulation.",
    "Start a dynamic PET data acquisition 30 sec before starting the bolus injection for a total duration of 20.5 min. The 30 sec data acquisition before the tracer injection provides a measure of the ambient background to be subsequently subtracted from the PET data. Set the regular sampling mode and the energy window at 250-650 keV.\nCollect two 200 μl blood samples at ~15 and 18 min after starting the 11C-AcAc injection. Inject heparinized saline in the catheter after each sampling to avoid blood clotting. Take note of the time at the beginning and the end of blood sampling and use the mean time. Centrifuge at 6,000 RPM for 5 min and collect plasma. Measure radioactivity counts in plasma using a gamma counter calibrated with the PET scanner.\nAfter the 11C-AcAc scan, allow a waiting period of 20 min to ensure that most of radioactivity has decayed. The period can vary from 15-30 min. Do not move the scanner bed and leave the rat under isoflurane throughout this period.\nDuring this time, using a concentrated 18F-FDG solution (~5.5 GBq/μl), prepare a syringe of ~50 MBq. Proceed exactly as mentioned in steps 2.6 and 2.7. Start a dynamic acquisition of a total duration of 40.5 min, including the 30 sec before the injection. Collect two 200 μl blood samples at ~30 and 35 min after starting the 18F-FDG injection.\nAt the end of the 18F-FDG acquisition, take one final 200 μl blood sample. Centrifuge and collect plasma. Keep plasma samples at -80 °C for glucose and AcAc analysis.\nFinally, place the rat on a heating mat during the waking period. Keep the animal for a longitudinal follow-up, or alternatively, euthanize the rat for brain sampling and further biochemical studies.",
    "Reconstruct the PET images according to the following time frame sequences: 1 × 30 sec; 12 × 5 sec; 8 × 30 sec; and n × 300 sec, where n = 3 for 11C-AcAc acquisition and n = 7 for 18F-FDG acquisition.\n3. Plasma Glucose and AcAc Analysis\nMeasure plasma glucose and AcAc with a clinical chemistry analyzer. Perform assays within 48 hr of the blood sampling to minimize AcAc decarboxylation into acetone. Measure glucose concentration with DF40 kit as previously described18 and AcAc with an open channel2. This type of analyzer is more accurate than strips (0.1 μM) and has a broad detection window.\n4. Quantitative PET Analysis\nUse PMOD software or an equivalent system for small-animal PET image analysis.\nPlasma time-activity curve (TAC)\n\t\nLoad 18F-FDG data. Sum image frames of the first 60 sec following injection (when tracer is mainly in blood).\nUsing a manual drawing tool, draw a volume of interest (VOI) on the left ventricular cavity blood pool (a large pool centered in the bottom part of images). Draw the VOI  ~1 mm inside of the edge of the blood pool (red voxels) to ensure no inclusion of tissue and avoid tissue radioactivity spill into the blood pool (Figure 1A). Copy the VOI to the entire dynamic image series and generate a curve of radioactivity as a function of time (TAC).\nIn a spreadsheet, use radioactivity counts of the two plasma samples taken during the acquisition to correct plasma TAC (Figure 1B). Use the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50761/50761eq1.jpg\n\t\tSome smoothing of the plasma TAC can be performed.\nVerify if residual radioactivity from 11C-AcAc is present in the first 30 sec of 18F-FDG scan, prior to injection. If so, subtract the following factor from all the subsequent time frames of the TAC:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50761/50761eq2.jpg,",
    "where R is the residual radioactivity, t1/2 is the half-life of 11C (20.4 min) and T is the time frame2,13. Residual radioactivity from 11C-AcAc after a waiting period of 20 min can be up to 1.5% of maximal 18F-FDG counts.\n18F-FDG/MRI coregistration\n\t\nApply coregistration obtained with 18F-FDG images to the11C-AcAc images. This is necessary because 11C-AcAc images have a low signal-to-noise ratio and automatic coregistration is difficult.\nLoad the corresponding MRI data. Load all 28 18F-FDG time frames in the same orientation as the MR images (on three axes).\nCompute the 18F-FDG summed image of the 28 time frames. This generates an image with higher counts, so it is easier to work with for coregistration with MRI than individual image frames.\nPerform the automatic coregistration of the 18F-FDG summed image on MR images (Figure 2). Apply the transformation to all individual 18F-FDG image frames. Save the transformation which will later be applied to 11C-AcAc images.\nVolumes of interest (VOIs)\n\t\nUsing segmentation software such as PMOD, select MRI data and choose preferred plane for manual drawing. Choose the manual or the semi-automatic drawing tool, depending on brain region size and image contrast. Locate brain structures according to a standard rat brain atlas19.\nDraw the VOIs. As shown in Figure 3, segment the whole brain, cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum, but other regions could be chosen. Save the VOIs, which will be applied to the coregistered 18F-FDG and 11C-AcAc images.\nApply VOIs to 18F-FDG coregistered images. Select the VOI statistics to visualize brain TAC. If needed, correct TAC by subtracting the decay-corrected mean radioactivity in the first 30 sec from all the subsequent time frames.\nCerebral metabolic rate calculation\n\t\nLoad brain and the corresponding plasma TACs.",
    "Select Patlak plot kinetic model20,21. Set the lumped constant to 0.4822 and the corresponding plasma glucose concentration (Figure 4B). Set the maximal relative deviation from the Patlak plot to 5%. Fit the data to the model.\n11C-AcAc images\n\t\nCompute the 18F-FDG summed image of the 24 first time frames to have the same number of frames as the 11C-AcAc scan. Otherwise, 11C-AcAc/MRI coregistration fails. Perform the automatic coregistration of 18F-FDG on MRI. Save the transformation process which will be used for 11C-AcAc image coregistration.\nRepeat steps 4.2 and 4.3 for 11C-AcAc images. Use 18F-FDG transformation in step 4.6.1 and apply it to all individual 11C-AcAc image frames. Repeat steps 4.4 and 4.5 and use 18F-FDG saved VOIs. Set the lumped constant to 1.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
