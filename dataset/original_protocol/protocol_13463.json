    "These studies were approved by the George Washington University Institutional Review Board (IRB # NCR203147). The study subject for all procedures described below (and pictured in figures) was a 32-year-old male who gave full informed consent to the study and publication of de-identified images. Inclusion criteria include any patient undergoing airway management or anesthetic care (especially those who have characteristics of a difficult airway) and exclusion criteria would include any patient who does not consent to this procedure.\n1. Differentiating esophageal from endotracheal intubation\nPrior to the induction of general anesthesia, prepare a high frequency, linear ultrasound probe (see Table of Materials) by placing a single layer of ultrasound gel (see Table of Materials) to the probe transducer. Select the linear probe from the transducer menu on the touchscreen and specify MSK (musculoskeletal) from the dropdown menu. Place the ultrasound in scanning mode by pushing the 2D button on the bottom left corner of the touchscreen. Induce general anesthesia as recommended by the attending anesthesiologist.\nFollowing the induction of general anesthesia,place the probe in the transverse position on the midline of the patient's anterior neck just cephalad to the suprasternal notch (Figure 1A). Ensure the probe marker is on the left of the screen on the ultrasound instrument (see Table of Materials).\nIdentify the trachea midline and note the constricted esophagus just lateral to the trachea (Figure 1B). For further anatomic confirmation, scan laterally to identify the carotid artery and internal jugular vein if necessary.\nCheck for obvious tracheal and surrounding tissue movement associated with intubation as the endotracheal tube moves into the trachea. In the event that tracheal movement is not observed, slightly twist the endotracheal tube to attempt to generate movement on the ultrasound image.",
    "Additionally, check that the hyperechoic, posterior aspect of the trachea disappears due to the endotracheal tube, leaving a characteristic acoustic shadowing that is bullet shaped (this is called the \"bullet sign\", shown in Figure 2). If, instead, there is an esophageal intubation, there will be obvious tissue movement to the left of the trachea, and there will now be two lumens. This is called \"double track sign,\" and there will be two air/mucosal interfaces (Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: Use this ultrasound technique in real-time intubations to obtain immediate feedback as to whether the tube is being placed in the trachea or the esophagus. In addition, consider using this technique during emergency airway management, where end tidal carbon dioxide confirmation may not be reliable due to poor pulmonary blood flow17.\n2. Identifying the cricothyroid membrane in preparation for a cricothyrotomy\nNOTE: For emergency airway management, a cricothyrotomy might be a necessary step if the provider encounters a \"cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate\" scenario. In the event a difficult airway situation is suspected, the provider may opt to identify the CTM prior to the induction of anesthesia, in case it might be required to perform a cricothyrotomy.\nPerform CTM identification with the patient lying in the supine position and the neck extended. Prepare the ultrasound probe as described in step 1.1. As the CTM is shallow in the neck, place the probe to a depth of approximately 1.5-2 cm based on an average-sized patient.\n\tNOTE: There are two methods for utilizing ultrasound to locate the CTM.\nPerform the first method to locate the CTM as described below.",
    "Place a linear, high frequency probe in the sagittal plane of the patient's neck just caudal to the thyroid cartilage (Figure 4A). The thyroid cartilage appears as the superficial, hypoechoic structure at the cranial side of the scan and casts an acoustic shadow (Figure 4B).\nNext, locate the cricoid cartilage, which is in a caudal location and appears hypoechoic. Identify the CTM lying between these two structures using the underlying air-mucosal interface, which appears as a hyperechoic line that runs the length of the trachea.\nFor further confirmation, scan caudal to locate the tracheal rings, which will appear as a hyperechoic \"string of beads\"18.\n\t\tNOTE: The second technique for identifying the CTM (step 2.5 to step 2.8) involves using a transverse scanning orientation on the anterior neck. This technique is sometimes referred to as the thyroid-airline-cricoid-airline (TACA) approach19.\nPerform the second technique to locate the CTM as described below.\n\t\nBegin by placing a linear high frequency probe in the transverse plane at the level of the thyroid cartilage, which appears as hyperechoic and casts an acoustic shadow-a black triangle with the tip being most superficial (Figure 5).\nScan in a caudal direction until the black triangle disappears as the thyroid cartilage ends and the CTM begins. Identify this as the air-mucosal interface that appears as a bright white line with reverberation effects (Figure 5).\nContinue scanning in a caudal direction until the CTM ends and the cricoid cartilage appears. The cricoid cartilage will appear as a hypoechoic band surrounding the trachea (Figure 5). Once the cricoid is identified, the sonographer will have located the inferior border of the CTM.",
    "To ensure that the proper anatomy has been identified, reverse these steps and scan in a cephalad direction, again identifying the CTM and the thyroid cartilage. Once these landmarks have been identified, mark the CTM location on the patient. Once the CTM has been marked, proceed to the induction of anesthesia and airway management as planned, knowing the CTM is properly identified in the rare event a surgical airway is required.\n3. Acquisition of parameters for the prediction of difficult airway management\nNOTE: For the prediction of difficult airway management, the skin to epiglottis distance and LPWT are measured. These steps should be performed prior to the induction of anesthesia.\nTo measure the skin to epiglottis distance, place the patient in the supine position with the neck in a neutral position and prepare the probe and ultrasound as described in step 1.1.\n\t\nPlace a high frequency, linear probe in the transverse position on the anterior neck at the level of the thyrohyoid membrane (Figure 6A).\nIdentify the epiglottis, which appears as the hypoechoic structure midway between the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage (Figure 6B). The laryngeal surface of the epiglottis forms a hyperechoic line, which represents the air-mucosal interface. Tilt the probe in either direction if the anterior border of the epiglottis is not clearly defined.\nNote an echogenic (fat-filled) pre-epiglottic space20.",
    "To measure the skin to epiglottis distance, freeze the image by touching the large Freeze button at the bottom of the touchscreen. Next, select the blue Distance button on the right side of the screen. Use a finger to drag one cursor to the superficial surface of the epiglottis, and move the other cursor to the anterior surface of the neck (skin). The skin to epiglottis distance will be displayed in the gray box on the upper left side of the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: Based on this measurement, it is possible to predict difficult intubation. A skin to epiglottis distance greater than 2.7 cm indicates that a Cormacke-Lehane score of 3 or 4 may be encountered on direct laryngoscopy21.\nTo measure the LPWT, place the patient in the supine position with the neck in neutral orientation.\n\t\nPlace a curvilinear, low-frequency probe in the coronal orientation below the mastoid process and in-line with the carotid artery (Figure 7A).\nUse doppler flow to identify the carotid artery. To accomplish this, press the C button on the bottom left of the screen. Using a finger on the touch screen, move the yellow box over the carotid vasculature. Identify the carotid artery by noting the pulsatile vascular flow.\nTo measure the LPWT, freeze the image (Figure 7B) by pushing the Freeze button on the bottom of the screen. Then press the blue Distance button on the right side of the screen. Place one cursor on the inferior border of the carotid artery and the second cursor on the anterior aspect of the airway. The LPWT will then be displayed in the gray box on the upper left side of the screen.",
    "NOTE: In the event of an emergency airway scenario requiring rapid sequence induction, step 3.2 may be skipped, as mask ventilation is not likely to be necessary, and in the interest of time.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
