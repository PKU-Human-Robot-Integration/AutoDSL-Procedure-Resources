    "While reverse-phase separation resins such as C18 have been extensively used for peptide binding and subsequent desalting, the long alkyl chains of C18 would impede downstream protein elution steps. In our previous publication (Clark et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0006]), we evaluated the use of reverse-phase resin with shorter alkyl chains (i.e., C4) for use in urinary protein isolation paired with “on-tip” protease digestion. Herein, we describe detailed steps for C4-tip production and “on-tip” protease digestion. Similar to traditional proteomics sample processing, Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-prot-0001] should be used for enzymatic digestion of protein mixtures into peptides, with the benefits that on-tip digestion can provide: Direct binding of urinary proteins, without doing sample preparation methods such as protein precipitation, ultrafiltration, or analytical ultracentrifugation. Users should skip Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-prot-0001] and proceed with Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-prot-0002] if focused on glycopeptide enrichment from peptide mixtures.\nNOTE: For C4-tips, we previously evaluated the binding capacity of the C4 resin and it is ∼400 µg of protein material per 30 mg of C4 resin (Clark et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0006]).

Use a Harris Uni-core disposable punch (I.D. 2 mm) to punch 2-mm holes in the 1/16 in. fine sheet and shoot in the D.A.R.T.S tips; make sure the flat side of the filter stays horizontal with the tip. Use a sterilized needle or iron wire to pack the filter firmly into the D.A.R.T.S tips; do not pack filter too tightly because it will affect downstream liquid aspiration and dispersion (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-fig-0002]).\nWe recommend using gravity to drop the iron wire ∼2 in. above the filter for ∼30 times to achieve reproducible results across all C4-tips.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/da9ec3f6-05b0-4612-91da-cee231135fb2/cpz1186-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSchematic representation of C4-tip and C18/MAX-tip. By using a Harris Uni-core disposable punch, punch 2-mm holes in the 1/16 in. fine sheet and shoot in the D.A.R.T.S tips. Making sure the flat side of the filter stays horizontal with the tip, load (A) 30 mg C4 or (B) 4 mg MAX, followed by 20 mg C18 in the D.A.R.T.S tip, pack the tip by punching another 5-mm hole in the 1/16 in. fine sheet and pack firmly on top. The resin should stay in the middle during the entire sample process procedure. If either the 5- or 2-mm sheet is not placed horizontally, the resin may leak during the sample processing procedure.\n3. Add 300 µl MeOH into Eppendorf tubes that contain C4 resin beads.",
    "4. Vortex thoroughly and inject MeOH/C4 resin mixture into the D.A.R.T.S tips that contain 2-mm filters. Rinse the Eppendorf tube again using 100 µl MeOH and inject into D.A.R.T.S tips to ensure C4 resin is all transferred to the D.A.R.T.S tip.\nIf using other liquid handling systems, the D.A.R.T.S tip might not be compatible with certain liquid handlers but the same packing method can still be implemented.\n5. Punch 5-mm holes using the Harris Uni-core disposable punch (I.D. 5 mm) in the 1/16 in. fine sheet; the resin should be in between the 2- and 5-mm filters.\n6. Use tweezers or a flat shaped rod to push the 5-mm filter firmly against the upper level of the resin.\nWe recommend marking a specific position on the flat shaped rod to push down the 5-mm filter to the same depth across production of all tips.\n7. Allow MeOH to flow through the bottom of the D.A.R.T.S tips naturally.\nSteps 1 to 7 describe the production of a single C4-tip. If users are manufacturing multiple C4-tips at the same time, we recommend weighing the appropriate amount of C4 material (30 mg/tip) in a small glass vial (preferably 20 ml) and adding MeOH in the following proportion: 30 mg C4 resin/200 µl MeOH (for example, for production of 20 tips, weigh out 600 mg of C4 resin, add 4,000 µl of MeOH). Add a magnetic stir bar and use a magnetic hot plate/stirrer to stir the resin/MeOH mixture. Make sure the mixture is homogenized and start to aspirate 200 µl/tip of mixture into the D.A.R.T.S tips, then follow steps 5 to 7.\nConditioning C4-tips\n8. Take out two racks, add 30 ml 50% ACN + 0.1% TFA, and 30 ml 0.1% TFA, separately.",
    "The volume specification in step 8 is just to ensure C4-tips can aspirate enough liquid, as long as the C4-tip can be submerged to aspirate liquids; the specific volume should not be critical.\n9. Use the liquid handling system to aspirate and disperse the C4-tips in 50% ACN + 0.1% TFA for ten cycles.\n10. Aspirate and disperse C4-tips in 0.1% TFA for another ten cycles.\nFor the liquid handling system (i.e., Versette), one cycle (aspiration and dispersion) will take ∼2 min. If using other liquid handling systems or a multichannel pipet, procedures need to be changed accordingly to follow the overall processing time of specific steps.\nSample loading on C4-tips\n11. If the protein samples are dried, reconstitute sample into 300 µl with 1% formic acid.\nFor C4-tips, we previously evaluated the binding capacity of the C4 resin as ∼400 µg of protein material per 30 mg of C4 resin (Clark et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0006]). Users are advised to adjust the total amount of C4 resin according to the protein material being processed.\n12. Vortex samples thoroughly.\n13. Centrifuge samples at 900 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble proteins and precipitates.\n14. Aliquot 300 µl supernatant into the 96-well Deepwell plate; be cautious and do not aliquot precipitates.\n15. Acidify samples with 20% formic acid until final concentration of formic acid is 1% to keep pH <3.\nIf samples are already at pH <3, this step can be skipped.\n16. Using the liquid handling system, aspirate and disperse acidified protein solution using C4-tips for 30 cycles.",
    "For the sample loading procedure, we added an extra delay time of 1 min between aspiration and dispersion; therefore, one cycle would be ∼3 min. If using other liquid handling systems, procedures need to be changed accordingly to follow the overall processing time of specific steps.\nSample washing to remove inorganic salts, urea, and other contaminants\n17. Remove contaminants and inorganic salts using 0.1% TFA; run for ten cycles.\n18. Adjust the pH in each of the tips using 50 mM TEAB and run for ten cycles.\nFor downstream on-tip digestion using a C4-tip, the user must adjust the pH in each tip in order to maintain enzymatic activity, i.e., pH ∼7.6-8.0. If TEAB is not compatible for the user's analysis, we recommend other pH buffers like ammonium bicarbonate.\n“On-tip” protein digestion using C4-tip\n19. Reduce protein disulfide bonds on bound proteins using 10 mM TCEP and run for twenty cycles.\n20. Alkylate reduced cysteine residues on bound proteins using 15 mM IAA in the dark and run for twenty cycles.\nIAA must be added in the dark because IAA is light sensitive.\n21. Make a digestion buffer consisting of 50 mM TEAB in 30% ACN.\nThe composition of digestion buffer has been evaluated in our previous publication (Clark et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0006]). We have found inclusion of 30% ACN in our digestion buffer resulted in a higher peptide recovery and also a higher trypsin enzyme activity.\n22. Perform protease digestion on bound proteins by adding Lys C in digestion buffer (1:40 enzyme/protein) for 30 cycles.\n23. Perform subsequent protease digestion on bound proteins by adding trypsin in digestion buffer (1:40 enzyme/protein) for another 120 cycles.\n24. Elute digested peptide on a C4-tip using 150 µl 50% ACN + 0.1% TFA and run for ten cycles.",
    "25. Repeat step 24 to ensure higher recovery of digested peptides.\n26. Pool solutions from steps 22, 23, 24, and 25 from the same C4-tip.\n27. Dry down digested peptides using a SpeedVac concentrator.\nFor SpeedVac processing to dry down the samples, we use the SpeedVac SC210A concentrator with settings of concentrator mode: “ON” and drying rate mode: “Low.”\n28. Store samples at -20°C until ready to start Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-prot-0002].\nSteps 22, 23, 24, and 25 all contain digested peptides. After the last peptide elution step, solutions from steps 22 to 25 should be pooled together.\nBasic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-prot-0001] can also be directly applied for protease digestion of unmodified peptides. If users are focused on global proteomics, a further C18 stage tip clean up would be sufficient for global proteomic analysis on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).",
    "With the advancement of mass spectrometry, high-throughput sample preparation has been the focus of proteomics (Clark et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0006]; Fu et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0009]), while high-throughput glycoproteomics has been somewhat limited to glycosite analysis using hydrazide chemistry (Berven, Ahmad, Clauser, & Carr, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0003]; Chen, Shah, & Zhang, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0004]). Traditionally, intact glycopeptides are enriched by hydrophilic chromatography (Sun et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0028]; W. Yang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0033]) or lectin (Guo et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0011]; Zhou et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0038]), while sialylated glycopeptides are typically enriched by TiO2 (Kawahara et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0018]; Palmisano et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0024]), strong cationic exchange (SCX; Lewandrowski, Zahedi, Moebius, Walter, & Sickmann, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0021]), immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) based on charge selection (Hu, Shah, Clark, Ao, & Zhang, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0015]), or periodate-oxidation of sialylated glycopeptides (Halim, Nilsson, Rüetschi, Hesse, & Larson, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0012]; Nilsson et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0023]). For periodate-oxidation, sialic acid information is lost after de-sialylation and release from hydrazide beads. With the limits described above, we developed a high-throughput intact glycopeptide enrichment platform that would combine two distinct proteomics enrichment strategies (i.e., hydrophilic and hydrophobic) for simultaneous desalting and enrichment of glycopeptides. We've previously compared the enrichment efficiency and specificity of multiple enrichment methods (W. Yang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0033]), and reported mixed-mode anionic exchange (MAX) showed higher yield of enrichment and great enrichment specificity. Hence, we further developed our glycopeptide enrichment platform using MAX resin (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0005]). Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-prot-0002] provides a step-by-step introduction of glycopeptide enrichment using a combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptide enrichment strategies, i.e., C18 resin plus MAX resin. Utilizing liquid handling systems, users should expect enrichment of intact glycopeptide after ∼6 hr of processing time.\nMaterials\nPeptide samples (dried)\nPreparative C18 125Å 55-105 µm bulk packing material (Waters, cat. no.

Use the Versette liquid handling system to aspirate and disperse the C18/MAX-tips sequentially in 100% ACN, 100 mM TAAB, 95% ACN + 1% TFA, and 0.1% TFA for ten cycles.\nWe have reported that for a column-based elution, the related position of C18 and MAX resin are optimized if they are stacked with C18 on top (G. Yang et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0031]). However, because liquid handling systems would aspirate and disperse in an up-down movement (unlike column-based flow, which generally uses gravity to allow the elution wash to flow naturally).

Using the liquid handling system, aspirate and disperse the acidified peptide solution using C18/MAX-tips for 25 cycles.\nUnlike the C4-tip sample loading steps, for this sample loading procedure, we did not add an extra delay time of 1 min between aspiration and dispersion; therefore, one cycle would still be ∼2 min. If using other liquid handling systems, procedures need to be changed accordingly to follow the overall processing time of specific steps.\nThe sample loading using 0.1% TFA is the sample loading condition for a typical C18 resin sample loading. Unmodified peptides and glycopeptides are able to bind to C18 material via hydrophobic interactions.\nSample washing/desalting using C18/MAX-tips",
    "21. Directly after the sample loading step, aspirate and disperse 0.1% TFA using the C18/MAX-tip that contains peptide mixtures for ten cycles.\nThis step is to eliminate any unspecific binding of C18 material. Because the washing buffer is 0.1% TFA (i.e., does not contain organic solvents), peptide will not be eluted off the C18/MAX-tip during this step.\nSample loading onto MAX material and elution of non-glycosylated peptides\n22.

Repeat steps 22 and 23 two more times.\n25. Collect eluant from steps 22 to 24; the eluant should contain the non-glycosylated peptides.\n95% ACN + 1% TFA is the intact glycopeptide sample loading condition which was evaluated in our previous publication (W. Yang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0033]). Simultaneously, 95% ACN will also allow for non-glycosylated peptide to elute from the C18 material, while glycosylated peptide will still be retained on the MAX material via hydrophilic interactions.\nRepeating steps 22 and 23 with fresh 95% ACN + 0.1% TFA is to ensure non-glycosylated peptides are completely eluted off the MAX material. In our previous work (W. Yang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.186#cpz1186-bib-0033]), we observed ∼66% of enrichment specificity for MAX material when we compared percentage of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) of all glycopeptides to the total PSMs of peptides and glycopeptides.\nElution of glycopeptides from C18/MAX-tip\n26.

If your glycopeptide samples are completely dried, resuspend them in 40 µl 0.1% TFA.\n2. Vortex thoroughly for 30 min.\nFor vortexing of the IGPs, we are using a DPC MicroMix Plate Shaker with amplitude settings at 4, form settings at 3. If using a mini vortexer, we recommend vortexing at a low to moderate speed. For example, for a VWR standard mini vortexer, we do not recommend a vortex speed >6.\n3. Aliquot 20 µl out into a new 96-well Deepwell plate.",
    "The purpose of this step is to preserve half of the samples as intact glycopeptides for intact-glycopeptide analysis. If users are not interested in intact-glycopeptide analysis, this step can be omitted. However, for the following steps, reaction volumes will have to be doubled.\n4. Make the PNGaseF digestion buffer by adding 2 µl PNGaseF in 98 µl 100 mM TEAB.\nAccording to protocols provided by New England BioLabs, 1 µl of PNGaseF contains 500 units of PNGaseF enzyme.\n5. Add the PNGaseF/TEAB mixture in the original Deepwell plate that contains 20 µl of intact-glycopeptide sample.\n6. Let react at room temperature overnight using a shaker.\nWe recommend this reaction be performed in the original 96-well Deepwell plate to save time and minimize sample loss during multiple sample transfer procedures.\nSeparating glycans from de-N-glycopeptides using C18 stage tips\nThere are multiple C18 stage tip protocols and manufacturers available to users. We pack our own C18 stage tips using a solid phase extraction disk (CDS EmporeTM).\n7. Condition C18 stage tips with 100 µl MeOH, twice. Centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (211 × g) for 2 min.\n8. Centrifuge 2 min at 1,800 rpm (304 × g) with 100 µl 50% ACN + 0.1% FA, twice.\n9. Centrifuge 2 min under 1,800 rpm (304 × g) with 100 µl 0.1% FA, twice.\n10. Load glycan/de-N-glycopeptide samples and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 rpm (94 × g), twice.\n11. Wash for 2 min by centrifuging at 1,800 rpm (304 × g) with 100 µl 0.1% FA, twice.\n12. Collect flow through from steps 10 and 11; this will be the glycan sample.\n13. Elute de-N-glycopeptides using 75 µl 50% ACN + 0.1% FA, twice.",
    "The specific parameters (time and spin rate) during stage tip procedures will vary according to the centrifuge and the tightness of the C18 packing material being packed. We highly recommend that users test out specific parameters prior to operating. We recommend not increasing the spin rate but increase the time of centrifuging, if parameters needed to be optimized.\nGlycan purification using PGC NuTip carbon\n14. Attach a PGC NuTip onto a 200-µl pipet.\n15. Aliquot 1 ml 80% ACN + 0.1% FA into an Eppendorf tube; denote as “conditioning buffer.”\n16. Aliquot 1 ml 0.1% FA into an Eppendorf tube; denote as “binding buffer.”\n17. Aspirate and disperse 50 µl conditioning buffer into an Eppendorf tube twenty times to condition the NuTip.\n18. Aspirate and disperse 50 µl binding buffer into an Eppendorf tube twenty times to condition the NuTip.\n19. Aspirate and disperse 50 µl of glycan samples twenty times to bind the glycan samples on the NuTip.\n20. Aspirate and disperse 50 µl binding buffer into an Eppendorf tube twenty times to wash the glycan samples.\n21. Aliquot 200 µl 80% ACN + 0.1% FA into an Eppendorf tube; denote as “releasing buffer.”\n22. Aspirate and disperse 200 µl releasing buffer into an Eppendorf tube fifty times to elute glycan samples.\n23. Dry down using a SpeedVac concentrator."
