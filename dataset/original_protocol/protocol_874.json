Mix PDMS base and curing agent \\(10:1 mass ratio) in a beaker using a plastic knife.\n  3. Pour ~40 g PDMS to the master in the petri dish and degas PDMS in a vacuum desiccator.\n  4. Cure PDMS in a baking oven at 80 °C for 2 hr.\n  5. Cut and peel off the cured PDMS from the wafer using a scalpel.\n  6. Punch holes in the PDMS device as the inlets and outlets using a sharpened steel puncher \\(6 mm diameter).\n  7. Punch holes in the PDMS device for cell loading ports using a smaller puncher \\(3 mm diameter).\n  8. Use adhesive tape to clean the PDMS device surface.\n  \n**PDMS device assembly ● TIMING: 20 min \\(Fig. 2B).**\n1. Place the PDMS replica and a clean glass slide in the plasma cleaner.\n  **CAUTION:** The channel side of PDMS replica faces up.\n2. Treat the PDMS replica and glass slide by plasma for 1-2 minutes.\n  3. Gently bond the PDMS replica to the glass slide. \n  **CAUTION:** Gently press for bonding to avoid damaging the thin barrier channels.\n4. Immediately inject deionized water into the microchannels.\n  \n**Device coating ● TIMING: 2.5 h \\(Fig. 3)**\n1. Mix RPMI-1640 and 4% BSA to get 0.4% BSA.",
    "2. Prepare fibronectin solution in DPBS to get final concentration of 0.25mg/mL.\n  3. Prepare 2 μg/mL rat tail collagen type I.\n  4. Remove the deionized water from all the medium ports.\n  5. Add 100 µl of fibronectin \\(for neutrophils) or rat tail collagen type I \\(for MDA-MB-231 cells) to the outlets and let it flow into the channels.\n  6. Incubate the devices for 1 hr.\n  7.

Incubate the device for 1 hr before cell experiments.\n  \n**Human blood neutrophil preparation ● TIMING: within 2 h**\n1. Human blood samples were obtained by venipuncture from healthy donors under an ethics protocol approved by the Joint-Faculty Research Ethics Board at the University of Manitoba.\n  2. Use a cell isolation kit \\(EasySep Direct Human Neutrophil Isolation Kit, STEMCELL) to negatively isolate neutrophils directly from the blood.\n  3. Re-suspend cells in RPMI with 0.4% BSA and incubate in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before the migration experiment.\n  \n**MDA-MB-231 cells preparation **\n1. Prepare culture medium using DME/F12 medium with 10% FBS.\n  2. Culture MDA-MB-231cells in culture medium.\n  **CAUTION:** Cells were passaged regularly and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\n3.

Load neutrophils to the D3-Chip coated with fibronectin through the cell loading ports and let cells settled in the docking area.",
    "4. Add chemoattractant solution and medium to the two inlet reservoirs of each test unit of the D3-Chip to create different gradient conditions in different units according to the need of the experiments. As one example configuration, one unit is used as the medium control without gradient, one unit is used for a known effective chemoattractant gradient as a positive control, and the other unit is used to test the condition of interest.\n  5. Put the microfluidic device on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope.\n  6. Image the fluorescence intensity of FITC-Dextran inside the channel to verify gradient generation.\n  7. Record cell migration images at 6 frames/min for 15 min.\n  8. Import the images to “ImageJ”to track cells.\n  9. Use “Chemotaxis and Migration Tool” to further analyze the tracking data.\n  10. Export the tracking data to Excel for further calculation of migration parameters.\n  11. Some migration parameters can be calculated from the tracking data such as chemotactic index \\(CI), flowtactic index \\(FI), and migration speed \\(V) \\[18].\n  12. Alternatively, chemotaxis assay using the D3-Chip can be done without taking time-lapse images. After cell loading and gradient generation, put the device in the incubator for 15 min. \n  13. At the end of the assay, capture the final cell images in the channel for data analysis. \n  14. Import the images to ImageJ.\n  15. Calculate the cell migration distance along the gradient direction \\(across the gradient relative to the thin barrier channel).\n  \n**Cancer cell chemotaxis assay and data analysis ● TIMING 7 h \\(Fig. 3)**\n1. Prepare chemoattractant solution at desired concentration in DME/F12 with 1% FBS. Add FITC-Dextran to the chemoattractant solution as the gradient indicator.",
    "2. Load cancer cells into each test unit of the collagen coated D3-Chip via the cell loading ports. Wait 5 min until enough cancer cells are trapped at the cell docking area.\n  3. Add chemoattractant solution and medium to the two inlet reservoirs of each test unit of the D3-Chip to create different gradient conditions in different units depending on the need of the experiments. As one example configuration, one unit is used as the medium control without gradient, one unit is used for a known effective chemoattractant gradient as a positive control, and the other unit is used to test the condition of interest.\n  **CAUTION:** Fresh chemoattractant solutions and medium should be added to the device every hour to maintain the gradient.\n4. As cancer cells migrate more slowly comparing to neutrophils, it is an advantage of the D3-Chip that chemotaxis assay can be done without time-lapse microscopy. After cell loading and gradient application, put the device in an incubator for several hrs. \n  5. At the end of the assay, capture the final cell images in the channels for data analysis. \n  6. Import the images to ImageJ.\n  7. Analyze cell migration distance along the gradient direction \\(across the gradient relative to the thin barrier channel)."
