    "Adult female CD1-strain mice were used in this study. Similar staining can be accomplished using both sexes at various ages. Experimental animals were cared for according to the principles and guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and the experimental protocol was approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee.\n1. Golgi-Cox Staining\nGolgi-Cox Impregnation of Brains\nMake the Golgi-Cox solution of 1% (w/v) potassium dichromate, 0.8% (w/v) potassium chromate and 1% (w/v) mercuric chloride by dissolving the potassium dichromate and potassium chromate into high-quality water separately. Mix the solutions, add the mercuric chloride and filter the final solution using grade 1 filter paper. Store the solution in the dark for up to one month.\nAnesthetize the mouse using 5% isoflurane.\nEuthanize the mouse by decapitation and quickly remove the brain.\nPlace the brain into a 20 mL glass scintillation vial containing 17 mL of Golgi-Cox solution and incubate in the dark at RT for 25 d.\nCryoprotect the brain by placing it into a 50 mL conical tube containing 40 mL of sucrose cryoprotectant (30% (w/v) sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) in the dark at 4 °C for 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The following optional three steps may be employed as an alternative to the main protocol, in order to freeze the brain at this stage for long-term storage.\nFreeze the whole brain by immersing it into 200 mL isopentane that has been precooled on dry ice.\nPlace the frozen brain into a 50 mL conical tube and store in the dark at -80 °C.\nWhen ready to proceed, thaw the brain by placing it into a 50 mL conical tube containing 40 mL of sucrose cryoprotectant in the dark at 4 °C for 24 h.\nBrain Sectioning",
    "Remove the brain from the sucrose and block it for sectioning by cutting off the cerebellum using a razor blade and leaving a flat edge at the remaining caudal end of the brain.\nHeat agar (3% (w/v) in water) until it is melted and let cool until it is slightly above its melting point.\nPlace the brain in a small disposable weigh dish with its caudal end face-down and add a sufficient amount of melted agar to cover the brain.\nOnce the agar has solidified, trim excess agar leaving approximately 2 - 4 mm surrounding the brain and glue the brain to the stage of a vibratome with its caudal end face-down using a small amount of ethyl cyanoacrylate glue.\n Fill the stage area of the vibratome with a sufficient amount of sucrose cryoprotectant to cover the brain, and section the brain at a slice thickness of 400 - 500 µm (depending on the brain region to be examined) using a vibration frequency of 86 Hz and a blade advancement speed of 0.125 mm/s.\nUsing a small paint brush, place brain sections into a well of a 6-well tissue culture plate containing commercially-available mesh-bottom inserts and pre-filled with 10 mL of 6% (w/v) sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.\nIncubate sections in the dark at 4 °C O/N.\nDeveloping Brain Sections\nUsing the mesh-bottom inserts, transfer brain sections into a new well containing 5 mL of 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PBD) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Incubate on a rocker moving at slow speed in the dark at RT for 15 min.\nWash sections twice by transferring them to new wells containing 5 mL of water. Wash on a rocker moving at a moderate speed in the dark at RT for 5 min.",
    "Transfer sections into a new well containing 5 mL of 2.7% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide. Incubate on a rocker moving at a slow speed in the dark at RT for 15 min.\nWash sections twice by transferring them to new wells containing 5 mL of water. Wash on a rocker moving at a moderate speed in the dark at RT for 5 min.\nTransfer sections into a new well containing 5 mL of Fixative A (see Materials Table) that has been diluted in water 10x from its original purchased concentration. Incubate on a rocker moving at a slow speed in the dark at RT for 25 min.\nWash sections twice by transferring them to new wells containing 5 mL of water. Wash on a rocker moving at a moderate speed in the dark at RT for 5 min.\nMounting Brain Sections\nUsing a small paint brush, mount sections onto microscope slides. Remove excess water and agar using tweezers and a small tissue. Ensure that all agar is removed before proceeding with dehydration.\nAllow sections to air dry at RT for approximately 45 min (400 μm sections) or 90 min (500 μm sections).\n\t\tNOTE: The timing and proper level of dryness is critical, and may need to be determined in each laboratory depending on ambient temperature and humidity level. Too short a drying time leads to sections falling off of slides during subsequent dehydration steps, and too long a drying time leads to sections cracking. Sections will still appear to be shiny at the appropriate level of dryness.\nStain sections with cresyl violet by placing slides into Coplin staining jars as indicated.",
    "NOTE: This optional step may be employed for sections that had never been frozen, in order to stain neuronal nuclei with cresyl violet. We have found that clearing and rehydrating sections before incubation in cresyl violet leads to even staining and low background across sections.\n\t\t\nPlace in clearing agent for 5 min. Repeat once.\nPlace in 100% ethanol for 5 min. Repeat once.\nPlace in 95% ethanol in water, then 75% ethanol in water, and then 50% ethanol in water for 2 min each.\nPlace in water for 5 min.\nPlace in 0.5% (w/v) cresyl violet in water for 7 min.\nPlace in water for 2 min. Repeat once.\nDehydrate sections by placing slides into Coplin staining jars as indicated.\n\t\t\nPlace in 50% ethanol in water, then 75% ethanol in water, and then 95% ethanol in water for 2 min each.\nPlace in 100% ethanol for 5 min. Repeat once.\nPlace in clearing agent for 5 min. Repeat once.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These dehydration and clearing times are sufficient to process mouse brains as described in this manuscript. However, we have observed for other species including rat and cowbird, that the final clearing step may need to be extended up to 15 min total.\nCoverslip sections using an anhydrous mounting medium.\nAllow slides to dry horizontally in the dark at RT for at least 5 d.\n2.
