    "Animal Care\nMale C57 BL/6 mice were group-housed and kept in a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle with free to access to food and water ad libitum. The animals used in this protocol were 10-12 weeks old. All procedures were performed under protocols approved by Indiana University’s Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Surgical Preparation\nAnesthetize the mouse using a Ketamine/xylazine mixture (87.7 mg/ml Ketamine and 12.3 mg/ml Xylazine) and administer (1 ml/kg) via IP injection.\nShave the head of the mouse between the ears.\nApply a petroleum-based jelly to the eyes of the mouse to prevent drying out during surgery.\nClean the shaven area with 10% iodine. Then use 70% ethanol to clean off the iodine.\nFix the mouse head in the stereotactic frame using the ear bars and bite plate. Ensure the brain is stable.\n2. Craniectomy\nMake a longitudinal incision in the middle of the head with scissors. Use a hemostat to hold skin off to the left side.\nUse a cotton-tipped applicator to remove the blood and tissue on the bone to expose the skull. Allow exposed skull to dry for 1 min.\nUse forceps to apply pressure and ensure that the skull remains immobile. Identify anatomical landmarks Lambda (caudal aspect) and Bregma (frontal aspect). Draw a circle in the center of Lambda and Bregma with a 4 mm diameter and 0.5 mm away from the midline.\nUse a drill to cut along the marked circle. Gently blow bone dust away. Do not drill completely through the bone to prevent damaging the dura mater.\nUse forceps to remove bone and expose the dura mater.\n3. Impaction\nThe impact system includes a control box to set impact parameters, an actuator to perform the impaction, and a stereotactic frame to secure the actuator and mouse head for impact.",
    "Pre-set the velocity of the actuator to 3 m/sec before surgery.\nPre-set different deformation depth to induce different injury severities. Deformation depths of 0.0-0.2 mm, 0.5-1.0 mm, and 1.2-2.0 mm would result in mild, moderate, and severe TBIs, respectively. This protocol explained how to achieve a moderately severe brain injury with a deformation depth of 1 mm by using a velocity of 3 m/sec.\nAttach the actuator to the holder in the stereotactic frame and use the micromanipulators moving it to secure the round, flat tip of the actuator (3 mm diameter) in the center of the open skull area. Then adjust the tip at an angle parallel to the surface of impact site.\nEstablish the zero point by moving down the actuator in the extending model until the tip touches the surface of the impact site. Then set the Z channel on the stereotactic control panel to zero.\nRetract the impactor tip while simultaneously moving the actuator down 1 mm.\nHit the impact button to strike the injury site and achieve a deformation depth of 1 mm.\n4. Injury Site Closure\nUse cotton-tipped applicators to remove any blood following impact, but do not touch the injury area.\nPlace mouse on a warm pad to maintain body temperature.\nOnce bleeding has stopped, suture the wound closed. Put the animal back into the clean cage and allow it to recover from the surgery overnight on the warm pad.\nAdminister Buprenorphine 0.05-0.10 mg/kg SQ every 8-12 hr for 2 days after surgery.\nSubscription Required.
