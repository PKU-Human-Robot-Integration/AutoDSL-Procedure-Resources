    "1. Self-(in)compatibility determination\nSample the flowers in the field. It is necessary to collect the flowers at balloon stage (Figure 1A), corresponding to stage 58 on the BBCH scale for apricot28, to avoid unwanted previous pollination.\nSelf- and cross-pollinations in the laboratory\nRemove the anthers of the flowers at balloon stage and place them on a piece of paper to dry at laboratory temperature.\nAfter 24 h, sieve the pollen grains by using a fine mesh (0.26 mm) (Figure 1B).\nEmasculate a group of 30 flowers at the same balloon stage for each self-pollination and cross-pollination and place the pistils on florist foam in water at laboratory temperature (Figure 1C).\nHand pollinate the pistils with the help of a paintbrush with pollen from flowers of the same cultivar 24 h after emasculation. In addition, pollinate another set of pistils of each cultivar with pollen from flowers of a compatible pollinizer as control (Figure 1D).\nAfter 72 h, fix the pistils in a fixative solution of ethanol/acetic acid (3:1) for at least 24 h at 4 °C29. Then discard the fixative and add 75% ethanol ensuring that the samples are completely submerged in the solution. Samples can be conserved in this solution at 4 °C until use8,17,30,31,32.\nEvaluating pollen viability through in vitro pollen germination\nTo prepare the germination medium, weight 25 g of sucrose, 0.075 g of boric acid (H3BO3) and 0.075 g of calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2)33.\nAdd the components of the medium in 250 mL of distilled water and dissolve completely.\nSolidify the medium adding 2 g of agarose and mix by swirling.\nCheck the pH of the medium using a pH meter and adjust the value to 7.0 with NaOH or HCl solution.\nAutoclave the mixture to sterilize the medium.",
    "After autoclaving, cool down the medium and distribute it into Petri dishes in a sterile laminar flow hood.\nScatter the pollen grains of the same cultivars used for the controlled pollinations in the solidified pollen germination medium and observe them under the microscope after 24 h6.\n\t\tNOTE: To sterilize the laminar flow hood, clean the surface with 70% ethanol and switch on the UV lamp during 10 min.\nStore the Petri dishes in a refrigerator at 4 °C until use.\nMicroscopy observations\nWash the pistils three times for 1 h with distilled water and leave them in 5% sodium sulphite at 4 °C. After 24 h, autoclave them at 1 kg/cm2 during 10 min in sodium sulphite to soften the tissues34.\nPlace the autoclaved pistils over a glass slide and, with the help of a scalpel, remove the trichomes around the ovary to get a better visualization of the pollen tubes. Then, squash the pistils with a cover glass.\nPrepare 0.1% (v/v) aniline blue stain: mix 0.1 mL of aniline blue in 100 mL of 0.1 N potassium phosphate tribasic (K3PO4). Apply a drop of aniline blue over the preparations to stain callose depositions during pollen tube growth.\nObserve the pollen tubes along the style by a microscope with UV epifluorescence using 340-380 bandpass and 425 longpass filters.\n2. DNA extraction\nSample 2-3 leaves in the field in spring. It is recommended to sample the leaves at young stages since DNA obtained is of higher quality and lower levels of phenolic compounds compared to old leaves.\nExtract Genomic DNA following the steps described in a commercially available kit (see Table of Materials).\nAnalyze the quantity and quality of DNA concentrations using UV-vis spectrophotometer (260 nm).\n3. S-allele identification\nSetting up of the PCR Reactions",
    "Prepare a 50 ng/μL dilution in distilled water of each DNA extraction sample.\nThaw out the PCR reagents slowly and keep them on ice. Leave the DNA polymerase in the freezer until needed.\nPrepare the amplification reactions using the different combinations of primers. Create the PCR reaction mix by combining the components in Table 1. Vortex the PCR reaction mix well and distribute the volume indicated for the different combinations of primers to each well of the PCR plate. Then, add 1 μL of the DNA dilution in each well.\nPlace the PCR plate in the thermocycler and run the corresponding PCR program shown in Table 1.\nAnalyze the amplified fragments. There are mainly two different ways to analyze the PCR amplified fragments: capillary electrophoresis (CE) with fluorescent-labelled primers or as visualize amplicons of agarose gel electrophoresis with not-labelled primers.\n\t\nCapillary Electrophoresis\nTo prepare the loading buffer, mix 35 μL of deionized formamide with 0.45 μL of labeled sizing standard. Vortex the reagent to mix well, and then dispense 35.5 μL into the well of the reader plate.\nAdd 1 μL of the PCR product into the well. In addition, add a drop of mineral oil to prevent water evaporation.\nPrepare the separation plate adding separation buffer.\nUse the commercial software included with the gene analyzer (see Table of Materials). Create a new sample plate and save the sample names for all wells on the plate.\nSelect the method of analysis. In this case, denature the samples at 90 °C for 120 s, inject at 2.0 kV for 30 s, and separate at 6.0 kV for 35 min.\nInsert the two plates into the gene analyzer. Fill the capillary array with distilled water.\nLoad the patented linear polyacrylamide (LPA) gel. Finally, click Run.\nGel Electrophoresis",
    "Prepare a 1% agarose gel adding 1.5 g of molecular biology grade agarose in 150 mL of 1x TAE (Tris-acetate-EDTA) electrophoresis running buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, and 1 mM EDTA at pH 8.0). Dissolve the agarose by microwave heating for 2-3 min.\nTo visualize the DNA, add 4 μL of a nucleic acid stain (see Table of Materials) and mix gently.\nAdd a gel comb, with sufficient wells for ladders, controls and samples, into a gel tray. Then, pour slowly the mix into the middle of the gel tray and avoid bubbles.\nLet the gel cool down for 30-45 min at room temperature until the gel has completely solidified. Introduce the gel in the electrophoresis chamber, remove the gel comb and fill the chamber with enough 1x TAE buffer to cover the gel.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Check the placement of the gel. The wells should be placed close to the negative pole since negatively charged DNA migrates towards the cathode.\nAdd 5 μL of loading buffer (0.1% (v/v) bromophenol blue) to the PCR products and mix well.\nTo estimate the size of the bands, load 5 μL of DNA molecular weight ladder (see Table of Materials).\nLoad the samples into the additional wells of the gel.\nOnce all the samples and the DNA molecular weight ladder are loaded, run the gel at 90 V for 1-1.5 h, until the blue dye line is approximately at 75% the length of the gel.\nVisualize the bands in a transilluminator for nucleic acids.\nSubscription Required.
