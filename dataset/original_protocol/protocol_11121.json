    "Human cells are potentially infectious. Therefore, the experiments are performed strictly in accordance with the required precautions and procedures discussed as occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) and personal protection equipment (PPE).\n1. Isolation of PBMCs from whole blood\nCollect all the materials needed from Table 1 and bring them to room temperature (RT). Warm RP10F to 37 °C. Adjust centrifuge to RT. Except for centrifugations and cell counting, perform all the steps using viable cells in a biological safety cabinet.\nObtain blood in five 10 mL tubes (desired amount) containing anticoagulant. Store the whole blood at ambient temperature (18‒24 °C). Label 50 mL separation tubes with the human research subject number for the blood sample to be processed.\nTransfer 10‒15 mL of blood into each separation tube(s) with the matching subject number. Dilute the blood at least 2 fold with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). Do not exceed 35 mL of diluted blood per tube.\nCarefully and slowly underlay the blood with ~13 mL of density medium. Watch through the transparent density medium at the bottom of the tube, and stop pipetting when the pipette is almost empty (to prevent bubble release). Carefully remove the pipette to avoid mixing the blood and density medium layers.\nCarefully transfer the filled separation tubes to the centrifuge without disturbing the layers.\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 30 min with the centrifuge brake off (deceleration set to zero).\n\tNOTE: If the centrifuge only displays rpm, consult rotor specifications to estimate the rpm equivalent for 500 x g.\nCarefully remove separation tubes from the centrifuge without disturbing the layers. Observe the buffy coat, which has been formed in between the density medium and plasma layers.",
    "Pipette from the top to remove and discard most of the upper plasma fraction, so that 10 mL remains above the buffy coat. Carefully and slowly collect the buffy coat. Transfer the buffy coats from two separation tubes into a new pre-labeled and sterile 50 mL tube, as shown in Figure 1.\nDilute the PBMCs at least 2 fold with HBSS, bringing the volume in each new tube up to 50 mL. Remember to switch the centrifuge brake to full. Pellet PBMCs by centrifugation at 400 x g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant as much as possible and tap the bottom of the tube to loosen the pellet.\nTo lyse residual red blood cells (RBC), resuspend each cell pellet in 1‒2 mL of ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer per 10 mL original blood volume. Incubate for exactly 5 min. Promptly stop lysis with an equal or greater volume of HBSS and adjust volume to 50 mL. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant and tap the bottom of tube to loosen the cell pellet. Pool cells from the same donor. Bring volume up to 50 mL with HBSS. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant and tap the bottom of tube to loosen the cell pellet. Resuspend cells in 10 mL of warm RP10F medium, and take an aliquot for viable cell counting using trypan blue.\nCalculate the total cell number in each sample using a hemocytometer.\n2. Purification of CD4+CD45RO+ T cells from PBMCs         \nNOTE: Purification of CD4+CD45RO+ T cells from PBMCs is done by using commercially available magnetic separation (see Table of materials) with minor modifications. It is preferred to follow the kit manual for incubation time as each commercial kit has their own instructions.",
    "Wash the desired quantity of PBMCs in 10 mL of selection buffer. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and tap the bottom of the tube to loosen the pellet.\nDilute PBMCs to 5 x 107 cells/mL in selection buffer and transfer them to a 5 mL of polystyrene round-bottom tube (12 x 75 mm).\nAdd 50 µL of antibody cocktail per 1 mL of sample, and mix gently. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nImmediately before use, vortex magnetic particles for 30 sec on high speed. Add 50 µL of magnetic particles per 1 mL of sample to the tube containing PBMCs, and mix gently.\nBring the volume up to 2.5 mL with selection buffer and mix gently. Place the tube (without lid) into the magnet, and incubate at RT for 2.5 min.\nPick up the magnet, and in a continuous motion, invert the magnet and tube to pour the enriched cell suspension into a new sterile tube.\nTo increase recovery, add 2.5 mL of selection buffer to the tube remaining in the magnet, without disturbing the immobilized beads. Keep in the magnet for another 2.5 min, and repeat step 2.6 to recover additional cells.\nTake an aliquot for viable cell counting using trypan blue. Calculate the total cell number using a hemocytometer or cell counter.\nConfirm the purity by flow cytometry (Figure 3).\n3. Chemical activation\nAdjust CD4+CD45RO+ T cells to 5 x 106 cells/mL with warm RP10F medium, and distribute cells into culture dishes of the desired size. Rest cells in a humidified 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator overnight.\nPellet rested cells by centrifugation at 400 x g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and tap the bottom of tube to loosen the cell pellet.",
    "Adjust cell concentration to 5 x 106 cells/mL with warm RP10F medium, and distribute 0.5‒1 x 107 cells into each of three sterile, screw-cap tubes.\n\tNOTE: If sufficient cells are available, duplicate stimulations or additional time points may be included in the experimental design.\nStimulate cells in tubes 2 and 3 with PMA and A23187. Add PMA to 25 ng/mL and A23187 to 500 ng/mL and mix gently. Add an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the cells in tube 1 that will serve as a vehicle (control). For instance, if using 1 µL of PMA and 1 µL of A23187, then add 2 µL of DMSO to the vehicle tube. Keep the final concentration of DMSO below 0.5% in all tubes.\nLoosen the caps on the tubes, and return cells to the 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h (tube 2) and 6 h (tubes 1 and 3). At the indicated time, centrifuge cells at 500 x g for 10 min.\nPrior to lysis, discard as much of the supernatant as possible, without disturbing the cell pellet.\nPromptly lyse the cells, as directed by instructions from the commercially available RNA isolation kit (see Table of Materials). Proceed with RNA isolation, or freeze the lysate at -80 °C to process later with additional samples.\n\tNOTE: RNA purity and integrity may be verified using microcapillary electrophoresis.\nOptional: To completely remove all traces of DNA from the purified RNA sample, use RNA clean up kit (see Table of Materials), according to manufacturer’s instructions."
