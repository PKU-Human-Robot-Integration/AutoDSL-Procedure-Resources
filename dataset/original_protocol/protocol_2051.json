    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting of spermatogonial stem cells\nTiming: 6 h\nSpermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are able to self-renew and differentiate, two characteristics of tissue stem cells (Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). During these processes, SSCs change their cellular states progressively, thus generating a heterogeneous population of SSCs that possess varied gene expression and functionalities (Hermann et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Shami et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Guo et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). To understand the regulatory mechanisms of SSC self-renewal and differentiation, it is essential to isolate SSCs at their distinctive cellular states (La et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). The following protocol describes experimental steps taken to isolate sub-populations of SSCs via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), using a transgenic (Og2) mouse line that expresses GFP under the control of Pou5f1 promoter (Yoshimizu et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]; Yeom et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]) and marker protein cKIT. Pou5f1 encodes the stem cell marker OCT4 and cKIT is a marker for differentiating SSCs, thus GFPHcKIT-, GFPHcKIT+ and GFPLcKIT+ can be used to represent SSCs at varied proliferating and differentiating states (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1643-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Note each round spermatid contains a single dark particle (the chromatoid body) adjacent to the nucleus.",
    "Enzymatic digestion of testicular cells.\nThe enzymatic digestion of testicular cells is modified from previously published method (Bellve, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Prepare three 35-mm dishes, each containing 2 mL DMEM basic media; one 35-mm dish containing 2 mL DMEM basic media with 2 mg/mL Collagenase IV and 5 μg/mL DNase I, pre-warm media for 30–60 min in a 37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO2.\nSacrifice four male juvenile mice (10–12-dpp) or one adult mouse (2–3-month) by cervical dislocation after anesthetization with CO2.\nSterilize abdomen using 70% ethanol, open the abdominal cavity with micro-dissecting scissors and tweezers.\nDissect testes with tweezers and scissors, place testes in pre-warmed DMEM basic media, remove tunica albuginea, dismantle seminiferous tubules and remove attached blood vessels as much as possible. Wash seminiferous tubules by moving them through dishes containing clean DMEM basic media.\nTransfer cleaned seminiferous tubules to the dish containing media with Collagenase IV and DNase I, mince seminiferous tubules with a micro-dissecting scissor into small pieces, incubate the dish in the 37°C incubator for 10 min, disperse cells once by pipetting up and down gently.\nAdd 20 μL Trypsin (50 mg/mL stock), continue incubation for another 15 min, pipet gently to dissociate cells every 5 min.\nCritical: The timing of Trypsin digestion is not constant, partly due to the number of testes processed at one time and the age of mice. Insufficient digestion will reduce the yield of spermatogenic cells, whereas excessive digestion will increase cell mortality. Depending on the actual situation, incubation can be stopped when no observable tubule pieces are found.\nNote: Clean scissors and tweezers with 70% ethanol between mice during dissection, wash seminiferous tubules free of hair before transferring them into enzyme-containing media.",
    "Filter dispersed cells into a 50-mL Corning tube through a 40-μm cell strainer, collect cells by centrifugation at 150 × g, 4°C, for 10 min, using a refrigerated table-top centrifuge.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cell pellets with 2 mL HBSS, count cell numbers with a hemacytometer, centrifuge again at 400 × g, 4°C, for 5 min.\nResuspend cells in HBSS containing 5% FBS to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL.\nNote: Throughout the protocol, cell washing steps are referring to repeated centrifugation and resuspension of cells in desired buffer. Cells are usually spun down at 400 × g, 4°C, 5 min, unless otherwise indicated. After discarding supernatants, cells are resuspended with 1 mL buffer and incubated for 5 min on ice.\nFACS of sub-populations of SSCs troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDisperse testicular cells from four 10-day old Og2 mice as described in step 1.\nPlace 1 mL dispersed cells (2 × 106) in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 2 μL eFluor 780-conjugated anti-cKIT antibody (1:500), incubate 45 min on ice in dark (wrap tubes in tinfoil).\nNote: Resuspending cells once with a pipette during antibody incubation will help to fully conjugate antibodies to cells.\nWash cells once with 1 mL ice-cold HBSS.\nSpin down cells and resuspend stained cells in 1 mL HBSS containing 5% FBS.\nOptional: Before sorting, cell suspension can be filtered through 40-μm strainer again to remove cell clumps and thereby to avoid plugging during sorting process.\nTurn on the accelerated cell sorting system MoFlo XDP Cell Sorter 30 min before running samples, adjust sheath stream and laser alignment.",
    "Run 5000–10,000 cells, set gate-1 (R1) in FSC-Area/SSC-Area to exclude cell debris and aggregates, set gate-2 (R2) in FSC-Height/FSC-Area to exclude non-single cell clusters. Apply excitation/emission at 488 nm/507 nm for GFP and 647 nm/780 nm for cKIT, respectively. Set gate-3 to 5 (R3 to R5) using green and red signals that separate labeled cells on X and Y axis of the contour plot (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). Collect sample cells and examine them under a fluorescent microscope.\nRun all cells using the same gating parameters to sort out GFPHcKIT-, GFPHcKIT+ and GFPLcKIT+ SSCs.\nCollect sorted cells into 5-mL Falcon tubes containing 1 mL HBSS, centrifuge cells at 700 × g, 4°C, 5 min.\nProceed to steps 13 or 17–19 for analyses of proteostasis in SSCs. Alternatively, discard supernatant, store cells at −80°C for subsequent RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR.\nOptional: Before store cells at −80°C, adding 1 mL TRIzol reagent into cells is beneficial for maintaining RNA stability.\nNote: It is advised to proceed for RNA preparation right after cell sorting to ensure the quality and preservation of messenger RNAs.\nPause point: Cells can be stored at −80°C for up to one month.\nVelocity sedimentation of spermatocytes and haploid spermatids\nTiming: 1 day\nMeiotic and post-meiotic spermatogenic cells (a.k.a. spermatids) represent major cell populations in adult testes. Although some specific marker proteins are available, cell sorting methods using FACS may not be suitable for obtaining large quantity of haploid cells for biochemical analyses. In this step, we describe the conventional method that has been developed in the past to separate spermatocytes and haploid spermatids (Bellve, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). This step can be combined with the fluorescence activated cell sorting of SSCs to comprehensively characterize spermatogenic cells at various developmental stages.\nVelocity sedimentation at unit gravity with BSA gradient troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Make 200 mL 2% and 200 mL 4% BSA in HBSS.\nUse 150 mL of each BSA solution to prepare 300 mL 2%–4% consecutive BSA gradient using a gradient mixer. This usually takes about 1 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: Air bubbles can damage the consecutive gradient of BSA. They should be avoided by filling the plastic pipeline with 2% BSA solutions gently before preparing the gradient. Although DMEM basic media or HBSS is used for enzyme digestion of testicular cells, EKRB buffer can also be used. Cell viability should be examined by Trypan Blue staining after cell collections. Using this method, we routinely obtain viable cells above 90%. 1× PBS was sometimes used during velocity sedimentation when collected cells are processed for subsequent biochemical analyses immediately or short-term experiments, however, it is suggested to avoid usage of PBS in order to better maintain cell viability.\nNote: Autoclave BSA solutions to sterilize in order to use testicular cells for further experimentation, including transient cell culture.\nNote: Bottoms of 2% and 4% BSA chambers should be placed higher than the upper limit of BSA gradient in the sedimentation chamber.\nDisperse testicular cells from 2 adult male mice as described in step 1.\nResuspend cells in 10 mL HBSS, slowly lay cells on top of the BSA gradient, stand for 2.5 h at RT.\nManually collect cell fractions into 15-mL Corning tubes, 5 mL/per tube.\nExamine spermatocytes, round and elongating spermatids using a light microscope (EVOSfl), according to their cellular morphologies.\nPool fractions containing the same cell types together for further experimentation.",
    "Note: Depending on the volume of BSA gradient and number of testicular cells used, collected fractions containing spermatocytes, round and elongated spermatids may vary from time to time. Fractions to pool together should be determined each time by examining cells under a light microscope. The most abundant cells fractioned from adult mice using the velocity sedimentation at unit gravity are usually spermatocytes and spermatids. Pachytene spermatocytes (SPCY I) contain large nuclei with a thin rim of cytoplasm, whereas spermatocytes at meiotic II (SPCY II) are smaller and come in fractions after pachytene spermatocytes. Round spermatids are smaller and have circular morphology with a distinctive dark particle (the Chromatoid body) next to the nucleus, whereas elongating spermatids have oval shaped nuclei with overlaying hooked tips. Residue bodies that are shed from maturing sperm usually come in the last few fractions and are difficult to separate from elongated spermatids due to their similar sizes. These can be discarded if more pure fractions of spermatids are required for subsequent experiments. Spermatogonial stem cells are difficult to obtain using BSA gradient due to their scarce content. Representative images of fractionated cells are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D (Xu et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1643-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(F) Representative confocal images of immunocytochemistry and Giemsa staining showing spermatocytes at different meiotic stages. Images adapted and modified from (Zou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).\nAnalytical flow cytometry of spermatogenic cells\nTiming: 5 h\nSpermatogenic cells can be analyzed without collecting them. Protocol described here is modified from a previous method (Bastos et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), using the varied contents of DNA in spermatogenic cells at different developmental stages. Comparing to wild type mice, this step can provide a glance at whether genetically modified mice are compromised in the process of spermatogenesis.\nFlow cytometry of testicular cells.\nPrepare testicular cell suspensions as described in step 1.\nPlace 1 mL single cell suspension in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube (2 × 106 cells).\nAdd Hoechst 33342 at a concentration of 10 μg/mL, wrap the tube with tinfoil to avoid light, incubate in a 32°C water bath for 20 min.\nWash cells once with 1 mL HBSS, resuspend cells in 1 mL HBSS containing 5% FBS and 2 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI), incubate 10 min.\nWash cells once with 1 mL HBSS, resuspend cells in 1 mL HBSS containing 5% FBS.\nNote: Due to the integrity of plasma membrane, live cells are not stained by PI, which can be used to discriminate live and dead cells.\nTurn on LSRFortessa 30 min prior to use. Run 5000–10,000 cells, set gate-1 in FSC-A/SSC-A to exclude cell debris and aggregates, set gate-2 in PI/FSC-A to exclude PI+ cells, set gate-3 in Hoechst Red/Hoechst Blue contour plot to exclude cell debris and clusters for PI- cells. Run cells using Hoechst Red/ Hoechst Blue. Collect data for further analyses.\nHaploid spermatids can be distinguished by their DNA contents. Round and elongating spermatids can be further separated using forward scattering (FSC) parameter according to their sizes.",
    "Flow cytometry data are processed using FlowJo software, the ratios of 2N spermatogonia, 4N spermatocytes and 1N spermatids in total testicular cells can be calculated accordingly. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Testicular cells stained with Hoechst 33342 can be divided into six populations, including spermatogonia, diploid cells, pre-leptotene to leptotene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes, MII spermatocytes and haploid spermatids (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nAnalytical flow cytometry of spermatogonial stem cells\nTiming: 7 h\nIt is desired that sometimes SSCs are analyzed for their compositions of various sub-populations without isolating them using flow cytometry.\nFlow cytometry analyses of spermatogonial stem cells.\nTo analyze SSC sub-populations, use wild-type mice to disperse testicular cells as described in step 1. Chill 1× PBS on ice.\nTransfer 2 × 106 dispersed testicular cells (1 mL) into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube, centrifuge at 400 × g, 4°C, 5 min.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), incubate on ice for 30 min.\nWash cells once with 1 mL 1× PBS, then incubate cells in 1 mL 1× PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice for 15 min.\nWash cells once with 1 mL 1× PBS, resuspend cells in 1 mL 1× PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nSpin down cells, resuspend cell pellet with 0.5 mL 1× PBST (1× PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100, freshly made), add 2.5 μL PE-conjugated anti-PLZF (1:200) and 1 μL eFluor 780-conjugated anti-cKIT (1:500), wrap tubes with tin-foil, incubate on ice for 60 min.\nNote: Gently pipetting cells up and down to mix them once during incubation helps to conjugate antibodies to cells.\nWash cells three times, with 1 mL 1× PBS, 10 min on ice each time.",
    "Spin down cells at 400 × g, 4°C, 5 min, discard supernatant, resuspend cells in 0.5 mL 1× PBST, run ∼5000 cells first to select gating parameters as described in step 2g on LSRFortessa.\nApplying excitation/emission at 507 nm/561 nm for PLZF and 647 nm/780 nm for cKIT, respectively.\nFlow cytometry data are processed by FlowJo software.\nNote: PLZF is a marker for proliferating SSCs and cKIT is a marker for differentiating SSCs. PLZFHcKIT-, PLZFHcKIT+ and PLZFLcKIT+ can be used to represent proliferating, early differentiating and late differentiating SSCs, respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Other marker proteins that have suitable antibodies for fluorescently staining SSCs can also be applied for analyses of SSC subpopulations using this protocol.\nQuantitative RT-PCR of gene expression in spermatogonial stem cells\nTiming: 1.5 days\nChanges of gene expression often precede changes of cellular states during development. Although current high throughput technologies, such as single cell RNA sequencing, have helped to unveil the dynamic changes of gene expression of developing cells, they sometimes are not practical for the analysis of individual genes. In this step, we describe procedures that would allow absolute quantitation of mRNA copy numbers of specific genes in sub-populations of SSCs, using Rpl39l as an example. This can be used as a quality control of sorted SSCs, as well as to characterize unknown genes in SSC sub-populations.\nTotal RNA extraction from sorted SSC sub-populations.\nFollowing step 2, extract total RNAs from sorted cells using RNAsimple ToTal RNA Kit. Also prepare total RNA from testes of a juvenile mouse using the same kit (https://en.tiangen.com/content/details_68_4278.html[href=https://en.tiangen.com/content/details_68_4278.html]).\nDissolve RNAs in RNase-free ddH2O, determine RNA concentrations via spectrophotometry.\nGeneration of standard curve of gene expression troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Set up reverse transcription using total RNA from the juvenile mouse in a 0.5-mL Eppendorf tube. We used AMV reverse transcriptase for the RT reaction, other reverse transcriptase such as SuperScript IV can also be used.\nSet up PCR reaction using gene specific primers accordingly, use high-fidelity Taq DNA polymerase or equivalent DNA polymerase. This PCR reaction generates control samples for constructing the standard curve of a specific gene.\nSubject PCR products to agarose gel electrophoresis.\nExcise gel strips containing the PCR products under UV light.\nPurify DNA fragments using TIANgel Midi Purification Kit (https://en.tiangen.com/content/details_69_5485.html[href=https://en.tiangen.com/content/details_69_5485.html]).\nDetermine concentrations of purified DNAs using spectrophotometry, calculate copy numbers according to the molecular weight of DNA: copies/μL = (6.02 × 1023 copies/mol) × (ng/μL (DNA concentration) × 10−9)/(bp (DNA length) × 660 gram/mol.\nMake 10× dilutions of a series DNA templates as: 2 × 107, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 copies/μL, set up PCR reactions as following:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1643_7.csv\nRun PCR on a CFX96 Real-Time system as following:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1643_8.csv\nDraw standard curves using DNA copy numbers vs. CT values, using equation: copy number of Rpl39l = 2 × 10(37.46-CT)/3.595.\nNote: A linear relationship between DNA copy numbers and CT values can be established, in which higher DNA copy numbers correspond to lower CT values.\nDetermination of mRNA copy numbers of a specific gene in SSCs using quantitative RT-PCR.\nSet up reverse transcription reaction using total RNAs from sorted SSC sub-populations following steps 7a and 7b.\nUse 1 μL RT samples to run quantitative PCR reactions following steps 7i and 7j.\nCalculate mRNA copy numbers according to the CT values using the standard curve.\nCritical: Manipulation of RNA-containing samples and materials should be carried out on a clean bench and use RNase-free Eppendorf tubes and pipette tips.\nImmunocytochemistry of spermatocytes undergoing meiotic cell division",
    "Timing: 2 days\nDuring meiosis, chromosomes in spermatogenic cells, namely spermatocytes, undergo one round of DNA replication and two consecutive rounds of cell division. Changes of chromosomal states, such as their morphology and the distribution of specific DNA binding proteins, allow the identification of spermatocytes at different meiotic stages. This is important for studies of genes that play regulatory roles during meiosis. This step describes procedures for quantifying the progression of meiotic cell cycle, using chromosomal spread of testicular cells, as well as immuno-staining of cell nuclei (Evans et al., 1964[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Peters et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). In particular, SYCP3 that decorates chromosomal synaptonemal complex and γH2AX that localizes to XY chromosomal pairing are used for immunofluorescent staining of meiotic cells and classifying stages of meiotic cell cycle (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).\nImmuno-staining of spermatocytes with anti-SYCP3 and anti-γH2AX.\nDissect out testes from adult mice following steps 1a–1d.\nTransfer 15-cm long seminiferous tubules into a 35-mm dish containing 1 mL hypotonic solution, incubate at RT for 1 h.\nTransfer 3-cm long seminiferous tubules into a 40-μL drop of 100 mM sucrose solution on a glass slide, tear the tubule into small pieces with two fine-tipped tweezers.\nPipet up and down to release testicular cells onto the glass slide with a 20-μL pipette-man.\nWet 18 mm × 18 mm cover glass slides by dipping them in fixation buffer.\nTransfer a drop of cell suspension (20 μL) onto the upper left corner of a cover slide, slowly spread cells first in the horizontal direction then in the vertical direction by tilling the slide with hand in a swirling motion.\nProcess the rest of seminiferous tubules following steps c–f.\nCritical: Spreading cells evenly on the cover glasses is important for thoroughly fixing cells at an appropriate density.",
    "Note: Hypotonic solution helps to avoid contamination of blood cells attached to the tubules and dissociation of testicular cells.\nDry cover glasses in a moist chamber (a plastic box containing a layer of water) for 2 h, RT.\nWash cover glasses twice by incubating them in 2 mL 0.4% Photo-Flo 200 solution, 3 min each time. Photo-Flo solution helps to clear the cover glasses for better visualization under confocal microscope.\nPlace cover glasses in 6-well plates, block cells with 1 mL 2% BSA/PBST for 2 h at RT.\nRemove blocking buffer, add 1 mL 1% BSA/PBST containing anti-SYCP3 (1:400) and anti-γH2AX (1:500), incubate overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.\nOptional: Turn slides up-side down during incubation with antibodies can reduce volumes of solution used and thus save antibodies (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nWash cover glasses the next morning three times by incubating them in 2 mL 1× PBST, 10 min each time.\nAdd 1 mL 1% BSA/PBST containing appropriate fluorescein-tagged secondary antibodies (1:1000), wrap 6-well plate in tinfoil, incubate for 1 h, RT.\nWash cover glasses three times with 1× PBST, 2 mL, 10 min each time, then mount cover glasses onto slides in 50% glycerol/PBST.\nExamine slides under a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM), take images covering at least 500 spermatocytes.\nGiemsa staining of chromosomes.\nDissect out testes from adult mice following steps 1a–1d.\nTransfer 6-cm long seminiferous tubules into a 35-mm dish containing 1.5 mL isotonic sodium citrate (2.2%).\nSqueeze out spermatogenic cells from seminiferous tubules with tweezers.\nCollect cells by centrifuge at 100 × g, RT, 5 min, discard supernatant, resuspend cells in 1.5 mL hypotonic sodium citrate (1%), mix and incubate cells at RT for 12 min.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 100 × g, RT, 5 min, discard supernatant, resuspend cells in 0.5 mL fixation buffer made of 74% ethanol, 25% acetic acid and 1% chloroform, mix and incubate cells at RT for 5 min. Repeat once.\nAdd 10-μL drop of cell suspensions onto glass slides, air dry.\nStain cells with Giemsa diluted in ddH2O (1:20) for 30 min at RT.\nWash slides under gently flowing water for 10–20 s, air dry slides.\nCritical: Check the intensity of Giemsa under a light microscope during washing every 5 s helps to acquire staining with clear and appropriate intensities.\nNote: Sodium citrate is an alkalinizing reagent that can help to chelate Ca2+ and helps to dissociate tubules for release of spermatogenic cells, may also prevent blood cells from clotting on the tubules.\nSeal slides with neutral balsam.\nExamine stained cells under a light microscope equipped with a CCD camera, take adequate images that include at least 1000 mid-pachytene nuclei.\nCounting spermatocytes at various stages of meiotic cell cycle.\nFor prophase I spermatocytes, from confocal images, count cells with distinct SCYP3 and γH2AX staining patterns to distinguish cells at leptotene, zygotene, pachytene and diplotene stages. Calculate percentages of spermatocytes as: Number of spermatocytes at a particular stage/Total number of all spermatocytes counted X 100%.\nFor meiosis I (MI) and meiosis II (MII) spermatocytes, from Giemsa stained images, count cells with distinct chromosome morphology in defined areas that contain 1000 nuclei at mid-pachytene stage. Calculate the ratio of MII/MI spermatocytes, which reflects the progression of meiosis I to meiosis II.",
    "Note: Prophase I spermatocytes can be distinguished by the appearance of chromosomes in their nuclei when stained for SCYP3 and γH2AX, the markers for synaptonemal complex formation. For example, leptotene spermatocytes have diffused distribution of SCYP3 in nuclei, zygotene spermatocytes have thin thread of SCYP3 formed and γH2AX foci start to form, pachytene spermatocytes have thick strings of SCYP3 and a clear XY body decorated with γH2AX, whereas diplotene spermatocytes have SCYP3 positive threads with separated crosses, γH2AX positive XY body is still present at this stage. MI and MII spermatocytes have no nuclear envelopes and contain condensed intact homologous chromosomes and thinner sister chromatids, respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nIn vivo and in vitro labeling of nascent proteins in spermatogenic cells\nTiming: 5 days\nIn vivo labeling of nascent proteins facilitates the study of how different cell types of a tissue express cell’s functional units, proteins. In this step, we describe methods for in vivo labeling of nascent proteins in mouse testis using intraperitoneally injected puromycin, as well as in vitro labeling of nascent proteins in transiently cultured spermatogenic cells that are dispersed from mouse testes (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1643-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Unfolded proteins are often degraded through proteasome or lysosome systems, of which the former recognizes poly-ubiquitinated proteins. Thus, expression of molecular chaperones and protein ubiquitination indicate protein quality control and turnover of cellular proteomes.
