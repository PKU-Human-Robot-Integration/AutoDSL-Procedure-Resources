    "All experiments were performed in accordance with the EU directives on the protection of animals for scientific purposes and with permission from the Ethical Commission of the Faculty of Biology, University of Belgrade (approval number EK-BF-2016/08). Regarding patient material (sera for IgGs), it was collected for routine clinical examination with informed patient's consent in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. The protocol was approved by the Ethics committee of the Clinical Center of Serbia (No. 850/6).\n1. Primary cell culture preparation\nBrain tissue isolation\n\tNOTE: Isolation should be performed on ice, using ice cold solutions.\n\t\nUse newborn pups 1-3 days old for primary neonatal cell culture33.\n\t\tNOTE: For the study presented here, Sprague Dawley hSOD1G93A and non-transgenic rats were used. For genotyping, rat tails were used for later DNA extraction and PCR.\nSprinkle the pup's head with 70% ethanol and immediately decapitate it fast using scissors.\nCut open the skin using small-angled scissors to expose the skull. Open the skull by making a cut from the foramen magnum toward the orbits. Next, make a perpendicular midline cut. Remove the brain from the skull and place it in a Petri dish containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\tNOTE: Clean the tools between pups to prevent cross-contamination between transgenic and non-transgenic pups. Isolation of the cortices from the rest of the brain should be done under a stereomicroscope.\nUsing the tip of the forceps, tear the connections between both hemispheres. Then, separate the hemispheres with curved forceps by gently pushing a hemisphere from the center to the side.\nRemove the meninges by carefully tearing them with straight and curved forceps.\nRemove the hippocampus by pinching it with a curved forceps. Discard the hippocampus or use it for another cell culture preparation.",
    "NOTE: Further steps should be performed under the laminar flow hood to ensure sterile conditions.\nTissue homogenization and dissociation\n\t\nTransfer one cortex into a 15 mL tube filled with 3 mL of cold PBS. Pipet the suspension up and down with a 1 mL tip, completing 10-15 strokes until the suspension becomes homogeneous.\n\t\tNOTE: Be very cautious not to produce bubbles in this process.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of cold PBS by pipetting it up and down with a 1 mL tip. Repeat the centrifugation step.\n\t\tNOTE: All solutions used from this point should be prewarmed to 37 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Transfer the homogenate to a 2 mL tube.\nPass the homogenate through 21 G and 23 G needles (three times each) to make a suspension of single cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Be very cautious not to produce bubbles in this process.\nPour the cell suspension prepared from one cortex into a 60 mm diameter Petri dish or a T25 flask (with the surface pretreated with a polypeptide coating for the growth of adherent cells) containing 3 mL of complete DMEM. Lightly shake the Petri dish so that the suspension is uniformly distributed.\nGrow the cells in the incubator in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C.\nChange the medium 48 h after isolation and replace the medium every 3 days.\nTo promote astrocyte growth, when cells reach 70%-80% confluency, wash them with prewarmed PBS to remove the loosely attached glial cells and traces of FBS in the medium.",
    "Trypsinize the underlying layer of astrocytes by adding 1 mL of prewarmed trypsin solution (0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in PBS, sterile-filtered).\nPlace the dish in the incubator at 37 °C for 2-5 min.\nCheck the cells under the microscope. When they start to detach, add 4 mL of complete DMEM.\nCollect the cell suspension and transfer it to a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of complete medium. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\nReplate the cells at a density of 104 cells/cm2 in 5 mL of fresh complete DMEM.\nChange the medium every 3 days. To minimize the presence of other glial cell types, after astrocytes reach 50% confluence and prior to each media replacement, wash the cells with complete DMEM.\n\t\nAspirate the supernatant medium with a 1 mL pipette and gently dispense it onto the layer of cells several times. Ensure that the whole surface of the cell layer is covered during this washing step.\nOnce the cells reach 80% confluence (usually after 14 days), repeat the trypsinization and the collection of astrocytes as described in step 1.6.\nSeed 5 × 103 of astrocytes on a 7 mm circular glass coverslip coated with poly-L-lysine (50 µg/mL). Use them in experiments after 48 h.\nTo promote microglia, after step 1.7, allow the glial cells to reach a confluent layer34. When microglial cells appear on top of the astrocyte layer (after 10-15 days, recognized by their smaller, more oval bodies and shorter processes), shake the Petri dish on an orbital shaker for 2 h at 220 rpm.\nDispersing and seeding microglial cells",
    "Lightly wash the detached and loosely attached cells by aspirating the supernatant medium with a 1 mL pipette tip and gently dispense it onto the layer of cells several times. Be sure to cover the whole surface of the cell layer during this washing step, collect the medium with the detached cells, and transfer it to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of medium.\nPass the cell suspension through a 21 G needle to obtain a single-cell suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: Most published methods use trypsin or papain to dissociate the tissue; however, 21 G needles have the advantage of preventing the overdigestion of cells, allowing for a gentler dissociation.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer. Seed 5 × 103 microglial cells on a 7 mm circular glass coverslip coated with poly-L-lysine (50 µg/mL). Use them in experiments after 48 h.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is difficult to obtain a pure microglial culture by shaking, since the oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes may still be present in a variable number depending on the experimenter's experience. The immunocytochemical protocol used to estimate the presence of different cell populations in glial cultures has been described elsewhere35.\n2. Immunocytochemistry\nRinse the cells plated on coverslips in PBS, 2 x 1 min.\nFix the cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature (RT).\nWash in PBS 3 x 5 min.\nIncubate in a blocking solution containing 10% normal donkey serum (NDS)/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.1% Triton X-100 for 45 min at RT.\n\t\nAdd 50 µL of a blocking solution per 10 mm diameter coverslip.",
    "Prepare primary antibodies in 1% NDS/1% BSA/0.1% TritonX-100 in the following dilutions: mouse anti-GFAP 1:300, goat anti-Iba1 1:500. Incubate the cells with primary antibodies overnight at +4 °C.\nRinse in PBS, 3 x 10 min.\nIncubate with the secondary antibodies conjugated with a fluorophore: donkey anti-mouse (excitation 488 nm [1:200)) or donkey anti-goat (excited at 647 nm [1:200)). Incubate the cells for 2 h at RT in the dark.\nWash in PBS, 7 x 5 min.\nIncubate the cells with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:4,000) for 10 min at RT.\nWash in PBS 5 x 5 min.\nMount the coverslips on microscope slides using a mounting solution; use one drop of it per coverslip.\n\tNOTE: Antibody dilutions may vary depending on the producer. Users must determine optimal dilutions for their experiments.\n3. Time-lapse video imaging\nNOTE: Solutions containing the fluorescent dye should be protected from direct light. Before starting the imaging experiment, make sure that the glass coverslip does not move when turning on the perfusion.\nPreparation of solutions and cells\n\t\nPrepare extracellular solution (ECS) for imaging: 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCal2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, and 10 mM HEPES. Adjust the pH to 7.4. Ensure that the osmolarity is 280-300 mOsm/kg and prepare ECS without Ca2+: 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.1 mM EGTA.\nPrepare the test solutions: 100 µM ATP dissolved in ECS, 1 µM Thg in ECS without Ca2+, and 0.1 mg/mL ALS IgG in ECS8.\nTransfer one coverslip to a dish with ECS to wash out the complete DMEM. Prepare the dye loading solution by diluting 1 mM stock solution of Fluo-4 AM with ECS to the final concentration of 5 µM Fluo-4 AM.",
    "Place the coverslip with cells in the dye loading solution for 30 min at RT in the dark. Wash the cells in ECS for 20 min.\nIf cells are not adequately loaded (i.e., if the basal level of fluorescence is too low-<5% of the dynamic range of the camera with exposure time greater than 400 ms), increase the loading time to up to 45 min to 1 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, mix the Fluo-4 AM stock solution with an equal volume of 20% (w/v) detergent (Pluronic) in DMSO before diluting in ECS, making the final Pluronic concentration ~0.02%.\n\t\tNOTE: The experimental examples of this study were performed with human IgG isolated from ALS patients' blood sera as described previously4,5,11. Each experiment was performed with IgG samples of a single patient.\nVideo imaging\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, the Video Imaging System was combined with a xenon short arc lamp, a polychromator system, and an inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with water, glycerin, and oil immersion objective. Timelapse imaging was performed using a Digital Camera System.\n\t\nSwitch on the components of the imaging setup 15 min before the experiment to allow the system to reach the working temperature.\nPlace the coverslip in the recording chamber with 1 mL of working solution (ECS or ECS without Ca2+).\nTo choose the correct imaging protocol, open the imaging software and in the Acquisition panel, choose the filter pairs for Fluo4-AM with an excitation wavelength at 480 nm, a dichroic mirror at 505 nm, and an emission wavelength at 535 nm.",
    "Choose the field of view taking care to have a consistent number of cells throughout the experiment. Adjust the exposure time and detector gain appropriately, in such a manner that the signal is not saturated. Choose the pseudocolor mode for acquisition. For more detailed instructions, refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer.\nAdjust the sampling rate to 1 Hz (1 frame per second).\nStart the imaging by acquiring the basal level of fluorescence for 3-5 min for the baseline determination (F0). Ensure a constant flow of the working solution.\nStop the flow of the working solution and switch to the test solution for the desired length of time (also see time bars in examples of Figure 2 and Figure 3). Between each test solution, wash the cells with a constant flow of the working solution for 3-5 min.\nKeep the solution volume in the recording chamber at ~1 mL by arranging a constant suction from the top of the solution (see Figure 2E).\n\t\t​NOTE: To apply the treatment directly to the imaged cells, a customized delivery system made of a glass pipette (0.8 mm inner diameter) was positioned ~350 µm away and ~1 mm above the cells, at an angle of 45° combined with the solution exchange system containing pinch valves and an electronic valve controller (see Figure 2E).\n4. Data analysis\nDefine a region of interest (ROI) that corresponds to the individual cell.\n\t\nChoose the frame with the highest signal intensity (i.e., from the application of ATP) and encircle one cell by using the application Polygonal Tool. Repeat for all the cells in the acquired field. Choose five ROIs in the background using the Circle Tool.",
    "To measure the mean signal intensity of a single cell and the background for each time frame, select all ROIs and use the Multi Measure command in ROI Manager in ImageJ or any equivalent command in commercial software (see the Table of Materials).\nExport the mean signal intensity values of the ROIs as a spreadsheet.\nAverage five background ROIs and subtract the averaged background of each frame from the mean ROI intensity of the frame acquired at the same time.\nTo normalize the obtained data to the baseline signal, use equation (1):\n\tΔF/F0 = (F - F0)/F0   (1)\n\twhere F is the signal intensity of each time frame after background subtraction, and F0 is the baseline Fluo-4 fluorescence.\n\tNOTE: A custom-made code was used in this study.\nTo analyze calcium activity, determine several parameters4: the amplitude of the calcium peak (ΔF/F0), the integrated change (time integral, surface under the response recording) of the calcium transient (ΔF/F0 × s), time-to-peak-elapsed time from the onset of stimulation to the maximum of calcium transient (s), rise time-time elapsed from the onset of the stimulation to the value of ΔF/F0 that reaches 50%-80% of the maximal amplitude (s), half-width-full width of a transient at half-maximal amplitude (s), frequency of responses if they are repetitive (Hz).\nSubscription Required.
