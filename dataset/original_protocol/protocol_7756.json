    "CultivationCultivate for 4-5 days algae strains or species on TAP medium (Harris, 1989) under continuous light of 60 μmol/m2/s and a temperature of 23 °C ± 0.1 °C in a Phytotron GC 400 growth chamber to the end of exponential and early stationary phase of growth.Check under the microscope whether cell culture is not contaminated.Count cell number under the microscope using Bürker chamber.Centrifuge certain volume (depending on the cell density, counted in step A-3) of cell suspension at 1,200 x g by RT, resuspend in Sager-Granick medium or other appropriate medium, so to get 10 ml of cell suspension with a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml for every sample.Temperature treatmentKeep 10 ml cell culture with a density 1 x 106 cells/ml in an incubator under continuous shaking, at different temperatures: t = 39 °C for 30 min t = 42 °С for 5 min t = 45 °С for 5 min Notes: The same heating procedure could be done in a circulating water bath at the same three temperatures: t = 39 °С for 30 min, t = 42 °С for 5 min, and t = 45 °С for 5 min.Use 50 ml flasks to comply with the requirement that volume of the cell culture must be not more than 1/3 of the volume of the flask.Place on ice to stop the heating process.For HSP70B analysis keep cells for 2 and 4 h after the step II-2 at t = 23 °C ± 0.1 °C to allow cells to recover. Centrifuge 10 ml cell suspension at 1,200 x g for 5 min."
