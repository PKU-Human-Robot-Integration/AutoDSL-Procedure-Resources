    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell preparation and actin staining\nTiming: 2–3 days for cell culture, staining 1 h (for steps 1 to 3)\nWe refer to the fluorescence image to choose the scanning area for the Nanoendoscopy-AFM. In this protocol, the target structure is an actin filament. Therefore, we stain the actin filament using a chemical dye. This step varies depending on the experiment, and different fluorescent dyes or fluorescent protein-expressing cells can also be used. The following steps describe the procedure for chemical staining using the acting-binding fluorescent dye (SiR-Actin kit, CY-SC001, Cytoskeleton). The protocols follow the datasheet of the products (https://www.cytoskeleton.com/pdf-storage/datasheets/cy-sc001.pdf[href=https://www.cytoskeleton.com/pdf-storage/datasheets/cy-sc001.pdf]).\nCritical: The SiR-Actin is based on jasplakinolide, which inhibits actin depolymerization.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] Therefore, treatment with excess SiR-Actin should be avoided because it decreases actin dynamics.\nPreparation of cells.\nSeed 0.1–5 × 104 BALB/3T3 cells on a 35 mm low-height glass-bottomed dish in culture medium.\nNote: This step should be performed in a biohazard safety cabinet.\nCulture cells in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2 days.\nNote: Nanoendoscopy-AFM imaging is easier when the cell height in the target area is low. Therefore, cells such as fibroblasts are relatively easy to measure because they are usually spread out and thin.\nNote: Cultivate the appropriate number of cells so that they do not touch each other, but multiple cells are visible in the field of view (cell density range: 0.4–2 × 104 cells/cm2).\nNote: We use a low dish (μ-Dish 35 mm low Glass Bottom, ibidi) because a tall dish has a risk of contact with the AFM head when the cantilever reaches the bottom.\nStaining cells.\nPrepare 1 mM SiR-Actin stock solution by dissolving the reagent in anhydrous Dimethyl sulfoxide.",
    "Prepare a staining solution by adding a 1:1000 volume of 1 mM SiR-actin stock solution to the culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin).\nChange the cell culture medium to the staining solution in the safety cabinet and incubate in a CO2 incubator for 0.5–1 h.\nChange the medium to Leibovitz L-15 supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nChecking the fluorescence.\nTurn on the inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse Ti2, Nikon) equipped with the EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 888, Andor).\nSelect the Cy5 filter (excitation 620/60, dichroic 660, barrier 700/75).\nAdjust the excitation intensities and exposure times to avoid photobleach and phototoxicity (laser power: 1%–10%, exposure time: < 100 ms).\nTake pictures. Compare with the bright image (result example: Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2876-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Bright-field and fluorescence images of a BASL 3T3 cell\n(A) Bright-field image.\n(B) Actin-stained fluorescence image of the same cell as A. Scale bar indicates 10 μm.\nNote: If the staining efficiency is low, add 10 μM verapamil, which is included in the SiR-Actin kit, to inhibit efflux pumps.\nNote: Use Phenol Red-free L-15 medium for fluorescence measurement because Phenol Red increases the background when the orange or red fluorescent dye is used.\nNote: Using a medium without FBS for measurement may be preferable because it reduces the frequency of cell division during nanoendoscopy.\nFabrication of the nanoneedle probes\nTiming: 3 h",
    "We describe two methods for fabricating nanoneedle probes. One method is to mill a commercial probe using a focused ion beam (FIB).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Another method is electron beam deposition (EBD) which deposits carbon at the tip of the cantilever.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] The FIB-milled tip is longer and harder, but it requires skills and takes time to fabricate. EBD can be fabricated relatively easily in a short time, but it is shorter. The FIB milling method requires 3 h, and the EBD method requires 1 h.\nFabrication of FIB-milled tip.\nSetting cantilevers in FIB-SEM.\nA cantilever (240AC-NG, OPUS, spring constant 2 N/m) is placed on the custom-built cantilever holder for FIB milling (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2876-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cantilever holder for fabrication of the long nanoneedle tip\n(A) Cantilever for focused ion beam (FIB)-milling tip.\n(B) Cantilever for electron beam deposition (EBD) tip.\n(C) Fixed state to the 45° inclined plane of the stage of FIB-SEM.\nThe cantilever folder is placed on the 45° inclined surface of the stage in a Helios G4 CX Dual Beam system (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and fixed it with a screw (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: The cantilever holders are made of brass to avoid magnetization.\nFinding the tip position.\nClose the door and start evacuation of the vacuum chamber.\nAfter confirming that the pressure in the chamber is less than 5 × 1−4 Pa, press “Beam On” to start the electron and ion beams.\nSet the electrical voltage to 15 kV, and the current to 43 pA in SEM mode.\nAdjust the focus and link the Z position of the stage and the distance between the sample and the lens.\nBring an AFM tip on the cantilever into the field of view.",
    "Bring up the stage to 4 mm and tilt 17° with respect to the horizontal plane. Then, adjust the focus and link it again.\nSwitch to the FIB mode and set the acceleration voltage to 16 kV and the current to 15 pA (observation mode).\nCritical: When using the FIB mode, set the lowest electrical current possible and avoid unnecessary imaging to reduce unwanted milling.\nNote: Because the ion beam line is tilted 52° from the vertical axis, the angle between the cantilever on the 45° inclined surface and the ion beam line becomes 10° by tilting the stage by 17°.\nIncrease the magnification step by step up to 15,000× and focus on the AFM tip.\nRecord the position as “side_(cantilever number)”.\nMilling the tip.\nPlace the rectangle area for milling inside of the probe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2876-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Inset shows the magnified tip image.\nNote: Initially, place the rectangle relatively away (∼2 μm) from the center line of the probe and then gradually close it to the center by decreasing the electrical current.\nSet the electrical current to 0.4 nA.\nSet the Properties in the Pattern Control panel to Application Si, Time 5–10 min, and Scan Direction right to left.",
    "Note: It is not necessary to adjust other parameters such as Z size and Dwell Time.\nNote: The Scan Direction should be set in the manner that the scans start away from the center of the tip and go toward the center.\nScan once just before milling and confirm that the tip is not drifting. If significant drift was observed, wait 5–10 min and readjust the milling position.\nStart the milling.\nWhen the size of the object becomes small, stop the milling and reduce the size of the milling rectangle. And then mill it again.\nNote: The smaller the milling rectangle area, the faster the milling speed.\nReplace the milling rectangle on the other side of the probe.\nPerform the milling (after milling: Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nAfter milling from the side of the probe, reduce the electrical current to 15 pA.\nReturn the Tilt to 0° and lower the Z to 10–20 mm, and then rotate the stage by 180°.\nNote: Make sure to lower the stage not to hit the lens or the nozzle of the Gas Injection System (GIS).\nMove the cantilever into the field of view. Set the Z position to 4 mm and Tilt to 7°.\nFocus and record the position as “front_(cantilever number)”.\nSet the Scan Rotation to −90° so the probe’s tip faces up.\nPlace the milling rectangle on one side of the probe. Set the electrical current to 45 pA (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Put the milling rectangle upstream of the drift first.\nScan once and start milling.\nMove the rectangle to another side of the probe and mill it again (after milling: Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nDecrease the electrical current to 15 pA and return to the “side” position.\nPlace the rectangle inside the probe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Set the electrical current to 0.13 nA.",
    "Scan once and start milling.\nAs mentioned above, repeat the process 2–3 times while reducing the electrical current until the width of the probe is less than 200 nm.\nNote: Be sure to scan once before every milling to avoid cutting unwanted areas.\nNote: Be sure to set the electrical current to 15 pA (for observation) after milling.\nNote: When the width of the probe is close to 200 nm, we suggest placing a reference rectangle with a width of 180 nm at the center of the probe and using it as a shaving guide.\nFinishing fabrication of the tip.\nWhen the diameter of the probe is less than 200 nm, tilt the milling rectangle by 5° and taper off the tip in the front view.\nDo it again by tilting the milling rectangle by −5°(after milling: Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G and 3H).\nNote: Adjust the angle to achieve the desired tip aspect ratio.\nTilt 38° from the “side” position (total Tilt 45°). Change to SEM mode and take a photo of the probe.\nFabrication of the electron beam deposition (EBD) tip (optional).\nSetting the cantilever in the chamber of the FIB-SEM.\nPlace a cantilever (BL-AC40TS-C2, Olympus) on the cantilever holder for EBD fabrication (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nFix the cantilever holder on the 45° inclined surface of the stage (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPreparation and finding the tip.\nClose the door and start evacuation of the vacuum chamber.\nAfter confirming the pressure in the chamber is less than 5 × 10−4 Pa, press “Beam On” to start the electron and ion beams.\nSet the electrical voltage to 15 kV and the current to 43 pA.\nAdjust the focus on the surface and link the stage’s Z value to the distance between the sample and the lens.\nFlattening the tip.\nRotate 180°.",
    "Bring up the stage to 4 mm.\nBring the cantilever into the field of view.\nTilt the stage by 7°.\nSelect the FIB mode and set the electrical voltage to 16 kV and the current to 15 pA.\nNote: Set the lowest electrical current and reduce the imaging time as possible to avoid unwanted milling.\nFocus the AFM tip in FIB mode.\nIf the head of the probe is not flat, flatten the surface using FIB. Change the electrical current to 45 pA and place the milling rectangle at the tip of the probe (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2876-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Inset shows the magnified tip image.\nTake one image and perform milling for 2 min.\nDeposition of carbon on the tip.\nChange to SEM mode.\nSet the Tilt to 35°.\nFind the place for the deposition.\nMagnify to 150,000× and adjust the focus.\nSet the electrical current to 0.17 nA. Place the deposition circle and set the properties with the following values: Outer Diameter 22 nm, Dwell Time 20 min, Scan Direction Inner To Outer.\nInsert the carbon GIS nozzle. Repeat opening and closing a few times to release air from the nozzle.\nTake one image. If significant drift is observed, wait for about 5–10 min and readjust the position of the deposition circle.\nStart deposition.\nNote: Ensure that Z is approximately 4 mm. A longer Z distance decreases the deposition efficiency.\nAfter deposition, retract the nozzle and delete the deposition circle. Change the electrical current to 45 pA.\nReturn to Translation 0° and Rotation 0°.\nTilt 45°.\nFind the tip position and take a photo (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).",
    "Note: Other types of cantilevers can be used in the same manner.\nNote: The nanoneedle probe can be stored in the desiccator for about several months.\nNanoendoscopy\nTiming: 3–6 h (for step 6)\nTiming: 2–4 h (for steps 7 to 8)\nThere are two types of scanning methods; 2D scanning and 3D scanning. 2D scanning is the so-called “Tapping”, “Dynamic”, or “AC” mode. The cantilever oscillates at the resonance frequency and detects the surface of the structures. In this mode, the cantilever moves along the surface. In 3D scanning mode, the cantilever is forcibly retracted by a set length (∼ 0.1–10 μm) at each pixel, and the resistance strength is detected until it reaches the set point during the approach. Intracellular structures can be extracted from the 3D force data.\n3D Nanoendoscopy.\nSetting up AFM.\nTurn on the AFM (JPK Nanowizard 4, Bruker), stage controller (SPC-180713-04, Bruker), dish heater (RES-SAMPLE-HTR, Bruker), AFM-equipped fluorescence microscope (Eclipse Ti2, Nikon), light source (X-Cite XYLIS, Excelitas), and EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 888, Andor).\nSet the temperature of the dish heater to 37°C.\nNote: If freshly fabricated probes are not used, plasma cleaning for 10 min at 2 mA (Meiwafosis) is recommended.\nPlace the dish on the stage. Open the lid and fix the dish with fixing plates.\nPlace the fabricated nanoneedle probe into the cantilever holder and fix it.\nPlace the cantilever holder on the AFM head.\nTake 50 μL of the medium from the dish with a micropipette and fill the space between the cantilever and cantilever holder with the medium.\nNote: If this step is skipped, bubbles will appear on the cantilever and obstruct the optical path of the detection laser.\nStart the AFM software.\nPlace the AFM head on the stage.",
    "Note: Ensure space between the cantilever and the bottom of the dish. If there is insufficient space, raise the Z-position of the AFM head.\nChoose Force Spectroscopy mode.\nLower the AFM head and dip the cantilever in the medium.\nNote: Be careful not to touch the cell or the bottom of the dish with the tip.\nBring into the focus of the cantilever using a low-magnification lens (10 or 20×) while observing the bright-field image.\nAlign the AFM detection laser to the cantilever probe by maximizing the SUM value and centering the laser spot on the photodiode.\nCalibrate the cantilever using the calibration manager of the AFM software.\nNote: If it is difficult to find the detection laser spot in the bright-field image, first check whether the laser cutting and fluorescence filters have been removed. Then, turn off the light of the bright field, increase the camera contrast, and find the tail of the laser spot.\nChoose the data saving folder in Saving Settings and turn on Autosave.\nNote: Make sure to include Vertical Deflection data for saving.\nSetting up fluorescence imaging.\nStart the fluorescence image acquisition software (NIS-Elements, Nikon).\nChange to a high-magnification lens. To use the oil-immersion lens, place a drop of oil on the lens.\nBring the cells into focus.\nChange to epifluorescence mode. Select the Cy5 filter (excitation, 620/60; dichroic, 660; barrier, 700/75).\nTake an image. Find the cell you want to observe.\nApproaching the bottom of the cell.\nApproach the bottom surface of the dish. Set the Z position as 0.\nRetract the cantilever to enough height so that the nanoneedle probe does not touch the sample (10–15 μm).\nMove the cantilever to the desired position on the cell.\nApproaching the cell surface and taking one force curve.",
    "Approach to the cell surface. Calculate the height of the cell to be measured.\nNote: For approaching the cell surface, the set point should be less than 0.5 nN.\nSet the setpoint to 1–2 nN in the case of a 0.1 N/m spring constant cantilever, Z length 2 μm, Z speed 15 μm/s, 2 px/nm (sample rate 3000 Hz), approach speed 3 μm/s.\nNote: The parameters should be adjusted depending on the cell type or target structure.\nTake one force curve.\nNote: If the force curve shows a small peak around the cell height, it indicates that the probe successfully penetrated the cell membrane (indicated by the arrow in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). If the force curve shows a smooth exponential increase without peaks, it indicates that the probe did not penetrate the cell membrane (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). In this case, increase the set point, change the position, or change the nanoneedle.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2876-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Comparison of the penetration for successful and not successful force curves\n(A) Successful examples of the force curve. The small peak indicated by the arrow indicates the penetration of the cell membrane.\n(B) Non-successful example of the force curve. The extend curve increases exponentially without any peaks.\nNote: The 2D nanoendoscopy uses the same procedures until this step.\nNote: Both types of probes (FIB and EBD nanoneedles) can be used.\n3D nanoendoscopy measurement.\nChange the mode to QI Advanced Imaging.\nSet the setpoint to 1–2 nN, Z length 2 μm, Z speed 15 μm/s, 2 px/nm (Sample rate 3000 Hz), approach speed 3 μm/s.\nNote: We usually use 64 × 64 pixel and scan size 0.5–20 μm. It takes about 30 min.\nStart scanning.\n2D Nanoendoscopy (optional).\nThe AFM setup is the same until Step 5d (iii) of 3D Nanoendoscopy.",
    "Note: Both types of probes (FIB and EBD nanoneedles) can be used.\nSet up for AC mode.\nChange to AC imaging mode.\nStart the AC Feedback Mode Wizard and press the Run or Infinite icon to run a frequency sweep.\nZoom into the resonance peak and set the Drive Frequency and Setpoint.\nNote: Choose the setpoint at 50%–70% of the left side of the Lock-in amplitude peak.\nNote: We usually set 25 kHz as Drive Frequency and 5–10 nm as Setpoint (Peak to peak amplitude: ∼12 nm) when we use BL-AC40TS-C2 (spring constant: 0.1 N/m).\nSet the IGain to 50–150.\n2D nanoendoscopy measurement.\nStart approach.\nNote: If the approach stopped at around the cell membrane, increase the setpoint to around 90%, change the place to be observed, or change the nanoneedle probe (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nWait for 2 min to stabilize the nanoprobe inside the cell.\nStart imaging. Compare the trace and retrace images. If these are the same, imaging is successful. Otherwise, readjust the setpoint or IGain.\nNote: We usually use 128 × 128 pixels and scan size 0.2–2 μm. It takes about 2 min. It is possible to increase pixel size as necessary.\nPost-scanning.\nAfter taking an image, change to Force Spectroscopy.\nTake a force curve and check if the height of the cell is changed by comparing the force curve before and after the 2D imaging.\nApproach the bottom of the dish and take an image of the substrate.\nCompare the substrate image with the 2D nanoendoscopy image because 2D nanoendoscopy at the bottom of the cell is likely to be affected by substrate corrugation (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2876-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Turn off all the equipment that has been started up.\nThe locking part of the cantilever holder in the AFM head should be cleaned using ddH2O and ethanol.\nClean the lens if you use the oil immersion lens using lens paper and a cleaner.\nTransfer data.\nVisualization\nTiming: 2 h\nFor 3D visualization of 3D nanoendoscopy data, the data is first pre-processed using custom-built Python and LabVIEW (National Instruments) programs. Next, the data are imported into Voxler 4 (Golden Software) and visualized. For 2D nanoendoscopy, JPK Data Processing Software (Bruker) or Gwyddion (open-source Software)13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] is used with normal processing (Plane Fit, Line Leveling, and Median Filter). In this section, we describe the protocol for the visualization of 3D nanoendoscopy-AFM.\nNote: We uploaded the custom-built programs (https://github.com/fukuma-lab/3D-AFM_Analysis[href=https://github.com/fukuma-lab/3D-AFM_Analysis]).",
    "The process flow is illustrated in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]. This process varies depending on what is to be visualized and the type of data.
