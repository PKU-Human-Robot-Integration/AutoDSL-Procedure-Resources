    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEndothelial cell culture and lentiviral transduction for stable knockdown\nTiming: ~1 week\nThaw 1 vial of HUVECs and seed into a gelatin-coated T75.\nAfter 1 or 2 days, HUVECs can be replated as described above into appropriate number of coated T150s, usually 3–4, depending on the pool of HUVECs (some pools grow better than others). This step is for experiments that require large numbers of cells. Otherwise, skip this step and proceed with 3.\nAfter 1 or 2 days, seed HUVECs for lentiviral transduction into coated 6-well plates at 40%–60% confluency, 1 or 2 wells per condition.\nThe following day, transduce HUVECs with virus-like particles, obtained as described above.\nNote: HUVECs can be transduced with individual shRNAs or with pools of different shRNAs targeting the same gene. The latter is suitable for initial screening purposes. The efficiency of knockdown varies per shRNA, as do the chances of off-target effects. Furthermore, it is recommended to use 2 or 3 different clones per target gene, to reduce the chances of erroneous interpretation of results due to off-target effects. Finally, a scrambled sequence in the same vector should be used as a control.\nHUVECs are incubated for 12–16 h with the shRNA lentivirus solution (1 mL/well of a 6-wells plate) in DMEM, supplemented with 0.2–1.0 mL of EGM-2.\nNote: Supplement with EGM-2, depending on virus concentration and/or efficiency. It is advised to use as little virus as possible to achieve efficient knockdown of target gene expression. Since the shRNA-coding sequence is randomly integrated into the host genome, increasing copy number increases the chance of destroying critical genes, which will affect the cell in ways other than by knockdown of the target gene. Titration of the virus (with puromycin) is recommended.",
    "Replace the medium with EGM-2 containing puromycin (1 μg/mL) to select positive cells (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/994-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Generation of HUVECs with stable suppression of gene expression and assessment of the efficiency of knockdown\n(A) Phase/contrast images showing HUVECs before and after lentiviral transduction with pLKO.1 and selection with puromycin. Untransduced controls are all dead after two days of puromycin treatment. Bar, 100 μm.\n(B) Determination of knockdown efficiency using flow cytometry. Histograms represent cell-surface levels of β1 integrin in HUVECs expressing scrambled sequences (sh_Ctrl) or shRNAs against integrin β1 (sh_β1). Bar, 20 μm.\n(C) Confocal images of HUVECs stained for β1 integrin (yellow), F-actin (red), and VE-cadherin (gray).\n(D–G) (D) Composite images showing examples of sprouting efficiency in fibrin gels. Bar, 75 μm. Total network length/bead (E), average sprout length (F), and number of sprouts/bead (G) were determined using the protocol described here from 10 beads out of 2 experiments. Data are means ± SEM, statistically significant differences are denoted by ∗ p < 0.05, (unpaired two-tailed t test).\nAfter 2 days, the selected cells can be used for attachment to beads (see sprouting assay protocol below).\nThe efficiency of knockdown should be assessed in parallel by flow cytometry (for surface proteins) or Western blotting (for intracellular proteins), using validated antibodies (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If these are not available, knockdown can be confirmed by Q-PCR.\nNote: Selection should be finished 2–3 days after the addition of puromycin. Always take 1 well of non-transduced cells along to confirm puromycin-induced cell death. In case the selection is suboptimal, a kill curve should be performed first to establish the ideal puromycin concentration.\nCritical: Make sure sufficient cells after obtained after selection (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nAssay to screen for factors regulating sprouting angiogenesis\nTiming: 1–2 days",
    "This step describes how to achieve fast and robust HUVEC sprouting in fibrin gels, and to visualize sprouting and tip cell characteristics, such as the formation of filopodia, by confocal microscopy. Work in the flow hood to keep cells and materials sterile.\nPrepare beads\nResuspend beads.\nTransfer 250 μL of resuspended beads to a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAllow beads to settle and remove supernatant.\nAdd 250 μL of EGM-2.\nPrepare cells\nHarvest HUVECs by trypsinization and resuspend in EGM-2.\nCount cells using a cell counter.\nAdjust cells to a concentration of 660.000 cells/mL (=1 × 106 cells/1.5mL).\nNote: This is sufficient to coat approximately 1200 beads. To coat less or more beads, change numbers accordingly.\nAttach cells to beads\nAdd 1.5 mL of cell suspension to a 50 mL tube (=1 × 106 cells in total).\nResuspend beads and add 40 μL to the cell suspension.\nPlace cell/bead mixture at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 4 h.\nResuspend every 20 min.\nIncubation of beads with cells\nAdd cell/bead mixture to T25.\nNote: Don’t fill up the pipette with the entire 1.5 mL; too many cells/beads will stick to the inside of the pipette.\nAdd 3.5 mL of EGM-2 to T25.\nPlace cell/bead mixture at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 12–16 h.\nHarvest HUVEC-coated beads\nResuspend beads and transfer to a 50 mL tube.\nRinse T25 once with 3 mL of EGM-2 and add to the same tube.\nAllow beads to settle.\nNote: The knockdown of some target genes may affect HUVEC adhesion to Cytodex beads. Visually inspect whether HUVEC adhesion is efficient.\nWash HUVEC-coated beads\nAfter beads have settled, remove the supernatant, add 1 mL of EGM-2, resuspend and allow beads to settle. Repeat.\nPrepare fibrin gel",
    "Add 0.6 mL of 10 mg/mL fibrinogen to 2.4 mL of PBS, then add 18 μL of 15 U/mL aprotinin.\nAfter removing the supernatant from the beads, add fibrinogen/aprotinin/PBS mixture to the 50 mL tube.\nPipet a drop of 1,875 μL of a 10 U/mL thrombin solution in the middle of a well of a glass-bottom 96 well plate.\nNote: The plates mentioned here require small volumes of reagents, ideal for testing multiple conditions simultaneously, and the glass bottom is ideal for confocal imaging. However, plates with different properties (such as different well size, or plastic bottom if phase/contrast imaging is used instead of confocal microscopy) can also be used.\nAdd 30 μL of the fibrinogen/aprotinin/PBS mixture containing HUVEC-coated beads and resuspend once, very gently.\nNote: Avoid air bubbles. Do not move plate.\nCritical: Make sure the beads are properly resuspended and distributed. While too many beads per well or beads that are too close to one another could be good to study anastomosis, it hinders a proper discrimination of sprouts belonging to individual beads (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/994-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Common problems associated with the assay\nMaximum projection of an image stack (A), basal z-slice only (B), and 3-D projection along the x-axis (C), showing HUVECs spreading on the bottom of the plate (arrow). Example of hypersprouting (D), beads too close to each other (E) and beads too close to the well periphery (F). All stainings show F-actin (magenta) and Hoechst (cyan). Maximum projections are generated from stacks of 199-291 z-slices. Bars, 75 μm.\nPolymerization\nAllow the fibrin gel to polymerize for 5 min in the flow hood at 20°C–22°C.\nGently place plate in incubator for 15 min.\nNote: Avoid air bubbles. Do not move plate!\nSprouting",
    "In the flow hood, very gently drip 100 μL of EGM-2 on top of the gel.\nPlace HUVEC/bead/gel mixture at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 20–48 h.\nCritical: The relative quantities of thrombin and fibrinogen are crucial for the polymerization and quality of the gels. While poor gel quality can affect sprouting in various ways, a common problem is that beads sink to bottom and cells start to adhere to the bottom of the well (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nNote: The optimal window required for sprouting should be determined first for appropriate experimental conditions. We occasionally observe excessive sprouting already within 48 h, which complicates the analysis and quantification (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Also, it will be more difficult to identify stimulatory effects on sprouting under these circumstances (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nMulti-position confocal imaging of fixed material\nTiming: 8–12 h\nAfter the desired time of sprouting (in glass-bottom ‘half-well’ 96-well plates, efficient sprouting is already visible within 20–48 h after initiation of the assay), cells can be fixed for immunofluorescence analysis. For the visualization of individual sprouts and cells, rather than subcellular structures, we use phalloidin to stain actin filaments, and Hoechst to stain nuclei. Both stains are very bright and because of their small size, their delivery to cells in the fibrin gels is much more efficient than that of antibodies. The time required for imaging of an entire plate will depend on the numbers of beads to be imaged per condition, as well as microscope settings such as number of z-slices, resolution, and scan speed.\nStaining\nAspirate the medium and wash once with PBS containing MgCl2/CaCl2.\nFix with 500 μL of 4% PFA for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash 4 times with PBS.",
    "Permeabilize with 500 μL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at 4°C (this is sufficient for robust delivery of phalloidin, in contrast to antibodies which would require longer permeabilization).\nBlock non-specific binding with 5% BSA in PBS containing MgCl2/CaCl2 for 2 h at 20°C–22°C.\nWash the gels 3 times with PBS containing MgCl2/CaCl2.\nIncubate with Hoechst and phalloidin for 12–16 h at 4°C.\nWash gels 3 times with PBS containing MgCl2/CaCl2 for 10 min and store at 4°C until imaging. Although it is advised to image the plates shortly after staining, the plates can be stored for a number of weeks.\nNote: In case of storage, keeping the phalloidin in until imaging increases the quality of staining.\nOptional: For the visualization of subcellular structures or specific proteins, stainings with antibodies can be performed. For details on immunostaining in fibrin gels see: (Eglinger et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Nakatsu and Hughes, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])\nMulti-position confocal imaging\nApply two drops of water to the lens of a 20× long-distance water objective, as well as a drop of water on the bottom of the 96-well plate underneath the wells to be filmed.\nPlace plate on the stage of confocal microscope.\nNote: The use of objectives with long working distance is preferred. Best results are obtained with water objectives, which generate less optical aberrations at long working distance, as compared to oil-immersion objectives. Moreover, oil immersion objectives are less suitable for multi-position imaging, as the oil will be distributed all over the plate, increasing the risk of focus loss. For longer imaging periods with water objectives, the use of a water pump is required to maintain water immersion. Use no higher magnification than 20–25× if entire beads with all pertaining sprouts are to be imaged.",
    "Select the appropriate laser lines (for instance, excitation at 405 nm for Hoechst, and 561/594 nm for Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin).\nDetermine laser/gain and other confocal settings, for instance image dimensions 1024 × 1024 pixels, 0.75 μm/pixel, pinhole 1 μm, scan speed 400 Hz, bidirectional scanning, and performing sequential scanning between stacks (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/994-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Confocal imaging and mosaic sprouting assays\n(A) The confocal set-up used for assays described in this paper requires a module for multi-position imaging and a 37°C climate chamber equipped with CO2 and humidifier, as well as a water pump for prolonged water immersion imaging.\n(B) Screenshot of confocal settings for imaging of sprouts in multi-position mode.\n(C) Example of a mosaic assay for simultaneous assessment of differential sprouting properties between conditions. Two different HUVEC populations are differentially labeled using CellTracker dyes (pseudocolored yellow and magenta), mixed in a 1:1 ratio on beads, and allowed to sprout in fibrin gels, whereafter they are fixed and the nuclei stained (gray). Images are maximum projections of confocal z-stacks comprised of 183 slices. Bar, 75 μm.\nOptimize laser and gain settings.\nSet the appropriate number of z-slices. Example: at a 1.5 μm z-slice thickness, a typical bead with sprouts of about 300 nm in height will require around 200 z-slices.\nRun a pilot stack to confirm or adjust settings.\nSelect xyz positions and save to positions list. Attempt to image ~10 beads per condition.\nNote: The settings mentioned here will enable fast imaging with high-quality results, but several settings including the number of z-slices should be adjusted according to individual demands on image quality or imaging speed.\nStart the experiment. The positions list can be created at the end of the day to let the confocal run for 12–16 h.",
    "Note: The above settings will generate high-quality images with great resolution, but imaging with these settings will take on average 15 min per bead. For the analysis of large numbers of beads, scanning time can be reduced to about 3 min per bead using resonant scanning. The latter option will result in lower resolution but will still generate sufficient detail for proper visualization and quantification.\nNote: Because of bead-to-bead heterogeneity and variability in sprouting, it is advised to image multiple beads (5–10) per condition. Potential bias in selecting the beads for imaging could be reduced by performing the selection in a blind manner. Furthermore, unbiased bead selection may be aided using microscope applications that scan the entire well at low magnification (such as Leica Navigator), thus giving an impression of the general efficiency of sprouting per condition. Finally, phase/contrast images can be acquired of the same plate in parallel to confirm differences in sprouting between conditions.\nCell labeling and mosaic sprouting assays to assess differences in tip cell formation\nTiming: 1–2 days\nWhile the protocol described above allows for visualization of tip cell morphology in detail (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), differences in tip cell behavior or competitive advantages in tip cell formation can be assessed more directly in mosaic assays with differentially labeled cell populations, e.g., by using CellTracker as described below.\nLabeling of HUVECs with cell-permeable CellTracker dyes\nTrypsinize HUVECs of experimental condition and control.\nCount HUVECs and resuspend equal numbers in EGM-2.\nAdd a different CellTracker dye to each population, for instance CellTracker Green for the experimental condition, and CellTracker Red for the control (both at suggested concentrations of 0.1 μM).\nWash the cells twice with large volumes of PBS.",
    "Note: Perform these steps in the flow hood to keep cells and dyes sterile. CellTracker dyes are dissolved in DMSO as a 1000× solution, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: CellTracker dyes are cell-permeable but once in the cell, they are converted into cell-impermeable reaction products. They are transferred to daughter cells after division. CellTracker Green produces uniform cell labeling, while CellTracker Red prominently labels vesicular compartments (see Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/994-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Live imaging approaches for visualization of tip cell behavior during sprouting\n(A) Stills from a single-channel time-lapse movie showing filopodial dynamics in sprouting HUVECs labeled with CellTracker. Images were acquired every 10 min with 61 z-slices per time-point. Bar, 20 μm.\n(B) Schematic representation of the construct used for live imaging (top). Stills from a pseudocolored dual-channel time-lapse movie, showing a tip cell expressing H2B-mNeon to visualize the nucleus, and TagRFP-CAAX to track the plasma membrane and endomembranes (bottom).

Bar, 10 μm.\n(C) Stills from a pseudocolored dual-channel time-lapse sequence showing tip cell dynamics in a mosaic sprouting assay with a 1:1 mixed population of HUVECs differentially stained with distinct CellTracker dyes. Imaging started 20 h after sprouting, images were acquired from 99 z-slices with a 20 min interval. Bar, 75 μm.\nNote: Wear protective clothing, gloves, and eye/face protection when handling DMSO or the DMSO dye solution. DMSO easily penetrates the skin and facilitates the absorption of organic molecules into tissues. Dispose of waste and materials in compliance with the appropriate local regulations.\nAttaching labeled HUVECs to beads\nPre-incubate for 30 min in the dark at 37°C.\nMix the two populations in a 1:1 ratio.",
    "Incubate labeled HUVEC mixture with the beads for 12–16 h at 37°C as described in steps 11 and 12.\nHarvest beads with labeled HUVECs as described in steps 13 and 14.\nAdd beads with labeled HUVECs to fibrin gels and start sprouting assay as described in steps 15–17.\nFix cells at appropriate time-point, e.g., at 20 h after the induction of sprouting.\nCritical: CellTracker dyes can induce toxic effects in the long run. Determine cellular health by visual inspection and decide on the optimal time-point to fix the cells. For tip cell competition assays, formation of large sprouts is not necessary and the experiment can be fixed at an early time-point.\nLabel cells after fixation with Hoechst as described above in step 18. Keep plates in the dark to avoid loss of CellTracker signal.\nSelect the appropriate laser lines on a confocal set-up (for instance; 405 nm for Hoechst, 488 nm for CellTracker Green, and 591 nm for CellTracker Red).\nImage the cells as described above (step 19).\nCreate maximum projections of the z-stacks as described in the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section below. The separate channels will reveal cells of each population, as well as the nuclei of all cells (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nQuantification of tip cells is performed by counting all tip cells for each color, and dividing this number by the total number of cells in that color. This will correct for potential differences in total cell numbers in each condition.\nCritical: First determine the best conditions for labeling (ie concentration, incubation times) with CellTracker dyes (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]). Note that prolonged incubation increases dye dilution due to cell division, as well as transfer of dyes to adjacent cells.",
    "Critical: To rule out (indirect) effects of the dye on tip cell formation it is recommended to include a condition where the different CellTracker dyes are swapped between cell populations. Furthermore, it is advised to include a condition in which control cells, labeled with either dye, are mixed in a 1:1 ratio. The number of tip cells in each color should be around 50% in this condition.\nLive imaging by time-lapse confocal microscopy\nTiming: 1–2 days\nIn addition to imaging fixed materials, this protocol describes how to generate time-lapse movies from sprouting cells in fibrin gels, which will reveal the dynamic behavior of tip cell filopodia and of individual cells within sprouts. To visualize endothelial cells, they can be labeled using CellTracker dyes, or engineered to express a fluorescent protein. As an example of the latter, we here use a bicistronic construct in a lentiviral vector, encoding mNeonGreen labeled histone 2B (H2B) as well as a CAAX motif tethered to tagRFP (Bolhaqueiro et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The C-terminal CAAX motif used here is from K-Ras and integrates specifically in the plasma membrane, thus marking the cell membrane and endocytic/pinocytic compartments derived thereof, while H2B marks the chromatin. Therefore, this approach is useful for the simultaneous imaging of membranes and nuclei in living cells (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nLabel cells with CellTracker dyes as described above in step 20.\nOr:\nFollow steps 22–32 of the section “Production of lentivirus-like particles[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5]”, but using the lentiviral expression vector of interest, instead of shRNA-encoding pLKO.1-puro.\nTransduce HUVECs as in steps 1–5 of section “Endothelial cell culture and lentiviral transduction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]“.\nIf desired, select positive cells with antibiotics as described in step 6 of section “Endothelial cell culture and lentiviral transduction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]“.",
    "Note: We use a lentiviral vector here for the delivery of our fluorescent protein of interest. Any marker protein can be used in this manner, within the size limit of a lentiviral vector (~10 kilobases in total; virus production is less efficient for inserts > 2kb).\nNote: If imaging with lentivirally delivered proteins is initiated shortly after transduction, a BSL-2 imaging facility is required.\nNote: CellTracker is easily combined with stable suppression of gene expression using shRNAs. To achieve robust expression of a fluorescent marker protein in stable knockdown cells, we recommend transducing and selecting shRNA-expressing cells first, followed by transduction to express the marker protein. A different antibiotic (for example blasticidin) could be used to select marker protein-expressing cells, but this will often not be necessary given the high degree of transduction efficiency using lentiviral systems, and the fact that positive cells can easily be selected by visual inspection.\nAttach the fluorescent HUVECs to beads as described in step 21.\nDetermine the best time-point to start imaging. Generally, sprouting does not occur earlier than 16–18 h after placing the beads in the gels.\nReplace the medium approximately 1 h before starting to set up the microscope. The microscope should be prewarmed and atmospherically stabilized at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nSelect the appropriate laser lines and settings. Appropriate time intervals will depend on the hypothesis, e.g., imaging filopodia dynamics will require shorter intervals than investigating tip cell sprouting or sprout elongation.\nStart the experiment as described above in step 19.\nNote: Because CellTracker can fade, impose toxicity, or transfer between cells during prolonged incubation, it is advisable to not image CellTracker-loaded cells too long.",
    "Critical: It is important to first determine the optimal confocal settings (number of z-slices per position, intervals between images), as well as potential phototoxicity and bleaching effects (troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13])."
