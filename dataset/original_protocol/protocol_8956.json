    "1. Primary Cultures of Olfactory Mucosa and Olfactory Bulbs\nPrior to dissection\n\t\nMake medium, for 50 ml, by adding 44 ml of calcium-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's/Ham's F12 medium (DMEM/F12), supplemented with 5 ml of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1 ml of penicillin/streptomycin.\nCoat 75 cm2 flasks with poly-L-lysine (50 μg/ml, 1.5 μg/cm2), 1 hr at room temperature.\nRinse flasks with PBS 1x.\nStore the coated flasks in the fridge for up to 1 week.\nDissection\n\t\nAny method of euthanasia must be approved in advance by the institution's animal care and use committee and carried out by qualified personnel.\nChoose inbred rats such as Fischer rats.\nAfter the rat has been confirmed to have entered deep anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital or other injectable forms of anesthesia such as ketamine/xylazine, decapitate him and remove the skin.\nOpen the skull from the anterior to the posterior part.\nRemove the OB taking care to avoid the meninges.\nIn the same rat, open the nasal cavity sagittaly.\nRemove the OM taking care to avoid the respiratory mucosa. Note that the OM epithelium can be easily identified by its yellowish color.\nFurther detailed protocols about dissection of OM can be find in a previous J. Vis. Exp[href=http://www.jove.com/video/2762/isolating-nasal-olfactory-stem-cells-from-rodents-or-humans]. publication13.\nCulture\n\t\nPlace OB in Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) containing 0.1% trypsin for 45 min at 37 °C.\nPlace OM in HBSS containing 0.05% collagenase A for 45 min at 37 °C.\nStop enzymatic digestion by adding 2 ml of warm medium.\nWash the cells with medium and centrifuge them at 300 x g for 3 min.\nTriturate samples of 2 ml of medium using a P1000 pipette until a homogenous cell suspension is obtained.\nPlate the cells in the precoated flasks (5-10 x 106 cells/flask) with 25 ml of warm medium.",
    "Incubate and culture the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nChange half of the medium every 2 days.\nAfter 6-8 days in vitro, check the proportion of p75 positive cells on small cell samples, assumed to be OECs in rodents, by flow cytometry or by immunocytochemistry. For these analyses, other markers can be studied such as GFAP and S100β.\nFlow cytometry analysis\n\t\nCollect the cells as described in \"cellular transplantation\" (section 2.2 below).\nIncubate them with p75 primary antibody (1:100) during 15 min at 4 °C.\nWash the cells with 2 ml of PBS-EDTA and centrifuge them at 300 x g for 3 min.\nIncubate the cells with PE conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody during 15 min at 4 °C in the dark (1:200).\nWash the cells with 2 ml of PBS-EDTA and centrifuge them at 300 x g for 3 min.\nResuspend the cells in 500 μl of PBS-EDTA.\nAnalyze 10-30 x 103 cells with flow-cytometer.\nImmunocytochemistry analysis\n\t\nPlate the cells in 6-well plates precoated for 48 hr as described in \"culture\" (section 1.1.2 below).\nWash the cells with PBS.\nFix the cells with PFA 4% for 15 min at RT.\nWash the cells with PBS.\nIncubate the cells with PBS/Triton X100 (0.1%) for 15 min at RT.\nWash the cells with PBS.\nIncubate the cells with primary antibodies (1:200): p75, S100β and GFAP overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the cells with PBS.\nIncubate the cells with the secondary antibodies (1:500) during 1 hr at RT in darkness.\nWash the cells with PBS.\nIncubate the cells with Hoechst 10 min at RT in darkness.\nWash the cells with PBS.\nAnalyze the cells using a fluorescent microscope.\nGFP labeling cells\n\t\nFive days before transplantation, infect OB and OM cultures overnight with lentiviral vector harboring enhanced GFP (multiplicity of infection: 20).",
    "Before transplantation check on small samples the rate of GFP positive cells by flow-cytometry as described previously in \"culture\" (section 1.1).\n2. Surgery and Transplantation\nRecurrent nerve anastomosis\n\t\nAll experiments with animals must be approved in advance by the institution's animal care and use committee and carried out by qualified personnel.\nPrior to surgery autoclave all instruments and maintain sterility throughout the surgical procedures.\nAnesthetize rat by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (12.5 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine hydrochloride (0.625 mg/kg). Assess adequacy of anesthesia by toe pinch prior to surgery.\nPlace the rat in dorsal decubitus.\nPerform a 2 cm vertical medium cervical cutaneous incision with a scalpel.\nPerform a vertical incision of the infrahyoid muscles following the medial white line.\nExpose larynx by using autostatic retractor between infrahyoid muscles.\nExpose the RLN.\nUnder microscopic control, cut the nerve fully with microscissors at the level of the seventh tracheal ring.\nPerform anastomosis using one point of 11.0 suture under microscopic control. This surgery leads to a specific motor denervation of the larynx.\nCellular transplantation\n\t\nJust before transplantation, remove the cells from the dishes using 0.05% trypsin EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C.\nStop enzymatic digestion by adding 2 ml of warm medium.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min.\nUnder a microscope count the cells using a hemocytometer and adjust the cellular concentration according to specific protocol. In this model, desired concentrations were between 1.2-6 x 106 cells in 30 μl of DMEM/F12.\nMake cellular preparation with 1:2 mix (30 and 60 μl in this experiment) of DMEM/F12-Matrige l in 1.5 ml tube before grafting and place it on ice. To avoid unspecific effects, use growth factor reduced Matrigel.\nJust prior to transplantation hold the tube in your hand for a few seconds to warm up the Matrigel-medium mix.",
    "Depose the mix on the anastomosis site using a pipette and wait until the mixture self-assembles on the injured nerve.\nClose the muscles and skin with a 4.0 suture.\nHouse the rats individually and keep under a heating lamp for 24 hr.\n3. Evaluation\nLaryngoscopy\n\t\nAnesthetize rats by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (12.5 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine hydrochloride (0.625 mg/kg). Confirm rats are anesthetized with a toe pinch prior to proceeding with protocol.\nPlace the rat in dorsal decubitus.\nInsert a 30° videolaryngoscope adjusted to provide the best view of the larynx. Determine anatomic landmarks to reproduce the same view for each recording.\nRecord vocal cord movements using the videolaryngoscope (5-10 sequences/animal). For each animal select three sequences of successive maximal adduction and maximal abduction.\nAnalyze laryngeal function using image analysis software. Determine absolute angular movement by measuring the difference between movement of maximal abduction and maximal adduction of the vocal cords. Determine dynamic score by measuring the movement amplitude. Determine functional score by measuring the synkinesis and paradoxal movements.\nElectromyography (EMG)\n\t\nPlace an electrode on the hamstring muscles of the rat for electrical isolation.\nExpose larynx and trachea by opening skin and muscles as described previously in \"recurrent nerve anastomosis\" (section 2.1).\nExpose the cricothyroid cartilage.\nOpen the cricothyroid cartilage to expose the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle using microscissors.\nIntroduce a monopolar needle electrode (38 x 0.45 mm) in the PCA muscle.\nRecord the electrical muscular activity of the PCA muscle using an acquisition system during spontaneous ventilation.",
    "Analyze the muscular activity in terms of richness and synchronization with the respiration. To analyze EMGs, assign a qualitative score from 0-3 using the following scale: 0: unrhymed tracing, without increase during inspiration, 1: rhymed tracing with inspiratory increasing, but poor tracing (neurogen), 2: rhymed tracing with richer activity, 3: rhymed tracing, very rich, constituting an interference pattern, similar to a maximal intentional activity.\nExpose the vagus nerve to measure latency and potential duration. The vagus nerve is chosen as the site of stimulation because RLN can be damaged during stimulation due to its small size.\nStimulate the vagus nerve with an electrode.\nRecord electrical signals in the PCA muscle. Measure latency and potential duration. If possible use an acquisition module to record muscular activity, latency and potential duration such as Powerlab system.\nHistology\n\t\nEuthanize the animal using pentobarbital overdose.\nRemove the distal stump of RLN under microscopic control. The distal part of RLN is defined as the part between anastomosis and larynx. Note that it is possible to find the anastomosis site several weeks after surgery because the 11.0 suture is a nonabsorbable suture.\nPlace the distal portion of RLN in 2% glutaraldehyde with 0.1 M phosphate (pH=7.3) for 2 hr at 4 °C.\nCarefully orient the samples to realize coronal sections.\nWash samples in phosphate buffer.\nCut in smaller segments (3-4 mm length) and postfix for 60 min at room temperature in 1% cacodylate buffered OsO4 and dehydrated with ethanol.\nOrient samples in silicone molds and embedded in resins consisting in POLYBED 812, DDSA and MNA, to which was added 2% of the accelerator BDMA.\nMake semi-thin transverse sections (1μm-thick) using a Pyramitome Ultramicrotomy System.\nStain with 0.1% Toluidine Blue in 1% sodium tetraborate for 75 sec at 70 °C.",
    "Analyze RLN samples with a counting analysis system. Count the number of fibers and measure myelinated nerve fiber profiles by determining the outer and inner boundary of the myelin sheath.\nTransplantation\n\t\nPrepare cells for transplantation and transplant the cells as previously described in \"cellular transplantation\" (section 2.2).\nAnalysis\nEuthanize the animal using pentobarbital overdose. Note that fixation of the animals can be performed using intracardiac injection of PFA 4%.\nRemove around 2 cm of RLN. Use proximal and distal parts of the RLN.\nFix RLN sample in liquid nitrogen.\nStore samples at -80 °C.\nCut samples longitudinally using cryostat (10-20 μm thick).\nAnalyze samples under fluorescent microscope to detect GFP positive cells. Note that anti-GFP antibody can be used to increase fluorescence emission and to perform costainings.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
