  "procedures": [
    "All described steps were performed under protocols approved by the Biosafety Committee and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Boston Children's Hospital. Boston Children's Hospital has pathogen-free mouse facilities with regulated light/dark cycles and climate control. Veterinary and animal care staff change cages and ensure the health of the mice. The facilities are AAALAC certified and have active Animal Welfare Assurance certification (AAALAC Accreditation Granted on 2/24/1992. Animal Welfare Assurance number: A3303-01). Mice were euthanized by CO2 delivered from a compressed gas source. Tissue samples were collected after confirming that heart rate, movement, and breathing of animals had ceased. Neonatal rodents are resistant to CO2 euthanasia and were euthanized by decapitation using sharp scissors. These methods are consistent with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n1. Generation of rAAV9 Constructs by Cloning a cDNA or shRNA Expression Cassette into the Plasmid Backbone",
    "NOTE: The rAAV9 plasmid, containing the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of AAV2, used for gene overexpression has been modified to harbor the chicken TNNT2 promoter (rAAV9.cTNT), which enables cardiomyocyte-specific expression of transduced genes25,26,29. Unique NheI and KpnI sites have been introduced into the plasmid, downstream of the promoter. The cDNA fragments encoding the genes of interest can be cloned into the rAAV9 backbone using these two restriction sites25,26,29. Here, as an example, the rAAV9 vector for overexpression of the GFP gene in mouse hearts was generated. The resulting plasmid contains the cTNT::GFP cassette flanked by two ITR sites (Figure 1). rAAV9.U6::shRNA constructs were used for gene knockdown25. Design shRNAs using online shRNA design servers. rAAV9.U6::shRNA can be generated either by annealing and ligating DNA oligos-containing shRNA sequences into the restriction enzyme-digested rAAV9 vectors harboring the U6 promoter, or by long-range PCR and intra-molecular Gibson assembly-based \"seamless\" construction30. The resulting plasmid should contain the U6-shRNA cassette flanked by two ITR sites (Figure 2). Here, as an example, the rAAV9.U6::shRNA vector was constructed to knockdown Trbp mRNA (Trbp shRNA sequence: GCAGTGATGGATATGCATCTTCTCGAGAAGATGCATATCCATCACTCG). A scramble shRNA was used as a negative control (CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCGCTCGAGCGAGGGCGACTTAACCTTAGG).\nClone the cDNA or shRNA expression cassette into the rAAV9 plasmid backbone. Transform the DNA into competent E. Coli cells25.\n\tNOTE: Use stbl2 or stbl3 E. coli cells for rAAV9 DNA transformation to minimize undesired ITR recombination.\nPick up the positive clone from the transformed E. Coli cells. Amplify the culture in 500 ml of Lilly-Barnett medium and extract the rAAV9 plasmid from the bacterial cells25-30.\n\tNOTE: Midi/Maxi prep the rAAV9 plasmid to obtain a high amount of DNA (> 100 µg). Before generating the virus, always analyze the sequence integrity of the AAV plasmids by restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis, as previously described (http://www.vvf.uzh.ch/cloningservice/11bpdeletion/itrintegrity.html).",
    "2. Transfection of HEK293 Cells with rAAV9 Plasmids\nPrepare 1 µg/µl of linear polyethylenimine (PEI) solution. Dissolve PEI powder in endotoxin-free dH2O that has been heated to 70-80 °C. Aftercooling down to RT, neutralize the solution to pH 7.0 with 1 M HCl. Filter sterilize (0.22 µm) the solution. Aliquot the 1 µg/µl PEI stock solution (1,400 µl/tube) and store the solution at -20 °C.\nCulture HEK293 cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Culture the cells in a 37 °C incubator with 5 ± 0.5% carbon dioxide (CO2).\nAt day 0, plate HEK293 cells in ten 150-mm dishes 18-20 hr before transfection by splitting > 90% confluent cells in a 1:2 dilution.\n\tNOTE: At day 1, the cells should reach 90% confluence.\nAt day 1, transfect HEK293 cells with the rAAV9 plasmid (e.g., rAAV9.cTNT::GFP or rAAV6.U6::shRNA constructs), Ad-Helper plasmid, and AAV-Rep/Cap plasmid using PEI25,26,29.\n\t\nFor 10 dishes of cells at 90% confluence, mix 70 µg of AAV-Rep/Cap plasmid, 70 µg pf rAAV9 plasmid, and 200 µg of Ad-Helper plasmid in a 50-ml centrifuge tube.\nIf the cells are less confluent, adjust the DNA amount proportionally. For instance, if the cells are at 75% confluent, reduce the DNA amount proportionally (75/90 of the amount shown in step 2.4.1): mix 70 x 75/90 = 58.3 µg of AAV-Rep/Cap plasmid, 70 x 75/90 = 58.3 µg of rAAV9 plasmid, and 200 x 75/90 = 166.7 µg of Ad-Helper plasmid in a 50-ml centrifuge tube.\nAdd 49 ml of RT DMEM (without FBS) to the 50-ml tube and mix well.\nAdd 1,360 µl of PEI solution to make the PEI:DNA ratio (v/w) be 4:1. Mix well. Incubate at RT for 15 - 30 min.",
    "Add 5 ml of the mixture prepared in step 2.4.4 to each 150-mm dish (50 ml of the mixture for ten 150-mm dishes).\nCulture the cells in a 37 °C incubator with 5 ±0.5% CO2 for 60-72 hr.\n3. Harvest of Transfected HEK293 Cells and Purification of rAAV9 Vectors\nHarvest the cells 60-72 hr after transfection. Dislodge and suspend the cells in the dishes by pipetting up and down with the culture medium. Transfer all the cell suspensions to sterile 50-ml tubes.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cell pellet with 5 ml of PBS in each tube and combine all the cell suspensions into one 50 ml tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. At this step, store the cell pellet at -80 °C or immediately purify the AAV from the pellet, as described in steps 3.4-3.15.\nPrepare the lysis buffer: 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Filter sterilize (0.22 µM). Store the buffer at 4 °C.\nResuspend the pellet with 10 ml of lysis buffer.\nFreeze the lysate at -80 °C or in the dry ice/ethanol bath, then thaw it at 37 °C. Vortex for 1 min. Freeze and thaw the lysate 3 times.\nAdd MgCl2 solution to the thawed lysate (make the final concentration of MgCl2 in the lysate be 1 mM). Add the nuclease to a final concentration of 250 U/ml. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min to dissolve the DNA/protein aggregation.\n\tNOTE: If the DNA/protein aggregation does not get dissolved after nuclease or endonuclease treatment, dounce homogenize the lysates 20 times.\nCentrifuge the sample at 4,800 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant.\nMeanwhile, prepare the Iodixanol gradient solution:",
    "Prepare the 17% of the gradient solution by mixing 5 ml of 10x PBS, 0.05 ml of 1 M MgCl2, 0.125 ml of 1 M KCl, 10 ml of 5 M NaCl, and 12.5 ml ofdensity gradient medium. Adjust the total volume to 50 ml using H2O.\nPrepare the 25% solution by mixing 5 ml of 10x PBS, 0.05 ml of 1 M MgCl2, 0.125 ml of 1 M KCl, 20 ml of density gradient medium, and 0.2 ml of 0.5% (w/v) Phenol Red. Adjust the total volume to 50 ml using H2O.\nPrepare the 40% solution by mixing 5 ml of 10x PBS, 0.05 ml of 1 M MgCl2, 0.125 ml of 1 M KCl, and 33.3 ml of density gradient medium. Adjust the total volume to 50 ml using H2O.\nPrepare the 60% solution by mixing 0.05 ml of 1 M MgCl2, 0.125 ml of 1 M KCl, 50 ml of density gradient medium, and 0.1 ml of 0.5% (w/v) Phenol Red.\nWith a needle and syringe, load the Iodixanol gradient solution into the polypropylene tube in the order of 5 ml of 17%, 5 ml of 25%, 5 ml of 40% and 5 ml of 60%, starting from the bottom. Load all the lysate obtained from step 3.8 (14-16 ml) on top of the gradient. The gradient, listed from the bottom to top, is 60%, 40%, 25%, 17%, and the lysate layer. Fill the tube with lysis buffer and cover it with the cork.\nCentrifuge at 185,000 x g for 90 min at 16 °C.\nHarvest the viral fraction (40% layer) with a syringe. Insert the needle (21 gauge) into the intersection between the 40% and 60% fractions, only aspirating the 40% layer.\n\tNOTE: Avoid aspirating ANY of the 25% layer.",
    "Mix the viral fraction with sterilized polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer PBS solution (10% polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer stock 1:10,000 diluted in PBS) up to a total volume of 15 ml. Load the mixture into the filter tube (cut-off MW = 100 kD). Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the solution at the bottom. Refill the filter tube with polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer PBS solution to a total volume of 15 ml. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Repeat this step two more times. Collect the purified rAAV9 virus (the fraction above the filter).\nTransfer the purified rAAV9 in the filter tube to 1.7-mL tubes. Aliquot the purified rAAV9 (100 - 400 µl/tube, depending on the volume and titer of the AAV) and store the virus at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Avoid repeated freeze-thaws.\n4. Measurement of the Titer of rAAV9\nPrepare standard DNA samples.\nDesign specific and efficient PCR primers for rAAV9 vectors and optimize the PCR condition.\n\t\tNOTE: The primers used in this study are \"Forward: TCGGGATAAAAGCAGTCTGG; Reverse: TCGGACGGAGATACGTGAGT\". The PCR reaction was performed with the following conditions: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 20 sec, 60 °C for 15 sec, and 72 °C for 10 sec; and the final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. However, the optimized primers and PCR conditions are plasmid-specific, as the inset sequence in the rAAV9 vector may affect the specificity and efficiency of PCR31.\nPerform the PCR reaction with the conditions shown in step 4.1.1. Purify the PCR product with a gel extraction kit.\nMeasure the concentration of purified DNA using a spectrophotometer. Calculate the concentration in DNA molecular numbers based on the molecular weight/length of the PCR product.",
    "Calculate the molecular concentration using the following equation: molecular concentration (DNA molecules or fragments/ml) = 6.23 x 1023 mol-1 x Con. x 10-6/MW. Note: (6.23 x 1023 mol-1 is Avagadro's Number; Con.: DNA concentration in µg/ml; MW.: molecular weight in g/mol). For instance, if the obtained concentration of the PCR product is 100 µg/ml and its length is 200 bp, the molecular weight of the double-stranded DNA is 2 x 200 x 310 = 124,000 (the average molecular weight of each nucleotide in the single-stranded DNA is about 310 g/mol). The molecular concentration (DNA molecules/ml) = 6.23 X 1023 mol-1 x 100 µg/ml x 10-6 /124,000 g/mol = 5.18 x 1014 DNA molecules/ml.\nPerform a dilution series of the DNA fragment and prepare the standard samples, with concentrations of 1013 molecules/ml, 1012 molecules/ml, 1011 molecules/ml, 1010 molecules/ml, 109 molecules/ml, 108 molecules/ml, and 107 molecules/ml. Use 1 µl of solution for each standard sample for the quantitative PCR (qPCR, in step 4.6).\nMix 5 µl of purified rAAV9 solution with 5 µl of 10x DNAse buffer, 1 µl of DNAse (10,000 U/ml), and 39 µl of ddH2O. The total volume should be 50 µl.\nIncubate the vial at 37 °C for 30 min to remove residual unpackaged plasmid DNA.\nInactivate the DNAse at 95 °C for 10 min. Cool down the solution, add 44 µl of H2O, 5 µl of 10x DNAse buffer, and 1 µl of Proteinase K stock (10 mg/ml).\nIncubate the solution at 50 °C for 2 hr. Stop the reaction and inactivate the Proteinase K at 95 °C for 10 min.\nUse 1 µl of the sample for the quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Calculate the titer.",
    "Run quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the primers designed in step 4.1.1 using the samples from step 4.1.4 (standard samples) and from step 4.5 (samples to be measured).\n\t\t\nFor each reaction, mix 10 µl of 2x Green master mix (containing Taq polymerase, dNTP mix, buffer, MgCl2, and Green dye), 0.5 µl of forward primer (5 µM), 0.5 µl of reverse primer (5 µM), 8 µl of H2O, and 1 µl of the sample to be measured. Perform qPCR with the following conditions: hold the samples at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min; perform 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 sec and at 60 °C for 1 min; for the melt stage, incubate the samples at 95 °C for 30 sec and 60 °C for 15 sec. Generate the standard curve based on the CT numbers of the standard samples (Figure 3).\nCalculate the molecular concentration/titer of the AAV sample against the standard curve. The rAAV9 has a single-strand DNA genome, so the molecular concentration will be 2-fold higher than the calculated value (2x power (10, y), Figure 3B). In addition, the titer of the purified rAAV9 will be 20-fold higher than what is obtained from the calculation due to the 1:20 dilution of the virus in DNAse and Proteinase K reactions (5 µl in 100 µl total).\n5. rAAV9 Injection in Neonatal Mice and Gene Expression Assays in the Heart\nPrepare rAAV9 working solutions in polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer PBS solution. Make the virus stock with the titers of 1-7 x 1012 particles/ml.",
    "NOTE: Deliver 50-70 µl of rAAV9 solution into each postnatal day 0.5-1.5 mouse by subcutaneous injection. To achieve efficient gene overexpression or knockdown, it is recommended to perform a pilot test for each study to optimize the amount of injected AAV. Use the same amount of rAAV9.cTNT::Luc or rAAV9.U6::scramble controls for each study to minimize the bias.\n\tNOTE: We used 1-1.5 x 1011 particles/pup for overexpression and 2.5 - 5 x 1011 particles/pup for knockdown in postnatal day 0.5-1.5 mice).\nTreat neonatal mice with rAAV9 at P0.5-P2.5 by subcutaneous injection.\nPre-fill a 29G1/2, 0.33 x 12.7 mm insulin syringe with the rAAV9 solution. Be careful to remove air bubbles.\nHold the cryo-anesthetized pup in one hand with thumb and forefinger. Prior to injection, swipe the back skin of the pup with a swab stick saturated with 70% isopropyl alcohol to maintain the sterile condition. Insert the syringe needle into the anterior-dorsal subcutis of the animal at an angle of 5 to 10°. Inject 50-70 µl of the rAAV9 solution using the insulin syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: rAAV9 can also be delivered to the mouse via intraperitoneal or intravenous injection26,27. Efficient expression of the delivered genes in the heart can be obtained. However, intraperitoneal injection sometimes may result in leaky expression in the liver. After injection, the condition of the pups was monitored every day.\nThe level of gene expression in the heart can be monitored with qPCR, immunofluorescence, or western blot (representative results are shown in Figures 4 and 5)25,26.",
    "NOTE: Mice were euthanized by CO2 delivered from a compressed gas source. Tissue samples were collected after confirming that heart rate, movement, and breathing of the animals had ceased. Neonatal rodents are resistant to CO2 euthanasia and were euthanized by decapitation using sharp scissors. The method is consistent with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
