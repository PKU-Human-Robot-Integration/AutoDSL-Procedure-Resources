    "The following techniques have been approved for use by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee.\n1. Demographics and Anthropometry\nRecord demographic information from participants, including date of birth and gender.\nAt baseline (and other study points if temporal study design) take height and weight measurements. Ensure that participants have taken off shoes, heavy jackets or other clothing items, and have removed any heavy items from their pockets.\n\t\nMeasure participant's height using a stadiometer. Record measurements to the nearest cm.\nWeigh participants using dedicated scales. Record weight to the nearest g.\nCalculate BMI using the equation: weight (kg)/height2 (m2). From this, participants are categorized according to standard BMI definition values; healthy 18.5-25 kg/m2, overweight 25-30 kg/m2 or obese >30 kg/m2 27.\n2. Producing Samples for Oral Fatty Acid Threshold Assessment\nUse non-fat UHT milk as the base for fatty acid taste threshold assessment. Product can be purchased and stored in bulk if necessary, and will keep unopened for up to 6 months or until the product has reached its expiry. Prepare 2 types of vehicles: vehicle with added fatty acid and a control vehicle. The volume of solutions prepared for testing will depend on participant number. The following protocol provides typical amounts for 2 participants.\nPrepare a base milk solution to use for both the control and fatty acid vehicle by placing 5% w:v food grade gum arabic (e.g., 100 g per 2 L of milk) into a 3 L glass beaker. If required, hydrate gum prior to use (this will vary depending on gum manufacturer).\nAdd 0.01% w:v EDTA to the gum to prevent oxidation (e.g., 200 mg per 2 L of milk).\nAllocate approximately 1 L of non-fat milk per participant (e.g., for 2 participants, use 2 L milk) and pour into beaker.",
    "Using a laboratory grade mixer with emulsor screen, homogenize the solution at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. Set solution aside.\nPrepare the fatty acid solutions using food grade C18:1. Oxidation can be assessed through gas chromatography if necessary.\nPrepare a series of 13 variants of the fatty acid vehicle (UHT non-fat milk) with increasing concentrations of C18:1 (0.02, 0.06, 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 3.8, 5, 6.4, 8, 9.8, 12, and 20 mM/L). To do this, label 250-ml glass beakers with each concentration.\nAdd 5% liquid paraffin to each beaker (e.g., 5 ml paraffin per 100 ml of milk solution).\nBased on C18:1 concentration, add the appropriate amount of C18:1 to each beaker (see Table 1).\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nC18:1 concentration (mM),μl/100 ml\n0.02,0.56\n0.06,1.9\n1,31.5\n1.4,44.1\n2,63.1\n2.8,88.4\n3.8,119.9\n5,157.8\n6.4,202\n8,250\n9.8,309\n12,380\n20,631.2\nTable 1. Example C18:1 concentration per 100 ml solution. Increasing concentrations (µl/L) of C18:1 are used to prepare the series of 13 emulsions for oral fatty acid threshold testing.\nFollowing use, fill the C18:1 container with N2 to minimize oxidation and store below 4 °C.\nAdd the base milk solution to each fatty acid beaker to a total volume of 100 ml. Set aside.\nUsing the remaining base solution, prepare the control vehicle. In a 2 L glass beaker, add 5% of the remaining volume in liquid paraffin (e.g., 35 ml liquid paraffin in a final volume of 750 ml) together with the remaining base solution and homogenize for 30 sec per 100 ml of liquid.\nHomogenize the control vehicle for 30 sec per 100 ml. This step is conducted prior to the fatty acid solutions to prevent contamination with C18:1.\nHomogenize each fatty acid vehicle, beginning with the lowest concentration for 30 sec per 100 ml.\nSanitize the homogenizer both prior to and following testing.",
    "As the homogenization process can raise the temperature of the solutions, check temperature of control and C18:1 samples with a thermometer. Serve all samples at RT (20 °C).\nMilk samples must be freshly prepared on the same day as testing. Taste each solution prior to testing to assess freshness and suitability.\n\tNote: Depending on volume required, solution preparation will take a minimum of 60 min.\n3. Oral Fatty Acid Threshold Testing\nEnsure that participants have refrained from eating or drinking (including coffee, gum, mouthwash, etc.) for at least 1 hr prior to testing.\nMinimize non-taste cues by conducting testing under red lighting with participants wearing nose clips.\nUse the ascending forced choice triangle procedure to determine oral fatty acid thresholds. Label 30-ml plastic portion cups with a three-digit identification number. Provide each participant with a set of three 20-ml solutions in random order; two control vehicles and one fatty acid vehicle with the lowest concentration of C18:1 (0.02 mM).\nTo determine a participant's oral fatty acid threshold, instruct the participant to taste each solution from left to right and expectorate into a sink. Ask participants to not swallow the samples.\nAsk the participant to identify which of the 3 samples is 'odd' or 'different' and if they are unsure, they must guess (forced choice).\nHave participants rinse their mouth with deionized water after each set of samples.\nIf correctly identified, provide the participant with a second set of 3 solutions (2 control and 1 fatty acid solution in random order) with the same fatty acid concentration. If incorrectly identified, provide the participant with a second set of 3 solutions, but with the next highest concentration of C18:1 (0.06 mM).",
    "Continue this procedure until the participant is able to correctly identify the 'odd' sample 3x in a row at the same concentration. The concentration at which they are able to correctly identify the 'odd' sample is recorded as the participants C18:1 detection threshold. See Figure 1 for a graphical representation of this process.\nBased on detection threshold, characterize participants as hypersensitive, or hyposensitive to C18:1. In line with previous literature, hypersensitive individuals can detect C18:1 at concentrations <3.8 mM, while hyposensitive individuals require concentrations >3.8 mM.\n\tNote: Depending on the number of incorrect answers, the testing procedure can take between 10-30 min to complete.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51236/51236fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Ascending forced choice triangle procedure used for determining fatty acid detection thresholds. Participants are provided with three solutions (two control solutions and one C18:1 solution at a given concentration) and asked to identify the 'odd sample'. If correct, participants are given a second set of samples with the same C18:1 concentration. If incorrect, the participant is provided with another set of samples with a higher concentration of C18:1. This procedure continues until three 'odd' solutions are correctly identified at a given concentration. This point is deemed the individuals 'fatty acid detection threshold'.\n4. Fat Ranking Task\nThis task involves participants tasting four samples of instant custard, each with different fat contents (0, 2, 6, and 10%) and ranking them in order of perceived ascending fat concentration.\nPrepare 1 batch of custard using non-fat instant vanilla custard powder according to packet instructions. Mix 2 tablespoons custard powder, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 2 cups non-fat milk in a microwave safe bowl. If the suggested product is unavailable, this may be substituted with a similar non-fat instant product (e.g., cook and serve custard).",
    "Using high power, heat the mixture using a 1,400 W microwave in 30 sec intervals for a total of approximately 5 min, or until thick. This may vary depending on the brand of custard and the wattage of the microwave used. Allow custard to cool.\nLabel four 500-ml kitchen bowls (or similar) with fat percentages.\nDivide the custard into 4 separate 100-g batches.\nAdd 0, 2, 6, and 10% vegetable oil to each bowl to achieve the desired fat content (e.g., in a 100 g batch, add 0 ml, 2 ml, 6 ml, and 10 ml vegetable oil to achieve respective fat percentages) and combine. Stir each sample well to ensure all ingredients are completely amalgamated.\nLabel four 30-ml plastic portion cups with randomized three-digit numbers. Fill the portion cups with 20 g of each custard (1 type of custard per cup).\nRefrigerate samples prior to testing and serve cold (4 °C).\nCarry testing out under red lights to minimize visual cues.\nHave participants taste, swallow and rank the 4 custards from perceived lowest to highest fat content and receive a score out of 5 depending on their responses.\nScoring for this task is shown in Table 2.\n\tNote: Approximate preparation time for the custard samples is 30 min. The fat ranking task should take no longer than 10 min to complete.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nRanking order,Score\n\"0, 2, 6, 10\",5\n\"2, 0, 6, 10\",4\n\"0, 2, 10, 6\",3\n\"0, 6, 2, 10\",2\n\"1, 6, 10, 2\",1\n\"6, 0, 2, 10\",1\n\"2, 10, 6, 0\",1\n\"2, 6, 0, 10\",0\n\"6, 2, 10, 0\",0\n\"0, 10, 2, 6\",0",
    "Table 2. Fat ranking task scoring. Participants are given 4 samples of custard with 0, 2, 6, or 10% fat added. Participants are asked to rank samples from lowest to highest fat content and score 0 to 5 points (5 being the maximum).\n5. Fatty Food Liking\nPrepare small samples (5-20 g) of both regular and low-fat options of commercially available foods. Foods include regular and low-fat versions of: cream cheese (served on a cracker), chocolate mousse, cheese, dry biscuits, peanut butter dip served on a piece of carrot, mayonnaise, salad dressing (served on a slice of cucumber), and yogurt.\nLabel each sample with a random three-digit number for identification.\nPresent samples in a random order to prevent order effects.\nInstruct participants to taste each sample individually. Food items are ingested, but participants can eat as much or as little of each sample as they desire.\nHave participants rate how much they like or dislike each sample. Measure liking using a 100-mm hedonic generalized magnitude scale (gLMS; see Figure 2) ranging from strongest imaginable dislike to strongest imaginable like. Record liking by placing a vertical line at the point which represents the participants like or dislike of the food.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51236/51236fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Hedonic gLMS. The hedonic gLMS30,31 used to assess liking of both regular and low fat commercially available foods. Participants taste and rate each sample and place a vertical line at the point which best represents their like, or dislike of the sample.\nNon-taste inputs are not minimized for this task, so carry this task out under normal light and do not have participants wear nose clips.\n6. Tongue Photography\nSet up a camera and tripod for photography. Regular indoor lighting is sufficient.\nSet the camera to macro mode (or similar) for close up photography.",
    "Use a hole punch to create a 6-mm diameter circle on a 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm (or similar) square of filter paper. Label the paper with the participant's identification number.\nIn a 50-ml beaker, combine blue food coloring with deionized water at a 1:20 ratio. A small amount is required per participant.\nPour 30 ml food grade ethanol into a 50-ml beaker for tweezer sterilization.\nUsing masking tape, mark a 20 cm x 30 cm rectangle on the side of the testing table (this should be regular desk height), as shown in Figure 3a.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51236/51236fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A) Tongue photography setup. Demonstration of the table setup required prior to tongue photography. B) Tongue photography. Demonstration of the tongue photography method\nHave participants place their elbows on the marked corners of the rectangle, rest their chin in their palms and to comfortably protrude their tongue, using the lips to steady this position (Figure 3b). The participant must remain in this position for the duration of the testing.\nUsing a rectangular (1.5 cm x 3 cm) strip of filter paper, briefly dry the bottom portion of the tongue.\nDip a cotton bud into the food coloring/water solution and transfer a small amount of dye onto the anterior dorsal surface of tongue, immediately right of the midline point and close to the tip (see Figure 4). Dry the tongue for a second time with filter paper.\nDry ethanol sterilized tweezers with paper towel and using tweezers, place the pre-labeled 1.5 cm2 filter paper onto the participant's tongue, with the 6-mm hole over the blue food coloring (see Figure 4).\nUsing flash, take three-digital photographs of the participant's tongue. For confidentiality, ensure only the participant's mouth and tongue are visible.",
    "Remove the 1.5 cm2 filter paper from the participant's tongue with tweezers that have again been sterilized in food grade ethanol. Upload photographs to a photo editing software and with the zoom function, count all visible fungiform papillae.\nDifferentiate fungiform papillae from other papillae as larger mushroom shaped, elevated structures. They do not take on the dye solution as strongly, and as such appear much lighter in color.\n\tNote: Tongue photography should take no longer than 10 min to complete.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51236/51236fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Quantifying fungiform papillae density. Location of the 6-mm area for fungiform papillae assessment. Using photography editing software, numerical figures indicate each fungiform papilla."
