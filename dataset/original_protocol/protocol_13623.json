  "procedures": [
    "Procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology \"George Emil Palade\" of Târgu Mureș, by the Romanian National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority and complied with the International Council for Laboratory Animal Science guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU).\n1. Transesophageal atrial burst pacing protocol\nRandomize adult male Wistar rats (200-400 g of bodyweight) into two groups: STIM and SHAM.\nAnesthetize the animals.\n\t\nFor induction, use 2.5% isoflurane, 4 L/min, 99.5% O2.\nFor maintenance, use a mixture of ketamine/medetomidine (75.0/0.5 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally.\nCheck the depth of the anesthesia by testing the corneal reflex (5% glucose solution) and the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (toe pinch). Monitor the respiratory rate (a fall of 50% is acceptable during anesthesia; normal rate is between 70-120 breaths/minute) and the body temperature using a rectal thermometer (normal temperature is between 96.5 - 99.5 °F or 35.9 - 37.5 °C).\n\t\tNOTE: Continue the procedure only after the effectiveness of anesthesia is confirmed. Monitor the depth of anesthesia periodically throughout the protocol. Repeat the intraperitoneal ketamine/medetomidine injection when needed.\nApply an ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent corneal damage.\nLay the animal in supine position and place it on a heating pad to maintain body temperature at ~37 °C.\nAttach the three surface ECG electrodes to the rat limbs in a lead II configuration (Figure 1A).\n\t\nPlace the negative electrode on the right forelimb.\nPlace the positive electrode on the left hindlimb.\nPlace the grounding electrode on the left forelimb.\nSecure the electrodes into position using thin elastic bracelet string cords.\nTurn on the surface ECG recording and perform continuous ECG recording throughout the procedure (Figure 1B) using a commercial or a locally developed acquisition program10.",
    "For electrical stimulation, use a 5-6 F quadripolar catheter connected to a microcontroller-based cardiac pacemaker10.\nOnce the animal is anesthetized, insert the catheter through the oral cavity, into the esophagus. Measure the distance between the upper incisors and the heart (assessed by palpation) to approximate the depth at which the catheter should be inserted into the esophagus.\n\tCAUTION: Be careful not to force the catheter as there is a risk of esophageal perforation.\nConfirm the correct position of the stimulation catheter at the level of the atria as follows.\n\t\nApply electrical stimulation at a frequency of 400 stimuli/minute (stimulus duration 6 ms).\nCheck whether the ECG tracing shows constant capture of the atria (i.e., each electrical stimulus is followed by a narrow QRS complex) (Figure 2).\nDetermine the diastolic threshold—i.e., the lowest voltage required to obtain atrial capture (generally, between 10 V and 20 V).\n\tNOTE: Perform the following for the animals in the STIM group.\nOnce the correct position of the catheter is determined, set the stimulator to a frequency of 4,000 stimuli/minute (stimulus duration 6 ms), at a voltage 3 V above the diastolic threshold (Figure 3).\nApply to each animal 15 successive cycles of stimulation, 20 s each, with a free interval of 5 min between cycles11. Depending on the study objectives, repeat the protocol for each rat for 10 days, at a rate of 5 days/week, at the same time on each day.\nCheck the effectiveness of the stimulation as follows.\n\t\nIdentify the sinus node recovery time (SNRT), which appears at the end of the rapid pacing as a time interval that is longer than the cycle length recorded during sinus rhythm (Figure 4A) and represents the interval of time required for resumption of sinus rhythm after overdrive suppression ends.",
    "NOTE: Overdrive suppression represents the inhibition of sinus node activity by electrically stimulating the heart at a rate higher than the intrinsic rhythm.\nIdentify the occurrence of the AF episode, which is defined here as the presence of three or more consecutive irregular, supraventricular beats (i.e., irregular ventricular response with narrow QRS complexes), with P-waves absent or replaced by small, distorted \"f\" waves (Figure 4B).\nIf the AF episode does not end spontaneously by the time the next stimulation cycle should be performed (i.e., by the end of the five free minutes between cycles), do not apply the next stimulation.\n\t\nWait for another 5 min. If the AF episode still continues after those 10 min, end the protocol for that day.\n\t\tNOTE: If evaluation of the severity of electrically-induced AF is desired, longer ECG monitoring can be performed.\nIf severe bradycardia or asystole occurs at the end of the stimulation (i.e., due to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve), end the protocol. If the electrical activity does not return to normal rapidly, perform external cardiac massage and administer atropine sulfate (0.05 mg/kg) intraperitoneally.\nAt the end of the procedure, reverse the anesthesia with atipamezole (1 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. House the rats individually in clean cages with supplemental heat and observe periodically until they are fully recovered. No other specific animal care is required at the end of the protocol.\nAnalyze the surface ECG tracings and determine the following.\n\t\nThe inducibility of AF which is expressed in percentage (i.e., [number of stimulation cycles followed by AF episodes / total number of stimulation cycles applied] x 100).\nThe duration of each AF episode.\nThe presence of 'persistent' (i.e., >10 min) AF episodes.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform the following for the animals in the SHAM group.",
    "For the rats in the SHAM group, follow steps 1.1 to 1.7 as described above, without applying any electrical stimulation.\nMaintain the catheter into position for 80 min (i.e., the time required for completing the protocol in STIM rats) without applying any electrical stimulation, while continuously recording the surface ECG.\nAt the end of the procedure, reverse the anesthesia with atipamezole (1 mg/kg). No other specific animal care is required at the end of the protocol.\nAnalyze the surface ECG tracings and determine the parameters described in step 1.16.\nSubscription Required.
