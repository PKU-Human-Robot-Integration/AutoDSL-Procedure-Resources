    "Yeast protein hydrolysates were used as samples for the Representative results of this work. The entire protocol is summarized in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of materials and reagents\nMethanol/water: prepare a mixture of two parts of 99% methanol (MeOH) and one part of H2O, designated as MeOH/H2O. Store pure MeOH and MeOH/H2O at -20 °C to minimize alcohol evaporation and increase sample stability.\nHydrochloric acid (HCl): dilute 9 mol/L from concentrated HCl (12.0 mol/L or 37%) as well as 0.1 mol/L of HCl. The higher concentrated (9 mol/L) solution is used for protein hydrolysis, while the lower concentrated (0.1 mol/L) one is used for solid-phase extraction.\n\tCAUTION: Work inside the fume hood.\nPrepare a Replacement solution for SPE containing 10% of a saturated ammonia solution (stock: 30% w/w ammonia), 50% of methanol, and 40% of water (v/v).\nNMR Buffer: Dissolve 5.56 g of disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4, 0.08 mol/L), 0.4 g of 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic acid-2,2,3,3-d4 sodium salt (TSP, 5 mmol/L), 0.04 % (w/v) of sodium azide (NaN3) in 500 mL of deuterium dioxide (D2O) and adjust to pH 7.4 (using HCl or NaOH, respectively) (see Table of Materials). Check the purity of each new buffer batch by NMR spectroscopy.\n\tNOTE: The amount of any contaminants (e.g., ethanol) should be as low as possible.\nFill pulping tubes with zirconium oxide beads (2 mL tubes and 1.4 mm beads are suitable for most applications, but different variants are available) (see Table of Materials). Fill roughly 10-20 beads by hand or buy pre-filled tubes, which are also available.\nKeep pipettes and the respective tips ready in the range of 10-1,000 µL.\n\t​NOTE: Highly pure water, designated as H2O, defined by a high resistance of ≥18.2 MΩ·cm-1, was used throughout the work. It corresponds to double distilled water.\n2. Sample collection and storage",
    "Flash freeze the liquid samples (serum/plasma, cell culture supernatant, etc.) with liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C until usage.\nPrepare the solid materials as mentioned below.\n\t\nCollect the cells from cell cultures (3-5 million cells) either by collecting adherent cells, after washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraping and centrifugation, or direct centrifugation of cells grown in suspension.\nRemove the cell supernatants (which might be collected for further analysis, either by consecutive direct measurement, see step 6, or after precipitation of soluble proteins, see step 3.1), and then flash freeze the pellets with liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. For further processing, see step 3.2.\nStore and collect the tissues as per the aim of the study. For very homogenous tissues, such as the liver or muscle, analyze any part of it. For example, in the case of a mouse brain, determine global arginine methylation of the entire brain or brain sections.\n\t\t​NOTE: The ideal weight of tissues to be processed is 30-60 mg. It is advisable to freeze and pulverize the entire brain and use aliquots thereof. Alternatively, specific brain parts (e.g., frontal, cerebellum, occipital regions, or one hemisphere, weighing ~250 mg) may be used.\n3. Preliminary sample preparation\nNOTE: Perform the work on ice, keeping MeOH cold. The samples must also be kept on ice to avoid protein degradation.\nFor liquid samples, add 400 µL of ice-cold methanol to 200 µL of the sample. Continue with step 3.3.\n\tNOTE: If less sample is available, adjust the volumes accordingly; NMR sensitivity is usually high enough for smaller sample amounts, but has to be tested individually.\nIn the case of solid materials, prepare enough 1.5 mL tubes for the lysates (use for centrifugation after homogenization).",
    "Carefully, but thoroughly, resuspend the cell pellets in 600 µL of MeOH/H2O and transfer the entire liquid phase into the pulping tubes.\nPlace tissues into pulping tubes (you may directly weigh them into the tubes) and add 600 µL of MeOH/H2O (for 30-60 mg; adjust if weight differs substantially).\nPut the tubes into the tissue homogenizer (see Table of Materials) and either homogenize one time for 20 s with heavy shaking (for cell pellets, soft tissues) or two times for 20 s each (or longer if necessary) with an interval of 5 min in between (for stiff tissues).\nAfter homogenization, immediately put samples on the ice again and transfer the whole lysates into new 1.5 mL tubes.\nStore samples for at least 30 min (up to several days) at -20 °C before further processing.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. In the meantime, prepare enough 1.5 mL tubes to collect the supernatants.\n\tNOTE: This supernatant (designated \"(1)\" in Figure 1) might be discarded, be lyophilized, and directly processed for NMR (step 6) or analyzed otherwise.\nIn this protocol, the MeOH precipitate (= pellet obtained after step 3.1 or 3.2.2, respectively) is used for further analysis containing, among other things, components such as nucleic acids and lipids, arginine-methylated proteins. Continue with protein hydrolysis or store the pellets at -20 °C for a few days.\n4. Protein hydrolysis\nAdd 500 µL of 9 mol/L of HCl to each sample. Then, truncate the caps of each tube with scissors and place them into the glass culture tubes (Figure 2A). Carefully, but tightly, close the red caps (thereby checking the sealing).\n\tNOTE: Before use, always check each sealing (gray PTFE foil inside the red screw caps) for proper tightening and regularly clean them with water.",
    "When finished, place the tubes into a beaker partly filled with sand (for better heat transfer) and hydrolyze samples for about 16 h at 110 °C in a drying chamber.\nFollowing hydrolysis, cool down the samples (~1 h).\nAfter that, lyophilize overnight using a centrifuge with a high vacuum (below 100 Pa).\nDissolve the pellets - if completely dry (if not, continue lyophilization) - in 1 mL of 0.1 mol/L HCl and add 50 µL of chloroform (CHCl3) to each tube; thoroughly dissolve the pellet with a 1,000 µL pipette, thereby mixing the liquids, and then transfer the complete volume into a new tube.\n\tCAUTION: Always work with small amounts to minimize extensive evaporation\nThen, centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nCarefully collect the upper phase of the biphasic liquid containing the water-soluble fraction (Figure 2B, the fraction with the lower density) with a pipette and fill it into new tubes. Use 1.5 mL tubes for manual SPE (section 5.2) or glass vials for robotic SPE (section 5.3 and Figure 2D). Avoid spilling over CHCl3 and its contents (Figure 2C).\n5. Solid-phase extraction (SPE)\nBefore the first usage, clean the SPE cartridges two times with 1 mL of the replacement solution (step 1.3) followed by centrifugation at 800 x g for 1 min at room temperature (placed into 15 mL tubes). They can be used 10-20 times each.\nManual SPE\n\t\nPre-condition the cartridges (see Table of Materials) in every run with 1 mL of pure methanol and 2 x 1 mL of PBS, each time followed by centrifugation at 800 x g for 1 min at room temperature (placed into 15 mL tubes).",
    "After that, load the samples (from step 4.7) onto the SPE cartridges and centrifuge them at 600 x g for 2 min at room temperature.\nThen, apply a washing cycle as mentioned below.\n\t\t\nAdd three times 1 mL of H2O (each followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 800 x g at room temperature).\nAdd five times 1 mL of 0.1 mol/L HCl (each followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 800 x g at room temperature).\nAdd two times 1 mL of MeOH (each followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 800 x g at room temperature).\nThen, eluate arginine and its derivatives with 3 x 1 mL of replacement solution (followed by centrifugation 1 min at 800 x g at room temperature) into a single 15 mL tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The replacement solution serves as eluent for arginine and derivatives and is also used for cleaning the cartridges (all substances are either washed out before elution or at the basic pH value of the replacement solution). Still, to avoid contamination over time, the re-usage should be limited (see step 5.1).\nRobotic SPE\n\tNOTE: Here, a pipetting robot (the main part consisting of a pipetting needle, a washing station for the needle, a reagent supply, and positions for samples and eluates, see Table of Materials) is supplied with a cartridge holder for the SPE columns. For other instruments, make sure to be fully equipped with all things listed.\n\t\nFill the supernatant (from step 4.7) directly into glass vials with PTFE sealing (Figure 2D), prepare enough reagents (100 mL of each, i.e., replacement solution, 99% of MeOH, PBS, H2O, and 0.1 of mol/L HCl), 5 mL tubes for elution and washing solution for the needle of the robot (usually H2O).",
    "Use an application or method in the software of the robot based precisely on the steps described for manual SPE (step 5.2).\n\t\tNOTE: The details may vary a lot among instrument suppliers, so refer to the software manual of the respective robot for programming. A pipetting robot usually works by applying air pressure onto the cartridges instead of centrifugation, which is the main difference. If the protocol is established and run for the first time, include controls (e.g., L-arginine of known concentration) to verify an optimal workflow.\n6. Final preparation for NMR\nLyophilize samples overnight to complete dryness to get rid of ammonia and H2O.\nDissolve each sample in 500 µL of NMR buffer (step 1.4) and transfer to NMR tubes. Importantly, the volume must be the same in all tubes, and samples must be homogenous (free of residues and lipids, which tend to aggregate).\n\tNOTE: The details of NMR spectroscopy go beyond this method review and are described in more detail elsewhere27. Here, only the main requirements and steps are explained. The quantification of arginine and its metabolites are performed on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (see Table of Materials). In principle, any other NMR spectrometer/NMR field strengths can be used, provided that the NMR signals of arginine and methylated arginines can be detected with sufficient sensitivity and without signal overlap. Any probe head with z-axis gradients able to record 1H-spectra can be used, provided that the pulse sequences are set up accordingly.\nRecord a 1D spectrum using the CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) pulse sequence33,34 (cpmgpr1d, 512 scans, size of fid 73728, 11904.76 Hz spectral width on a 600 MHz NMR, recycle delay 4 s) with water signal suppression using presaturation.",
    "In these experiments, remove the 1H scalar couplings by virtual decoupling, reducing signal overlap. Record additional for specific questions and/or complex samples or matrices, e.g., 1H-13C-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra27.\n\tNOTE: For more complex matrices in which 1H NMR signals of methylated arginines could be partially overlapped with 1H NMR signals of other metabolites (e.g., lysine), 1H homo-nuclear J-resolved spectra (JRES)35 are required.\nPerform absolute quantification by integrating the respective peak intensities of standards of a known concentration, e.g., 100 µmol/arginine.\n\tNOTE: Routinely, ADMA, SDMA, and MMA (see Table of Materials) are reported as a ratio relative to arginine. This has a significant advantage that no separate normalization (e.g., cell number, tissue mass, protein concentrations) needs to be performed. In that case, arginine serves as an internal standard, and relative quantification is sufficient to gain biologically relevant information.\nFor differentiation of SDMA and MMA, lyophilize the samples again be to get rid of D2O (if they have been resuspended in NMR buffer before), which is then replaced by deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (d6-DMSO), enabling the resolution of methyl resonances27. Therefore, aspirate the samples from the NMR tubes with Pasteur pipettes, lyophilize, and dissolve them in 500 µL of d6-DMSO.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
