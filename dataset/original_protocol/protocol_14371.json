    "Animals (male and female mice) were born and bred in an accredited animal facility, in accordance and approval of the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. Euthanasia methods must be consistent with all national and institutional regulations.\n1. Detection of Mitophagy in Human Cells\nDetection of mitophagy using mt-Keima plasmid\n\tNOTE: The Keima protein, fused to a mitochondria target signal, simplified as mt-Keima, has proved useful for in vivo mitophagy detection. mt-Keima is a ratiometric pH-sensitive fluorescent protein which exhibits green fluorescence (excitation 458 nm) in basic or neutral conditions and red fluorescence (excitation 561 nm) in acidic conditions. Healthy mitochondria thrive in basic or neutral conditions (pH 7-8) and are indicated by green fluorescence when transfected with mt-Keima. When mitochondria undergo mitophagy and fuse with acidic lysosomes, the pH drops to 4.5 and mitochondria containing mt-Keima exhibit red fluorescence6,13,14. Importantly, mt-Keima is resistant to lysosomal proteases, enabling evaluation of mitophagy over longer periods. The protocol below is designed for 6-well plates.\n\t\nDay 1: Use either primary human cells (e.g., fibroblasts) or immortalized human cells (e.g., Hela Cells or U2OS cells). Seed approximately 0.3-1 × 106 cells/well (depending on the cell growth rate to allow cells to reach 70% confluency on the next day) in a 6-well plate. Maintain the cells in complete cell culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1% mixed solution of penicillin-streptomycin), and incubate in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C (20% O2, 5% CO2). Add 1 mL complete cell culture medium/well in a 6-well plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Gene overexpression/knockdown or drug treatments can be done at this stage6.\nDay 2: Mix mt-Keima plasmid DNA6 and DNA transfection reagent (the mixture for one well of a 6-well plate).",
    "Dilute 15 µL of a DNA transfection reagent with 150 µL of serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nDilute 2-5 µg of mt-Keima plasmid DNA with 150 µL of serum-free medium.\nAdd diluted mt-Keima plasmid to diluted DNA transfection reagent, vortex for 10 s, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Optimization of DNA transfection conditions may be necessary depending on the plate size (see the manufacturers' protocols for details).\nAdd DNA/transfection reagent mixture dropwise to cells, then shake the plates gently for 5-10 s until the solution is completely mixed.\nDay 3: Change the media by replacing the DNA transfection reagent-containing medium with fresh complete cell culture medium (1 mL/well).\nDay 4: Image the cells using confocal microscopy6. Use two imaging channels: green channel (excitation 458 nm, emission 570-695 nm) to visualize normal mitochondria and red channel (excitation 561 nm, emission 570-695 nm) to visualize mitochondria which are undergoing mitophagy. Randomly image 20 areas under 40x magnification to cover a total of 100-200 cells in every well.\nPerform data analysis. Calculate the \"mitophagy index\" (percentage of mitochondria undergoing mitophagy), using image analysis software to quantify the amount of fluorescence in both the red and green channels: take the ratio of red fluorescence to red + green fluorescence, and multiply by 1006.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatives to transfection include using mt-Keima stably expressed HeLa cell lines14. Since HeLa cells do not express Parkin, Parkin must be stably expressed to study Parkin-dependent mitophagy in this cell line.\nDetection of mitophagy using the colocalization between Cytochrome C oxidase subunit II (COXII) and LAMP2\n\tNOTE: COXII is a mitochondrial genome-encoded inner membrane protein. The 'mitophagy index' equals the ratio of COXII colocalized with LAMP2 expressed as a percentage of the total amount of COXII.",
    "Seed HeLa cells (or other cells of interest mentioned in step 1.1.1) in a 4-well chamber slide (1-5 × 104 cells in 1 mL complete cell culture medium/well) in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C (20% O2, 5% CO2) overnight.\nAdd 3.0 µL of 10 mM carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and incubate in the cell culture incubator (step 1.2.1) for 3 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Other drugs affecting mitophagy may be used.\nRemove the culture medium using a 1 mL pipette, wash the cells twice with 1 mL/well of cold (0-4 °C) 1x PBS. Let the solution sit for 10-30 s before the next wash. Then add 0.5 mL 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS to each well and incubate for 10 min on ice to fix the cells.\n\t\tCaution: PFA is toxin. Work in a fume hood when using PFA.\nDiscard the PFA solution using a 1 mL pipette, wash the cells twice with cold 1X PBS (1 mL/well; let solution sit for 10 s before the next wash), and permeabilize the cells with 1 mL/well of 0.25% detergent (in 1x PBS) for 10 min on ice.\nDiscard the permeabilizing buffer, gently wash the cells twice with cold 1x PBS and discard (let the solution sit for 10 s between washes). Block the cells with 1 mL/well of 5% FBS in 1x PBS overnight at 4 °C. Cover the chambers to prevent moisture loss.\nPrepare 0.5 mL/well of a mixed antibody solution with COXII antibody (mouse, 1:250 dilution) and LAMP2 antibody (rabbit, 1:20-1:50 dilution) in 1x PBS with 5% FBS, and store on ice for 0.5-1 h.",
    "Take out the 4-well chamber slide from the cold room and discard the blocking solution with a 1 mL pipette. Gently wash the cells twice with 1 mL/well of cold 1x PBS and discard (let the solution sit for 10 s between washes), then add 0.5 mL/well of mixed antibody solution. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h on a shaker at low speed.\nDiscard the first antibody solution using a 1 mL pipette and gently wash the cells three times with 1 mL/well of cold 1x PBS and discard. Let the solution sits for 10 s before the next wash. Add 1 mL/well of fluorescent secondary antibodies (e.g., goat anti-rabbit with wavelength 568 nm of red fluorescent protein (RFP) for LAMP2; and goat anti-mouse with wavelength 488 nm of green fluorescent protein (GFP) for COXII) in 1:250 dilution with 5% FBS in 1x PBS. Cover the 4-well chamber slide with aluminum foil and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h on a shaker at low speed.\nDiscard the second antibody solution with a 1 mL pipette. Gently wash the cells six times with 1 mL/well of cold 1x PBS. Let the solution sit for 1 min before the next wash.\nMount the cells with 50 µL/well of antifade mounting medium with DAPI, and add cover slips.\nImage the cells under a confocal microscope with 66x magnification and immersion oil (Tile scans/ mosaics may be used to increase the number of cells imaged by the software). Use the same settings such as channel exposure time, digital gain, digital offset, etc. throughout all imaging processes (see software instructions for details)15.",
    "Use colocalization analysis software to quantitatively analyze at least 20 random images of 100 cells15. Use the \"Closed Bezier\" function to select entire individual cells. Compare the Pearson's colocalization coefficient of GFP to RFP, either weighted or unweighted, to determine mitophagy levels in analyzed cells. Maintain values for horizontal and vertical crosshairs of the colocalization analysis software throughout analysis. To accurately set these crosshairs, prepare two extra sets of cells and label one COXII and the other LAMP2. Then, set crosshairs directly above the pixel distribution for each channel15 (see software instructions for details).\nA high throughput imaging measurement for mitophagy screening\n\tNOTE: Performing high throughput screens of mitophagy-inducing or mitophagy-inhibiting compounds from large compound libraries is technically demanding. An imaging technique based on the colocalization of mitochondria with autophagosomes is a more simplistic, yet highly sensitive alternative for mitophagy screening16.\n\t\nDay 1: Seed cells (e.g., human primary fibroblasts at 5,000 cells/100 mL cell culture media/well) in a 96-well plate (see step 1.1.1).\nDay 2: Treat the cells from the second day with FCCP or other compounds of interest for designated incubation time (see step 1.2.2).\nFollow steps 1.2.2-1.2.9 using the primary antibodies for COXII (mouse, 1:250 dilution with 5% FBS in 1x PBS) and LC3B (rabbit, 1:100-1:200 dilution with 5% FBS in 1x PBS). Alternatively, primary antibodies for COXII and LAMP2 may be used.\nImage the cells using a fluorescent reader16. Collect images in randomly placed fields and with a minimum 500 cells/well.\nAnalyze data using a cell analyzer customized protocol16.\n2. Detection of Mitophagy in C. elegans",
    "NOTE: The nematode C. elegans provides a platform to assay mitophagy at the organismal level. Two strains can be used to monitor mitophagy: (1) mitochondria-targeted Rosella (mtRosella) or (2) mitophagy receptor DCT-1 fused with GFP along with autophagosomal marker LGG-1 fused with Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed)5,17.\nMitophagy monitoring using Rosella biosensor\n\tNOTE: Rosella is a molecular biosensor that combines a pH-insensitive DsRed fused to a pH-sensitive GFP variant. The Rosella biosensor takes advantage of the pH differences between the acidic lysosome (pH ~4.5) and other cellular compartments. This biosensor has been used to successfully monitor mitophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several mammalian cell lines, such as HeLa, HEK293, and HCT11618,19. We adapted this versatile dual-fluorescent reporter and generated transgenic C. elegans nematodes expressing mitochondria-targeted Rosella (mtRosella) in body-wall muscle cells. Mitophagy induction is indicated by a reduced GFP/DsRed ratio of mtRosella fluorescence.\n\t\nDay 1: Pick L4 larvae of worms expressing mitochondria-targeted Rosella (mtRosella) in body-wall muscle cells onto a Nematode Growth Media (NGM) plate seeded with E. coli (OP50) using a dissection microscope5. Place 10-20 worms/plate on at least three 3.5 cm plates. Incubate the nematodes at the standard temperature of 20 °C5.\n\t\tNOTE: See reference for the worm anatomy, including identification of L4 larvae20, and the way to make a pick which is used to transfer worms from one location to another21.\nDay 5: Synchronize nematodes by selecting 15-20 L4 transgenic larvae and transferring them onto fresh OP50 seeded NGM plate. Use at least five plates per experimental condition.\nDay 7: Prepare vehicle plates for mitophagy-affecting drugs of interest or positive controls.",
    "Kill E. coli (OP50) bacteria seeded by exposing NGM plates for 15 min with 222 µW/cm2 (intensity) of UV light to ensure that mitophagy-inducing compounds are not metabolized by bacteria. Plates must be exposed with 2,000 J/m2.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Seconds of exposure needed = 2,000/((intensity in µW/cm2)*100).\nAdd compound(s) of interest to the top of seeded NGM plates. Add an equivalent amount of compound vehicle (solvent used to dissolve compound, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) to the vehicle plates as a negative control. For positive control of mitophagy induction, a mitochondrial toxicant, paraquat (8 mM final concentration) was used. Add a solution containing 10 µL of 8 M paraquat stock with 190 µL of ddH2O on the top of the agar plate for the treatment group. For the vehicle group, add a solution containing 10 µL of DMSO with 190 µL of ddH2O on the top of the agar plate.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The paraquat-working solution may be kept for 1 month at 4 °C.\nGently swirl the plates until the drug or vehicle coats the entire surface. Allow the plates to dry with the lids closed at room temperature for at least 1 h before transferring the worms.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Drug plates can also be prepared by adding drugs in the liquid NGM before it solidifies.\nDay 7: Transfer 10-20 of 2-day-old adult transgenic animals prepared in step 2.1.2 to plates containing either paraquat, compound(s) of interest, or vehicle (DMSO). Incubate the transgenic animals at 20 °C for 2 days.\nDay 9: Prepare 2% agarose pads (see Supplementary Material). Then add one droplet (10 µL) of 20 mM levamisole in M9 per pad. Immobilize the transgenic animals for imaging, by placing them in the M9-levamisole drop. Gently place a coverslip on the top.",
    "Capture single transgenic animals using a camera attached to an epifluorescence microscope. Acquire fluorescent images of whole transgenic nematodes expressing mtRosella in body-wall muscle cells at 10X magnification5. Save the collected images.\nProcess the acquired images with ImageJ software. Analyze the body wall muscle cells located in the head of the worm to avoid autofluorescence in the intestinal tissue. Measure the average pixel intensity value and total area for each fluorescent image only of the head region of each animal. To analyze the specific area of interest:\n\t\t\nSelect 'split channel' under the 'image' and 'color' drop-down menu to convert images .\nUtilize the 'freehand selection' tool to capture the fluorescent area of interest.\nSelect the 'measurement' command under the 'analyze' drop-down menu and perform pixel intensity analysis.\nPixel intensity should be normalized by dividing intensity by the total area analyzed. Upon normalization, calculate the GFP to DsRed ratio22.\nUse statistical analysis software to either conduct student t-test (comparison between two groups) or ANOVA (comparison among multiple groups) for statistical analysis with p < 0.05 as significant5,17.\nAssessing mitophagy using co-localization between DCT-1 and LGG-1\n\tNOTE: DCT-1 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that acts as a mitophagy receptor in response to stress conditions, similar to its putative orthologues BNIP3 and NIX/BNIP3L in mammals5. Thus, mitophagy initiation is assessed by co-localization between DCT-1 mitophagy receptor and autophagosomal membrane protein LGG-1 (homolog of the mammalian LC3).\n\t\nDay 1: Pick L4 larvae of transgenic animals expressing both DCT-1::GFP and DsRed::LGG-1 in body-wall muscle cells5 onto an OP50 seeded NGM plate. Place 5-10 worms/3.5 cm plate, and use at least three plates. Incubate the nematodes at 20 °C.",
    "NOTE: The transgenes are located on separate plasmids and they are not integrated in the genome. Pick up nematodes carrying both rol-6(su1006) and pmyo-2 GFP contransformation markers. Only transgenic worms with both contransformation markers express both DCT-1::GFP and DsRed::LGG-1 in body-wall muscle cells.\nFollow the steps from 2.1.2-2.1.5.\nImage single body-wall muscle cells using a camera attached to a confocal microscope5,23. Detect the borders of entire body-wall muscle cells and take z-stack images under 63x magnification. Higher magnification can also be used.\nOpen and process images acquired with the confocal software. Initiation of mitophagy is indicated by co-localization of the mitophagy receptor (DCT-1::GFP) to the autophagosomal marker (DsRed::LGG-1). Manually measure co-localization events in each stack of body-wall muscle cell5. It is essential to keep all microscope and camera settings (lens and magnifier, filters, exposure time, resolution, laser intensity, gain, etc.) consistent throughout experiments. All settings should be noted.\nUse statistical analysis software to either conduct student t-test (comparison between two groups) or ANOVA (comparison among multiple groups) for statistical analysis with p < 0.05 as significant5,17. For two-way comparisons use the Student's t-test (p < 0.05 is considered significant). For multiple comparisons use the single factor (ANOVA) variance analysis, corrected by the post hoc Bonferroni test. We recommend analyzing at least 50-70 animals or 30-50 body-wall muscle cells for each experimental condition. Repeat the experiment at least three times.\n3. Detection of Mitophagy in Mice\nNOTE: Previous methods to detect mitophagy in mice were cumbersome, insensitive, and difficult to quantify. A transgenic mouse model expressing the mitochondrial-targeted form of the fluorescent reporter Keima (mt-Keima) can now be utilized to assess levels of mitophagy in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological conditions.\nEuthanize mice using a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee14.",
    "Secure the mouse (ventral side up) to the working platform using pins in the limbs. Make an incision in the lower abdomen using microsurgery scissors and forceps to expose the liver24. Cut a piece of liver (e.g., a piece of right lobe at 1 × 1 × 1 cm) using microsurgery scissors and forceps.\n\tNOTE: Detection of mitophagy in mice is complicated and requires knowledge on mouse anatomy and highly skillful mouse handling and mouse surgery. This protocol provides basic, key steps on this method, and a more detailed method is available24.\nPlace the liver sample on a metal plate on ice to rapidly cool the tissue. Keep the tissue on the cold metal plate and process as quickly as possible. Optimally, use within 1 h of dissection.\nLift the liver sample using curved forceps and rinse with 5 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS.\nTransfer the liver to a Petri dish (Ø 100 mm) on ice using the spoon end of a spatula.\nCut the liver sample by hand into 0.5-1 mm thick sections using single-edge blades.\nCarefully transfer the tissue sections to a glass bottom dish using microsurgery forceps.\nCarefully set the liver section with forceps to flatten on the bottom.\nCover the sliced liver with 3-5 drops of cold 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: DAPI staining is recommended to identify the region of interest in certain tissues (e.g., brain)24. To validate co-localization of the red mt-Keima signal with the lysosome, lysosomal dyes, such as dextran cascade blue and lysosensor, can be used24.",
    "Image the tissue sections under confocal microscopy via two sequential excitations24. Set two imaging channels: \"green\" mt-Keima channel (excitation 458 nm, emission 570-695 nm range) and \"red\" mt-Keima (excitation 561 nm, emission 570-695 nm range). Maintain imaging settings between experimental conditions. For more efficient imaging, analyze two animals at once.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
