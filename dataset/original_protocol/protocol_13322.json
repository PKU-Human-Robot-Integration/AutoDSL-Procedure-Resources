  "procedures": [
    "The Zanba-stir-fried TBC processing method was optimized and standardized by CRITIC combined with the Box-Behnken response surface method. Benzoylaconitine, aconitine, and 3-deoxyaconitine were used as evaluation indexes during this procedure.\n1. Sample solution preparation\nPrepare the reference substance stock solution. Weigh precisely 9.94 mg of benzoylaconitine, 8.49 mg of aconitine, and 6.25 mg of 3-deoxyaconitine (Table of Materials) on an electronic analytical balance and place them in a 10 mL volumetric flask. Then, add 0.05% hydrochloric acid methanol solution to dissolve the solids and make up the volume to 10 mL. Finally, shake the mixture well to obtain the reference substance stock solution with mass concentrations of 0.9940 mg/mL benzoylaconitine, 0.8490 mg/mL aconitine, and 0.6250 mg/mL of 3-deoxyaconitine.\n\tCAUTION: Hydrochloric acid is a highly corrosive material11. Use proper protection, such as gloves, a lab coat, goggles, and a fume hood.\nPrepare the test sample solution.\n\t\nWeigh 2 g of Zanba-stir-fried TBC powder in a conical flask.\n\t\t\nPrepare Zanba-stir-fried TBC by weighing 30 g of TBC (2 cm) and 90 g of Zanba and adding them into the preheated stir-fry machine. Set the time and temperature of the stir-fry machine to 40 min and 140 °C, respectively. Set the machine to complete processing.\nUse a high-speed smashing machine to grind the Zanba-stir-fried TBC separately into powder samples that can pass through a 50 mesh (0.355 mm) sieve.\nAdd 3 mL of ammonia solution and 50 mL of a mixed solution of isopropyl alcohol and ethyl acetate (a ratio of 1:1 v/v) into the above conical flask, based on previous studies12,13.",
    "NOTE: To prepare the ammonia solution, add 40 mL of concentrated ammonia solution into a 100 mL volumetric flask and fill with purified water to the measuring line. Take appropriate protective measures when using concentrated ammonia solution as it has a strong smell.\nWeigh the above sample and conical flask and record the weight. Ultrasonicate for 30 min (voltage: 220 V, frequency: 40 kHz).\n\t\tNOTE: Aconitine alkaloids are easily decomposed by heat. Thus, the temperature of ultrasonic extraction must be below 25 °C.\nWeigh the sample and conical flask after ultrasonic extraction.\nMake up for the lost weight by adding a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and ethyl acetate (ratio of 1:1 v/v).\nFilter the sample solution. Evaporate 25 mL of the filtrate to dryness using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C.\nDissolve the residue by adding 5 mL of 0.05% hydrochloric acid methanol solution, filter the solution through a 0.2 µm syringe filter, and analyze it by performing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nPrepare a mixed reference solution that contains 0.1988 mg/mL benzoylaconitine, 0.0509 mg/mL aconitine, and 0.0938 mg/mL 3-deoxyaconitine.\n\tNOTE: Each standard (0.9940 mg of benzoylaconitine, 0.2545 mg of aconitine, and 0.4690 mg of 3-deoxyaconitine) is dissolved in a 5 mL volumetric flask in 0.05% hydrochloric acid methanol as the dissolution medium.\nPrepare 0.04 M ammonium acetate buffer by dissolving 6.16 g of ammonium acetate (Table of Materials) in 2 L of ultrapure water (mobile phase A). Adjust the pH to 8.50 using ammonia.\n\tCAUTION: Ammonia is a hazardous material. Use proper protection, such as gloves, a lab coat, goggles, and a fume hood.\nFilter 2 L of ultrapure 100% acetonitrile (mobile phase B) and degas it.\n\tCAUTION: Acetonitrile is a hazardous material13. Use proper protection, such as gloves, a lab coat, goggles, and a fume hood.\n2. Chromatographic condition",
    "Inject 10 µL of the pretreated sample solutions into an HPLC system with binary pumps. Use an HPLC system employing an ODS-3 column (5 µm x 4.6 mm x 250 mm; working at 30 °C) with mobile phases A and B for the MDA and DDAs separation. Inject each sample three times for technical replication.\nProgram the method as shown in Table 1 for the ODS-3 column. Set a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength as 235 nm.\nRecord the peak areas of every target compound.\n\tNOTE: Details of the instruments can be found in the Table of Materials.\n3. System adaptability test\nNOTE: Refer to section 2 for the chromatographic conditions to perform steps 3.1-3.5.\nInvestigate the linear relationship between the concentration and peak area.\n\t\nPrepare various concentrations - 19.88, 39.76, 59.64, 159.04, 198.80, and 497.00 µg/mL - of benzoylaconitine solution.\nPrepare various concentrations - 8.49, 16.98, 25.47, 33.96, 50.94, and 169.80 µg/mL - of aconitine solution.\nPrepare various concentrations - 1.875, 12.50, 37.50, 62.50, 93.75, and 125.00 µg/mL - of 3-deoxyaconitine solution.\nInject the above reference solutions from low mass concentration to high mass concentration and record the peak areas.\nObtain three linear regression equations from the plot of the reference solution concentration (µg/L) against the peak area.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the concentrations of benzoylaconitine, aconitine, and 3-deoxyaconitine fall within the linear range of this standard curve.\nPerform precision testing by continuously injecting six repeats of 10 µL of the sample solution into the HPLC system and run the samples under the same HPLC conditions described in section 2. Record the peak areas of benzoylaconitine, aconitine, and 3-deoxyaconitine.",
    "Perform stability testing experiments by injecting 10 µL of the prepared sample solution and determine the peak areas after 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h.\n\tNOTE: The peak areas are recorded automatically by the referenced HPLC system. These time points were based on relevant literature15,16,17.\nPerform the reproducibility test by taking the same batch of Zanba-stir-fried TBC to prepare six test sample solutions in parallel according to the method in step 1.2. Inject 10 µL of each sample into the HPLC system and run the samples as described in section 2.\n\tNOTE: Reproducibility was assessed by comparing the concentration differences between the six samples.\nPerform the recovery experiment by preparing six portions of the same batch of Zanba-stir-fried TBC for the test solution. Then, add ~100% of the reference substance of each index component into six portions of the test solution to calculate the recovery rate. Inject these samples (10 µL) into the HPLC system under the same conditions described in section 2 and calculate the recovery rate using Equation (1):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65139/65139eq01.jpg     (1)\n\tNOTE: In Eq. (1), A is the amount of the component to be measured in the test solution, B is the amount of reference substance added, and C is the measured value of the solution that contains the reference substance and the Zanba-stir-fried TBC sample.\n4. Single-factor experiments\nComparison of slice thickness\n\t\nPrepare five groups for tests, each with 30 g of TBC, where the thickness of the TBC is 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 cm, respectively. Weigh an amount of Zanba that is three times as much as that of TBC (90 g).",
    "NOTE: TBC is toxic. Use proper protection, such as gloves, a lab coat, goggles, and a fume hood, and be careful during the cutting process. Through the pre-experiment, it was found that three times the amount of Zanba was required for complete contact between TBC and Zanba. Therefore, in the formal experimental design, the study selected three times the amount of Zanba when examining the slice thickness.\nSet the temperature and the time of the automatic stir-fry machine to 140 °C and 40 min, respectively.\nAdd ~30 g of TBC and 90 g of Zanba into the machine after the automatic stir-fry machine has heated up to the set temperature.\nPrepare the sample solutions by following step 1.2.

    "Turn on the stir-fry machine for processing. Set the processing temperature to 100 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C, 160 °C, and 180 °C. Set the processing time as 40 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Through pre-experiments, it was found that the speed of Zanba yellowing is very low when the processing temperature is below 100 °C, and Zanba is easy to burn and turn black if the temperature is too high (above 180 °C). Therefore, 100 °C and 180 °C were set to be the minimum and maximum values of temperature during processing, respectively.\nPrepare the sample solutions by following step 1.2. Record the peak areas of the MDA and DDAs. Calculate the content of the MDA and DDAs in different processing products according to the standard curve (Table 2). Calculate the comprehensive score based on the results via the CRITIC method in section 6.\n\t\tNOTE: The experiment involves high temperatures of 160 °C and 180 °C.

Calculate the comprehensive score based on the results via the CRITIC method in section 6.\n5. Processing technology optimization of Zanba-stir-fried TBC using response surface methodology (RSM)\nBox-Behnken response surface design",
    "Determine the range of slice thickness (A, 1-3 cm), the amount of Zanba (B, 2-4x), the processing temperature (C, 100-140 °C), and the processing time (D, 40-80 min) by preliminary experiments using single-factor tests (step 4.1-4.4).\n\t\tNOTE: The coded values of four variables and their levels are shown in Table 3. Three levels of each variable were coded as -1, 0, and 1.\nUse software to generate the matrix and analyze the response surface models.\n\tNOTE: The screenshots for the software usage are shown in Supplementary File 1.\n\t\nUse a three-level-four-factor Box-Behnken design composed of 24 experiments (as done in this study), and measure five replicates (run order 1, 9, 14, 16, and 25) to calculate the pure error sum of squares (Table 4).

Model evaluation\nNOTE: This step is to be performed after each single-factor experiment or response surface experiment has been completed. After each experiment (e.g., comparison of slice thickness) is completed, the content of the MDA and DDAs in the different samples are measured to obtain five datasets, according to step 1.2 and section 2. The data are shown in Supplementary Table S1.\nDimensionless processing of the index",
    "NOTE: This step transforms the measured value (Xij) into a dimensionless relative value, so that the value of each index is at the same quantity level. This operation can facilitate comprehensive analysis and comparison of indicators in different units or orders of magnitude18. For the purposes of illustration, slice thickness values have been used for the calculations shown below (Supplementary Table S1).\n\t\nStandardize the content of the MDA (obtain yMDA; MDA refers to benzoylaconitine) by using the formula in Eq. (2).\n\t\tNOTE: The index \"i\" stands for one of four factors, and slice thickness is the first factor investigated. Hence, the value of i is equal to 1. The index \"j\" stands for each level of factors; thus, when the slice thickness is the first level (0.5 cm), j is equal to 1; When the slice thickness is the fifth level (4 cm), j is equal to 5. The contents of MDA (Xij) in the processed TBC with thicknesses of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 cm were 0.9693, 1.0876, 1.3940, 1.4185, and 1.3614 mg/g, respectively. Thus, xj, max is 1.4185 and xj, min is 0.9693.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65139/65139eq02.jpg      (2)\n\t\tThus, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65139/65139eq03.jpg\n\t\tHere, Xij is the measured content of the MDA of the experiment in the i-th factor and at the j-th level; xj, min is the minimum content of the MDA in this group of experiments; and xj, max is the maximum content of the MDA in this group of experiments. Thus, i = 1, 2, …, m, and j = 1, 2, …, n.\n\t\tNOTE: Thus, the standardized values of the MDA are 0.0000, 0.2634, 0.9455, 1.0000, and 0.8729 using Eq. (2).\nStandardize the total content of the DDAs (obtain yDDAs; DDAs refers to aconitine and 3-deoxyaconitine) by using the formula in Eq. (3).",
