  "procedures": [
    "This protocol describes FRAP of LET-23::GFP at the basal membrane of the VPCs, thus the “bleach region” is a part of the basal membrane. The protocol may be applied to lateral and apical membranes as well.MicroscopyPrepare an agarose pad using 4% melted agarose. Cut the edges of the pad to obtain a square of around 1 cm x 1 cm (Figure 1a). The agarose square should be smaller than the area of the cover slip (18 mm x 18 mm). Add 3 μl of 20 mM tetramisol and pick 20-30 worms from late L3 stage into the tetramisol drop. Carefully place the coverslip on the top of the pad and add M9 buffer with a pipette to fill in the space between the agar and the borders of the cover slip. Under these conditions animals survive for more than 1 h, but do not analyze animals that have been left more than 45 min on the slide. Notes:It is not possible to identify worms at the 4-cell stage (Pn.pxx stage) with the dissection scope. Pick several worms and confirm the 4-cell stage on the confocal microscope using weak fluorescence light to avoid photobleaching. Animals at the 4-cell stage of vulval development survive longer under the confocal scope. It is fundamental that the animals are not moving on the slide. Weak horizontal or vertical drifts can be digitally corrected (see below), but animals that move too much during the acquisition cannot be analyzed. On the confocal scope: Identify the ventral region of the animal where the vulval cells are located under DIC (differential interference contrast) or transmission light. Use the 63x /1.4 NA oil lens and change to UV fluorescence to identify the VPCs expressing LET-23::GFP. Center the field in the VPCs.",
    "In the Zeiss LSM710 ZEN software, use the “Channel color lookup table” to correct the saturation for each animal using the “Master Gain” function.Crop/Zoom 4x and rotate image to place the VPC horizontally in the viewing field. It’s important to keep the 4x zoom throughout all experiments.Perform a “Snap image” (Figure 1b).Bleaching settings: On the “Bleaching” window select the 488 nm argon laser with 85% laser power. On the “Start bleaching after # scan” option select “2”, and in the “iterations” options select “5” times bleach repeat. On the “Regions” window click on “Acquisition” for region #1 and “Bleach” for region #2. Select with the “rectangle” function from the “Regions” window the four VPCs and define this region as “Acquisition” and “Analysis” (Figure 1b). Select an area of the basal or lateral membrane to be photo bleached with the “rectangle” function and define this region as “Bleach” and “Analysis” (Figure 1b). Under these settings approximately 70% of the signal is photo bleached. Record the fluorescence recovery for 296 sec, taking a frame every 8 sec (“Time Series” window) with a 488 nm laser excitation, at 20% power intensity, a pinhole equivalent to 2.12 Airey units, a frame size of 256 x 256 dpi and speed (Pixel Dwell) of 3.15 microsecond (Figure 1 b-c). Note: Perform a few bleach experiments and analyze the data (see below) to determine if photo bleach and recovery occurs under these conditions. If photo bleach is not efficient, avoid increasing the percentage of laser power; instead increase the iterations to bleach several times repeatedly. If recovery does not occur, check for integrity of the animals and reduce the time they are mounted on the slide. Save the experiment in the .lsm format.Data handling and analysisIn FIJI (ImageJ)Install the following Plug-Ins:StackReg: http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/[href=http://bigwww.epfl.",

Time units between slides: 8 (sec) > ok.Note: In our setup the first picture is the “snapshot”. Therefore the Pre Bleached slice is “2” and the Post bleach is “3”.In Frap Analysis window: > Measurements > Automatic (Figure 1d).Select the rectangle selection tool.Go to the image window and select the post bleach image.Select the FRAP region with the rectangle selection tool. Choose a rectangle size that covers all bleached area (Figure 1e). Use the pre-bleach and post-bleach pictures as reference. In the FRAP Analysis window > FRAP Region> Set ROI > Apply to Image > Measure.A “Measurement Window” displays values of the images over time (this information will not be used, but keep it open).With the rectangle tool, select a part of the picture outside of the fluorescent area (Figure 1e’) (Background) and repeat the process in the FRAP Analysis window, this time as: Background > Set ROI > Apply to Image > Measure (Figure 1d).With the rectangle tool select the 4 cells (Figure 1e’’) and in FRAP Analysis window click on:Whole Cell > Set ROI > Apply to Image > Measure (Figure 1d).",
    "Go back to the Fluorescence image and select with the rectangle tool a region of the membrane that was not bleached. For example, the basal membrane of the cell adjacent to the bleached cell (Figure 1e’’’). In FRAP Analysis window repeat the above process for > Reference > Set ROI > Apply to Image > Measure.Click “Normalize” to obtain the normalization results.This procedure is used to doubly normalize the data: with the Reference region (nonbleached membrane) and with the total fluorescence of the 4 VPCs in the single section.Copy all results to a data analysis software (e.g. Excel) and keep the columns “Time” and“Normalized” for the analysis. Plot the data: Fluorescence intensity (normalized) vs. time (sec) (Figure 1f).The plots can be used to estimate the immobile and mobile fractions of the analyzed molecule. The mobile fraction is the fraction of fluorescence that is recovered and is represented by the difference between the initial and final fluorescence. FRAP-bleached molecules that are immobile do not permit mobilization of incoming proteins into those sites at the membrane and represent the immobile fraction.
