    "Revival of PBMCRemove the required number of vials containing stored PBMC from the liquid nitrogen container and thaw the cells immediately at 37°C using a water-bath.Notes:  At least 2 × 106–3 × 106 enriched CD4+ T-cells will be required for a single assay (see below). The CD4 percentage in healthy people is typically 30–40% of total lymphocytes, but this could be significantly lower in ART-naïve HIV-1 infected people. Therefore, a single assay may require 30 × 106–50 × 106 stored PBMC. Further, it could be essential to consider additional experimental parameters that may cause cell loss. For example, cell storage, revival, and activation may lead to the death of a small proportion of cells. Likewise, flow cytometry validation may require setting aside a small fraction of cells (see step 4 below). When working with HIV-infected cells, the following fundamental precautions must be taken:  All experiments must be performed in a Biosafety Level-3 laboratory (BSL-3) or in a ‘BSL-2 Plus’ laboratory (BSL-2+), which is a ‘BSL-3 laboratory minus negative pressure’. Please note that a regular BSL-2 is not suitable for HIV-1 work. Researchers must stringently follow all safety procedures mandated for a BSL-3 facility. See the following reference for more information on the operational procedures (Duane, 2013). In a culture hood, pool the PBMC in a 15-mL or 50-mL plastic tube containing the revival medium at room temperature (mix sample and revival medium volumes at a ratio of 1:3).Note: Before thawing the PBMC, dispense the required volume of the revival medium in a plastic tube readily available in the culture hood. Determine the cell count using a hemocytometer.Set aside an aliquot of 0.3 × 106 PBMC in a plastic vial, for the flow cytometry analysis.Notes:  These cells will represent the 'pre-enrichment' sample.",
    "A similar sample will be collected later (see step 9 below) following the CD4+ T-cell enrichment, labelled as the 'post-enrichment' sample. A comparison of these two samples by flow cytometry will identify the fold-enrichment of the CD4+ T-cells (see Procedure C below). Additionally, these cells will also be used to account for two additional controls for flow cytometry, comprising the 'No stain' and the 'Isotype' controls. Enrichment of CD4+ T-cellsCentrifuge the plastic tube containing the PBMC pool at 750 × g and room temperature for 10 min. Decant the supernatant, and gently loosen the cell pellet.Resuspend the pellet of approximately 50 × 106 PBMC in 1 mL of the enrichment medium at room temperature and transfer the cells to 5-mL round-bottom polystyrene tubes.Use the EasySep Human CD4 T-cell isolation kit to enrich the CD4+ T-cells from PBMC, by following the manufacturer's instructions.Collect the enriched CD4+ T-cells in a fresh 15-mL plastic tube containing 2 mL of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, at room temperature.Determine the cell count and keep aside an aliquot of 0.1 × 106 cells, for the flow cytometry analysis.Notes:  Label the tube as the 'post-enrichment' sample. Approximately, 2 × 106–3 × 106 enriched CD4+ T-cells are expected at this stage, especially from a clinical sample. Spin the rest of the cells and resuspend the cell pellet in 2.0 mL of complete RPMI medium. Dispense 950 µL of the cell suspension into two wells each of a 24-well cluster plate and incubate at 37°C for 3–5 h. Label the wells as \"No activation\" and \"Activation\". One of the two cell populations will be activated, while the other will serve as 'No activation' control in U-TILDA.Note: The incubation will allow the cells to recover, following revival.",
    "Validation of CD4+ T-cell enrichment by flow cytometryTwo different samples have been saved above (steps 4 and 9) before and after the cell-enrichment procedure. Unless otherwise mentioned, all the steps below are performed at room temperature.Centrifuge the tubes with cells from steps 4 and 9 at 750 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the medium, loosen the cell pellets, resuspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS each (PBS should be at room temperature), and centrifuge at 750 × g for 5 min.Aspirate the supernatant, loosen the cell pellets, and resuspend the cells in 100 µL of PBS (PBS should be at room temperature).Divide the 'Pre-enrichment' cells into three vials by transferring 30 µL of the cell suspension to each vial. Label the vials as 'No stain' control, 'Isotype' control, and 'pre-enrichment' sample. Add 60 µL of PBS to each vial to make the total volume 90 µL. Likewise, suspend all the cells of the 'post-enrichment' sample in 90 µL of PBS.Note: The two control vials will be common for the pre- and post-enrichment samples. Add 5 µL each of mouse anti-human CD4 antibody-FITC conjugate and mouse anti-human CD3 antibody-APC conjugate to the 'pre-‘ and ‘post-enrichment' vials. Similarly, add 5 µL each of mouse IgG1, κ Isotype antibody-FITC conjugate, and mouse IgG2a, κ Isotype antibody-APC conjugate to the 'Isotype control' vial.Incubate the samples at 4°C in the dark for 45 min.After the incubation, wash the cells twice with 500 µL of the staining buffer by centrifugation at 750 × g for 5 min, aspirate the staining buffer, and loosen the cell pellet.Resuspend the cells in 100 µL of staining buffer.Acquire the sample data using a flow cytometer.Note: Ideally, the stained samples should be analyzed as soon as possible. If necessary, the samples may be stored for 3–4 h at 4°C.",
    "First, identify the lymphocyte population by defining the FSC and SSC scatters, using the 'No stain' control (Figure 1A). Then, place a quadrant on the living cell population using the CD3-APC and CD4-FITC staining (Figures 1B–D). Using the defined gate, analyse the rest of the samples.Notes:  It may be necessary to determine the live cell population by adding a live-dead staining step to the protocol. A small proportion of PBMC may be dead after reviving the cells. The live-cell proportion must be 70% or higher. Cells are subjected to the live-dead staining protocol before the receptor staining step. Add 10 µL of 1,000-fold diluted Live/Dead Fixable Far Red Dead Cell Stain to the cells suspended in 90 µL of PBS, and incubate the vial at 4°C in the dark for 45 min. After the incubation, wash the cells by adding 500 µL of the staining buffer to the vial and centrifuging the vial at 750 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the staining buffer and loosen the cell pellet. Resuspend the cells in 90 µL of PBS and proceed to the receptor staining. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4391/bioprotoc-12-08-4391-g001.jpgFigure 1. Gating strategy used for analysis of the CD4+ T-cells. (A) The scatter analysis to identify the lymphocyte population (the gated population). (B–D) The lymphocytes population was then gated for CD3+ and CD4+ T-cells. The double-positive population in the upper right quadrant represents the CD4+ T-cells. (B) The isotype-control antibodies stain only a tiny proportion of cells, thereby confirming the validity of the staining. Cells falling within the gated zone will be considered CD4+. PBMC (C) before and (D) after enrichment. While only 32.40% of cells in the pre-enriched PBMC were CD4+, this proportion increased to 94.88% following enrichment.",
    "Cells of other lineages reduced concomitantly after the enrichment of the CD4+ cells (compare other quadrants between C and D panels).Activation of the enriched CD4+ T-cellsAfter 3–5 h of incubation, take the 24-well plate from step 10 above out of the incubator and proceed to cell activation.Note: At this stage, the 'activation and no activation' wells each may contain 1 × 106–1.5 ×106 enriched CD4 cells in 950 µL of complete RPMI medium. To the ‘Activation’ well, add 25 µL of PMA at 4 µg/mL (100 ng/mL final concentration) and 25 µL of Ionomycin at 40 µg/mL (1 µg/mL final concentration) solutions. Add 50 µL of plain RPMI medium to the 'No activation' control.Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 12–16 h.Note: Activation will lead to cell clumping compared to the 'no-activation' control. U-TILDAThe assay involves the distribution of the enriched CD4+ T-cells to several replica wells for each cell concentration in a 96-well cluster plate. The wells contain the reagents necessary for reverse transcription and PCR amplification. Total RNA will be released into the solution from the cells as the wells are heated, and reverse transcription will be initiated directly without nucleic acid purification. A pool of three RT primers specific to the viral transcript is used in the assay, to preferentially reverse transcribe the viral transcript. Cell-associated impurities do not interfere with the amplification efficiency at the number of cells used in the assay. Following the cDNA synthesis, the virus-specific outer primer pair (N2830 and N2831) will amplify the viral target in the same vial, using the one-step RT-PCR format. The first-round PCR product is diluted and used as the template for the second-round of the nested-PCR amplification, using an inner primer pair (N2832 and N2833), and a fluorescent probe (N2842).",
    "The fluorescence intensity of the amplification is monitored in real-time PCR. For additional information regarding the primer design see Mehta et al. (2021).One-step qRT-PCR (First-round of nested-PCR) Mix all the components for the qRT-PCR as shown in Table 2.

Plate layout for U-TILDA. The 96-well plate is divided into two halves, 'No-activation' and 'Activation'. Both halves comprise three dilutions of cells as shown, with two columns for each dilution, and one 'No-template’ control (NTC).Cell dilution following activation Following 12–16 h of cell activation, transfer the activated and control cells to two fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes appropriately labelled.Determine the cell count.Spin the cells and resuspend the pellet in such a way as to get a cell density of 1 × 106 cells in 37 µL of PBS (Figure 3). This cell density corresponds to 27,000 cells/µL.Transfer 10 µL of the cell suspension to the next vial containing 20 µL of PBS. This cell density corresponds to 9,000 cells/µL.Repeat the cell dilution, to get a stock of 3,000 cells/µL.Notes:  Sixteen replica wells are used for each cell dilution, with or without cell activation. The minimum number of cells required to set up the assay in the format suggested is 1.62 × 106 enriched CD4+ T-cells. These many cells suspended in 37 µL (or 0.81 × 106 cells suspended in 30 µL) will correspond to a cell density of 27,000 cells/µL. Cell dilution may be accomplished as suggested in step 28. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4391/bioprotoc-12-08-4391-g003.jpgFigure 3. Cell dilution following activation. One million cells are suspended in 37 µL of PBS (or 0.81 × 106 cells in 30 µL) to get a cell density of 27,000 cells per µL. Perform a serial 3-fold dilution as suggested, to get cell stocks of 9,000 and 3,000 cells per µL. The ‘no-activation’ and ‘activation’ samples both are diluted using the suggested dilution format.",
    "Add 1 µL of the cell suspension from the prepared cell stocks to appropriate wells as per the experimental format (Figure 2). Add 1 µL of PBS to the NTC wells.Seal the plate with a sealant film and transfer the plate to a PCR machine.Conduct amplification using the following conditions, reverse transcription at 50°C for 15 min, denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, and 25 cycles of amplification (95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 4 min).After the amplification, remove the plate from the thermal cycler and dispense 40 µL of TE buffer into each well, to dilute the contents for the second-round of amplification.Note: The plate with the diluted samples could be stored in a deep freezer for months, if necessary. Second-round PCR amplification (Real-time format) Prepare the reaction master-mix for the second-round of PCR as shown. The master-mix is sufficient for 100 (96 + 4) reactions (Table 3).Dispense 9 µL of the master-mix to each well of a 96-well PCR plate.Table 3. PCR mix for the second-round qPCRtable:",

Châtel et al. suggested the use of the cell lysate directly without storing the samples, to prevent TILDA loss of sensitivity (Châtel et al., 2018). Despite the optimization of the TILDA reported here, additional options are available for further improvisation of the assay. A simple strategy of RNA purification may permit the addition of more RNA to the amplification, thus enabling the interrogation of a larger number of PBMC per reaction well (Pezzi et al., 2017). Unfortunately, an RNA purification step may lead to additional costs, sample loss, and the risk of contamination. Several other DNA polymerases may demonstrate higher levels of tolerance to the presence of impurities in the sample than Taq polymerase (Abu Al-Soud and Rådström, 1998). The use of such enzymes may permit the addition of more RNA to the reaction. The amplification conditions of U-TILDA, including the primer length, annealing temperature, temperature gradation, and the concentrations of the reaction components, have been optimized to the highest extent possible."
