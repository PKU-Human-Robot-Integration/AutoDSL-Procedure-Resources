    "All ultrasounds in this protocol were performed on human subjects and were conducted following the ethical standards of the University of Illinois Hospital and the Declaration of Helsinki and its revisions. The imaging was performed on the authors themselves and patients in the emergency department as part of routine education and clinical care with preceding verbal consent as is the standard for the institution. Images collected illustrate both normal anatomy and physiology as well as abnormal findings collected at the University of Illinois Hospital. Images used to illustrate scanning techniques were performed on members of the writing team. All ultrasound images are free of any identifying information. The subsequent protocol was designed using sources from peer-reviewed journals and book chapters10,15,16,17,18,19. For this review, the protocol will focus on obtaining US images of adults.\n1. Safety\nNOTE: POCUS studies can be performed with non-sterile gloves, either nitrile or latex, depending on patient allergies. Additional safety measures may be taken based on clinical context and institutional policies.\nExamine the ultrasound system for cleanliness prior to use and clean the machine and probes in the appropriate manner after use. The cleaning material and process are dictated by the ultrasound unit manufacturer and institutional standards.\n2. Selection of probe\nFor most adults, the abdominal aorta is best visualized with a 2.5-3.5 MHz curvilinear probe, which has a large footprint and a wide field of view with a convex beam shape. This probe will generally provide excellent resolution and measurement capabilities.\nAlternatively, use the phased array probe (1-5 mHz), typically used for echocardiography and often informally referred to as the cardiac probe.",
    "â€‹NOTE: The phased array probe can be useful especially when attempting to visualize the proximal abdominal aorta as it exits through the diaphragmatic hiatus. This is especially true if the space just inferior to the xyphoid process is too narrow to accommodate the wider curvilinear probe. The phased array probe has a rectangular footprint and a triangular beam shape with a narrower field of view than the curvilinear probe but should be adequate to achieve the imaging goals.\n3. Machine presets\nUse the abdominal preset on the machine regardless of the probe used.\nSet the mode to B mode or 2-dimensional grayscale.\nSet the depth to 20 cm.\n\tNOTE: This is typically adequate to visualize the vertebral body which is an important landmark for the aorta.\nAdjust the depth once the aorta is visualized to keep the aorta in the midfield of the screen.\nConsider using harmonic imaging to provide better visualization if imaging is challenging due to excessive bowel gas.\n\tNOTE: Harmonics uses the resonance characteristics of tissue and creates a higher-resolution image with fewer artifacts.\nChoose a lower frequency range for patients with a high body mass index to improve image acquisition.\n4. Scanning technique\nApply ultrasound gel to the transducer.\nPosition the patient supine with the abdomen exposed. Hip flexion, if tolerated by the patient, will relax the abdominal muscles and may improve image acquisition.\n\tNOTE: Bowel gas can impede image acquisition. To improve image acquisition in the presence of bowel gas, the operator can apply firm, continuous pressure, known as graded compression, to the scanning area for a few minutes, displacing the bowel gas. Evaluation of the aorta in the coronal plane can also avoid bowel gas encountered in the transverse plane (see step 4.3.5).",
    "For a thorough evaluation of the abdominal aorta, obtain the images listed below.\n\t\nObtain images of the proximal aorta in the transverse plane.\n\t\t\nOrient the transducer in the transverse plane with the indicator toward the patient's right. Ensure that the indicator position matches the indicator on the screen (Figure 1A).\nPlace the transducer just distal to the patient's xiphoid process and apply light pressure to visualize the anterior aspect of the vertebra with its hyperechoic shadow-casting arch (Figure 1B).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The liver will appear in the upper left corner of the screen and acts as an acoustic window. The aorta will appear just above the vertebral body as an anechoic circle on the right side of the screen, corresponding to the patient's left. The inferior vena cava (IVC) is on the left side of the screen, corresponding to the patient's right. The IVC has a thinner wall than the aorta and is often collapsible even with light pressure.\nSlide the transducer caudally until the celiac trunk is visualized. The celiac trunk is short and quickly bifurcates into the hepatic artery and splenic artery. When the two arteries are visualized together, this is called the seagull sign (Figure 2).\nCapture these images for later review by clicking the button on the system that records clips.\nSlide the transducer caudally to encounter the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), which comes off the anterior aorta and very quickly courses inferiorly, typically following a parallel path with the aorta. The splenic vein courses anterior to the SMA and the left renal vein courses between the SMA and the aorta (Figure 3).\nCapture these images for later review by clicking the button on the system that records clips.",
    "Measure the AP diameter of the suprarenal aorta by optimizing a live image of the aorta in this location and then pressing the system's freeze button.\nPress caliper or measure and move the track ball or touchpad of the system to the outer edge of the anterior wall, the adventitia, and click select.\nMove the trackball or touchpad again to the outer edge of the posterior wall and click Select. Wait for the system to generate a measurement (Figure 4).\nSave this image as a still image containing the measurement by clicking the button on the system that saves still images .\n\t\t\tNOTE: The upper limit of normal of the AP diameter of the aorta is 3.0 cm. Any measurement >3 cm is considered aneurysmal15,16,20,21.\nImage the distal aorta in the transverse plane.\n\t\tNOTE: The distal aorta comprises two-thirds of the abdominal aorta and begins just distal of the renal arteries. The majority of AAAs occur in this distal segment.\n\t\t\nAs with the proximal aorta, continue scanning in a transverse plane visualizing the entirety of the aorta through the bifurcation.\nCapture these images for later review by clicking the button on the system that records clips.\nWhen a live image of the distal aorta is optimized, measure the AP diameter of the infrarenal aorta.\nPress caliper or measure and move the trackball or touchpad of the system to the outer edge of the anterior wall, the adventitia, and click select.\nMove the trackball or touchpad again to the outer edge of the posterior wall and click Select. Wait for the system to generate a measurement.\nSave this image as a still image containing the measurement by clicking the button on the system that saves still images.",
    "NOTE: It is prudent to obtain at least two measurements of the distal aorta given its greater length and increased likelihood of having aneurysmal dilations.\nAdjust the depth as the abdominal aorta courses caudally through the abdomen, since it becomes more superficial and tapers slightly.\nObtain a video clip of the aortic bifurcation into the left and right iliac arteries (Video 1-see Supplemental File 1: Supplemental Figure S1).\n\t\t\nContinue scanning caudally, adjusting the depth as necessary to maintain the aorta and vertebral body in the middle of the screen.\nScan through the aortic bifurcation into the left and right iliac arteries.\nCapture images while scanning through the bifurcation.\nObtain images and video clips of the aorta in the longitudinal plane.\n\t\t\nPlace the probe in the proximal abdomen, starting again in the subxiphoid area.\nIt is often easier to begin in the transverse plane with the indicator toward the patient's right. Once the transverse view of the aorta is optimized, rotate the probe clockwise, following the aorta as the image becomes longitudinal on the screen and the indicator is pointing toward the patient's head (Figure 5A).\nAcquire images while scanning caudally examining for aneurysmal dilatations.\nCapture these images for later review by clicking the button on the system that records clips.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The celiac trunk and SMA are easily visible projecting from the anterior aorta in long axis view (Figure 5B). It is advisable NOT to measure the diameter of the aorta in the longitudinal axis. If the US beam intersects the aorta tangentially, as opposed to in its midline, the measurement will be falsely smaller than if it were through the maximal AP diameter (Figure 6).",
    "Optional: Obtain a longitudinal view of the aorta in the coronal plane. This view is useful if obtaining views in the transverse or longitudinal planes is difficult.\n\t\t\nBegin with the transducer in the coronal plane at the midaxillary line on the patient's right with the indicator pointing cranially (Figure 7A).\nIf the patient is able, position them in the left lateral decubitus position for better image acquisition.\nScan the aorta in a coronal plane. The aorta will be visualized deep to the IVC if both vessels are imaged (Figure 7B).\nCapture these images for later review by clicking the button on the system that records clips.\nSubscription Required.
