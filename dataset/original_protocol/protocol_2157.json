    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue cryoprotection\nTiming: 30 min–2 h\nIn this step, embedding in water-soluble embedding medium and snap freezing in liquid nitrogen for tissue preservation is described.\nEmbedding in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT).\nRinse the bones 2× with 10 mL PBS in 15 mL tubes to get rid of PFA solution.\nDry the bones with tissue; make sure that they are clean; if necessary, remove redundant tissue.\nFill the cryomolds with OCT until the upper limit.\nPositioning of the tissue in OCT (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1741-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Embedding position of long bones\nEmbedding position of (A) femur, (B) tibia and (C) humerus in OCT.\nPlace the bones longitudinally close to the left side of the OCT containing cryomold.\nMake sure the bones are fully immersed and parallel to the left edge of the cryomold (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), to achieve the maximal frontal tissue surface after cryo-shaving.\nMove bubbles out if they are formed.\nSnap freezing in liquid nitrogen (LN2).\nFor dealing with LN2, wear protective equipment in appropriate rooms.\nGrab the filled cryomold with long-armed tweezers with the help of a table surface (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1741-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Snap freezing in liquid nitrogen\n(A) Grabbing the filled cryomold with long-armed tweezers.\n(B) Side view of the cryomold with a table surface.\n(C) Touching the bottom of the cryomold with the surface of the LN2.\n(D) Freezing of the OCT (white) from bottom to top.\n(E) Totally frozen OCT.\n(F) Dropping the specimen into LN2.\nTouch gently with the bottom of the cryomold the surface of the LN2 in an appropriate open LN2 Dewar flask. Attachment is ensured when a bubbling sound begins (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: Too quick plunging of the sample into LN2 can cause formation of bubbles.",
    "Let the OCT get freeze (white) from bottom to top (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nWhen the OCT is totally frozen (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E, drop it into the LN2 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nCritical: Fast snap freezing is essential to prevent formation of ice crystals which induce cellular and architectural tissue damage.\nCritical: For long-term preservation (up to 5 years, see Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]) frozen and embedded tissue should be stored subsequently at −80°C.\nCryostat shaving procedure\nTiming: 20 min/tissue block\nThis section describes the cryostat shaving procedure of the specimen for obtaining optimal bisected bone whole-mounts for 3D confocal imaging.\nSet up the cryostat settings according to the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nTransfer the samples to dry ice to prevent OCT melting.\nFreeze the frozen block on a specimen chuck on the long side using OCT and with the tissue upside down. If available, use a quick freeze chamber.\nCritical: The chuck should be at 18°C–25°C prior to use to ensure optimal adhesion.\nAllow time (5–10 min) for the temperatures within the cryostat to stabilize.\nStart to shave the block with the trimming function until the bone marrow is maximally exposed. Also see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nCritical: To prevent severe damage, ensure that the blade does not crash into the sample.\nSwitch to the sectioning thickness and shave the specimen 10–20×. Also see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nCritical: To ensure a planar shaved surface, check during the shaving steps the blade for notches caused by the bone matrix. If notches occur, shift the blade to an undamaged part or use a new one (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]). Be cautious during the shaving procedure as the blades are very sharp.\nNote: Use a brush to remove debris from the sample.\nCut the frozen tissue block with a razor blade from the specimen chuck.",
    "The shaved samples can be stored 3–4 weeks at −80°C prior to immunofluorescence staining.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Cryostat shaving procedure, related to steps 7–8\nWhole-mount immunostaining\nTiming: 1–7 days\nThis section describes the immunostaining procedure to image 3D information of hematopoietic stem cells and niche components (vasculature, endosteum, megakaryocytes) throughout the whole femoral bone marrow section with optimized antibodies, which, in total, need 5 days. The incubation times and concentrations of the used antibodies in this protocol are the same for other appropriate tissues. Novel antibodies should be validated before use.\nPurification from melting OCT.\nPlace the shaved and frozen samples into a box with separating chambers which are filled with ∼150 mL cold (4°C) washing buffer solution to cover the samples (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1741-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Purification from melting OCT\n(A and B) Frozen samples in PBS.\n(C) Melting samples.\n(D) Washing samples with washing buffer solution.\nCritical: Throughout the remaining parts of the protocol, avoid touching the exposed bone marrow to prevent losing cells and causing tissue artifacts (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nWait until the OCT around the sample is melted in the cold (4°C) washing buffer solution (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nAfter the OCT is melted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C), take out the exposed samples cautiously with tweezers and wash the bones with washing buffer solution with a plastic bottle to get rid of sticky OCT (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nCritical: Don’t pour the washing solution directly to the exposed bone marrow to avoid causing artifacts.\nNote: Use a see-saw rocker with ca. 30 rpm and cover the samples with a box from light for every step from now on.\nPrepare 24-well plates (wp) for fixation and washing (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) and 0.2 mL PCR tubes for blocking and antibody incubation (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1741-Fig6.jpg",

In general, the processed tissue should be fully covered by the solution in the tube.\nFixation in 24-wp.\nFill one well for each sample with 2 mL 4% PFA fixation solution.\nPlace the bone samples into the fixation solution with the shaved surface, so that the BM doesn’t touch the bottom and incubate for 30 min at 18°C–25°C.\nWash the samples 3× 20 min at 18°C–25°C by relocating from well to well with each well containing 2 mL of washing buffer solution.\nPlace the samples in 0.2 mL PCR tubes with blocking and permeabilization buffer; incubate at 18°C–25°C for 1 h.\nPrimary hematopoietic lineage antibody staining (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]):\nPrepare the lineage antibody cocktail solution with biotinylated anti-CD41 (1:2500), anti-CD48 (1:100), anti-CD11b (1:100), anti-B220 (1:100), anti-CD5 (1:100), anti-Gr-1 (1:100), anti-Ter119 (1:100), anti-CD8a (1:100) in antibody diluent buffer.\nIncubate at 4°C for 2 days.\nCritical: Spin down the antibody vials to remove aggregates and precipitates to avoid the occurrence of non-specific fluorescent spots.\nWash the samples 3× 20 min at 18°C–25°C in washing buffer solution (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nSecondary antibody staining (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]):\nPrepare secondary antibody solution with streptavidin (eFluor®450- or FITC- conjugated, 1:60) in antibody diluent buffer.\nIncubate at 18°C–25°C for 2 h.\nWash the samples 3× 20 min at 18°C–25°C in washing buffer solution (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nSLAM antibody staining (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]):\nPrepare antibody solution with anti-CD150-PE (4 μg/mL) in antibody diluent buffer.\nIncubate at 4°C for 3 days.",
    "Wash the samples 3× 20 min at 18°C–25°C in washing buffer solution.\nPlace the bone samples in 24-wp in storage buffer solution (2 mL per well) with the shaved surface and store at 4°C in the dark until microscopy.\nPause point: Samples can be imaged 1–3 days after the staining procedure.\nConfocal microscopy\nTiming: 0.5 days\nThis section describes the sample mounting and confocal 3D microscopy. Every immunostaining experiment has special settings and here we give the basic settings for 3D imaging we are using for the iFAST3D protocol.\nNote: With many confocal microscope acquisition software you can retrieve settings from previous experiments.\nDrop 30 μL–80 μL washing and storage buffer solution to the bottom glass of a 4-well-μ-slide (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A) to prevent tissue desiccation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1741-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Microscope glass chamber\n(A) 4-well-μ-slide chamber with 60 μL washing and storage buffer solution.\n(B and C) Placing of a whole-mounted sternum.\n(D) View from the bottom side of the sample.\nPlace the fluorescently labeled tissue cut-face down onto the drop in the 4-well-μ-slide (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B and 7C) and check from the bottom side that the sample surface is completely touching the glass planar (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D).\nCritical: Avoid too much pressure which can press out BM and prevent formation of air bubbles (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nCover the microscope glass chamber with the associated lid.\nSwitch on the confocal microscope system.\nPlace the glass chamber on the stage of the microscope.\nUse a 10× objective for preview and choose a region for setting up in the widefield mode.\nSet up the acquisition settings for confocal microscopy:\nSet up the channel configurations based on the excision/emission parameters of the used fluorochromes and dyes in the staining.\nNote: If available, use the auto-set-up mode with the ideal option.",
    "Use transmitted light detection (DIC) for trabecular and cortical bone matrix detection and for structural details.\nUse an image size resolution of 1024 × 1024 with bidirectional scanning (600 Hz–800 Hz) and 3–5× averaging.\nSwitch to a 20× objective and confocal live mode.\nOptimize the detector parameters gain, laser power etc. by negative controls and/or by a software over-saturation option (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nCritical: Avoid long-lasting laser exposure of the region of interest (ROI) to prevent photobleaching of sensitive types of labeled antibodies.\nScan for a ROI using 10× objective in the widefield mode.\nSwitch back to a 20× objective and confocal live mode.\nSet up the z-stack configurations:\nSet up the lower and upper focal plane scanning limits. A limit is reached when the image is out of focus. Z-thickness size can vary between 20 μm–75 μm.\nFor optimal and fast scanning, use a step size between 1.0 μm to 3.5 μm (z-step size).\nOptional: Set start and stop points for z-stack tile scanning.\nStart the scanning procedure for 3D imaging and save your z-stack data subsequently.\nProcessing and 3D visualization of raw data using Volocity analysis software\nTiming: 30 min per image\nThis section describes how to import raw data, how to process images to visualize in 3D and how to export images by using Volocity software as an example. For 3D reconstruction and subsequent quantification and analysis of structural, cellular, and subcellular properties, also other image analysis platforms (e.g., Imaris, ImageJ, FIJI) can be used.\nNote: Common file formats with metadata, generated by conventional confocal microscope systems, are supported and can be added to Volocity by drag and drop. The software saves every step automatically.\nImport of raw images:\nGo to the “File” menu and select “New Library…” (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1741-Fig8.jpg",
