    "1. Preparation and Dissection\nPrepare the dissecting dish lined with Sylgard. Recording chambers from WPI (Sarasota, Florida, USA; Suppliers are listed in Table 2) are used as dissecting dishes (Figure 1). The chambers are designed to accommodate glass slides and small plastic washers are used as molds for the Sylgard. The washers are first fixed to the slide with grease and liquid Sylgard is added to the center of the washer. The Sylgard will cure overnight and as it does so, it forms a small, circular bed on the glass slide, which becomes the base of the dissecting dish. The slide is placed into the recording chamber and serves as the base of the chamber to which the preparation is affixed (Figure 1).\nPrepare the solutions listed in Table 3. Extracellular solutions should be left at room temperature while intracellular solutions should be kept sterile. One can also add Lucifer yellow (0.1%) to the intracellular solution so that visualization of M-cell morphology may be performed at the end of the experiment. This serves to confirm cell identity (Figure 2).\nRaise wild type zebrafish embryos in egg water at 28.5 °C, and collect and stage according to Kimmel et al. 10. For dissections, transfer embryos to the dissecting dish that also serves as the recording chamber. Anesthetize for 7-10 min in an anesthetizing salt solution (0.02% tricaine; solution 1, Table 3) that closely approximates physiological saline. One can determine if they are adequately anesthetized by examining the response to a gentle tail pinch.\nPin the embryos through the notochord and onto the Sylgard-lined dish with 0.001\" tungsten wire (Scientific Instrument Services. Inc., Ringoes, NJ, USA) using 25X magnification on a dissecting microscope (Figure 1). The tungsten wire is easily cut into small segments with fine dissecting scissors.",
    "Adjust the magnification on the dissecting scope to 40-50X to perform the dissection. Once the embryo is pinned to the dish, the jaw, eyes and forebrain are removed using a fine pair of forceps (Dumont #5).\nThe hindbrain is gently peeled away from the underlying notochord by carefully working the forceps between the notochord and the brain. The hindbrain is then gently turned over so that the ventral surface faces up. This positioning provides good access to the M-cells, which are usually within 5-10 μm of the ventral surface in young embryos and ~20-50 μm in older larvae (Figure 2A).\nCarefully move the preparation to the recording setup where the patch clamp experiment can be performed. The M-cells are visualized with Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast (DIC), although other modes of imaging (i.e. Hoffman modulation contrast or Dodt Gradient Contrast Imaging from Luigs and Neumann, Germany) may also be used.\n2. Patch Clamp Recording (Whole Cell Mode)\nAll recordings are performed in the whole cell patch clamp mode11. Recording chambers are placed onto a microscope stage in an electrophysiology setup. Our stages are fixed and the upright patch clamp microscope is bolted to a movable microscope platform or a microscope translator.\nPatch clamp pipettes are pulled on a horizontal puller (P-97; Sutter Instruments Co.) from thin-walled, borosilicate glass obtained from WPI. Pipette tip diameters are on the order of 0.2-0.4 μm after fire polishing to a smooth edge, and the shank taper is ~4 mm in length.\nAttach the pipette to the amplifier head-stage in the electrophysiology setup. It is important to keep the head-stage at roughly 45° angle to the horizontal axis as this ensures an entry angle for the pipette that is suitable for the formation of high resistance seals onto the Mauthner cell.",
    "Just before entering the bath solution, apply a small amount of positive pressure to the pipette to reduce the chance of dirtying the tip. When recording mEPSCs, bath solutions include 1 μM TTX to block action potentials, 5 μM strychnine to block glycine receptors and 10 μM bicuculline or 100 μM picrotoxin to block GABAA receptors. When recording mIPSCs, bath solutions include 1 μM TTX, kynurenic acid and either bicuculline or strychnine depending on the receptor activity of interest.\nApproach the M-cell with a small amount of positive pressure in the pipette. The positive pressure gently pushes the cell from side to side and when positioned immediately over the cell, forms a small dimple on the cell membrane. Leave the pipette in place for a few seconds to gently clean the cell surface so that a strong seal between the pipette and the membrane can be formed. Releasing the positive pressure in the pipette allows the seal to be initiated and a small amount of negative pressure coupled with negative pipette potentials results in GigaΩ seals forming within a few seconds.\nChange the holding potential on the amplifier to -60 mV. Rupture the cell membrane with a series of short pulses of suction. Immediately record membrane potentials and minimize capacitance artifacts. Compensate cell capacitance (Cm) and access (series) resistance (Ra) by 70-85%. Ra should be routinely monitored, every 30 sec to a minute, and if there is a change of 20% or more, abort the experiment.\nOnce the experiment has ended and enough data has been acquired, the preparation is sacrificed by removing the hindbrain with a pair of forceps. At this point, data analysis can begin."
