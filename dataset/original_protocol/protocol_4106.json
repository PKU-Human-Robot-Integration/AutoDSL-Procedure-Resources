    "PCR amplify the antibiotic resistance cassette and the flanking regions of the target gene.  Please see Figure 1 about primer pairs, L1/L2, R1/R2 and L/R used in this PCR. Reaction mix:  5 μl 10x PWO polymerase buffer (-MgSO4) 3 μl 25 mM MgSO4* 5 μl 2.5 mM dNTPs 5 μl 4 pmol/μl primer L1, R1, or L, respectively 5 μl 4 pmol/μl primer L2, R2, or R, respectively 1 μl 5 ng/μl template DNA*# 0.5 μl PWO DNA polymerase 25.5 μl dH2O Vtot = 50 μl  PCR cycle:  93 °C- 4 min  93 °C30 sec   | 55 °C1 min   | 35x 68 °C1.5 min| 68 °C5 min  12 °C∞  * Optimize if necessary. Increased MgSO4 or DNA template concentrations might increase yield, but might also decrease specificity. # Template for the flanking regions is chromosomal DNA. Template for the antibiotic resistance cassette can be plasmids or chromosomal DNA of a resistant strain.   Purify PCR products with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit.    Measure DNA concentration with the Nanodrop. Concentration of >20 ng/μl is enough for the Megaprimer PCR (step 6).   Load 2 μl PCR product mixed with DNA loading buffer on a 1.5% agarose gel with a 100 bp DNA marker.    Check the gel for purity (should be a single PCR product) and size of the product (size depends on the primer design, usually ~1,000 bp). When the desired product is not amplified, repeat the PCR in step 1 with modified conditions (e.g. decreased Tm, increased MgSO4 or addition of DMSO).   Perform a MegaPrimer PCR to unite the left and right flanking region of the target gene with the antibiotic resistance cassette.  Reaction mix:  5 μl 10x PWO polymerase buffer (+20 mM MgSO4) 5 μl 2.",

Check the gel for purity and size of the PCR product. PCR products with multiple sizes can be present, but should contain a product with the size of the left flank, antibiotic cassette and right flank combined, typically ~3,000 bp.   Optional: Perform a MegaPrimer PCR with one the PCR product of one flank and the antibiotic resistance cassette to confirm that the desired MegaPrimer PCR product is not formed without all three components.    Optional: Improve PCR yield by adding primers L1 and R1 (see Figure 1) to the PCR mix.    Thaw 1 ml M-IV competent NTHi (protocol for making competent M-IV see Reference 2 and protocol in Notes below).   Centrifuge 2 min at 10,000 x g in microcentrifuge.   Remove the M-IV medium containing glycerol and resuspend the bacteria in 1 ml M-IV medium.   Add target DNA and incubate 100 min. shaking with 100 rpm at 37 °C.    Centrifuge 2 min at 10,000 x g in microcentrifuge.   Remove 900 μl M-IV medium and plate 100 μl on selective BHI plates. Grow overnight at 37 °C + 5% CO2.  Note: Record in your logbook the amount of colonies appearing on the selective plate.    Pick four single colonies using a loop and streak them independently onto new selective BHI plates.",
    "Grow them overnight at 37 °C + 5% CO2.  Note: From now on this protocol until step 23 is done for all 4 colonies from step 17.   Resuspend colonies from step 17 in 5 ml of BHI medium with antibiotics.    Grow bacteria until optical density at 620 nm = 0.2.    Perform a chromosomal DNA isolation on the 5 ml culture from step 19 (e.g. CTAB protocol, for protocol see Notes below).    Perform two control PCRs with isolated genomic DNA from step 20 to confirm the deletion of the target gene and the insertion of the antibiotic resistance cassette. Include as negative control the chromosomal DNA of the wild type strain.  Reaction mix:  2 μl 10x AmpliTaq PCR buffer (-MgCl2) 2 μl 25 mM MgCl2* 2 μl 2.5 mM dNTPs 2 μl 4 pmol/μl primer L1  2 μl 4 pmol/μl primer C (gene) or primer A (cassette) 1 μl 5 ng/μl template chromosomal DNA 0.2 μl AmpliTaq DNA polymerase 8.8 μl dH2O Vtot = 20 μl  PCR cycle:  93 °C4 min  93 °C30 sec    | 55 °C1 min     | 35x 72 °C1.5 min   | 72 °C4 min  4 °C∞  *Optimize if necessary   Load 2 μl PCR product mixed with DNA loading buffer on a 1.5% agarose gel with a 100 bp DNA marker.   Check the gel for the size of the PCR product and select a mutant to continue with. Primer L1 + primer C (gene) should not result in an amplified PCR product (gene is removed), whereas the primer L1 + primer A (cassette) should give a PCR product (antibiotic cassette is inserted). Select the correct mutant and throw away all others.",
    "1 µg chromosomal DNA of the mutant obtained in step 20 is 'crossed back' to the recipient wild type strain by transformation to prevent accumulation of (spontaneous) mutations because the chance that multiple mutations will transfer to the recipient bacterium is very low.    Optional: To ensure that both mutant as wild-type strain have undergone the same (stress) conditions, also perform a transformation without adding DNA and without selection.    Plate transformation mixture on (selective) BHI plates. Grow them overnight at 37 °C + 5% CO2.    Optional: Make sure to dilute the wild type cells enough (e.g. 10,000 times) and plate onto a BHI agar plate without antibiotic. The mutant and equally treated wild type strain can be 'coupled' to for downstream experiments. It is possible to combine multiple mutants to one wild type strain.   Pick a single colony from each plate using a loop and streak them independently onto new (selective) BHI plates. Grow them overnight at 37 °C + 5% CO2.  Note: From now on this protocol is identical for the wild type and mutant strains.   Resuspend colonies from step 28 in 5 ml of BHI medium with or without antibiotics.    Grow bacteria until OD 0.2 at 620 nm and place on ice.    Pipet 1.0 ml into a cryotube with 0.25 ml 80% glycerol and store at -80 °C.   Use of the remaining media for chromosomal DNA isolation.    Perform a chromosomal DNA isolation on the 5 ml culture from step 19 (e.g. CTAB protocol, for protocol see Notes below).    Perform two control PCRs with isolated genomic DNA from step 33 with similar conditions as in step 21 to confirm the deletion of the target gene and the insertion of the antibiotic resistance cassette. Include as negative control the chromosomal DNA of the wild type strain.",
