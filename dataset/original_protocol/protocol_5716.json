    "Cultivation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Note: Monitor the growth of cyanobacterial cells by measuring the optical density at 730 nm (OD730) with a spectrophotometer. Culture volume should be less than 150 ml in 200 ml columns. Inoculate Synechocystis cultures into liquid BG11 media in glass column photobioreactors at 30 °C under constant white fluorescent light with a light intensity of 100 μE/m2/sec. Adjust the initial OD730 to 0.5.Bubble the cultures with CO2-enriched air flow (3%). Add the saturated NaCl solution prepared in BG11 media into the late exponential phase culture (OD730 ≈ 8-10) to reach a final NaCl concentration of 600 mM.Harvesting cells: Centrifuge 2 ml aliquots of the above Synechocystis cultures at 12,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Cells (Figure 1A) can be stored at -80 °C if not proceed to the next step immediately.Note: Regularly, the highest intracellular glucosylglycerol concentration of Synechocystis would be reached within two days after salt shock. For sucrose, the highest concentration will be reached around 12 h after salt shock. If cells could not be extracted immediately, Synechocystis cells should be spun down by centrifugation and stored without supernatants at a -80 °C freezer.Extraction of intracellular osmolytes from Synechocystis cellsRe-suspend Synechocystis cells in 1 ml of 80% ethanol (v/v) (Figure 1B) and then incubate at 65 °C for 4 h.Note: When incubating at 65 °C, it is better to mix the samples gently by inverting tubes once for each hour.After centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature, transfer the supernatant to a clean 10 ml tube, and then dry at 55 °C under a stream of nitrogen. Dissolve the dry residues (Figure 1C) in 1 ml of Milli-Q water, and filter through membranes (0.22 μm).Note: For drying, it takes about 30 min.",
    "If the extracted samples (Figure 1D) could not be analyzed immediately, they should be stored in 4 °C for less than seven days (-20 °C for less than 30 days), and filtered again before analyzing by ion chromatography.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416182426_7759.jpgFigure 1.

The dry residues dried at 55 °C under a stream of nitrogen; D. The extracted osmolyte samples from Synechocystis cells.Detection of intracellular osmolytes by ion chromatographyDilute the extracted samples to the suitable concentrations ranging from 1~20 mg/L.Note: Normally, the intracellular sucrose and glucosylglycerol concentrations in the wild type cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 are around 100 mg/L. Therefore, the samples should be diluted 5-10 fold. Subject 25 μl of samples to ICS-5000+ ion-exchange chromatography system equipped with an electrochemical detector and a DinexTM CarboPacTM PA10 analytical column (4 x 250 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Elute the column with 200 mM NaOH at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.Mix the standards of glucosylglycerol, sucrose, and glycerol, dilute into 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 mg/L, and analyze by the same methods with the extracted samples.Quantification of intracellular osmolytesFor the standard mixtures with 15 mg/L of each osmolyte, retention times of glycerol, glucosylglycerol, glucose and sucrose using the method described above are 1.7, 2.1, 3.3 and 5.5 min, respectively (Figure 2A).Based on the mixed osmolyte standards, standard curves are made by using the peak area calculated by the Chromeleon software (Figure 2B).For quantification of intracellular osmolytes in cyanobacteria, areas of the target peak obtained by ion chromatography are calculated by the Chromeleon software, and then the osmolyte concentration is determined using the standard curve of osmolyte standards.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416182922_3554.jpgFigure 2.

    "A. Chromatogram of the standard mixture. 15 mg/L of each kind of osmolyte standard were mixed together and analyzed by ion chromatography. Gly, Glycerol; GG, Glucosylglycerol; Glu, Glucose; Suc, Sucrose. B. Chromatogram of the sample isolated from Synechocystis cells. Standard curves of glycerol (C), glucosylglycerol (D), glucose (E) and sucrose (F) were established by plotting peak areas and concentrations of each kind of osmolyte standard."
