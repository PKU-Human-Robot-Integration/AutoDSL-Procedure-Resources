    "1. Incorporate Unique DNA Barcodes onto a Plasmid Containing the Necessary Components for Allelic Exchange\nNOTE: A new plasmid, named pSKAP, with a high copy number and increased transformation efficiency compared to the existing pKD13 allelic exchange plasmid was created. This is described in steps 1.1-1.12 (Figure 1). The finalized plasmids containing unique DNA barcodes and components for allelic exchange are available through a plasmid repository (Table of Materials).\nUsing a commercial plasmid miniprep kit, purify pKD1314 and pPCR Script Cam SK+ from overnight bacterial cultures grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin or 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol (for pKD13 and pPCR Script Cam SK+, respectively) (Table 1).\nPerform restriction digestions on both plasmids using commercial restriction enzymes HindIII and BamHI according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\nRemove restriction enzymes and excised DNA from the pPCR Script Cam SK+ reaction and purify the 3,370-base pair (bp) plasmid backbone using a commercially available DNA cleanup kit according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\nSeparate the fragments from the pKD13 restriction digestion on a 1% agarose gel using an electrophoresis chamber.\nVisualize bands using a blue light transilluminator and excise the 1,333 bp fragment from the gel (Figure 1C).\nNOTE: This fragment contains the FRT-flanked kanamycin resistance gene required for chromosomal allelic replacement.\nPurify the excised DNA from step 1.5 using a commercial gel extraction kit.\nTo create pSKAP, ligate the purified fragment from pKD13 (from step 1.6) into pPCR Script Cam SK+ (from step 1.3) using a commercial T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\nTransform chemically competent DH5α cells with the ligated pSKAP plasmid following the manufacturer’s protocol (Table 1).\nSpread transformants onto LB agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubate at 37 °C overnight.",
    "Pick a colony from the plate and streak it on a new LB agar plate supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubate at 37 °C overnight. Pick a colony from this plate and use to inoculate LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Incubate the culture overnight at 37 °C with constant agitation.\nUse a commercial plasmid miniprep kit to purify pSKAP from the overnight bacterial culture.\nPerform a diagnostic restriction digestion of the plasmid from step 1.11 using Hind III and Bam HI according to manufacturer’s specifications. Visualize fragments on a 1% agarose gel as in steps 1.4-1.5.\nNOTE: The pSKAP total size should be 4,703 bp. Fragments after step 1.12 should be 3,370 and 1,333 bp.\nDesign PCR primers for insertional site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) (Table 2 and S1) in such a way as to insert a unique 25-basepair DNA sequence at position 725 of pSKAP (Figure 2).\nNOTE: The barcode DNA is inserted into the plasmid just outside of the FRT-flanked kanamycin resistance gene, so the barcode is not lost during subsequent removal of the kanamycin resistance cassette. If generating new barcode sequences, use online tools to ensure that the fluorescently-labeled target-specific PCR probes (hereafter referred to simply as “probes”) will efficiently bind to the new sequence. Insertion sequences designed to-date, along with the necessary primers to create them, are provided in Tables 2 and S1.\nPrepare SDM reactions using a commercial high-fidelity DNA polymerase, the desired primer pairs (Table 2), and pSKAP template. Set the thermocycler to perform the following: 1) 98 °C for 30 s, 2) 98 °C for 10 s, 56 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 2 min, 3) repeat steps 2, 24 times, 4) 72 °C for 5 min, 5) hold at 4 °C.",
    "After completion of PCR, deplete pSKAP template by adding the restriction enzyme Dpn I to the reaction. Incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.\nNOTE: Products from PCR should be visualized on an agarose gel to verify the size and purity of the product. A control Dpn I digestion consisting of the unmodified pSKAP template can be performed and used in subsequent steps to ensure template DNA is completely digested.\nUse 5 μL of the product from step 1.15 to transform 100 μL of commercial chemically competent DH5α cells according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\nSpread transformants onto LB agar plates supplemented with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nSelect a colony (or colonies) from overnight plates and streak onto individual LB agar plates supplemented with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol and incubate at 37 °C overnight. Select a colony from overnight plates and use to inoculate 5 mL of LB broth supplemented with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Incubate culture(s) overnight at 37 °C with constant agitation.\nUse a commercial plasmid miniprep kit to purify plasmids from the overnight culture(s).\nSanger sequence purified plasmids using the M13 Forward sequencing primer (Table 2). Compare mutated region to the original plasmid and assess for SDM insertional accuracy.\nAfter confirming the barcode insertion and accuracy, assign each barcode and plasmid a name.\nNOTE: Barcodes generated to-date have been assigned a two-letter designation: AA, AB, AC, …, BA, BB, BC, etc. Barcoded plasmids are denoted as pSKAP_AA, pSKAP_AB, pSKAP_AC, …, pSKAP_BA, pSKAP_BB, pSKAP_BC, etc.\nRepeat steps 1.14-1.21 to generate the desired number of DNA barcodes.\n2. Introduce DNA Barcode onto the Chromosome of S. Typhimurium",
    "NOTE: Insertion of DNA barcodes onto the S. Typhimurium chromosome is achieved by using an allelic exchange method described by Datsenko and Wanner14 that has been modified for use in S. Typhimurium.\nDetermine the locus on the S. Typhimurium genome at which to insert the DNA barcode (Figure 3).\nNOTE: Select a large, intergenic region of the chromosome. Avoid regions that produce non-coding RNA. This study utilized a locus downstream of put P between residues 1,213,840 and 1,213,861 (determined from genome assembly GCA_000022165.1). This region has previously been genetically manipulated for in trans complementation of genes15. Alternatively, a DNA barcode could be introduced while simultaneously disrupting a gene of interest. Doing so would require minimal alterations to this protocol and streamline mutant creation.\nDesign PCR primers to amplify the unique barcode and FRT-flanked kanamycin resistance gene from the desired pSKAP barcode-containing plasmid from step 1.21 (Table 2). Add 40-nucleotide extensions that are homologous to the region selected in step 2.1 to the 5’ end of each primer (Table 2).\nPerform the amplification using a commercial high-fidelity polymerase, the primers from step 2.2, and the desired pSKAP barcode-containing plasmid as template. Set the thermocycler to perform the following: 1) 98 °C for 30 s, 2) 98 °C for 10 s, 3) 56 °C for 15 s, 4) 72 °C for 60 s, repeat steps 2-4 29 times, 5) 72 °C for 5 min, 6) hold at 4 °C.\nAfter completion of PCR, deplete template DNA using DpnI as described in step 1.15. Purify and concentrate the DNA using a commercial DNA cleanup kit according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\nRefer to the previously published protocol for generating mutants in S. Typhimurium strain 14028s from PCR products14,16,17,18.",
    "NOTE: It is not essential that the kanamycin resistance gene is excised from the chromosome. However, excision of the gene is minimally disruptive to the bacterial chromosome as it results in a 129 bp scar that would leave potential downstream genes in-frame. It is recommended that the strain containing the kanamycin resistance gene is retained as it can be used to move barcodes between strains via P22-mediated transduction.\nRepeat steps 2.3 – 2.5 to create the desired strains with the appropriate barcodes.\nNOTE: Barcodes can be introduced into wild-type S. Typhimurium that can then be subjected to further genetic manipulation, or barcodes can be introduced into strains that have been previously genetically altered.\n3. Bacterial Growth Conditions and In Vitro Competition Assays\nFrom bacteria stock, streak desired S. Typhimurium strains that each harbor a unique DNA barcode onto LB agar plates. Incubate plates overnight at 37 °C.\nSelect a single colony from each strain and inoculate 5 mL of LB broth. Incubate for 20 h at 37 °C with constant agitation.\nNOTE: Using the overnight culture, proceed to step 3.5 to collect pure genomic DNA (gDNA) from each barcoded strain. This is necessary for subsequent validation and control experiments in section 6.\nFor each competition assay, transfer an equal volume of each overnight culture into an appropriately sized sterile tube. Thoroughly mix strains together by vortexing vigorously for at least 5 s.",
    "NOTE: The volume of each overnight culture to transfer should be sufficient for each condition and replicate, as well as for isolating gDNA to quantify input. While it is not entirely necessary to measure optical densities of cultures because the absolute number of input microorganisms will be quantified using digital PCR, the number of input bacteria for each strain should be approximately equal to avoid bottlenecks or unequal competition early in the experiment. Representative competition assays in this protocol compared growth rates of 8 strains simultaneously. Additional or fewer strains may be necessary for individual experimental designs.\nTransfer 100 μL of the mixed inoculum into 4.9 mL sterile LB broth. Incubate at 37 °C for the desired time or to a desired optical density.\nHarvest 500 μL of the inoculum by centrifugation at >12,000 x g for 1 min. Remove and discard the supernatant. Proceed immediately to section 4 with the cells.\nAt desired time points, remove 500 μL aliquots of culture and harvest cells by centrifugation at >12,000 x g for 1 min. Remove and discard supernatant.\nNOTE: If collecting aliquots at multiple timepoints, freeze pellets at -20 °C or immediately proceed to step 4.1 after each collection.\n4. Collecting and Quantifying gDNA from S. Typhimurium (from Steps 3.5 and 3.6)\nHarvest gDNA from cells using a commercial gDNA purification kit. If available, perform the optional RNA depletion step.\nNOTE: RNA depletion is not necessary; however, the presence of RNA will artificially increase the DNA concentration, leading to aberrant calculations in subsequent steps. If using a commercial gDNA purification kit, follow the manufacturer’s recommendations to ensure that the column is not overloaded with DNA. There is no minimum DNA concentration required if the sample is quantifiable in subsequent steps.\nUse a spectrophotometer to quantify DNA in each sample.",
    "NOTE: DNA can be quantified using any reliable method.\nCalculate gDNA copy number based on the bacterial genome size using the following equation where: X is the amount of DNA in ng and N is the length of a double-stranded DNA molecule (the genome size).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59630/59630eq1.jpg\nNOTE: 660 g/mole is used as the average mass of 1 DNA bp. Small variations may exist depending on the organism’s nucleotide composition. Numerous calculators are available online to perform the calculation.\n5. Design Primers and Probes for Quantitative Detection of DNA Barcodes via dDigital PCR\nDesign primers to amplify the barcoded region of the S. Typhimurium chromosome downstream of putP (Figure 3C and Table 2).\nNOTE: Primer and probe designs can be facilitated by numerous online programs (Table of Materials). If barcodes are all inserted at the same loci, a single set of amplification primers is universal for all barcodes.\nDesign 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-based and/or hexachlorofluorescein (HEX)-based probes specific to each barcode (Table 2 and S1).\nNOTE: The droplet reader used in this experiment is capable of detecting both FAM- and HEX-based probes simultaneously in a multiplex reaction. Design ½ of the probes to utilize FAM and ½ to utilize HEX. This is not a necessary step but will reduce the reagent use and experimental costs if implemented.\nMake 20x primer-probe master mixes containing 1) 20 mM of each forward and reverse amplification primer, 2) 10 mM of a single FAM probe, and 3) 10 mM of a single HEX probe (if multiplexing).\n6. Validate the Sensitivity and Specificity of Each Pprimer-probe Set for Each Genomic Barcode Using Digital PCR\nNOTE: This protocol uses validating eight unique barcodes with eight unique probes as an example. The number of barcodes utilized can be increased or decreased to accommodate various experimental designs.",
    "Create a pool of gDNA that contains every barcode except for one. Use this pool as the diluent to perform a dilution series with gDNA containing the single remaining barcode (sample dilution scheme is provided in Figure 4).\nNOTE: Using pooled gDNA as a diluent ensures a consistent background while ascertaining sensitivity. Using the copy numbers determined in step 4.3, dilute gDNA to a copy number within the recommended digital PCR range (1-100,000 copies per 20 μL reaction). Keep in mind that the range is set for each unique target (barcode), not the total gDNA.\nPrepare reactions for digital PCR in duplicate according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for using a digital PCR supermix designed for probe-based chemistry. Use the mixtures from step 6.1 as template DNA. Use the 20x primer-probe master mix from step 5.3 that contains the probe for the diluted barcode in step 6.1.\nPrepare replicate control reactions for digital PCR according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for using a digital PCR supermix designed for probe-based chemistry. Control reactions for each probe mix must consist of 1) no template controls (NTCs), 2) negative controls, and 3) positive controls.\nNOTE: The minimum number of replicate control reactions is two. This example protocol uses four NTCs, six negative controls, and six positive controls for each barcode. Negative controls should contain gDNA with each barcode except for the barcode corresponding to the probe being tested. This will validate the specificity of each probe.\nRepeat steps 6.1-6.3 to create digital PCR reactions for each barcoded gDNA sample. A sample plate arrangement is presented in Figure 5.",
    "NOTE: This and subsequent steps are described based on a specific digital PCR platform that utilizes droplets and flow-based technology. Alternative digital PCR platforms that utilize chip-based technology can easily be substituted with slight modifications to this protocol. Step 6.4 may require more than one 96-well plate to validate all primer sets. In contrast to qPCR, separate plates analyzed by digital PCR can be readily compared without the need for standardized reference wells between plates.\nGenerate droplets for each reaction condition using a droplet generator according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nTransfer newly created droplets into the appropriate 96-well plate. Use 200 μL pipette tips on a 5-50 μL multichannel pipette.\nNOTE: When pipetting droplets, pipette slowly and smoothly! The digital PCR equipment manufacturer recommends using only pipettes and pipette tips from a particular manufacturer (e.g., Ranin). These pipette tips have a smooth opening with no microscopic plastic fragments that can destroy droplets or damage the microfluidics of the droplet reader. Numerous brands of tips were examined and observed to have a spectrum of manufacturing quality. Equivalent results have been achieved using pipette tip alternatives; however, caution should be used when deviating from the manufacturer’s recommendations.\nAfter all the droplets have been generated and transferred, seal the plate with a foil plate sealer.\nUse the manufacturer-recommended thermocycler to perform the following cycling conditions: 1) 94 °C for 10 min; 2) 94 °C for 1 min, ramp rate set at 1 °C/s; 3) 55 °C for 2 min, ramp rate set at 1 °C/s; 4) repeat steps 2 and 3 49 times; 5) 98 °C for 10 min; 6) hold at 4 °C up to 24 h.\nNOTE: Thermal transfer in a droplet reaction is not the same as standard PCR. Reaction conditions may require modification.",
    "While thermocycling is being performed, program the data analysis software with the plate setup information such as sample name, experiment type (absolute quantification), supermix used, target 1 name (FAM barcode name), target 1 type (NTC, positive control, negative control, or unknown), target 2 name (HEX barcode name), target 2 type (blank, positive control, negative control, or unknown). The final plate setup information is shown in Figure 5.\nAfter thermocycling is complete, transfer the completed reactions to the droplet reader and start the reading process according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n7. Quantify the Number of Bacteria in a Competitive Index Experiment\nDilute gDNA isolated and quantified from section 4 to an appropriate concentration as described above.\nPrepare reactions for digital PCR according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for using the appropriate supermix. Use DNA from step 7.1 as the template. Use one 20x primer-probe master mix that contains the probe (or probes if detecting both FAM and HEX) for possible barcodes present in the experiment.\nPrepare additional digital PCR reactions as in step 7.2 using different 20x primer-probe master mixes until all barcodes utilized in the experimental design can be detected.\nInclude controls for each condition as described in 6.3. This includes 1) no template controls (NTCs), 2) negative controls, and 3) positive controls.\nContinue with the protocol as described in steps 6.5-6.10.\n8. Analyze Digital PCR Data and Calculate Absolute Copy Numbers\nWhen all wells have been read and the run is complete, open the .qlp data file using the data analysis software.\nNOTE: The file types and data analysis procedures described here are specific to one digital PCR manufacturer. If using alternative digital PCR platforms, file types and data analysis procedures will be specific to the platform used and should be performed according to the manufacturer’s recommended specifications.",
    "Select all wells that utilize the same primer-probe master mix.\nOn the Droplets tab, examine the number of droplets analyzed in each well (both positive and negative droplets). Exclude from analysis any well that has fewer than 10,000 total droplets.\nMove to the 1D Amplitude tab and examine the amplitudes of positive and negative droplets. Ensure they comprise two distinct populations.\nWithin the software, use the thresholding feature to make a cutoff between positive and negative droplets for each probe that was utilized (Figure 6).\nNOTE: All wells that use the same primer-probe master mix from step 5.3 should have the same thresholds.\nOnce appropriate thresholds have been applied to all wells, the software will calculate the number of DNA copies in each reaction. Export data to a spreadsheet to facilitate further analysis.\nNOTE: The data analysis software uses the number of positive and negative droplets that are fit to a Poisson distribution to determine the copy number.\nUsing the values from step 8.6, calculate the initial copy number of each unique genomic barcode in the sample. Determine the mean false-positive rate from the negative control reactions and subtract this value from the values obtained in experimental reactions. Multiply values as necessary based on the dilutions that were performed when setting up each experiment (Table 3).\n9. Determine Relative Fitness of an Organism by Calculating the CI or COI from Digital PCR-based Quantification of Barcoded Strains",
    "Calculate the CI of a barcoded strain using the following formulas where: AOutput is the absolute quantification of the barcoded strain at a given timepoint, WTOutput is the absolute quantification of barcoded wild-type bacteria at the same timepoint, AInput is the absolute quantification of the input inoculum of the barcoded strain, WTInput is the absolute quantification of the input inoculum of barcoded wild-type bacteria, XOutput is the summation of all strains at the same timepoint, XInput is the summation of the total input inoculum of all barcoded strains.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59630/59630eq2.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59630/59630eq3.jpg\nNOTE: See the discussion for advantages, disadvantages, and the most appropriate use of each formula.\nRepeat step 9.1 for each barcoded strain at all timepoints.\nIf applicable, calculate the COI using the following formulas where: AOutput is the absolute quantification of a barcoded strain with mutated gene A at a given timepoint, ABOutput is the absolute quantification of a barcoded strain with mutated genes A and B at the same timepoint, AInput is the absolute quantification of the input inoculum of the barcoded strain with mutated gene A, ABInput is the absolute quantification of the input inoculum of barcoded strain with mutated genes A and B, BOutput is the absolute quantification of a barcoded strain with mutated gene B at a given timepoint, and BInput is the absolute quantification of the input inoculum of the barcoded strain with mutated gene B.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59630/59630eq4.jpg\nAND/OR\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59630/59630eq5.jpgSubscription Required.
