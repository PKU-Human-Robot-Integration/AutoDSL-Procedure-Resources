    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of siRNA for injection\nTiming: 60–90 min (calculation time depends on the number of mice)\nIn this protocol we used Invivofectamine™ 3.0 Reagent (ThermoFisher) and in vivo siRNA from Ambion. Alternatively, one could use in vivo-jetPEI® (Polyplus transfection) or AteloGene® (Bio-connect).\nCalculating systemic amount and concentration of siRNA for a 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg dose.\nTo dose each mouse according to its individual body weight (in mg/kg), the siRNA amount and its micromolar (μM) concentration has to be calculated.\nBefore proceeding, convert the concentration of the siRNA stock to mg/mL (for example, use online calculator: https://horizondiscovery.com/en/ordering-and-calculation-tools/nmol-to-ug-calculator[href=https://horizondiscovery.com/en/ordering-and-calculation-tools/nmol-to-ug-calculator]). In our study, we used 250 μM siRNA stock solution (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nWeigh the mice a day prior to the experiment. This is necessary, as the Invivofectamine/siRNA complex takes 24 h to form.\nNote: In this protocol, we injected 200 μl per mouse. Always prepare ×1.5 volume per injection as a backup in case of any spillage.\nPreparation of Invivofectamine 3.0 - siRNA duplex complex mixture 24 h prior injection\nTo determine the siRNA concentration for each individual mouse, we made use of the information worked out in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and kept all mouse records in an MS Excel file.\nThe siRNA duplex solution for injection is prepared in accordance with the ThermoFisher protocol for Invivofectamine 3.0 Reagent Complexation with slight modifications.\nMix siRNA duplex solution (as calculated in the column 5 of Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) with Complexation Buffer in 1:1 ratio.\nThaw the Invivofectamine 3.0 reagent at 20°C–25°C and add to the diluted siRNA in 1: 0.5 ratio (modified from original manufacturer protocol).\nVortex immediately to ensure Invivofectamine 3.0 complexation.\nIncubate invivofectamine 3.0- siRNA duplex mixture at 50oC, for 30 min.\nSpin the tubes briefly to collect the sample at the bottom of the tube.",
    "Dilute the sample by adding PBS, pH 7.4 (DNase RNase free) to a total volume of 200 μl.\nStore the solution for 24 h at 4°C.\nCritical: Use RNase-free tubes, RNase-free filter pipette tips and follow standard biological sterile techniques.\nMouse intravenous (IV) administration\nTiming: 10 min for heating up, 5–15 min for injection per mouse.\nIntravenous (IV) administration in mice is usually performed via the lateral (right and left) tail veins.\nCritical: Tail vein injection is technically difficult, particularly in mice on a C57BL/6 J background, due to their relatively scaly skin and darker tail. Adequate training prior to the experiment, preferably in albino background mice, could be useful.\nRandomize mice prior to the treatment and match them by weight and gender.\nPlace the mice in a heating chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) at 38oC for 8–10 min to dilate the tail vein.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/618-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mouse Intravenous (IV) administration\n(A) Heating Box (Chamber).\n(B) Restrainer without mouse.\n(C) Restrainer with a mouse.\n(D) Tail vein injection\nRestrain mice using the mechanical restraint device with the pores in the front to ensure that the mouse is breathing and use the holes in the back to pull out the mouse tail (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nCritical: The restraining device should be of appropriate size for the mice to be injected. After use, the restraining device should be cleaned thoroughly to avoid pheromone-induced stress or cross-infection.\nDisinfect the tail with antiseptic solution (75 % ethanol).\nRotate or turn the restrainer to access the lateral (either left or right) tail vein and immobilize the tail with the left hand.\nVisualize the vein. If the vein is not visible, leave the mouse in the heated box for another 5 min. Troubleshooting 1",
    "Tightly press the tail and orient the needle (with 1 mL injection syringe ) in your right hand parallel to the tail, with the beveled edge of the needle facing up.\nInsert needle (30G) into the vein starting at the tip of the tail (distally) at about a 30° angle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: Always start injection by placing the needle at the distal end of the tail vein. In case of an unsuccessful injection, a second attempt can be made at a relatively more proximal site. Alternatively, the second vein on the other side (could be left or otherwise) can be attempted.\nIf the needle advances in the blood vessel, there will not be any resistance and the compound will flow easily during administration. In a case of unsuccessful needle injection, the material from the syringe will not move through the vein or it will cause blanching around the vein.\nAdminister compound slowly and evenly.\nUpon needle retrieval, immediately apply gentle pressure with gauze (30–60 seconds) on the vein until bleeding has stopped. Animals should not be returned to their cage before the blood flow has stopped.\nMonitor animal for 5 to 10 min to ensure hemostasis.\nIn our protocol, mice were left for 5–7 days post injection prior to tissue analysis.\nCritical: After the siRNA injection, animals should be monitored daily to observe any side effects caused by either siRNA injection (should be equal for both control and gene of interest siRNAs) or by loss of your specific gene of interest (should not be observed in control animals).\nBlood sampling\nTiming: For blood sampling from superficial vein  10–15 min per mouse.\nTiming: For terminal blood collection  Duration of cardiac puncture is 5–10 min per mouse.",
    "We used this method to collect blood samples before and after a fasting period to monitor the levels of different metabolites as well as markers of liver damage in the blood plasma.\nBlood sampling from superficial vein Prior to fasting period, a blood sample was collected from a superficial vein. Sampling from the lateral saphenous vein is a relatively quick and easy method for obtaining a small amount of blood from a mouse. In this method, conscious mice are restrained using a restraint tube and approximately 100–120 μl of blood is collected.\nRestrain a conscious mouse using a restraint tube (optionally, one can use a home-made 50 mL Falcon tube restrainer with a hole cut at the bottom to allow the mouse to breath).\nCritical: Restraint tube should be appropriate for the size of the mouse. All forms of restraining equipment should be frequently washed to prevent pheromone-induced stress or cross-infection.\nTo collect blood, the hind leg should be stretched out using your left-hand index finger and thumb, while the other fingers are used as barrier to stop the mouse escaping from the restrainer tube. Immobilize the leg in an extended position by applying gentle downward pressure with fingers immediately above the knee joint.\nShave the fur on the stretched back of the leg (or thigh) using an electric hair clipper. The vein should be visible on the skin after shaving.\nDisinfect the vein with antiseptic solution (75 % ethanol).\nCollect the blood using a 25G needle into anticoagulant-treated EDTA tubes (Microvette® CB300 K2E, Sarstedt).\nStop the blood flow by gentle finger pressure with sterile tissue paper or gauze over the puncture site. Animals should not be returned to their cage before the blood flow has stopped.",
    "Centrifuge blood samples for 10 min at 1,000–2,000 × g at 4°C and collect the supernatant plasma to a new tube and store on dry ice (long term storage in −20°C or lower).\nIn this protocol, blood plasma was analyzed for basal levels of glucose, insulin, and for liver function tests by the Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory (CBAL), a Cambridge University Hospital facility.\nCritical: The number of attempts for blood sampling should be minimised (no more than three needle sticks in any one attempt). There is always a possibility that a mouse may not bleed after three attempts to access the saphenous vein. Try to relax the mouse leg by tapping its foot gently, as this may allow a small amount of blood (10–20 μl) to be collected immediately.\nTerminal blood collection After the fasting period, a terminal blood sample was collected using cardiac puncture, a suitable technique that allows one to obtain a single, large, good quality blood sample from a mouse under deep terminal anesthesia. Depending on the size of the mouse and whether the heart is kept beating, 0.1 - 1 mL of blood can be obtained from each mouse.\nAnaesthetize mouse using isoflurane in an isoflurane chamber/box.\nOnce the mouse is in deep anesthesia (checked by pinching its toe with your fingernails), place it in a lying position with the chest and abdomen side up (ventral side up) on the table / or on the operating bench with the isoflurane mask on.\nPrepare a 1 mL syringe with a 23G needle (with plunger in).\nThe heart is located approximately at the level of the elbow on the left. The point of the needle entry or heart puncture is measured against the point of the elbow on the chest wall.",
    "Insert the needle (bevel-up) at an angle of slightly more than 45o at a point midway on the chest wall dorsoventrally, to enable the heart to be punctured.\nApply slight back pressure with the syringe. If the needle is in the heart, blood will flow into the syringe.\nWait until blood has filled the syringe before adding additional back pressure on the syringe. Avoid applying back pressure and releasing it repeatedly, as this can cause clotting in the syringe.\nCritical: Blood should be withdrawn slowly to prevent the heart collapsing.\nCollect blood by capillary action into anticoagulant-treated EDTA tubes (Microvette® CB300 K2E, Sarstedt).\nAfter blood collection, the mouse is culled by cervical dislocation.\nCentrifuge blood samples for 10 min at 1,000–2,000 × g at 4°C and transfer supernatant plasma to a new tube and store on dry ice (long term storage in −20°C or lower).\nIn this protocol, blood plasma was analyzed for basal levels of glucose, insulin, and for liver function by the Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory (CBAL), a Cambridge University Hospital facility.\nMouse food deprivation\nTiming: Duration of food deprivation is 23 h, with 1–2 h for weighing the mice, preparing the cages, and keeping records.\nThe body weight of each mouse should be measured before and after the fasting cycle and recorded.\nIn our laboratory, we routinely use two fasting periods: 23 h and 46 h. The 46 h period consists of a 22 h fasting period followed by refeeding for 2 h in order to synchronize mice in each group (since mice feed freely under normal conditions), and then a subsequent period of fasting for 22 h. Food deprivation typically starts at midday (from 12:00 to 1:00pm) and lasts untilthe next morning (by 10:00–11:00 am).",
    "For food deprivation, mice are transferred to a fresh cage without food, either singly or doubly housed. For fasting, instead of removing food from the old cage, move the mice to a fresh cage without food to avoid any food intake causing experimental error, e.g., in case any food particles were on the floor or nesting of the old cage.\nDuring the food deprivation period, mice have free access to water throughout the procedure.\nIn the experiments where the response to insulin signaling was assessed, the 23 h fasting period was followed by a refeeding period for 2 h to cause a synchronized-rise in glucose and insulin levels in the blood.\nAfter 2 h of refeeding, mice were weighed to ensure they have eaten the food.\nAfter the desired fasting/refeeding cycle, mice were anaesthetized using isofluorane and terminal blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture. After death has been confirmed by cervical dislocation, the liver and other tissues were collected.\nCritical: Mice will lose weight in this protocol. If the weight loss exceeds 15%, the mouse should be immediately either culled or re-fed (according to our licence).\nTissue (liver) dissection\nTiming: 5–10 min per mouse.\nSanitize the mouse abdomen surface with 70 % ethanol.\nUse scissors and tweezers to open the abdomen and dissect out the entire liver (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/618-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Liver dissection\n(A) Mouse open abdomen.\n(B) dissected liver.\nRinse liver in cold 1×PBS and immediately store the liver lobes on dry ice.\nTransfer mice tissue (in this case liver) into the −80°C freezer for long term storage.",
    "Note: In the trial experiment performed with a small mice cohort, additional organs such as brain, pancreas, spleen, muscle, and kidney should be collected for analysis. This will help the investigator assess if the protein of interest was also targeted in organs besides the liver.\nRNA isolation and analysis of mRNA levels\nTiming: 4–6 h\nPrepare homogenate from frozen liver tissue.\nPrepare a box with dry ice and a box with ice, and a scalpel and forceps cleaned with 70% ethanol and RNase decontamination solution.\nUsing scalpel and forceps, cut approximately 50–100 mg of the liver tissue.\nNote: It is important to cut the same liver lobe from each tissue sample. For protein isolation, cut a piece from the same tissue area. Do not allow thawing of the entire tissue. Freezing is not obligatory and one can analyse fresh tissue – the freezing step enables analyses at convenient times after the dissection.\nPlace a liver fragment into a pre-cooled (dry ice) 2 mL RNase- and DNase-free homogenizing tube containing ceramic beads. Keep the tube on dry ice to prevent thawing, while preparing following samples. In case liver tissue fragments were prepared fresh, continue to step d.\nOnce all tissues are cut, place tubes on ice, add 1 mL of TRIzol reagent per sample and homogenize using a homogenizer (work in the cold room).\nNote: TRIzol is highly toxic - always work in a fume hood when working with TRIzol.\nIncubate the lysate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C (room temperature) and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 20°C.\nTransfer supernatant to new 1.5 mL RNase-free tubes.\nPause Point: Homogenized samples can be stored at –60 to –80°C for at least one month with no noticeable differences in RNA yield, compared with fresh samples.",
    "Purify RNA using PureLink®RNA kit and on-column PureLink® DNase treatment, following manufacturer’s protocol specific for TRIzol extraction (starting on page 49 in manufacturer’s manual). Purified RNA can be stored long-term at −80°C.\nSynthetize cDNA using SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System, following the standard manufacturer protocol. cDNA can be stored long-term at −20°C.\nPerform real-time PCR analysis with prepared cDNA using PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix, following standard manufacturer protocol. Troubleshooting 3\nNote: In the real-time PCR assay, CT values are specific to your gene of interest. The ΔCT value shows a difference in expression between your gene of interest and a reference gene (usually housekeeping gene; in our protocol we used mouse Gapdh). The ΔΔCT shows a fold change difference between the control and treated sample. When comparing two (or more) groups of mice, for example control siRNA vs. siRNA knockdown or fed vs. starved mice, always prepare one sample with an equal mixture of each cDNA from all control/basal conditions mice in the experiment. The ΔCT result for this sample will serve as a normalization factor allowing one to calculate fold-change in the expression of your gene of interest (ΔΔCT) for each mouse (both control and treated).\nProtein isolation and analysis of protein levels\nTiming: 2–4 h\nPrepare homogenate from a frozen liver tissue.\nPrepare a box with ice, and scalpel and forceps cleaned with ethanol.\nUsing scalpel and forceps, cut approximately 100 mg of the liver tissue.\nNote: It is important to cut the same liver lobe from each tissue sample. For protein isolation, cut a piece from the same tissue area. Do not allow thawing of the entire tissue. Freezing is not obligatory and one can analyse fresh tissue – the freezing step enables analyses at convenient times after the dissection.",
    "Place a liver fragment into a pre-cooled 2 mL tube with 1 mL ice-cold 1×PBS and wash the liver fragment by inverting the tube a few times.\nTransfer the liver fragment to a pre-cooled 2 mL tube containing ceramic beads and 500 μl of cold RIPA buffer (kept on ice) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Keep the tube on ice, while preparing following samples.\nNote: RIPA buffer can be prepared earlier and stored in aliquots in −20°C; always add protease and phosphatase inhibitors freshly prior to use.\nOnce all tissues are prepared, homogenize using a homogenizer.\nIncubate homogenates on ice for 30 min and centrifuge 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer supernatants into fresh pre-cooled eppendorf tubes and keep on ice.\nDetermine protein concentration using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit following manufacturer’s protocol.\nPause Point: Homogenized samples can be stored long-term at –80°C. Prepare aliquots to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nAnalyze the protein levels and post-translational modifications (for example protein phosphorylation) using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using specific antibodies. Troubleshooting 5\nNormalize your protein-of-interest levels (in our case Usp9x) to the levels of a house-keeping gene, like mouse Tubulin or Gapdh. Present the data as ratios of protein-of-interest signal intensity to signal intensity of a house-keeping gene using arbitrary units (AU). Test a few house-keeping genes and stain the protein ladder resolved by SDS-PAGE gel using Coomassie staining, to ensure equal protein loading across samples. Troubleshooting 2, Troubleshooting 4",
    "Note: Often, the number of samples that one is analysing exceeds the number of wells available on one gel. To be able to compare the protein levels across all animals, load the same control sample (or few common controls) onto each gel. The use of common controls on different gels allows normalization, so one can compare large numbers of samples."
