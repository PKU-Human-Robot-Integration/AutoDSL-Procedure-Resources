    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSection preparations\nTiming: 2–4 h\nIn this step, you will generate transverse or longitudinal sections of your sample to use for the immunolabeling procedure.\nBlock trimming.\nAfter polymerization, the resin-embedded sample inside the block should be trimmed to remove excess resin regions and to orient the sample in the block for microtome sectioning (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: The goal of this step is to help obtain the tissue sections easily by removing excess resin regions without sample from the block. The width of the block at this point will define the section size, and the number of sections that can be handled during the experiments. Depending on the sample, an optimal section size is 3 × 3 mm to 5 × 5 mm.\nUse a blade or scalpel to remove resin without sample, be sure to keep a square shape at the end (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Keeping a square shape makes it easier to section.\nSectioning.\nMake the basic adjustments to the microtome (knife angle, sample position, thickness selection), be sure that everything is correctly set and place the base mold with the sample to start the cutting process.\nObtain sections. Sections with a thickness of 10–16 μm are recommended.\nNote: The first sections you obtain could not have sample in it (Tissue is not directly at the surface of the block, first some sections must be cut that will only have plastic resin). Check the presence of the correct sample within the section by collecting some sections and observing them under a stereo microscope. Once you start getting sections with the sample proceed to the next step.",
    "Grab the sections with some tweezers and without releasing them, dip them for a few seconds in a well containing distilled water, this step will eliminate any debris. The well used for this step can be in another box.\nAfter the washing step, transfer up to 5–10 sections to 1 well of a 24-well plate containing 1 mL of Milli-Q water (per well), to continue with the protocol.\nNote: Include samples for the negative and positive controls (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nBlocking\nPrepare blocking solution (see the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] Section).\nRemove water from the well with a pipette and add blocking solution. The working volume will depend on the number of sections you have in the well, usually 1 mL is enough for up to 5–10 sections.\nWash three times with blocking solution 10 min each.\nCritical: To avoid the sections sticking together in the wells, try to use small sections, less than 5 × 5 mm. If the sample is too large or complex, try to dissect it first and embed it in separate blocks. Sections should not overlap in the solution, otherwise they will stick together.\nImmunolabeling using fluorescent antibodies\nIncubation with primary antibody\nTiming: 14–17 h\nDuring this step, primary antibodies bind to their epitope molecules in the sample.\nAfter Step 3c, remove the blocking solution from the wells using a pipette.\nReplace blocking solution with 500 μL of primary antibody solution (diluted).\nPreviously prepare the primary antibody (from 1:20 to 1:1000; see Note) in blocking solution supplemented with 0.025% Tween 20.\nDo not agitate samples during incubation with primary antibodies.\nAlways include control samples that were not incubated with primary antibody. In this case, carry incubation in blocking solution with 0.025% Tween 20.",
    "Note: Another possible control is adding a standard solution of the epitope to one of the samples being incubated with primary antibody. Because of competitive reaction, this sample should have lower signal intensity but same spatial localization.\nIncubate for 14–17 h at 4°C; place the lid on the plate and protect from light. No agitation is needed.\nAfter incubation, wash 2 times with 1 mL 1× MTSB solution,7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] 5 min each.\nNote: Primary antibody concentrations vary. A guideline is to follow the manufacturer’s recommendation. In our hands, we use a 1:500 dilution for the hormone antibodies (OlChemIm).\nCytokinin: anti-trans-zeatin stock 4.3 μg/μL; 1:500 dilution means 0.0086 μg/μL or 8.6 μg/mL.\nAuxin: anti-indole-3-acetic-acid stock 3.12 μg/μL; 1:500 dilution means 0.00624 μg/μL or 6.24 μg/mL.\nWhen using the approach as the example in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], if 4 wells are used for one experiment; first well is the negative control (NC) without antibody, for the next 3 wells prepare 1.5 mL blocking solution with 0.025% Tween 20 + 3 μL antibody of the stock (gives a 1:500 dilution) and then use 0.5 mL per well.\nIncubation with secondary antibody\nTiming: 2 h\nSecondary antibodies can be conjugated to a reporter such as a fluorescent molecule. The secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody, which is generated in a different species; for example, a goat generated anti-rabbit secondary antibody that will bind to a primary antibody produced in rabbit.\nRemove the washing 1× MTSB solution.\nBlocking: add 1 mL of 1× MTSB + 1% BSA, incubate for 5 min. Repeat 3 times.\nAdd 500 μL of the secondary antibody solution previously prepared in blocking buffer (1:200 to 1:2000 dilution; depending on the antibody concentration; see Note).\nIncubate for 1–2 h at 22°C–25°C, place the lid on the plate, in the dark.",
    "Wash 3 times with 1 mL 1× MTSB after completing, 5 min each.\nProceed to sample mounting and observation (see sample mounting and observation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5] section, Step 29).\nNote: Secondary antibody concentrations vary. A guideline is to follow the manufacturer’s recommendation. In our hands, we use a 1:1000 dilution for the Dylight 488 antibody (Abcam). The stock is 0.5 μg/μL; a 1:1000 dilution means 0.5 μg/mL.\nWhen using the approach as the example in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], if 4 wells are used for one experiment; prepare 2 mL of 1× MTSB with 1% BSA + 2 μL antibody of the stock (gives a 1:1000 dilution) and then use 0.5 mL per well.\nNote: With the use of a secondary antibody conjugated with Alkaline Phosphatase, we obtained better results incubating it for at least 3 h or longer. With the use of a secondary antibody conjugated with a fluorescent molecule, e.g., DyLight 488, a 1–2 h incubation period is sufficient.\nImmunolabeling using non-fluorescent antibodies\nIncubation with primary antibody\nTiming: 14–17 h\nDuring this step, primary antibodies bind to their epitope molecules in the sample.\nAfter Step 3c, remove the blocking solution from the wells using a pipette.\nReplace blocking solution with 500 μL of primary antibody solution (diluted).\nPreviously prepare the primary antibody (from 1:20 to 1:1000; see Note) in blocking solution (1× PBS + 1% BSA) supplemented with 0.025% Tween 20.\nDo not agitate samples during incubation with primary antibodies.\nAlways include control samples that were not incubated with primary antibody. In this case, carry incubation in blocking solution with 0.025% Tween 20.\nNote: Another possible control is adding a standard solution of the epitope to one of the samples being incubated with primary antibody.

    "Incubate for 14–17 h at 4°C; place the lid on the plate. No agitation is needed.\nAfter incubation, wash 2 times with 1 mL 1× PBS solution, 5 min each.\nNote: Primary antibody concentrations vary. A guideline is to follow the manufacturer’s recommendation. In our hands, we use a 1:500 dilution for the hormone antibodies (OlChemIm).\nCytokinin: anti-trans-zeatin stock 4.3 μg/μL; 1:500 dilution means 0.0086 μg/μL or 8.6 μg/mL.\nAuxin: anti-indole-3-acetic-acid stock 3.12 μg/μL; 1:500 dilution means 0.00624 μg/μL or 6.24 μg/mL.\nWhen using the approach as the example in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], if 4 wells are used for one experiment; first well is the negative control (NC) without antibody, for the next 3 wells prepare 1.5 mL blocking solution with 0.025% Tween 20 + 3 μL antibody of the stock (gives a 1:500 dilution) and then use 0.5 mL per well.\nIncubation with secondary antibody\nTiming: 5 h\nSecondary antibodies can contain a conjugated enzyme that generates a visible colored product. The secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody, which is generated in a different species; for example, a goat generated anti-rabbit secondary antibody that will bind to a primary antibody produced in rabbit.\nRemove the washing 1 mL 1× PBS solution.\nBlocking: add 1 mL of 1× TBS + 1% BSA, incubate for 5 min. Repeat 3 times.\nAdd 500 μL of the secondary antibody solution previously prepared in blocking buffer (1:200 to 1:2000; depending on the antibody concentration; see Note).\nIncubate for 3–5 h at 22°C–25°C, place the lid on the plate, in the dark.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL 1× TBS, 5 min each, at 22°C–25°C.\nProceed to Staining/revealing reaction Section (see staining/revealing reaction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] section, Step 24).",
    "Note: Secondary antibody concentrations vary. A guideline is to follow the manufacturer’s recommendation. In our hands, we use a 1:2000 dilution for the anti-rabbit IgG antibody, Alkaline Phosphatase conjugate (Merck). The stock is 1.6 mg/mL; a 1:2000 dilution means 0.0008 mg/mL or 0.8 μg/mL.\nWhen using the approach as the example in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], if 4 wells are used for one experiment; prepare 2 mL of TBS with 1% BSA + 1 μL antibody of the stock (gives a 1:2000 dilution) and then use 0.5 mL per well.\nNote: With the use of a secondary antibody conjugated with Alkaline Phosphatase, we obtained better results incubating it for at least 3 h or longer. With the use of a secondary antibody conjugated with a fluorescent molecule, e.g., DyLight 488, a 1–2 h incubation period is sufficient.\nNote: Without systematic testing, we have the idea that the results are similar using either MTSB or TBS buffer independently whether fluorescent or non-fluorescent antibodies are used. PBS and TBS buffers are slightly easier to prepare. Important, when using an Alkaline Phosphatase conjugated antibody, do not use PBS because it interferes with the signal, but use TBS. Important, to observe hormones by immunolocalization, the MTSB buffer must always be used in the fixation solution (see sample embedding Section).\nStaining/revealing reaction (for non-fluorescent secondary antibodies)\nTiming: 10 h\nWhen the secondary antibody is conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (AP), the substrate NBT-BCIP solution is used, and the enzyme reaction will produce a purple signal (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nAfter Step 23, remove the 1× TBS solution.\nWash 3 times with blocking solution (1× TBS + 1% BSA), 5 min each.\nMix Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-4-indolyl phosphate (BCIP), check the manufacturer’s recommendation. See note below.\nPrepare the substrate solution: detection solution + NBT-BCIP solution.",
    "Mix Nitro blue Tetrazolium Chloride (NBT) and 5-Bromo-4-chloro-4-indolyl phosphate (BCIP), check the manufacturer’s recommendation. See note below.\nAdd 1 mL solution to each well and incubate for 3–5 h in the darkness at 22°C–25°C.\nStop the reaction by adding 1 mL TE solution to each well, leave for 10 min.\nWash 3 times with Milli-Q water, 5 min each.\nProceed to sample mounting and observation (see sample mounting and observation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5] section, Step 31).\nNote: Stock solution NBT-BCIP contains 18.8 mg/mL NBT and 9.4 mg/mL BCIP (Merck). The final concentration needed for the reaction is 0.15 mg/mL NBT and 0.075 mg/mL BCIP.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] When using the approach as the example in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], if 4 wells are used for one experiment, this means that mix 8 mL detection buffer + 64 μL of NBT-BCIP stock solution and then use 1 mL of this mixture per well.\nSample mounting and observation\nTiming: 3 h or 19 h\nMount samples on a microscope glass slide to observe the result of the immunolabeling. Depending on the type of secondary antibody used, there are two ways to observe the result:\nFor fluorescent conjugated labels.\nAfter Step 13, use tweezers to transfer the samples from the well plate onto a microscope slide and place a cover slip.\nNote: Try to grab the sections from one corner. Expand and organize for viewing. Placing a drop of antifade fluorescent mounting medium (Fluoroshield; see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] Section) is helpful both to mount the sections and to preserve fluorescence. Add a cover slip. Alternatively, add 50% glycerol and add a cover slip.\nCapture images using a confocal or fluorescence microscope.\nFor non-fluorescent conjugated labels.\nAfter Step 28, place some glass slides on a slide warmer at 42°C and add some distilled water on each slide.",
    "Use tweezers to transfer the sections to the glass slide on the water, be sure the sections are fully expanded, you can use some tweezers to help.\nLet the water evaporate.\nCover the slides with mounting medium (Cytoseal 60) and wait for 16 h (at 22°C–25°C) to let the mounting medium dry and generate permanent slides. Alternatively, add 50% glycerol and add a cover slip, and observation can be done directly.\nSlides are ready to observe under a light microscope.\nNote: Slides with non-fluorescent samples can be observed later (up to days/week). Fluorescent samples should be observed immediately (the same day)."
