    "1. Specimen Preparation/Base\nApply a flat base around the specimen. Place the specimen on the scanning table. Orientate the occlusal surface to the horizontal plane (Figure 1).\n2. Software Analysis\nStart the program and then the Laboratory Measurement Module (Figure 2)\nPosition the specimen at the center of the scanning table.\nChoose the correct magnification lens. For large objects, like full arch scans, use the 5X objective.\nMove the scan optic by using the 3D mouse until the surface of the specimen is displayed on the live view window (Figure 3).\nUse sensor control to set Exposure and Contrast to achieve optimal scanning parameters. For metal surfaces, use an exposure between 400 and 800 µsec and a contrast between 0.3 and 0.8 (Figure 4).\nCheck image quality by checking the button \"Show Image Quality in Live Preview\".\nSet the correct parameters in the section \"Measurement Control\". The measurement type is \"3D Dataset\"; ImageField Type is \"General ImageField\" (Figure 5).\nClick on \"New ImageField\".\nDefine the scan volume. The software needs the bounding coordinates of the measure volume.\n\t\nMove the specimen to the highest and lowest scan level and click on \"Add Position\" at both points. The \"Z Range\" value shows the actual height of the scan volume (Figure 6).\nMove the specimen to the X-Y boundings of the scan volume. Click on \"Add Position\" to define X-axis and Y-axis lengths. The dimension of the scan volume is shown at the \"Information\" tab and should exceed the dimensions of the specimen by 1 cm in the X-axis and Y-axis.\nCheck the \"Points\" number. The software is capable of scanning 100 million surface points in one \"ImageField\" scan. The actual number of points exceeds this limit. \"Decimate\" the measure point's number by a \"Lateral Downsampling\" of the point size.",
    "Click on \"Advanced Settings\" (Figure 7).\nMove the \"Lateral Downsampling\" slider to the right until the \"Points\" number is reduced below 100 M (Figure 7). Downsampling reduces the lateral resolution of the surface points, resulting in larger pixel size of the scanned object. To ensure optimal scan results, the vertical resolution is increased.\nClick on \"Start Measurement\". This will start the \"Preview Mode\". The software performs a prescan with the selected X- and Y-axis dimensions.\nAfter the prescan is completed, select the region of interest. This helps to reduce file size and scanning time (Figure 8).\nSelect all parts of the prescan except the specimen and two measure fields around the specimen, containing the flat base (Figure 9).\nClick on \"Start\" to begin the scan.\nControl the scan in the \"ImageViewer\" using the mouse and press the left mouse button (Figure 10).\nClose the window and click on \"View Pseudo Color Only\".\nClick on \"Settings\" and \"Pseudo Coloring\", and choose \"Repeatability\".\nSet the \"Max.\" value to 0.2 and click on \"Apply Range\".\nControl the repeatability, it should be equal for areas with the same incline and material. In particular, the base around the specimen should display a homogeneous repeatability (Figure 11).\nClick on \"Database\" and save the scan to the appropriate folder.\nExport the scan to different file formats, if needed. Click on \"File/Export/3D Data As/….\" The protocol can be paused at that point and continued later.\n3. Difference Analysis\nUse the \"3D-Editor\" to cut away the base. This area will not be used for the difference analysis.\nTo compare and analyze two scans, start the \"Difference Measurement\" software (Figure 12).\nChoose the second model to compare.\nClick on \"Automatic Rough Alignment\" to perform a first match of the models.",
    "Click on \"Manual Adjustment\" and align the models with rotating and moving until they are in the same orientation (Figure 13).\nClick on \"Automatic Alignment\" and \"Apply\" to start the best fit algorithm for the optimal model matching.\nClick on \"Differences\" to view the difference map of the two matched models.\nSelect a proper color range to display the deviations (Figure 14). Save the visual deviation pattern as a screenshot for analysis.\nClick on \"Statistics\" to display the statistical values of the differences. Choose 1 µm class size and save histogram data to a text file for statistical comparison (Figure 15).Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
