    "NOTE: The preparation and analysis of bacterial glycopeptide samples can be divided into four sections (Figure 1). For this study, the glycosylation of three sequenced A. baumannii strains was assessed (Table 1). Proteome FASTA databases of each of these strains are accessible via Uniprot. Refer to Table 2 for the composition of buffers used in this protocol.\n1. Preparation of protein samples for proteomic analysis\nIsolation of proteome samples of interest\n\t\nIf using whole cells, ensure that the cells have been washed with a phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) to remove potential protein contaminants present in the media. Snap-freeze whole cells after washing and store them at -80 °C until required.\nIf fractionated samples are used (such as membrane preparations), ensure that the reagents used will not interfere with downstream liquid chromatography MS (LC-MS) analysis50.\nIf detergents, such as sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS), Triton X-100, NP-40, or lauroylsarcosine, have been used, remove these detergents using acetone precipitation, SP3 sample preparation methods51, or commercial proteomic clean-up columns such as S-traps52. Alternatively, substitute incompatible detergents with an MS-compatible or removable detergent such as sodium deoxycholate (SDC) or octyl glucopyranoside.\nEnsure all plasticware and glassware to be used for sample preparation has not been autoclaved. Autoclaved glassware and plastics are typically heavily contaminated with small molecular weight compounds, such as polymers, which are readily detected within the MS.\nSolubilization of whole-cell samples\n\t\nResuspend ~10 mg of washed, snap-frozen cells in 200 µL of freshly prepared sodium deoxycholate lysis buffer (SDC lysis buffer: 4% SDC in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5).\n\t\tNOTE: Protease inhibitors can be added to the SDC lysis buffer to limit protein degradation.",
    "Boil the samples for 10 min at 95 °C with shaking (2000 rpm on a thermomixer), and then leave on ice for 10 min. Repeat this process twice to ensure efficient lysis and solubilization of the samples.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples can be stored long-term at this point at -80 °C. If stored, resolubilize by heating at 95 °C before further processing.\nQuantify sample protein concentrations using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay53. Store samples on ice while undertaking quantification to limit protein degradation.\n\tNOTE: For total proteome analysis, 20-100 µg of protein is more than sufficient for nano LC-MS, which typically requires less than 2 µg of protein digest per analysis. The preparation of excess peptide allows for replicate analysis or further fractionation if deep proteomic coverage is required. For glycopeptide enrichment-based analysis using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), 100-500 µg of protein is required.\nReduce and alkylate samples.\n\t\nAdd 1/10th the volume of 10x reduction/alkylation buffer (100 mM Tris 2-carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride; 400 mM 2-chloroacetamide in 1 M Tris, pH 8.5) to samples for a final concentration of 1x and incubate samples in the dark for 30 min at 45 °C with shaking at 1,500 rpm.\n\t\tNOTE: Check the pH of the 10x reduction/alkylation buffer to ensure a pH of approximately 7.0-8.0 before adding to the samples, as a lower pH will cause the SDC to precipitate.\nBriefly spin down the samples and add the proteases Trypsin/Lys-C (~10 µL, resuspended in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5) for a final protease:protein ratio of 1:100. Incubate the digests overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 1,500 rpm (up to 18 h). To ensure complete protein digestion, use a Trypsin/Lys-C protease:protein ratio of 1:50 to 1:200.",
    "Quench digests by adding 1.25 volumes of 100% isopropanol to the samples. Vortex the samples for 1 min to mix and briefly spin them down.\n\tNOTE: Samples can be stored at -20 °C to be further processed later.\nAcidify the samples by adding 0.115 volumes of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; final concentration of ~1% TFA), vortex the samples, and briefly spin them down.\n2. Processing of proteome samples\nPeptide clean-up of proteome samples\n\t\nPrepare one styrenedivinylbenzene-reverse-phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS) Stop-and-go-extraction (Stage) Tip for each sample as previously described54.\n\t\t\nEmpirically, for binding 50 μg of peptide, excise three SDB-RPS discs from a 47 mm2 SDB-RPS membrane using a blunt needle (14 G). For larger peptide amounts, increase the number of discs accordingly.\nPrior to using SDB-RPS Stage Tips, prepare the tips by sequentially adding at least ten bed volumes of the following buffers and either spinning the buffer through the column by centrifugation (25 °C, 3 min, 500 × g) or by pushing the buffer through the column by gently applying pressure using a syringe.\n\t\t\nWet the tips with 150 µL of 100% acetonitrile.\nWash the tips with 150 µL of 30% methanol, 1% TFA in 18.2 MΩ H2O.\nEquilibrate the tips with 150 µL of 90% isopropanol, 1% TFA balanced with 18.2 MΩ H2O.\nLoad the samples (containing 50% isopropanol, 1% TFA) onto the SDB-RPS Stage Tips by centrifugation (25 °C, 3 min, 500 × g) or by gently applying pressure using a syringe.\nWash the SDB-RPS Stage Tips with the following buffers by centrifugation (25 °C, 3 min, 500 × g) or by gently applying pressure using a syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: Additional washes or alternative buffers can be used to remove non-peptide contaminants, such as the use of ethyl acetate instead of isopropanol55.",
    "Wash the tips with 150 µL of 90% isopropanol, 1% TFA.\nWash the tips with 150 µL of 1% TFA in 18.2 MΩ H2O.\nElute the peptides from the SDB-RPS Stage Tips with 150 µL of 5% ammonium hydroxide in 80% acetonitrile by centrifugation or by gently applying pressure using a syringe. Collect the samples in individual tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare 5% ammonium hydroxide in 80% acetonitrile in a plastic container immediately prior to use within a fume hood.\nDry the eluted peptides by vacuum centrifugation at 25 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: If undertaking HILIC enrichment, 1-10% of the peptide eluates can be removed at this point, dried, and used as total proteome input controls.\nEnrichment of glycopeptide samples\n\t\nPrepare Zwitterionic Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) Stage Tips as previously described54,56.\n\t\t\nBriefly, excise one C8 disc from a 47 mm2 C8 membrane using a blunt needle (14 G) and pack the disc into a P200 tip to create a frit. Add approximately 5 mm of ZIC-HILIC material, resuspended in 50% acetonitrile, 50% 18.2 MΩ H2O, onto the frit by gently applying pressure using a syringe.\nPrior to using ZIC-HILIC Stage Tips, condition the resin by sequentially adding the following buffers and gently applying pressure using a syringe.\n\t\t​NOTE: To ensure the integrity of the pseudo-water layer on the surface of the ZIC-HILIC resin (required to enrich glycopeptides), the resin must always remain wet. When washing the resin, always leave ~10 µL of solvent above the resin and ensure the washes/samples are pipetted directly into this residual solvent.\n\t\t\nEquilibrate the resin with 20 bed volumes (200 µL) of ZIC-HILIC elution buffer (0.1% TFA in 18.2 MΩ H2O).\nWash the resin with 20 bed volumes (200 µL) of ZIC-HILIC preparation buffer (95% acetonitrile in 18.2 MΩ H2O).",
    "Wash the resin with 20 bed volumes (200 µL) of ZIC-HILIC loading/wash buffer (80% acetonitrile, 1% TFA balanced with 18.2 MΩ H2O).\nResuspend the dried digested samples (from step 2.1.6) in ZIC-HILIC loading/wash buffer to a final concentration of 4 µg/µL (e.g., for 200 µg of peptide, resuspend in 50 µL of ZIC-HILIC loading/wash buffer). Vortex briefly for 1 min to ensure the samples are resuspended, and spin down for 1 min at 2,000 × g at 25 °C.\nLoad the resuspended peptide sample onto a conditioned ZIC-HILIC column.\n\t\t\nWash three times with 20 bed volumes (200 µL) of ZIC-HILIC loading/wash buffer (for 60 bed volume washes total) by gently applying pressure using a syringe.\nElute glycopeptides with 20 bed volumes (200 µL) of ZIC-HILIC elution buffer into a 1.5 mL tube by gently applying pressure using a syringe and then dry the eluate by vacuum centrifugation at 25 °C.\n3. LC-MS of proteome/glycopeptide-enriched samples\nResuspend the samples in Buffer A* (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) to a final concentration of 1 µg/µL (for example, for 50 µg of peptide, resuspend in 50 µL of Buffer A*).\nLoad the samples onto an HPLC/UPLC coupled to an MS to enable the separation and identification of glycopeptides.\n\tNOTE: The column parameters, including inner diameter, length, flow rates, type of chromatography resin, and required peptide injection amounts, should be optimized for the analytical setup and gradient length to be used; for an example of how to undertake optimization of analytical setups, see57.\nMonitor the collection of the resulting MS data ensuring the data is being collected with the desired parameters.",
    "NOTE: For compositional analysis, CID fragmentation is sufficient. Due to the addition of glycans to glycopeptides, glycopeptide ions are typically observed with a higher m/z and lower charge density than unglycosylated peptides. To ensure these ions are observable, allow a MS1 mass range from 400 to 2,000 m/z.\nFragment selected ions using CID, ensuring the collection of low m/z fragment ions that contain oxonium ions important for the characterization of glycans.\n\tNOTE: Fragmentation of glycopeptides using CID is influenced by both the peptide and glycan sequences, as well as the energy applied during fragmentation25,58,59. While a range of different collision energies can be used, an optimal strategy for fragmenting glycopeptides is the use of stepped collision energies combining the use of multiple collision energies25,59,60.\nUse alternative fragmentation methods, if available, such as ETD for site localization, or IT-CID to aid in the determination of glycan compositions.\n\t​NOTE: Neither of these fragmentation approaches are essential for compositional analysis, yet can be collected to enable further interrogation of glycopeptides of interest.\n4. Analysis of proteome/glycopeptide-enriched samples\nPrefiltering data files to enable searching in FragPipe\n\t\nIf ETD or IT-CID scans have been acquired within datasets, filter these scan events from the datafiles using MSConvert61 prior to searching with FragPipe.\n\t\tNOTE: For the open searching parameters outlined below, only beam-type CID data are required.\nPerforming open searches in FragPipe\n\t\nOpen FragPipe and click the Workflow tab. In the workflow pulldown menu, select the Open search option, and click Add files to import the data files to be searched into FragPipe (Figure 2A).",
    "Click the Database tab and launch the download manager by clicking Download. This allows proteome databases to be downloaded from Uniprot using a Uniprot Proteome ID. Click the Add decoys and contaminants option within the download manager to incorporate decoy and contaminant proteins into databases.\nFor more stringent FDR thresholds, click the Validation tab and modify the Filter and report value from 0.01 to the required FDR.\n\t\tNOTE: The default FragPipe settings will ensure a 1% FDR at the protein level.\nClick the MSfragger tab. Within the Peak matching box, increase the Precursor mass tolerance from the default 500 Da to 2,000 Da to allow the identification of large modifications (Figure 2A).\nClick the Run tab and define the location of the outputs of FragPipe. Click the Run button to begin the search.\nUsing the PSMs identified across datasets (contained within the psm.tsv outputs from FragPipe), identify potential glycans by plotting the frequency of observed delta masses within datasets (Figure 3). Create delta mass plots from MSfragger outputs using the R scripts accessible via PRIDE accession PXD027820. \n\tNOTE: Minimal postprocessing of the open searching results is undertaken within these scripts, as the main purpose of these scripts is to aid in the visualization of delta mass profiles. Importantly, the observation of abundant delta masses alone is not proof that a modification is a potential glycan, as assigning delta masses as glycans requires further analysis of the corresponding MS2 events.\nTo enable the characterization of glycopeptides within samples, focus on high confidence delta mass identifications, corresponding to assignments with high hyperscores.\n\t\nTo aid in assessing glycopeptide spectra, use peptide annotation tools, such as the Interactive Peptide Spectral Annotator63, which enables the assignment of peptide-associated ions within spectra, allowing the manual identification of the glycan-associated ions (Figure 4).",
    "NOTE: Within the datasets presented here, hyperscores of >30 are considered high scoring, as these correspond to scores within the top 50% of all identified glycopeptides (Figure 5).\nWith high-confidence glycopeptides assigned, identify commonly observed glycan-associated ions (Figure 4) to improve the identification of glycopeptides.\n\tNOTE: By incorporating glycan-associated ions within searches, known as glycan-focused searches, the quality of glycopeptide assignments can be improved.\n\t\nClick the MSfragger tab of FragPipe, incorporate the determined delta masses of the observed glycans into the Variable modifications and Mass Offsets sections. Add these masses by typing values into the Variable modifications and Mass Offsets sections with individual masses separated with a /. Add the glycan-associated fragment masses of these glycans into the Glyco/Labile mods section of MSFragger.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 2B outlines the key information required for a glycan-focused search of the A. baumannii strain AB307-0294.\nUpload all MS data associated with proteomic studies to centralized Proteomic repositories such as the PRIDE or MASSIVE repositories.\n\tNOTE: All data associated with this study have been deposited into the PRIDE proteomic repository and can be accessed via the PRIDE accession: PXD027820.\nSubscription Required.
