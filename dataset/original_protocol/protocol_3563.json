Due to the inability of VSV∗ΔG-FLuc to express VSV-G, this virus is unable to produce infectious progeny virions in the absence of in trans expression of VSV-G (or another suitable viral surface glycoprotein). Therefore, pseudo-typed VSV particles that harbor viral surface glycoproteins allow for a single infectious cell entry event into target cells and are thus safe surrogate vectors for studying cell entry of highly pathogenic viruses without the need to work with the authentic virus. Pseudo-typing of VSV∗ΔG-FLuc was performed according to a previously published protocol (Kleine-Weber et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nPreparation of VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (VSV-G) stocks using BHK-21(G43) cells\nTiming: 3 days\nStart new BHK-21(G43) cell culture. One day prior to infection, seed BHK-21(G43) cells into T-75 flask in 10 mL medium (10% FBS). Grow cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a standard tissue incubator.\nOnce cells reach 75% confluence (typically achieved at 24 h post seeding), remove old culture medium and add new culture medium containing 10−8 M mifepristone and incubate for 6 h.\nRemove medium and immediately add 8 mL DMEM containing diluted (1:1,000) VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (or alternatively VSV-G is used as positive control) stock, incubate 1 h at 37°C.\nRemove medium, wash 2–3 times gently with PBS.\nAdd 20 mL DMEM (high glucose) and 5% FCS supplemented with 10−8 M mifepristone and incubate for 16–24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 (until most of the cells are rounded and detached).",
    "Collect supernatant, centrifuge to pellet cellular debris for 10 min at 2,000 × g at 22°C.\nPrepare aliquots of 1 mL in cryo vials, flash-freeze samples and store at -80°C.\nTitration of VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (VSV-G) stocks using HEK293T cells\nTiming: 3 days\nOne day prior to infection, seed HEK293T cells into 96-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well). Grow cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a standard tissue incubator. Cells should reach 75% confluence (typically achieved at 24 h post seeding) for infection.\nOn the day of infection, prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (or alternatively VSV-G) stock by mixing of 900 μL culture medium with 100 μL of VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (or alternatively VSV-G) stock (or previous dilution). Remove old culture medium and inoculate serially diluted VSV∗ΔG-FLuc(VSV-G) onto cells (in technical triplicates or quadruplicates).\nIncubate cells for 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nRemove medium, wash 2–3 times gently with PBS.\nAdd 100 μL of culture medium per well and incubate for 16–24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nCount eGFP-positive cells using a fluorescence microscope. Ideally, wells containing 20–200 eGFP-positive cells should be counted. Counting is typically done by eye but can also be performed using an automated fluorescence reader (e.g., Bioreader-7000-F from Bio-Sys). Calculate titer of VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (VSV-G) stocks according to the following formula:\nTiter [ffu/mL] = average no. of eGFP-positive cells (of technical triplicates) × reciprocal serial dilution factor (dilution in which eGFP-positive cells were counted) × inoculum dilution factor (10, since 100 μL were used for inoculation)].\nProduction of anti-VSV-G antibody (I1) supernatants\nTiming: 10–14 days",
    "Start new CRL-2700 cell culture. Seed low (up to 10th) passage CRL-2700 cells at a density of 1 × 104 cells/mL into T-7[L] \\1ask in 10 mL medium (10% FBS). Grow cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a standard tissue incubator. Cell culture flasks should be kept in an upright position in the incubator in order to allow addition of cell culture medium volumes >20 mL (e.g., step 16).\nWhen the cell count reaches 1 × 106 cells/mL, split cells 1:4 in order to obtain 4× T-75 flasks of CRL-2700 cells.\nContinue cultivation until the density reaches 1 × 106 cells/mL. Add 30 mL of FBS-free culture medium (final FBS concentration = 2.5%).\nContinue cultivation until the density reaches 1 × 106 cells/mL. Collect all cultures (= 160 mL). Add 240 mL of FBS-free culture medium (final FBS concentration = 1%) and seed 40 mL of cell suspension into 10 × T-175 flasks.\nContinue cultivation until the density reaches 1 × 106 cells/mL. Collect all cultures (= 400 mL) and transfer into 50 mL sterile centrifugal tubes.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 600 × g to pellet cells (cells can be aliquoted in MEM/DMEM + 10% FBS + 10% DMSO and frozen), collect supernatant in a separate tube.\nLoad supernatant on Vivaspin Protein Concentrator Columns (molecular weight cut-off: 30 kDa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and centrifuge (4,000 × g/4°C) until the total volume has been reduced to ∼40 mL (∼ 10-fold concentrated).\nAliquot concentrated supernatant in cryo vials and store samples at -20°C (or -80°C).\nNote: For determination of the appropriate dilution of the antibody supernatant to neutralize VSV-G, following procedure is done once per batch:",
    "Seed HEK293T cells into 96-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well). Grow cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a standard tissue incubator. Cells should reach 75% confluence for infection.\nOn the day of infection, pre-incubate VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (VSV-G) (∼10,000 ffu/50 μL) with 50 μL of 2-fold serial dilutions of the antibody preparation for 1 h at 37°C (technical triplicates or quadruplicates); Range: 1:100 to 1:6,400.\nRemove culture supernatant from HEK293T cells, add 100 μL/well of VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (VSV-G)/antibody mixtures and incubate for 16–24 h.\nCheck for eGFP-positive (infected) cells using a fluorescence microscope. The highest antibody dilution that leads to complete block of infection (no eGFP-positive cells) is the concentration that should be used for VSV pseudotype preparation.\nVSV pseudotype preparation using HEK293T cells\nTiming: 4 days\nStart new HEK293T cell culture. Seed low passage HEK293T cells into 6-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well). Grow cells for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a standard tissue incubator.\nNote: It is recommended not to use cells that have been split for more than 15 times. Using lower passages ensures a good cell quality and cell growth rates.\nPrepare transfection mixtures in sterile (autoclaved) 1.5 mL reaction tubes as follows: Mix 6–8 μg of plasmid-DNA (pCG1-SARS-2-S for experimental design or alternatively pCAGGS-VSV-G as positive control) per well and sterile ultrapure water to a final volume of 112.5 μL, then add 12.5 μL of sterile-filtered CaCl2 (stock conc. 2.5 M) and mix. Add 125 μL of sterile-filtered 2× HBS buffer and vortex, incubate for 15 min at 22°C.\nCritical: Adding the 2× HBS dropwise can help to ensure a clear transfection mixture (see Troubleshooting Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Mix by pipetting gently (not vortexing) and add the transfection complexes dropwise to the cells, incubate overnight (16–18 h) at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a standard tissue incubator.\nRemove supernatant and inoculate cells with 1 mL VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (or VSV-G as positive control), MOI (multiplicity of infection) = 3. Incubate for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a standard tissue incubator.\nRemove supernatant carefully wash 1–2 times with PBS.\nAdd fresh medium containing anti-VSV-G antibodies (except for cells transfected with VSV-G; add fresh medium without anti-VSV-G antibodies instead) incubate overnight (16–18 h) at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a standard tissue incubator.\nCollect supernatant, remove cellular debris by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min and transfer clarified supernatants into fresh tubes.\nUse supernatants either directly for transduction of target cells or store supernatants at -80°C.\nDrug treatment of human volunteers, isolation, and infection of human nasal epithelial cells\nTiming: 25 h\nThe acid sphingomyelinase (Asm)/ceramide system plays an important role in many bacterial and viral infections (Grassmé et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Grassmé et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Asm catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to phosphorylcholine and ceramide. Many antidepressants functionally inhibit the Asm activity by displacing the enzyme from lysosomal membranes and thereby inducing Asm degradation (Hurwitz et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Previously, we have shown that amitriptyline, an approved antidepressant used in clinical routine and a functional inhibitor of the acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA) (Albouz et al., 1981[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Hurwitz et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Kornhuber et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), prevents infection with pseudo-typed replication deficient vesicular stomatitis virus particles presenting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike) (Hoffmann et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Carpinteiro et. al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nIsolation of nasal epithelial cells from healthy human\nTiming: 0.5 h",
    "Human nasal epithelial cells are obtained from healthy, adult volunteers. We did not observe any differences in infection between cells isolated from women or men. Therefore, isolation from both genders is feasible.\nThe first epithelial cell isolation should be performed before the oral administration of the drug, amitriptyline in the present study.\nTransfer 1 mL prewarmed H/S buffer to each micro tube, one tube per volunteer.\nKeep a 96-well plate ready.\nEpithelial cells are removed from the nasal mucosa employing a small nose brush. To this end, insert the brush 1.5 to 2 cm into the nose and gently rotate the brush to collect epithelial cells.\nThe cells are directly released from the brush and resuspended in the prewarmed H/S buffer in the micro tube by careful rotating the brush.\nPipette the cell suspension up and down once to mix the cells and then split the volume of each sample into identical aliquots (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and transfer into a new microcentrifugation tube. Prepare aliquots as later needed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/485-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of sample aliquoting and handling\nCells are pelleted by centrifugation (22°C, 830 × g) for 10 min and the supernatant is discarded.\nFor cellular infection continue with step 43 directly. For amitriptyline treatment ex vivo continue with step 50. Cells of another aliquot can be directly shock-frozen and stored at -80°C for Asm activity assay or continue immediately with step 52/56. Alternatively, cells of this aliquot can be used to determine ceramide amounts. To this end, continue with step 70 directly or shock-freeze cells and store at -80°C.\nPause Point: Samples to determine Asm activity and ceramide can be shock-frozen and stored at -80°C.\nDrug treatment of the volunteers\nDirectly after nasal cell isolation, human volunteers take amitriptyline orally (0.5 mg/kg).",
    "Note: Amitriptyline is approved for human use for depression by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Amitriptyline is a well-tolerated drug if the dosage recommendations are followed and the contraindications are observed. The special legal requirements for the use of drugs in humans must be observed.\n1.5 and 24 h after medication intake, isolation of nasal epithelial cells is repeated, identical to steps 35–40.\nNote: It is recommended to use the opposite nasal cavity for each successive epithelial cell collection to equalize the conditions.\nCellular infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike and analyzation of infection efficacy\nTiming: 0.5–25 h\nCells of two aliquots are resuspended in 100 μL prewarmed MEM/10% FCS, containing pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike (infected sample) and transferred into one well of a 96-well plate each.\nCells are incubated for30 (to determine Asm activity and ceramide amounts) or 60 min (to determine infection rates) at 37°C.\nFor determination of Asm activity after infection, cells are transferred into a micro tube, centrifuged, and washed once with H/S buffer as above. Discard supernatant and directly continue with section Acid sphingomyelinase activity[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.12] (step 52/56) or shock-freeze the cells (without buffer) and store them at -80°C until the assay is performed. Alternatively, cells can be used to perform ceramide determination. In this case, continue with step 70 or freeze cells.\nPause Point: Samples to determine Asm activity or ceramide can be shock-frozen and stored at -80°C.\nAnother aliquot of cells is also transferred into a micro tube, centrifuged, and washed once. Resuspend cells in 100 μL fresh MEM/10% FCS and culture them for 24 h to allow expression of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) encoded by the particles.",
    "Next day, transfer cells into a micro tube, spin down cells at 830 × g for 10 min, remove medium and resuspend cells in 20 μL H/S.\nPipet an aliquot of 10 μL onto a glass slide, cover with a cover slip and immediately visualize the cells on a fluorescence microscope.\nInfection is determined by expression of eGFP. To this end, slides are analyzed with a confocal microscope (we are using Leica TCS SL or Leica TCS SP5) using a 40× lens and an adequate software tool (e.g., Leica LCS software). At least 500 cells have to be counted for positive and negative eGFP expression in randomly chosen microscopic fields. Number of green fluorescent cells is set in relation to the total cells counted.\nEx vivo treatment of nasal epithelial cells with amitriptyline\nTiming: 1.5 h\nTo compare efficacy of amitriptyline in vitro, one aliquot of freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells from untreated volunteers is treated with amitriptyline ex vivo.\nAmitriptyline (Sigma-Aldrich) should be freshly prepared as 10 μM solution in 0.9% NaCl.\nCells of one aliquot are resuspended in 100 μL of a 10 μM amitriptyline solution and transferred into one well of a 96-well plate. Incubate for 60 min at 37°C in an incubator.\nAfter incubation, cells are centrifuged as above, supernatant is discarded, and cells are resuspended in 100 μL prewarmed MEM/10% FCS, containing pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Continue with step 44 of section Cellular infection with pp-VSV-CoV-2 spike[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.9].\nCheck for the functional inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase by amitriptyline",
    "The antidepressant amitriptyline is a functional inhibitor of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (Asm). Asm catalyzes the degradation of sphingomyelin to phosphorylcholine and ceramide and plays a crucial role in many bacterial and viral infections, contributing to cellular entry of pathogens. We have previously shown that oral medication with amitriptyline by healthy volunteers inhibits the pseudo-infection of freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells with pseudo-typed VSV particles presenting SARS-CoV-2 spike on their surface (Carpinteiro et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nFunction of amitriptyline in vivo and ex vivo can be checked by using two different assays. The first assay determines the Asm activity by the use of an [14C]labeled sphingomyelin, the substrate of the enzyme. The second assay determines one product of Asm reaction, intracellular ceramide amount, quantitatively.\nAcid sphingomyelinase activity assay\nTiming: 2–3 h\nNote: Work on ice if not indicated otherwise.\nCell samples to determine Asm activity can be directly used or shock-frozen and stored at -80°C until the day of the assay. Centrifuge freshly prepared cell samples and discard the supernatant. Shock-frozen cell pellets should be quickly thawed at 37°C using a thermo shaker (see step 55).\nAs the substrate, radiolabeled [14C]sphingomyelin is used. Assay readout is the release of hydrophilic [14C]phosphorylcholine, separated by phase extraction from the lipophilic substrate.\nWorking with radionucleotides requires special laboratories and the permission for handling radioactivity.\nPlace 270 μL pre-cooled Asm dilution buffer into a new micro tube for each sample to be analyzed.\nRemove [14C]sphingomyelin from the freezer and pipette 0.1 μL [14C]sphingomyelin, corresponding to 0.05 μCi, for each sample into one new micro tube.\nNote: Always prepare sphingomyelin for the number of samples to be analyzed plus one (e.g., 20 samples means 2.1 μL ((20+1)∗0.1 μL), corresponding to 1.05 μCi).",
    "Dry the sphingomyelin resolved in organic solvent in a vacuum concentrator for 10 min (larger volumes may take longer).\nMeanwhile, transfer frozen samples into a thermo shaker and thaw them quickly at 37°C.\nAdd 200 μL pre-cooled Asm lysis buffer to each sample and place samples on ice for 5 min.\nIn the meantime, continue with the dried substrate for the assay. Add 30 μL Asm assay buffer per original 0.1 μL to dried sphingomyelin (e.g., 20 samples means 630 μL assay buffer ([20+1]×30 μL)) and sonicate in a sonication bath for 10 min to promote micelle formation.\nAdd 30 μL of lysed sample to pre-pipetted Asm dilution buffer to dilute NP40 concentration to 0.2% (final volume, Vend = 300 μL).\nAdd 30 μL of sonicated [14C]sphingomyelin (in Asm assay buffer) to each sample (Vend = 330 μL).\nNote: Sonicated sphingomyelin should not be vortexed or pipetted up and down before aliquoting.\nVortex each sample and transfer the tube into an 37°C prewarmed thermo shaker and incubate for 30 - 60 min at 300 rpm horizontal shaking and 37°C.\nEnzymatic reaction is terminated by adding 800 μL of freshly mixed lipid extraction mixture (CHCl3:CH3OH, 2:1, v/v).\nVortex each sample for 30 s.\nSeparate hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases by centrifugation at maximum speed in a micro centrifuge for 5 min.\nIn the meantime pipette 4 mL scintillation fluid into a scintillation vial for each sample.\nThe radioactive labeled product is [14C]phosphorylcholine that is in the upper hydrophilic phase and therefore can be separated from the lipophilic substrate [14C]sphingomyelin which is in the lower lipid phase. Take an aliquot of the upper phase by pipetting twice 125 μL of the upper phase into prepared scintillation vials.",
    "Note: This must be done very carefully without mixing the two phases or taking anything from the lower or intermediate phase.\nPositive control: Add 20 μL of [14C]sphingomyelin in Asm assay buffer (see step 2) to 4 mL scintillation liquid.Negative control: One scintillation vial with scintillation fluid, but without a sample.\nVortex each scintillation vial for 10 s and wait for 10 min before analyzing them in a scintillation counter.\nCalculation of Asm activity:\nUsing the specific activity of [14C]sphingomyelin, the counts of each sample are converted into the amount of product (moles). For calculation of the specific Asm activity (amount of product per time and amount of protein), the time of assay (30 - 60 min) and the amount of protein used has to be considered and specific enzyme activity is expressed as mol/mg/h. Protein determination can be performed with a commercial kit compared with a calibration protein series.\nOptional: You can use the remaining lysed sample (in Asm lysis buffer; step 58; 170 μL) for ceramide determination. This approach saves sample, but requires a certain routine with methodology. Samples should be directly used or shock-frozen again.\nPause Point: The rest of the samples can be shock-frozen and stored at -80°C and used for quantitative ceramide determination later (step 70).\nQuantitative determination of ceramide\nTiming: 6–12 h\nNote: Cell samples to determine ceramide can be directly used or shock-frozen and stored at -80°C until the day of ceramide assay. Centrifuge freshly prepared cell samples and discard the supernatant. Shock-frozen cell pellets should be quickly thawed at 37°C using a thermo shaker.",
    "To determine ceramide, [32P]γATP is used to phosphorylate endogenous ceramide of the cell samples. Within the 60-min assay period the entire endogenous ceramide present in the samples is converted to radioactive ceramide-1-phosphate (and a fraction of non-radioactive ceramide). Readout is phosphorylated ceramide that can be quantified with an imager after thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and in comparison to standard ceramide series.\nSince 32P has a half-life of 28 days, current radioactivity has to be calculated and considered when pipetting the master kinase assay mix.\nWorking with radionucleotides requires special laboratories and the permission for handling radioactivity.\nPrepare a TLC chamber with 100 mL of freshly prepared TLC running buffer, consisting of CHCl3:C3H6O:CH3OH:C2H4O2:H2O (50:20:15:10:5; v/v/v/v/v).\nResuspend each sample in 200 μL H2O or use the rest of hydrophilic sample of the Asm activity assay (previous described method Acid sphingomyelinase activity[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.12], step 58).\nExtract lipids by adding 600 μL lipid extraction mixture, consisting of CHCl3:CH3OH:1 N HCl (100:100:1; v/v/v), and vortex for 10 s.\nFor standards use 50, 100, 250, and 500 pmol of C16 and C24 ceramide each. Steps 70 and 71 are identical for the standard samples.\nSeparate phases by centrifugation for 5 min at 22°C and maximum speed.\nCeramide is in the lower, organic phase. Carefully transfer 180 μL (or more, if required) of the lower phase into a new 2 mL micro tube and dry the samples in a vacuum concentrator.\nIn the meanwhile, remove the [32P]γATP from the freezer and let it thaw at 22°C (timing: ∼ 1 h).\nPrepare the kinase containing kinase assay master mix for the number of samples to be analyzed:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_485_18.csv\nRe-dissolve dried samples (step 74) in 20 μL detergent solution.\nAdd 70 μL of master mix to each sample to start the kinase reaction.",
    "Incubate for 60 min at 22°C with shaking on a horizontal mixer (350 rpm).\nStop kinase reaction by adding 1 mL lipid extraction mixture, containing CHCl3:CH3OH:1 N HCl (100:100:1; v/v/v), and vortex for 10 s.\nAdd 170 μL complete salt solution and vortex for 10 s.\nAdd 30 μL of 100 mM EDTA solution to promote phase separation and vortex once again.\nCentrifuge the samples at 22°C for 5 min at maximum speed.\nTransfer 2 times 170 μL of the lower phase, containing the phosphorylated ceramide, into a new 1.5 mL micro tube and dry the samples in a vacuum concentrator.\nNote: Handle the samples carefully to avoid mixing phases and contaminating of your transfer probe with the upper, hydrophilic phase.\nRe-dissolve dried samples in 20 μL freshly prepared CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1; v/v) and spot them in 3–4 μL steps onto a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate.\nNote: During the spotting process, always close the sample tubes.\nNote: Since the solvent evaporates quickly when spotted onto the TLC plate, it may be useful to place a sheet of squared paper at the bottom of the TLC plate for orientation of the sample application points. Choose a suitable, not too narrow distance between the spotting dots.\nNote: Do not spot too many samples in parallel.\nNote: The horizontal line of the application points should be 1 to 1.5 cm from the lower edge of the plate.\nUse CHCl3:C3H6O:CH3OH:C2H4O2:H2O (50:20:15:10:5; v/v/v/v/v) as running buffer (step 1) to separate samples until the running front reached the end of the TLC plate.\nNote: This takes about 3 h.\nAnalyze TLC plates with an appropriate imager and quantify ceramide spots in comparison to standard C16 and C24 ceramide series using an appropriate software tool."
