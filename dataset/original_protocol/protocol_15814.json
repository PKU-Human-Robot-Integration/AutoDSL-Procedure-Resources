    "1. Radial locomotion assay\nPrepare 100 mm or 150 mm diameter Petri dishes about half full of nematode growth media (NGM) and seeded with a uniform lawn of OP50 bacteria to cover the entire surface of the agar.\nFlip the NGM assay plates upside-down and label the bottom with an identifier for the C. elegans strains to be assayed, 2 plates per strain (Figure 1A).\nMake a small dot with the marker in the center of the upside-down plate (Figure 1A).\nWhile working with a dissecting microscope, transfer 15-20 staged matched11 worms to the center of the assay plate directly over the center dot (visible through the NGM) using a platinum-wire pick (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Try to transfer all the worms at the same time or as quickly as possible.\n\t\nSet a timer for 30 min after worms are placed in the center of the plate. Put the lid back on the plate and set it aside (Figure 1C).\nContinue transferring worms until all strains are on the designated assay plates, making a note of approximately how long it takes to transfer between plates (aim for ~ 1 min between plates). Keep all plates in the same order that they were set up.\nAfter 30 min, begin scoring the first plate.\n\t\nRemove the lid and place the plate face down under the dissecting microscope, such that the labeled back of the plate is facing up, and the NGM agar is between the line of sight and the worms. The plate will be upside-down from the normal usage.\nAdjust the microscope focus until worms are visible through the agar.",
    "Using a different colored felt tip pen from the center point, put a small dot at the location of each worm - follow the worm tracks through the bacterial lawn to find the most distal animals.\nCheck the edge of the plate as some worms may end up there. Also, count and record the number of worms in the center point dot (Figure 1D).\nContinue marking all assay plates in order, such that all plates have 30 min of activity time, being careful to account for the time it took to set up the plate. Then, perform manual or digital measurements as described in steps 1.8 or 1.9.\nPerform manual measurements using a ruler.\n\t\nUse a ruler to measure in mm, the distance from the center point to the final location markings for each worm and record the distance. To help keep track of progress during scoring, label the first scored point with a small marking line.\nRecord length data for each dot consecutively by rotating the plate in a clockwise fashion (Figure 1E).\nPerform digital measurement using a scanner and ImageJ.\n\t\nUsing a flatbed scanner, scan the back of the assay plate(s) next to a ruler (numbers facing the scanning surface) (Figure 2A).\nOpen the scanned plate image in ImageJ or a similar program.\n\t\t​NOTE: ImageJ is a free Java-based image processing software hosted by the NIH.\nClick on the Straight-Line Tool and then draw a line connecting the 1 cm and 2 cm points on the scanned image of the ruler (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: Holding the Shift computer key will force the line to the nearest 45° angle.\nNavigate to the Analyze menu and use it to set the scale (Analyze | Set Scale) (Figure 2C).",
    "Enter the Known Distance (10) and Units of Length (mm) in the appropriate boxes, do not adjust the distance in pixels number. Check Global to apply the same scale to all images being analyzed in each ImageJ session; otherwise, set the scale for each image upon opening (Figure 2D). Click Ok.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 1.9.2-1.9.5 are performed to set the measurement scale. Measurements for this image will now automatically relate the length of lines to the defined pixel: length relationship. Images scanned at 300 dpi will have an approximate relationship of 11.8 pixels per mm.\nUse the Paintbrush Tool to mark just above the first point to be scored.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a visual indicator for the first worm scored.\nUse the Straight-Line Tool to draw a line from the center point to the first worm data point.\nClick the M key on the keyboard to measure the distance. Alternatively, navigate to the Analyze menu and choose Measure (Analyze | Measure). In both cases, the measurement will appear in a new window; this window will collect all measurements per image.\nKeeping the center point constant, move the end of the line touching the first worm point to the next worm point, moving clockwise, and click the M key to measure.\nContinue measuring each point in a clockwise fashion until all points are scored.\nCopy and Paste length measurement data into a spreadsheet to save it. Then, repeat the process for each scanned plate image.\n\t\t​NOTE: Steps 1.9.6 - 1.9.11 measure the worm displacement values (Figure 2E-F).\nPerform statistical analysis.\n\t\nCombine replicates within a single experiment so that a total number scored is between 30-40 worms.\nPerform independent experimental replicates on different days and with independent populations of worms to end up with 3 independent experimental replicates.",
    "Analyze data using appropriate statistical analyses such as Student's t-test for 2 strains or 1-way ANOVA for three or more strains.\n2. Computer-analyzed swimming assay\nNOTE: This protocol contains detailed instructions for the commercially available WormLab hardware and software system (see Table of Materials). However, the workflow can be applied to other computer-analyzed swimming assay systems.\nSetting up and recording videos.\nRaise the shielding on the imaging hardware (Figure 3) and verify that the camera height is set to the expected location.\n\tNOTE: The optimal height for capturing worms on a 35 mm plate is such that the third from the bottom threaded screw bore is visible below the adjustable camera mounting bracket, but no additional mounting hole is seen above the screw bore (approximately 30.5 cm above the stage) (Figure 3C). This will result in a capture ratio of 11.43 µm/pixel. Consider adding a \"correct height\" indicator so that this is easier to confirm prior to beginning the assay. See protocol step 2.18 to account for height adjustments.\nOpen the associated software (Supplementary Figure 1A).\nClick the Video Capture icon (film with a right-pointing triangle in the middle) to open a new Video Capture window. The camera will be in the Live View, but the display will be black (Supplementary Figure 1B).\nPress down on the dimmer knob and turn it clockwise to adjust the light.\n\tNOTE: The dimmer knob is on the stage of the imaging system near the bright field light source. The Video Capture live view display will turn from black to illuminated.\nBack in the Video Capture window, click on the Settings tab, adjust as follows: Video mode: 2456 x 2052_Mono8, Frame rate: 14, Output: monochrome, Exposure: 0.00300 s, Gain: 1 dB , Gamma: 1, Rotate 180 (check on).",
    "Move back to the Capture tab. Select the recording folder (Supplementary Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: This is where all recordings and project files will be stored. Create unique folders for individual experiments to keep data organized.\nAssign a file name by entering it into the File prefix text box.\n\tNOTE: The software will automatically append a progressive number to the end of the prefix in the format \"0001\". It is advisable to have a consistent naming scheme for the files such as: \"YYYYMMDD_treatmentName_rep#_\".\nSet other Capture settings as follows: Buffer: 128 frames (default), Duration (check on): 00 h:01min:00 s. Ignore or turn off other settings in this tab.\nPlace the assay plate, lid up, on the device stage, and center it in the Video Capture screen; remove the lid.\n\tNOTE: Prepare assay plates ahead of time. Each plate consists of a 35 mm Petri dish approximately half full of unseeded (no bacterial lawn) NGM.\nUse a micropipette to wash the stage synchronized11 worms in 1 mL of M9 onto the assay plate - aim for about 50 worms (Figure 3D). Gently swirl the plate to bring the animals to the center or use a micropipette to add a few drops of M9 to separate animals (Figure 3E). Set a timer for 60 s to allow worms to acclimate to swimming.\n\tNOTE: The plate will not be 100% visible on the screen. Animals are not accurately tracked while overlapping.\nWhile the timer counts down, manually adjust the camera focus by turning the focusing ring on the lens body of the camera while watching the display (Figure 3F). It is possible to zoom in on the worms using a scroll wheel mouse allowing for more precise focusing.",
    "After setting the focus, adjust the light knob such that the display is as bright as possible without overexposure (shows up as red pixels on display).\nAfter 60 s, press the Record button.\n\tNOTE: The video will go from the Live View to Recording and a timer will be visible. When the capture is complete, the Video Capture display will return to the Live View (Supplementary Figure 1B).\nRemove the plate after recording and set up the next plate. Rename the prefix as needed. Wash worms into the assay plate, incubate for 60 s, and record each treatment.\nAfter completing all recordings for an experiment, close any open video tabs, and turn off the light source by depressing the dimmer knob.\nClose the Video Capture window by clicking the red x button in the window's upper right corner; alternatively, close the entire software package and reopen.\nPrepare videos for tracking.\nFrom the Workflow sidebar menu, select the first button on this menu, Import Image Sequence, and find and double click on a video. The video will open in the middle window (Supplementary Figure 2A).",
    "NOTE: The default display for the software is the Workflow sidebar menu; this menu can also be accessed through the view top dropdown menu under View [View | Workflow]. The Workflow menu has several view options; the Track view is appropriate at this point in the protocol. If the Set Sequence Info button is not visible in the menu, then this is not the correct view. First, look at the bottom of the Menu and check that the Workflow tab is active, next check that the Track view is active by clicking on the Track icon. Where menus appear in the window is dependent on monitor size and the location of other opened menus. Menus can be moved by drag and drop, resized, and closed. Most of the menus can also be opened through the View dropdown menu.\nFrom the Workflow menu, select Set Sequence Info (Supplementary Figure 2B). In the new menu window, check the naming scheme, add notes, and validate metadata.\nCheck that the scaling is set correctly; Scale: 11.43 µm/pixel and Measure will auto fill as 1000 µm is 87 pixels. If the camera height has been adjusted differently than prescribed here, follow the instructions in this menu to update the scale. Click the Save button.\nIn the Workflow menu, select Adjust Image, and a new popup menu called Image Adjustments will open (Supplementary Figure 2C). Select Dark worms on light background (bright field).\nAdjust additional settings. Recommended Image Processing Settings are as follows: Background smoothing: 10, Gaussian smoothing: 5, Fill holes: 2, Small object filter: 0, and skip Integral Derivative Segmentation.\nAdjust the Threshold level such that the animals are completely filled with green but still distinct from the background. Click Apply.\n\tNOTE: It is permissible to pick up some objects that are not worms.",
    "From the Workflow menu, select Detect and Track (Supplementary Figure 2D).\n\tNOTE: A menu will appear to the side of the video with 3 tabs: Detecting, Tracking, and Repair. The cursor will look like a pointing finger when over the video display. Alternatively, click the Select icon (cursor arrow) in the icon menu in the upper left of the software.\n\t\nUse the finger selector tool to select 3-7 worms and click the Detect worms button in the Detection tab.\n\t\tNOTE: This selection helps the software accurately identify worms for given conditions and must be done for each video. After a few seconds, most of the worms will be highlighted in green and have a number in yellow. Worms that are touching or curled up will likely not be highlighted; however, the program will most likely find them during tracking. There is an option to adjust the detection parameters; however, the defaults work well under most conditions. If adjustments to the detection parameters are made, make sure to be consistent between samples and replicates.\nStill in the Detect and Track window, move to the Tracking tab (Supplementary Figure 2E). In the Tracking Parameters check Use backtracking, uncheck Track worms at the edge of the image.\nSet the Max tracked hypothesis to 5. Set the Tracking mode to Swimming.\n\tNOTE: The Max tracked hypothesis setting adjusts how many potential worm-tracks a single tracked worm is allowed to have and gives the program some leeway in how accurately to track a single worm without losing track of it. 5 is a good setting for swimming.",
    "Move to the Advanced Settings section and set the following: Frames worms can touch boundary: 50, Frames worms can overlap: 500, Position tolerance: 0.50, Shape tolerance: 0.50. Save these settings and deploy them for all videos in an experiment (and beyond) by saving them as a configuration.\n\tNOTE: Track filtering is not recommended and can easily be done post-processing, leave off.\nNavigate to the Configuration Manager (gear icon) in the upper-left icon menu. When clicked, the Configuration Manager sidebar menu will open. Next, click the Save (gear +) icon, give this configuration a name and description, then click the OK button.\n\t\nTo access this configuration in the future, open the Configuration menu, select the desired configuration, and click the Load (gear up arrow) icon. Then add sequence information, possibly fine-tune the threshold level, and select worms for detection. All other settings will be the same.\nIn the Workflow menu, click Save Project, verify the save location and add a project file name (matching the project file name to the video name helps with continuity). Close the video.\n\tNOTE: These projects are saved with the .wpr filetype.\nRepeat for all videos: Import Image Sequence (2.18), Load saved configuration (2.28.1), adjust the threshold (2.23), set sequence info (2.19), detect worms (2.24.1), save the project (2.29), close video.\nTrack videos\n\t\nTo track the project files, go to the Workflow menu and click the Batch (folder containing worm pages) icon (Supplementary Figure 2F).\n\t\tNOTE: The Batch Processing panel will be displayed (Supplementary Figure 2G). Sometimes it is hidden but can be accessed at the very bottom of the Batch Workflow menu; the window may need to be expanded to see it.",
    "Click the Add button under the File Selection section of this Batch Processing menu. Navigate to and select all the project files (.wpr) to be processed, click Open.\n\t\tNOTE: The Batch Processing menu will fill with the selected file path, a status indicator and a gray progress bar for each file.\nClick the Start (play button icon). Note the green progress indicator on the first file. Allow all the files to be processed. When all the files read as finished (green), the software can be closed (Supplementary Figure 2G).\nIf a project file gets stuck, consider running the hung-up file by itself, this usually fixes the problem. If this does not fix the problem, open the project file, delete the selected worms (Detect and Track menu), and reselect from a new training set. Then reprocess the project file.\nRepairing tracks (recommended)\n\tNOTE: Repairing tracks can increase the accuracy of the tracks. Common fixes are combining tracks that clearly belong to the same worm as viewed by the human eye as, deleting tracks that are not accurate or do not capture real worm data, and splitting tracks that are misrepresented because worms are touching (remove the bad section and combine tracks from before and after the poor section if practical).\n\t\nOpen the software and open a project file [File | Open Project] of interest. Click Open and click yes to use this file. Wait for the temporal filter to load. The processed video will be on the screen; worms will be highlighted in green and outlined in yellow. Use the video player to scrub through or play the video.",
    "From the Workflow menu, select Detect and Track (Supplementary Figure 2D). Switch to the Repair tab. Activate the Selector cursor by clicking on the Selector tool icon (cursor arrow). Scrub through the video, finding and selecting a worm track, and then use the repair menu to create the desired change.\n\t\tNOTE: To strategically fix most problems quickly, zoom in such that about 1/6th of the plate is visible, start with the area surrounding track #1. Quickly scrub through the video checking for worms that mysteriously appear out of nowhere, tracks where the numbers change, or worms bumping into each other, editing as problems arise. Follow worms in numerical order from the start position. Scrub back and forth to follow each worm as necessary until the whole plate is repaired. Pay careful attention to the edges of the plate; often, fake worms appear in the shadows of plate edges.\nData analysis\n\t\nFrom the Workflow menu, select Analyze Data (Supplementary Figure 3A).\n\t\tNOTE: A new window named Data Analysis and Plotting will appear (Supplementary Figure 3B). This window has many ways to assess and view the movement data of a specific project file's worm population. Most of these analyses allow for the selection of specific, multiple, or all worms from a given video allowing for track information to be plotted in different ways.\nTo analyze turn count, navigate to the Track Summary [Position & Speed | Track Summary] (Supplementary Figure 3C). Use the Export button in the bottom right to export data in a spreadsheet readable format (.csv), choose a path to the desired location of the spreadsheet, including renaming it to something memorable. The default settings are a good choice (Supplementary Figure 3D).",
    "Paste this data, as well as any other relevant project datasets into a consolidated spreadsheet workbook (Supplementary Figure 3E).\nUse the Turn Count and Track Duration to calculate turns per min for each track in using spreadsheeting functions (=turns/track duration * 60) or use a different metric as desired (Supplementary Figure 3F).\n\t\tNOTE: Turns per minute captures very similar information as a manual thrashing assay which is a widely used metric of activity in liquid, but there are many options, and it is quite possible that a different metric may identify other interesting data for a given treatment or comparison.\nIf desired, screen for worm size, track duration, and/or some other chosen metric(s) using conditional formatting tools to highlight tracks for removal if they are potentially confounding. Maintain consistent data processing between treatments and replicates.\nAnalyze data using appropriate statistical analyses such as Student's t-test for 2 strains, or 1-way ANOVA for 3 or more strains. Perform independent experimental replicates on different days and with independent populations of worms for at least 3 independent experimental replicates."
