    "NOTE: An insect cell/baculovirus system with modified expression vectors for secretory plant protein expression and crystallization is used.\n1. Modification of a Baculovirus Expression Vector with the GP67 Signal Peptide for Plant Protein Secretion Expression\nSynthesize a DNA fragment containing a 5' BglII cutting site13, the GP67 secretion signal sequence, and a multi-cloning site with NotI, BamHI, EcoRI, StuI, SalI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI, and XhoI (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: Since both BglII and BamHI digested DNA resulted in the same adhesive ends, the linearized vector can ligate to the digested DNA fragment while both the BglII and BamHI sites in the annealed ligation sequence will be mutated to a sequence that is not cleavable by either BglII or BamHI14.\nDigest 4 µg of the DNA with BglII and XhoI, and 4 µg of an expression vector DNA with BamHI and XhoI14. Mix 10 units of each restriction enzyme with the DNA in a 1x concentration reaction buffer (50 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM Tris-acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, and 100 µg/mL BSA, pH 7.9 at 25 °C) and incubate the mixture at 37 °C for 4 h.\n\t\nPurify the excised DNA fragment and the linearized vector DNA by a DNA gel extraction kit15.\nMix 100 ng of the linearized vector DNA with 400 ng of the digested DNA fragment in a 10-µL ligation reaction mixture containing 1x T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, and 10 mM DTT, pH 7.5 at 25 °C) and 5 units of T4 DNA ligase.

Ligate the gene fragment with the linearized vector. Mix 100 ng of the linearized vector DNA with 400 ng of the digested DNA fragment in a 10-µL ligation reaction mixture containing T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer and 5 units of T4 DNA ligase.

Follow the protocol of the baculovirus expression system1 to extract and verify the bacmid DNA. Aliquot each DNA in two tubes with 20 µL each, and store the tubes at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: The following steps require an aseptic operation.\nGrow a monolayer of Sf9 cells in the culture media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 µg/mL (or 100 I.U./mL) penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics at 27 °C to 80% confluence in a 6-well plate. Estimate the percentage of confluence based on the percentage of covered area on the tissue culture plate.\nPrepare the following solutions in two sterile 1.5-mL centrifuge tubes.\n\t\nTube 1: For each transfection, dilute 20 µL of bacmid DNA into 100 µL of unsupplemented Sf9 cell culture medium without antibiotics. Mix the dilution gently by flicking the side of the tube.\nTube 2: For each transfection, dilute 8 µL of lipid transfection reagent into 100 µL of unsupplemented Sf9 cell culture medium without antibiotics. Mix the dilution thoroughly by pipetting up and down for 6x.\nCombine the two solutions, mix them gently by pipetting slowly up and down for 3x, and incubate them for 20 - 40 min at room temperature.\nWash each well of the Sf9 monolayer cells 2x with 3 mL of unsupplemented Sf9 cell culture medium without antibiotics. For each transfection, add 0.8 mL of unsupplemented Sf9 cell culture medium without antibiotics to each tube containing the lipid-DNA mixture. Mix the contents of the tubes gently by pipetting slowly up and down for 3x. Aspirate the wash media from the plates and overlay the samples with the transfection mixture.",
    "After the addition of the transfection mixture, incubate the transfected plate for 5 h at 27 °C. Replace the transfection media with the complete Sf9 cell culture medium containing 10% FBS and 100 µg/mL (or 100 I.U./mL) penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. Incubate the transfected plate at 27 °C for 4 d.\nHarvest and amplify the recombinant baculovirus.\n\t\nCollect the supernatant of the infected plate in a sterile 15-mL conical tube after 4 d of incubation. Spin the supernatant at 1010 x g for 5 min to remove the cell debris. Discard the pellet and decant the supernatant to a clean tube and store it at 4 °C for up to 1 year.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the P0 virus. It can be aliquoted and stored at -80 °C for a longer period of time.\nTo amplify each recombinant virus, grow a monolayer of Sf9 cells on a 150-mm plate to 80% confluence. Aspirate the media from the plate, add 2 mL of the P0 virus to the cells adherent to the plate and incubate the plate for 1 h in a 27 °C incubator. Rock the plate every 15 min to mix the medium with the cells.\n\t\t\nAdd 25 mL of complete Grace's media containing 10% FBS and 100 µg/mL (or 100 I.U./mL) penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. Incubate the plate for 3 d in a 27 °C incubator to obtain the P1 passage virus.\nCollect the supernatant of the infected plate in a sterile 50-mL conical tube and spin at 1010 x g for 5 min to remove the cell debris. Decant the supernatant to a clean tube and store it at 4 °C for up to 1 year.\n\t\tNOTE: The P1 virus can be aliquoted and stored at -80 °C for a longer period of time.",
    "To amplify the virus from P1 to P2 passage, grow a monolayer of Sf9 cells on a 150-mm plate to 90% confluence, aspirate the media of the plate, add 2 mL of the P1 virus to the plate, and incubate it for 1 h in a 27 °C incubator.\nRepeat steps 3.8.2 and 3.8.3 to obtain the P2 and P3 passages of the viruses. Do not store the P3 virus for more than 2 months.\n4. Protein Expression, Purification with NiNTA, and Crystallization\nCulture 1 L of Hi5 insect cells in the culture media with 100 µg/mL (or 100 I.U./mL) penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics to a density of 2 x 106 at 100 rpm in a 27 °C incubator shaker. Spin down the cells at 570 x g for 5 min, decant the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 20 mL of the freshly produced P3 virus, and keep it at room temperature for 1 h. Gently shake the spin bottle to resuspend the cells 1x every 15 min.\nTransfer the cells to 1 L of culture media with 100 µg/mL (or 100 I.U./mL) penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics, culture the cells at 100 rpm in a 27 °C incubator shaker for 72 h. Spin down the cells at 1,010 x g for 5 min and collect the supernatant.\nUse pH indicator strips to adjust the pH of the supernatant to 8.0 by adding either 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH and add binding buffer at a final concentration, containing 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole. Add a certain amount of NiNTA resin (10 - 40 mL) based on the estimated yield of the expressed His-tagged recombinant protein.",
    "Mix the solution on a magnetic stir with low speed at 4 °C for 1 h. Wash the resin and elute the bound protein following the standard NiNTA purification protocol18.\nSubject the purified protein to ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, as well as other protein purification methods, to yield a homogeneous sample.\n\tNOTE: For the TDR ectodomain, 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl were used as gel filtration buffer. For the PRK3 ectodomain, 20 mM bis-Tris, pH 6, 100 mM NaCl were used as the preferred gel filtration buffer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
