    "Note: All procedures are performed for four samples. Preparation of the cells (Figure 2)Place 12-mm-diameter cover glasses in each well of a 24-well plate.Grow the cells to 60% confluence on the cover glasses in 500 μl of the recommended culture media at 37 °C, with 5% CO2.Remove media from the wells and wash twice each with 1 ml PBS. Add 500 μl 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature.Remove the solution from the well and wash twice each with 1 ml PBS.Take the cover glasses from the wells using tweezers.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181029/20181029210514_5026.jpgFigure 2. Preparation for PLA method with cell lines. A. Cover glasses in each well of the plate (left). Cells grown on cover glasses in the culture media (right). B. Post-PLA slide glasses mounted with cover glasses using DAPI and sealed with nail polish. Preparation of the tumor specimensFix surgical specimens in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embed them in paraffin, and section at a thickness of 4 μm.Remove paraffin with xylene, rehydrate with a graded series of ethanol solutions, and wash twice with PBS.Add 300 μl ImmunoSaver to 60 ml Milli-Q water in the staining jar.Autoclave the slides in the staining jar for 45 min at 98 °C and incubate at room temperature.Wash the slides twice with PBS.Draw a circle around the tumor specimen of around 1 cm2 with the Dako Pen.Conjugation of the PLA oligonucleotide to the antibodyThaw conjugation buffer at room temperature and vortex.Add 2.1 μl conjugation buffer to 21 μl rabbit monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody and mix gently with a pipette.Transfer the antibody solution from Step C2 to one vial of oligonucleotide PLUS or oligonucleotide MINUS and mix gently with a pipette.Incubate at room temperature overnight.Vortex stop reagent solution and add 2.1 μl to the solution from Step C3 and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "Vortex storage solution and add 25.2 μl to the solution prepared in Step C5 and store at 4 °C.The stored solution can be used within one month.BlockingVortex blocking solution and transfer 40 μl to each sample.Put the slides in a pre-heated humidity chamber and incubate in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min.PLA probesDilute the conjugated antibodies from Step C6 in the PLA probe diluent.Prepare 200 μl of 1x working assay reagent by mixing 10 μl of 20x stock solution and 190 μl of PLA probe diluent.Add 8 μl PLUS or MINUS antibody solution (Step C6) to 72 μl working assay reagent (from Step E1a) and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.Gently remove the blocking solution from the samples using a Kimwipe waste paper sheet without touching the cells.Add 38 μl (19 μl PLUS probe and 19 μl MINUS probe) in total diluted PLA probes PLUS solution and MINUS solution to each sample.Mix gently with a pipette.Incubate in a humidity chamber for 2 h at room temperature.LigationDilute 32 μl ligation buffer (5x) in 124 μl Milli-Q water and mix.Gently remove the PLA probe solution from the samples using a Kimwipe waste paper sheet without touching the cells.Gently wash the slides twice for 5 min each in 500 μl Wash Buffer A.Add 4 μl ligase to 156 μl ligation buffer (1x) and vortex.Add 39 μl solution to each sample.Put the slides in a pre-heated humidity chamber and incubate in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min.AmplificationDilute 32 μl amplification red (5x) in 126 μl Milli-Q water and mix.Gently remove the ligation solution from the samples using a Kimwipe waste paper sheet without touching the cells.Gently wash the slides twice for 2 min each in 500 μl Wash Buffer A.",
    "Add 2 μl polymerase solution to 158 μl amplification red (1x) and vortex.Add 39 μl solution to each sample.Put the slides in a pre-heated humidity chamber and incubate with a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min.Preparation for imagingGently remove the amplification-polymerase solution from the samples using a Kimwipe waste paper sheet without touching the cells.Gently wash the slides twice for 10 min each in 500 μl Wash Buffer B.Gently wash the slides for 1 min in 500 μl 0.01x Wash Buffer B.Let the slides dry at room temperature in the dark.Mount the slide glasses with cover glasses using a minimal volume of Duolink® In situ Mounting Medium with DAPI.Seal the edges with nail polish and incubate for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.Imaging with a microscopeAnalyze the images using fluorescence microscopy.After imaging, store the slides at -20 °C in the dark."
