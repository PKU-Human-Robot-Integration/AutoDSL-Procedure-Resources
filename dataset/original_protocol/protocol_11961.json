    "1 . Electroporation In Ovo\nPrepare the expression plasmid DNA for fluorescent labeling in high concentration. Isolate DNA from 200 mL of bacterial culture by the alkaline lysis method using anion-exchange columns according to the manufacturer's protocol (Table of Materials). Mix pCAGGS-EGFP and pCAGGS-mCherryNuc at a final concentration of 4 µg/µL each.\n\tNOTE: Endotoxin-free plasmid DNA purification may be preferred for electroporation.\nIncubate fertile chicken eggs horizontally at 38 °C in 70% relative humidity.\nAfter 2.5 days, eliminate 5 mL of albumen (egg white) from the pointed side of the egg using 20 mL syringe with an 18 gauge needle and seal the needle hole with tape.\nCut the top of the egg shell with curved scissors to open a hole 2 cm in diameter and check the developmental stage of the embryo under the stereomicroscope (stage 17 of Hamburger and Hamilton9). Seal the hole again with tape.\n\tNOTE: This step can be performed at any time during E2.5-E3.0. Steps 1.3 and 1.4 lower the level of the embryo in the egg to avoid a tight attachment of the growing embryo and the blood vessels to the top shell.\nContinue incubation until E5.5.\nBefore electroporation, prepare 10 µL of the mentioned plasmid DNA colored with 0.5 µL of Fast Green (25 mg/mL), 10 mL of autoclaved phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and micropipettes made from glass capillary tubes using a micropipette processor. Cut the distal tip of the micropipette to make an appropriate size of pore depending on the amount of DNA for injection.",
    "Cut the sealed top shell with scissors to reopen a hole 2.5 cm in diameter and set the egg stably under the stereo microscope. Add a few drops of PBS into the egg. Peel off the allantoic membrane covering the embryo without hemorrhage using two fine forceps. Remove the amnion from the head of the embryo.\nWhile turning the head with a microspatula, inject 0.1-1 μL of the colored DNA into the ventricular cavity of the left optic tectum using a micropipette connected to a suction tube.\n\tNOTE: The amount of DNA injected depends on the purpose of the experiment. Concentrated DNA solution should sink and attach along the ventricular wall.\nPlace a pair of forcep-type electrodes (3 mm square electrodes with 7 mm distance) so that the target area of the optic tectumis placed in between (Figure 1, Step 1).\n\tNOTE: The DNA is electroporated to the anode side.\nCharge a pre-pulse of 30 V, 1 ms with a 5 ms interval and four subsequent pulses of 6 V, 5 ms with a 10 ms interval using the pulse generator.\n\tNOTE: The electronic condition depends on the size and distance of the electrodes. It should be strong enough to achieve efficient transfection, but it must be modest enough to assure the normal development of the target tissue.\nSeal the hole with tape and continue incubation. Soak the electrodes in PBS to remove albumen with an interdental brush in a plastic dish. Repeat 1.7-1.11 for each egg.\n2. Flat-Mount Culture on the Cell Insert",
    "One day before the flat-mount culture, prepare the coated cell culture insert. Float some cell culture inserts on the autoclaved distilled water in a 10-cm cell culture dish. Load a solution of 8 µg/mL laminin and 80 µg/mL poly-L-lysine to cover the inserts and leave the floated inserts in the cell culture CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: On the following day, the coated inserts can be stored at 4 °C.\nOn day of the culture at E7.0, remove the laminin-poly-L-lysine solution from the insert and place the insert in a glass bottom dish (Figure 1, Step 2) filled with 1.1 mL of culture medium (60% reduced serum medium, 20% F12, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% chick serum, 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin). Keep the dish in the cell culture CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: The medium can be used throughout the culture period for three days without change.\nPrepare the culture setup. Set a humid chamber unit on an inverted confocal microscope with a gas flow of 40% O2 and 5% CO2 (gas controller) at 38 °C (temperature controller).\nCut the head of the embryo with scissors. Pinch the head out with the forceps into the ice-cold Hanks' Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) in a 6-cm cell culture dish.\nIsolate the electroporated optic tectum using two fine forceps. Transfer the tectum with a plastic dropper into another dish filled with ice-cold HBSS. Use the concaved glass dish based with black silicon as a saucer for cutting.\nCheck the position of the labeling under the fluorescence stereoscopic microscope. Cut out the tectal tissue surrounding the labeling area with a microsurgical knife. Make sure the direction of the tissue in the tectum (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral).",
    "Transfer the labeled tissue with a plastic dropper to the insert so that the pia side is attached to the insert. Lay the tectal tissue in the desired direction and remove excess HBSS (Figure 1, Step 2).\nRepeat 2.4-2.7 in order to prepare other tissues on the same insert. Place the dish in the prewarmed chamber in the inverted confocal microscope (Figure 1, Step 3).\n3. Time-Lapse Imaging\nCheck the fluorescent labelling and focus the microscopic field in the inverted confocal microscope. Start the laser confocal units and try sampling the confocal scan to adjust the direction and position of the tissue along the X and Y-axis in the field. Use the 10X or 20X objective lens without immersion oil.\nSelect the scanning size (e.g., 512x512 dpi). Decide the interval and total range of the confocal scan along the z-axis. Take a 5 or 10 µm interval for the 100 µm range. Decide the time interval of the confocal imaging and total imaging duration (e.g., 10 min intervals over 48 h).\n\tNOTE: To avoid laser phototoxicity, prohibit scanning in the high scanning size with short z-intervals for the long z-range, or with short time intervals during the long imaging duration. For example, when applying a high scanning size (e.g., 1024x1024 dpi), decrease the number of scans along the z-axis.\nSet the parameters of the confocal running program described in 3.2 and start imaging.\nAfter the imaging, combine the confocal images at different z-axis to provide z-stack images with fine focal adjustment at every time point.\nAppend the z-stack images at different time-point and construct a time-lapse movie in the AVI format.\nSubscription Required.
