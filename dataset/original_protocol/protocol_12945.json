    "1. Preparations for Cell Culture\nPurchase commercially available stocks of human cells.\n\tNOTE: This protocol utilizes HCT116 colorectal carcinoma and primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTEC).\nMake 500 ml medium for culture of HCT116: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/High glucose medium supplemented with 7.5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S).\nMake 500 ml medium for culture of HRPTEC: Epithelial cell medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% epithelial cell growth supplement, and 1% P/S.\nPrepare 500 ml of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS): 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4. Adjust pH to 7.4 and sterilize by autoclaving for 40 min at 121 °C.\n2. Initiation of Cell Culturing\nCarefully aspirate the medium from a 80-90% confluent dish without disturbing the cells.\nAliquot 3-5 ml of 1x PBS per culture dish, gently rock each flask to coat the surface area of the dish, and carefully aspirate the 1x PBS. Repeat for a second 1x PBS wash.\nAliquot 3 ml of 0.05% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) into each culture dish and gently rock to evenly coat the cells with trypsin-EDTA. Incubate at 37 °C for 2-3 min.\nTransfer the detached cells into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 90 sec.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 ml of complete DMEM.\nCount cells using a haemocytometer. Calculate how many non-pyrogenic and polystyrene 100 mm cell culture dishes are required to achieve an initial seeding density of approximately 2,500-5,000 cells per cm2.\nPre-warm complete cell culture medium made in steps 1.2 or 1.3 in a 37 °C water bath for 30-45 min.\nDecontaminate the medium bottle and cell vial with 70% ethanol. From this point forward all operations should be performed aseptically.",
    "Aliquot 6 ml of complete DMEM into as many 100 mm cell culture dishes required to use the entire volume of frozen cells within the seeding density mentioned in step 2.6.\nTransfer the volume of cell suspension calculated in step 2.6 to each of the 100 mm culture dishes. Rock each plate manually to evenly distribute the cells over the surface of the plate.\nPlace the seeded 100 mm cell culture dish in the incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Allow cells to incubate at least 24 hr before the next steps.\n3. Subculturing\nView each cell culture dish under a microscope to determine the percentage of cell confluency (% cells covering the area of the dish). Return cells to the incubator and pre-warm complete medium and 1x PBS. Proceed to the next step if the cells are 80-100% confluent.\nCarefully aspirate the spent medium without disturbing the cells in each culture dish.\nAliquot 3-5 ml of 1x PBS per culture dish, gently rock each flask to coat the surface area of the dish, and carefully aspirate the 1x PBS. Repeat for a second 1x PBS wash.\nAliquot 3 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA into each culture dish and gently rock to evenly coat the cells with trypsin-EDTA. Incubate at 37 °C for 2-3 min.\nDuring this incubation, aliquot 10 ml of complete medium into as many culture dishes are required to obtain cell density of 2,500-5,000 cells per cm2.\nWhen the cells have detached from the plate, quickly add 3 ml of 1x defined trypsin inhibitor and gently swirl the dish for 1 min to ensure that all of the trypsin-EDTA has been neutralized.",
    "Transfer the detached cells into a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube and set aside. Add 3 ml 1x PBS to the dish to gather any remaining cells, and transfer that to the same 15 ml centrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging 150 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 ml of complete medium.\nCount cells using a haemocytometer and seed 150 mm culture dishes containing 15 ml of complete medium to obtain a cell density of 2,500-5,000 cells per cm2. Use two 150 mm for each cap-binding assay.\n\tNOTE: Oxygen diffusion to cells through liquid media is dependent on the volume36. It is recommended to keep the volume of the media consistent between experiments whether adherent cells or cells in suspension are used. Media can be pre-conditioned (incubated in the workstation for 24 hr as discussed in Discussion) to avoid these variabilities in diffusion.\nPlace the seeded-culture dishes in the incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Allow cells to incubate at least 24 hr before proceeding to the next steps.\n4. Physioxic Exposure\nView the cells under the microscope. For best results, ensure that cells are 70-80% confluent for a 24 hr exposure, 50-60% confluent for a 48 hr exposure, and 40-50% confluent for a 72 hr exposure.\nPlace the cells into a hypoxia workstation for the desired time (24, 48, or 72 hr depending on the experiment).\nSet the workstation to the appropriate physioxia.\n\tNOTE: For example, a 3% O2 setting would be accompanied by 5% CO2 and 92% N2.\n\tNOTE: If oxygen fluctuations within a dynamic range are desired over a specific timeline, program the schedule into the instrument or manually adjust the oxygen settings at the desired intervals.",
    "Set the humidity to 60%. The workstation atmosphere is very dry nonetheless, and media will noticeably evaporate during long experiments (>48 hr). Keep a media reserve in a cell culture flask within the workstation (so that the media is equilibrated with the workstation atmosphere) to replenish the media in the cell culture dishes.\n\tNOTE: Any solution that will interact with the cells prior to lysis (such as PBS and trypsin-EDTA) should be pre-conditioned for 24 hr before use within the hypoxia workstation so that the dissolved oxygen equilibrates with the atmospheric oxygen36.\nKeep cells within the workstation until lysis.\n5. Preparing Buffers for Cap-binding Assay\nPrepare 1x Tris-buffered Saline (TBS).\n\t\nIn 800 ml of dH2O, dissolve 8.76 g NaCl and 6.05 g Tris Base.\nBring the solution to a final pH of 7.4 using 1 M HCl.\nBring the final volume to 1 L using dH2O.\nPrepare non-denaturing lysis buffer. Prepare lysis buffer the day of the cap-binding assay. Make extra lysis buffer to wash the blank agarose beads and the γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP agarose C10-linked beads (steps 7.9 and 7.13).\n\t\nIn 7 ml of dH2O, add 160 µl 5 M NaCl, 160 µl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 40 µl 200 mM NaF, 40 µl 1 M MgCl2, and 40 µl 1 mM sodium orthovanadate.\nAdd 40 µl of Igepal to the 7 ml solution. Cut the tip of the pipette to help retrieve Igepal as it is extremely viscous.\nMix by pipetting up and down, or vortex, the 7 ml solution until all of the Igepal has been dissolved.\nRaise the final volume of the solution to 8 ml and keep on ice.\nPrepare 4x Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)-PAGE Sample Buffer.\n\t\nIn a beaker, combine 16 ml 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 12.64 ml glycerol, and 8 ml dithiothreitol (DTT).",
    "Add 3.2 g of SDS and 0.16 g of bromophenol blue. Allow powder to fully dissolve by mixing with a magnetic stir bar.\nAliquot into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20 °C.\n6. Cell Lysis\nPrepare non-denaturing lysis buffer and keep on ice the day of the cap-binding assay.\nPre-warm 1x PBS and trypsin in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min.\nAliquot 980 µl of lysis buffer into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for each cap-binding assay being performed.\nAdd 10 µl of 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 10 µl of 100x protease inhibitor cocktail to the 980 µl of lysis buffer. Keep on ice.\nDiscard the media from each 150 mm dish in a waste container within the hypoxia workstation.\nWash the cells with 3-4 ml of warm 1x PBS and discard all of the liquid.\nAdd 1 ml of warm 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to each dish and let sit for 2 min or until cells are no longer adhered to the plate.\nUsing a pipette, transfer the cells of one plate to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Repeat as needed so that each plate of cells is transferred to a separate 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes at 6,000 x g for 90 sec to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the trypsin using a pipette without disturbing the pellet. If the pellet is disturbed, re-centrifuge the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube at 6,000 x g for 90 sec.\nWash the cells with warm 1x PBS by gently pipetting 200 µl of PBS into the tube just above the pellet. Re-centrifuge if the pellet is disturbed.\nAspirate the PBS without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Pipette 500 µl from the 1 ml prepared lysis buffer solution onto the first cellular pellet. Resuspend the pellet entirely by pipetting up and down.\nCombine the resuspended cells with the second cell pellet and resuspend the second pellet by pipetting up and down. Repeat this process until all pellets have been combined and resuspended for each sample.\nCombine the lysate with the remaining 500 µl of lysis buffer in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nRemove samples from the hypoxia workstation.\n\tNOTE: After adding lysis buffer, all subsequent steps are to be performed in ambient air as the hypoxia workstation is set to 37 °C and the following steps are to be performed cold (4 °C or on ice).\nLyse the cells using gentle agitation by rotating the samples at 4 °C for 1.5-2 hr.\nCentrifuge the lysed cells at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris.\nTransfer the lysate to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and discard the pellet.\nReserve a portion (5-10%) of the supernatant to be used as a whole cell lysate input control for future western blot analysis.\n7. Cap-binding Assay\nFor each sample, transfer 50 µl of the blank agarose bead control slurry and 50 µl of the γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP agarose C10-linked bead slurry to separate 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Use scissors to remove the tip of the pipette to facilitate collection of the bead slurry.\nPellet the beads by centrifuging the slurry at 500 x g for 30 sec.\nRemove the supernatant carefully and resuspend the beads in 500 µl of TBS.\nRepeat steps 7.2 and 7.3. Pellet the beads at 500 x g for 30 sec and remove the supernatant.",
    "Transfer the supernatant containing the lysate from step 6.19 to the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing the blank agarose beads.\n\tNOTE: The blank agarose beads act as a pre-clearing step to remove proteins from the lysate that non-specifically interact with the bead.\nIncubate for 10 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation.\nPellet the blank agarose beads by centrifuging at 500 x g for 30 sec.\nTransfer the lysate to the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing the γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP agarose C10-linked beads.\nWash the blank agarose beads by resuspending the beads in 500 µl of lysis buffer, pelleting the beads by centrifuging at 500 x g for 30 sec, and discarding the supernatant. Repeat this four times for a total of five washes.\nResuspend the blank agarose beads in 1x SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boil the beads for 90 sec at 95 °C. Store at -20 °C for future western blot analysis to observe whether the protein of interest binds non-specifically to the bead.\nIncubate the lysate with the γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP agarose C10-linked beads with gentle agitation for 1 hr at 4 °C to capture cap-binding proteins.\nPellet the γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP agarose C10-linked beads by centrifuging at 500 x g for 30 sec. Discard the supernatant.\nWash the γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP agarose C10-linked beads by repeating step 7.9.\nResuspend the beads in 600 µl of lysis buffer.\nAdd GTP to a final concentration of 1 mM.\nIncubate the γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP agarose C10-linked beads + 1 mM GTP with gentle agitation for 1 hr at 4 °C. Note: This will disassociate proteins that non-specifically interact with m7GTP (i.e., also interact with non-methylated GTP).\nPellet the γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP agarose C10-linked beads by centrifuging at 500 x g for 30 sec.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 200 µl of 4x SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Store the GTP control sample at -20 °C for future western blot analysis37. Wash the beads by repeating step 7.9.\nResuspend the beads in 1x SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol), and boil at 95 °C for 90 sec. Store the m7GTP-bound fraction at -20 °C for future western blot analysis37.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
