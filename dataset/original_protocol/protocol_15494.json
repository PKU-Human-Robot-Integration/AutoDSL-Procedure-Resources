    "1. Buffers and Solutions\nPrepare the solutions listed below. Degas all buffers for liquid chromatography. Add ADP, benzamidine, and protease inhibitors just before use.\n\t\nPrepare buffer A: 50 mM Tris buffer with hydrochloric acid (Tris-HCl) pH 8.0, 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM benzamidine, 5 mM aminocaproic acid (ACA), and protease inhibitors (10 µM amastatin, 50 µM bestatin, 50 µM pepstatin, 50 µM leupeptin, and 50 µM diprotin A).\nPrepare buffer B: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.25 M sucrose, 4 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5 mM benzamidine, 5 mM ACA, 1 mM ADP, and protease inhibitors (10 µM amastatin, 50 µM bestatin, 50 µM pepstatin, 50 µM leupeptin, and 50 µM diprotin A).\nPrepare Q-column buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 4 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgSO4, 5 mM benzamidine, 5 mM ACA, and 1 mM ADP.\nPrepare Q-column elution buffer: Q-column buffer with 1 M NaCl.\nPrepare SEC buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgSO4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM ADP.\nPrepare chloroform saturated with 2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Mix chloroform with 2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5 in approximately 1:1 ratio in a screw-cap bottle, shake, let the organic and aqueous phases separate, and measure pH in the upper aqueous layer with a strip of pH-indicator paper. Store at room temperature. Just before use, shake again and let the phases separate. Use the lower chloroform layer.\n\t\tCAUTION: Chloroform is volatile and irritating to eyes and skin. Work in a fume hood. Use safety spectacles when shaking.\n2. Preparation of sub-mitochondrial Particles\nResuspend mitochondrial vesicles (mitoplasts) isolated by hypotonic lysis25 from 1 x 1011 to 2 x 1011 cells of procyclic T. brucei in 5 mL of ice-cold buffer A. Keep the sample chilled until step 3.2.",
    "Determine the protein concentration in the suspension by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay26 according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nUse a bovine serum albumin (BSA) dilution series in ultrapure water to construct the standard curve. Dilute a small amount of sample 20 - 100 times with ultrapure water to fit into the range of BSA standards.\nCalculate the total protein amount in the sample and bring the protein concentration to 16 mg/mL by diluting it with additional buffer A.\nFragment mitoplasts into inverted vesicles and membrane pieces by sonication of the suspension 7x for 15 s with a total energy of 70 to 100 J per impulse with a microtip with a diameter of 3.9 mm. If the ultrasonic homogenizer does not display the energy output, start the optimization at 50% of the maximal power. Incubate the sample on ice for 30 s between impulses. After the sonication, the suspension becomes slightly darker.\nSediment the membrane fragments by ultracentrifugation at 54,000 x g for 16 h or at 98,000 x g for 5 h at 4 °C. Decant the supernatant and proceed with the chloroform extraction, or flash-freeze the sediment in liquid nitrogen and store it at -80 °C.\n3. Release of F1-ATPase from Membrane by Chloroform\nResuspend the pellet of mitochondrial membranes in buffer B with the aid of a small Dounce homogenizer. Calculate the volume of buffer B based on the total amount of buffer A used in steps 2.1 and 2.2 using the following formula: volume (buffer B) = volume (buffer A) x 12/21. Transfer the suspension to a 15- or 50-mL conical tube.\nRemove the sample from ice and, from now on, keep the sample and all solutions to be used at room temperature.",
    "Add chloroform saturated with 2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5; the volume of chloroform to be added equals half the volume of the suspension. Close the cap tightly. Shake it vigorously for exactly 20 s. Centrifuge it immediately at 8,400 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the upper cloudy aqueous phase to 1.6-mL microtubes. Add protease inhibitors (10 µM amastatin, 50 µM bestatin, 50 µM pepstatin, 50 µM leupeptin, and 50 µM diprotin A) to replace the inhibitors removed by the chloroform treatment. Centrifuge the samples at 13,000 x g for 30 min at room temperature. Transfer the supernatant to fresh microtubes and repeat the centrifugation to remove any insoluble material.\n4. Anion-exchange Chromatography\nEquilibrate the 5-mL anion exchange (Q) column attached to a fast-protein liquid chromatography system with the Q-column buffer at a flow rate of 5 mL/min until the absorbance at 280 nm and the conductivity stabilize (approximately 50 mL of buffer).\nLoad the supernatant from step 3.3 on the equilibrated column at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Wait until the absorbance at 280 nm stabilizes at the background. Apply a 25-mL linear gradient of the Q-column elution buffer from 0% to 100% at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Collect 1-mL fractions.\nAssay the individual fractions corresponding to the major elution peak for ATP hydrolytic activity by the Pullman ATPase assay2 at pH 8.0. Use 10 µL of each fraction per 1 mL of reaction mixture.Pool the fractions that exhibit ATPase activity. Optionally, separate 10 µL of each fraction on sodium dodecyl phosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and stain the gel by Coomassie Blue to visualize individual F1-ATPase subunits and contaminating proteins.",
    "Concentrate the pooled sample by membrane ultrafiltration using a spin column with a 100,000 MWCO PES filter to 200 - 500 µL. Proceed to SEC or store the sample overnight at room temperature.\n5. Size-exclusion Chromatography\nEquilibrate the SEC column attached to a liquid chromatography system with at least 48 mL (two column volumes) of the SEC buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.\nApply the sample on the column and run chromatography at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. Collect 0.25-mL fractions.\nRun 10 µL of the fractions that correspond to the peaks of the UV280nm absorbance trace on SDS-PAGE and stain them by Coomassie Blue. The first major peak contains the F1-ATPase. Assay the fractions corresponding to this peak for the ATP hydrolytic activity and azide sensitivity by the Pullman ATPase assay. Determine the protein concentration by the BCA assay.\nKeep the purified F1-ATPase at room temperature and use it within 3 d after purification for downstream applications. Alternatively, concentrate the sample using a spin column with a 100,000 MWCO PES filter to > 1.5 mg/mL, precipitate it by mixing it with saturated ammonium sulfate adjusted to pH 8.0 (1.2x the volume), and store it at 4 °C.\nSubscription Required.
