    "This protocol contains a brief description of the HDTVi procedure for generating HCC mouse models (Zhang et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-bib-0021]). Examples of HCC mouse models obtained by this procedure and further applications of this technique have been reported in the literature (Molina-Sánchez et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-bib-0011]; Wang et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-bib-0018]). This approach allows the stable transduction of mouse hepatocytes to induce HCC by tail vein injection of a large volume of saline solution containing a combination of a Sleeping Beauty transposon for oncogene somatic integration, a vector encoding the Sleeping Beauty transposase, and a third vector expressing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the tumor-suppressor gene of interest, depending on the HCC oncogenic drivers of interest. A procedure for following HCC growth kinetics by measuring tumor volume using MRI are also described, along with steps to extract blood and HCC-bearing liver samples from mice upon reaching the predefined experimental endpoint.\nNOTE: The instructions given in this protocol pertain to mice housed in individually ventilated cage (IVC) units; therefore, it is advisable to work under sterile conditions.\nMaterials\nAnimals: age (6-8 weeks)-, gender-, and strain-matched mice\nMixture of the plasmids of interest (selected according to the guidelines in step 1), in sterile saline solution (0.9% [w/v] NaCl) in a 50-ml tube\nVirkon S (Biosecurity B.V.)\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nWarm (37°C) water in a 50-ml tube\nLaminar flow hood\nFood, cage, water, and housing material for mice\nHighly absorbent diaper for animals\nScale (Sartorius Entris 4202-1S)\nHeating lamp (IR100R PAR Philips)\nMouse restrainer (Bioseb Lab Instruments)\nThree 26-G, 5/8-inch needles (BD Microlance)\n3-ml syringes (BD Emerald)\nPaper tissues\nHeating pad (Digital thermostat TS-5000 comfort)",
    "1. Before initiating the experiment, weigh the mice on a scale to determine the final volume of saline solution required for injections. The final volume should provide for an injection of 10% of each mouse body weight, plus enough excess for three mice to avoid not having enough material. Then, in a 50-ml tube, prepare the sterile saline solution containing the plasmids of interest:\n         \n10 µg per mouse of Sleeping Beauty transposon pT3 vector containing the oncogene of interest;\n10 µg per mouse of pX330 vector expressing the sgRNA targeting the tumor-suppressor gene of interest for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout;\n5 µg per mouse of Sleeping Beauty transposase;\nSterile 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution (amount equivalent to 10% of each mouse's weight).\nThe average mouse weight can be considered 20 g for this preparation.\nThe concentration of vectors injected can be changed according to the researcher's need. Injecting smaller amounts of plasmids may be useful when slower-developing/growing liver tumors are sought, to better assess treatment response, for instance.\nThe Sleeping Beauty transposon vectors can be purchased from Addgene and complemented, if desired, with a fluorescent reporter gene (e.g., gfp) through cloning for the detection of cancer cells.\n2. Before beginning to work with the mice, clean a laminar flow hood using Virkon S and 70% ethanol. Place all required equipment in the flow hood and add a diaper to absorb any spilled bodily fluids.\n3. Transfer the mice to the clean hood prepared in step 2.\n4. Place the heating lamp above the open cages. Place the mice under the heater for 15 min before injection to allow vein dilation.\n5. Immediately before injection, insert the mouse tail in warm water (37°C) for 15 s to further dilate the tail vein.",
    "6. Accommodate the mouse in the rotating mouse restrainer, identify the caudal vein, and inject the saline solution containing the plasmids (10% of the mouse body weight) with a 3-ml syringe connected to a 26-G, 5/8-inch needle (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-fig-0002]). The injection point should be near the bottom of the tail, and the duration of the injection should be 8-10 s. Clean off any blood or bodily fluids with a paper tissue wetted with ethanol.\nIf the first injection is unsuccessful, proceed to the upper parts of the vein.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b666390c-e149-489f-9a72-658831a0788c/cpz1147-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nRepresentation of a mouse tail viewed from above. A 90° rotation of the mouse restrainer is needed to expose the tail vein in front of the investigator, allowing a precise and steady insertion of the needle\n7. After the procedure, the mouse will be immobile in a resting state. Carefully transfer the mouse to a heating pad recovery station.\n8. After a recovery time of 30 min, mice can be transferred to fresh cages with food, water, and housing material. Wet food should be placed at the bottom of the cage for 48 hr after the HDTVi procedure.\n9. Monitor mice daily for a week after the procedure for any signs of distress or poor health. Warning signs include reduced mobility, piloerection, hunched gait, and weight loss.\n10. Weigh mice twice a week to monitor possible weight loss following the HDTVi procedure.\nSpecific instructions pertaining to each animal facility and their evaluation of the HDTV procedure may lead to additional steps, for instance the inclusion of analgesic. It is advisable to discuss the procedure with the Animal Welfare committee.",
    "After the injection of the saline solution containing the plasmids of interest via HDTVi, the mice should be monitored regularly for any symptoms of tumor growth, with tumor penetrance and aggressivity dependent on the combination of oncogene and tumor-suppressor knockout chosen. A key readout is the enlargement of the mouse abdomen, which increases as HCC progress and can affect the mouse's mobility and ability to ingest food and water.\nOrthogonal to these clinical signs, tumor progression should be quantified using MRI. This procedure should start 2 weeks after injection and be repeated weekly or biweekly, adjusted according to the tumor growth kinetics of the combination of oncogenic drivers chosen.\nLongitudinal tumor volume measurement can be used to determine longitudinal HCC tumor growth and to assess the efficacy of drug treatment in the context of preclinical intervention trials.\nMaterials\nHCC model mice (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0001])\nOpthalmic ointment (Alcon Duratears)\nLaminar flow hood\nFilled isoflurane station to provide 1.8% isoflurane\nRespiratory sensor (Bruker)\nHighly absorbent diaper for animals\nLubricated rectal thermometer probe (SA Instruments Inc.) and probe protectors\nAnesthesia induction chamber\n7-Tesla MRI instrument (Bruker Biospec 70/20)\nBruker Paravision 6.0.1\n1H transmit-receive volume coil\nSilicone warm water heating mat connected to a heating bath set at 35°C, to cover the mouse during scanning (SA Instruments Inc.)\nSurgical tape\nMIPAV (Medical Image Processing, Analysis and Visualization) open-source software (US National Institutes of Health, nih.gov) for use on Java-enabled platform\n1. Check and refill the isoflurane stations if necessary. Open the valves for isoflurane, providing O2 at ∼35% and air at ∼65%.\n2. Place the respiratory sensor on the animal bed and secure it with a piece of tape.",
    "3. Lay a highly absorbent diaper on the animal bed inside the machine. Place a fresh lubricated probe protector around the rectal probe and ensure that the eye ointment is ready to be used.\n4. In a laminar flow hood, open the mouse cage and place the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber.\n5. From the isoflurane station, open only the valve to the anesthesia induction chamber, ensuring that it is standing under the ventilation arm. Turn the isoflurane to 1.8%.\n6. Confirm with a toe pinch that the mouse is properly anesthetized (after ∼3 min with isoflurane). Open the valve to the MRI and close the one to the anesthesia induction chamber.\n7. Move the mouse to the animal bed, apply ophthalmic ointment to eyes, and secure the mouse with the tooth in the toothbar in the prone position (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-fig-0003]). Ensure that the front paws are pointing backwards. Tape the silicone heating blanket over the mouse.\nEnsure that the isoflurane cable is not pinched anywhere.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b22ea3e-5d02-4494-80a3-319361e24f61/cpz1147-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Mouse MRI procedure details. (A) Top: Empty MRI bed with clear tubing for isoflurane gas anesthesia to toothbar, respiratory pillow for monitoring of the mouse at 6 cm distance from nose cone, silicone heating pad. Middle: Mouse is positioned in toothbar and not too tightly in nose cone, legs are positioned backwards, eyes are protected with ointment (Duratear), respiratory pillow is covered with a Foliodrape surgical drape for hygiene. Bottom: Heating pad is warmed with water and is covering the mouse tightly enough to fit in the bore and coil and prevent motion artefacts, but not so tightly as to hamper the mouse's breathing. (B-D) Liver tumor growth was detected in MycOE/Trp53KO HCC model by MRI, and volume was measured with MIPAV software 2 weeks after HDTVI as indicated in panel (B) at day 0 (volume, 0.469 mm3). Tumor progression was assessed weekly, as shown in panels (C) and (D), at day 7 (volume, 42.62 mm3) and day 14 (1382.16 mm3). The red line indicates the visible tumor area that corresponds to the measured volume of interest (VOI) shown in the output window.\n8. Carefully insert the bed until the abdomen of the mouse is in the center of the coil and magnetic field. Change the height of the animal bed if needed.\nEnsure that the cables are not obstructed and that the bed does not touch the coil.\n9. To start the scanning using the program Bruker ParaVision 6.0.1, select File (upper left) > New Study and fill in the (bold) fields. Click Create followed by Exam.",
    "10. In the Palette > Explorer window, you can select Object, Region, and Application. Select the protocol optimized for the liver. For this, the following parameters are used: respiratory gated sequence with TR/TE = 2500/25 ms, 32 × 24-mm field of view (320 × 240 matrix, resolution of 0.1 mm), 30 × 0.7-mm axial slices and 4 averages (scan duration = 10 min).\n11. Drag the localizer to the scan queue. Press Continue on the bottom of the queue to start the scan.\n12. When the scan is finished, drag the user protocol into the examination window. Right-click the protocol to duplicate it. Adjust the geometry in the examination window to obtain a symmetric image. Click Continue to start the scan.\n13. Repeat step 10 until the image is symmetric. Physically adjust the bed until your region of interest is in the middle of the scanned images.\n14. Before proceeding to the first high-quality scan, ensure that the signal is fine-tuned by shimming. Some receivers do this automatically; otherwise, follow the instructions for the MRI machine in use.\n15. Drag the desired T2 liver imaging protocol from the palette window into the queue. Select the finished scan protocol with the best geometry and drag it onto your new protocol. Confirm that the geometry should be copied, and press Continue.\n16. When finished with the scan, ensure that the Export to DICOM macro is enabled, and close the examination window.\n17. When the MRI scanning is finished:\n         \nQuit Paravision.\nUnplug the respiratory battery.\nTurn off the gas and isoflurane, and close the valves.\nTurn off the warm bath.\nClean the animal bed thoroughly to avoid cross-contamination.\n18. Repeat steps 1-17 for each mouse needed.",
    "19. To measure the HCC tumor volume, use the software MIPAV (Bazin et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-bib-0001]). The volume of interest (VOI) area is calculated after manual delineation of the tumor areas in each scan section. A step-by-step approach for tumor quantification can be found below and is shown in Figure 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-fig-0003]-D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-fig-0003].\n         \nDraw the tumor area with the software tool that best fits the tumor contour. The option Draw level set VOI identifies contrast differences automatically and is commonly the optimal choice but can be adjusted manually if required.\nIf the contrast difference between tumor and healthy tissue is not clear, circle the tumor manually using the Ellipse VOI or Bspline VOI function.\nCalculate the tumor volume by clicking on the drawn area, selecting View VOI Properties, and then selecting Volume in the next pop-up. Press Calculate. The tumor volume in mm3 can be found in the Output pop-up.\nLongitudinal tumor volume measurement for each mouse should be recorded in a charted format to allow the experimenter to generate growth curves illustrating the progressive increase in tumor volume through time, to compare the outgrowth of HCC based on the genetic makeup of cancer cells of interest, or to assess efficacy of treatment when applicable.\nThe number of HCC lesions/nodules will vary based on the oncogenic drivers chosen as well as within the same group of mice. The lesions can be multinodular (20-30 per liver, each measured independently using MIPAV) or show a unique HCC, based on the genetic drivers injected by HDTV. We thus suggest that 8 mice per group should be included to perform tumor volume measurement and consider the potential variability of lesion numbers.",
    "When they reach a predefined endpoint, such as clinical symptoms, treatment cessation, or endpoint tumor size (2000 mm³, defined by MRI), mice are euthanized. The required steps to collect HCC tumors and blood for all subsequent sections are presented here.\nMaterials\nHCC model mice (Basic Protocol 1)\nVirkon S (Biosecurity B.V.)\n70% (v/v) ethanol\n1× PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-rec-0019])\nComplete medium 10% (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-rec-0008])\nLaminar flow hood\nFood, cage, water, and housing material for mice\nHighly absorbent diaper for animals\nCO2 hose to supply 10% of mouse cage volume per minute\nDissection plank with pin needles\nForceps, straight/serrated (Fine Science Tools)\nTitanium Bulldog Spring Clamps (Fine Science Tools)\nScissors: straight, 8.5 cm (Fine Science Tools)\n10-ml syringes (BD Emerald)\nButterfly needles (Terumo Surflo winged infusion set, 25-G)\nEDTA blood collection tubes (Sarstedt Inc.)\n50-ml tubes\nIce\n1. Prepare a sterile laminar flow hood and clean with Virkon S and 70% ethanol. Place a clean diaper to absorb any spilled bodily fluids.\n2. Clean surgical tools thoroughly, spray all required equipment with 70% ethanol, and place them inside the flow hood.\n3. Transfer the mouse cage containing mice to be sacrificed to the hood. Transfer any littermates to a fresh cage with food, housing material, and water.\n4. Connect a CO2 hose to the IVC cage. Adjust the system so the CO2 flow rate displaces ∼10% of the cage volume per minute.\n5. After the mouse is immobile, check for any toe reflex to ensure that the mouse has been euthanatized successfully, and dislocate the neck to ensure sacrifice.\n6. Place the mouse on a dissection plate with its ventral side up. Stretch out its legs, and use pin needles to fix the mouse's limbs.",
    "7. Spray the abdomen with 70% ethanol, lift the skin with forceps, and carefully cut the skin open with scissors. Proceed with the incision from the lower abdomen up to the diaphragm and sternum, being careful not to puncture any organs. The liver should be readily visible after the initial incision is made.\n8. Hold the sternum with forceps and carefully cut the diaphragm. Hold the sternum up with a clamp to expose the heart, which will be used for blood collection and PBS perfusion.\n9. Before starting with the organ perfusion, prepare a 10-ml syringe filled with PBS and the EDTA tube for blood collection.\n10. Connect a butterfly needle to an empty 1-ml syringe. Carefully puncture the right ventricle of the heart with the needle and pull the desired volume of blood from the heart. Immediately transfer this to the EDTA tube and place it on ice.\nThe blood extracted in this section can be used for serum or plasma preparation (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0004]) or for flow cytometry if peripheral immune cell analysis is desired (see Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0006]). It is advised to draw at least 100 µl for serum or plasma preparation, and at least 50 µl for flow cytometry.\n11. Remove the blood collection butterfly needle. Place a fresh butterfly needle on a 10-ml syringe previously loaded with PBS. Carefully puncture the left heart ventricle with the needle, and gently push the plunger to start perfusing the mouse with 10 ml PBS.",
    "12. After ∼2 ml of PBS has been injected, perform a small cut with scissors of the left atrium and continue perfusing the remaining PBS. This procedure will ensure better circulation of the PBS to the peripheral organs. If the perfusion is successful, the liver should slowly decolorize after the injection of the 10 ml PBS.\n13. To macrodissect the liver, gently push the gut and stomach aside and cut the supporting connective tissues. Be careful not to damage the neighboring organs. This step is crucial, as the anatomy can be significantly disrupted with the presence of tumors, and this could compromise the sterile environment, thus contaminating further steps of the protocol.\n14. When the liver is successfully extracted, place the organ in a 50-ml tube containing 10 ml complete medium 10% on ice. This material will be used in Basic Protocols 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0005]-6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0013] and Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0010].\n15. Dispose of the mouse body and clean the flow hood, surgical tools, and dissection plank with Virkon S and 70% ethanol.",
    "Serum and plasma can be prepared using the blood samples obtained in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0003] (step 10). The choice of serum versus plasma preparation is determined ahead of time depending on the research of interest. These samples have to be prepared immediately after blood withdrawal. Serum or plasma can be divided into aliquots and stored at −80°C, and subsequently used for protein analyses as described in Alternate Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0014]. Other possible applications for these samples include measurement of the activity of hepatic enzymes (such as alanine transaminase) and the expression of HCC-related biomarkers (such as α-fetoprotein).\nMaterials\nBlood samples from HCC-bearing mice, in EDTA collection tubes (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0003], step 10)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nMicrocentrifuge, 4°C\nPreparation of plasma\n1a.

Transfer the clear supernatant solution to a fresh 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nPreparation of serum\n1b. Transfer 100 µl of the blood sample from the EDTA collection tube to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and let it rest for 15-30 min at room temperature to allow it to clot.\n2b. Centrifuge the 1.5-ml tube for 20 min at 2000 × g, 4°C.\n3b. Transfer the clear supernatant (seric phase) to a fresh 1.5-ml tube.\nStore the serum or plasma samples at −80°C for later use or, if desired, proceed to perform enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs; Alternate Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0014]). To preserve sample integrity, avoid cycles of freezing and thawing.",
    "In this section, the steps required to generate a single-cell suspension from mouse HCC samples are described, along with the necessary steps for HCC immune landscape analysis by flow cytometry. The immune context analyses described below are tailored to characterize the changes in liver immune cell subsets associated with HCC development and corresponding to the chosen genetic heterogeneity of HCC. These changes can encompass differences in cell population content, as well as distinct markers of activation, proliferation, and polarization. The single-cell preparation described in this protocol can also be used for preparing HCC cell lines (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0007]).\nNOTE: If planning to use the preparation for the isolation of HCC cell lines (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0007]), perform this procedure under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood and with sterile solutions.\nMaterials\nLiver Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi)\nHCC-bearing mouse liver (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0003], step 14)\nComplete medium 10% (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-rec-0008])\nLiver medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-rec-0017])\nFACS buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-rec-0012]), sterile, 4°C\nErylysis buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-rec-0011])\nPrimary antibodies (see Tables 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-tbl-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-tbl-0003])\nBD Brilliant Buffer stain (BD Biosciences)\n1× PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-rec-0019])\nUltraComp eBeads (Thermo Fisher), diluted 1/10 in FACS buffer\nLive/dead staining solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-rec-0016])\nFixation/permeabilization solution: 1 part eBioscience™ Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate and 3 parts eBioscience™ Fixation/Permeabilization Dilute (Invitrogen)\nPermeabilization solution: Permeabilization Buffer (10×; Invitrogen), diluted 1:10 in deionized water\ngentleMACS C-Tubes (Miltenyi)\nLaminar flow hood\n10-cm Petri dish\nForceps, straight/serrated (Fine Science Tools)\nDisposable scalpel blades (Swann Worton)\ngentleMACS Octo Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi)\n50-ml tubes\n100-µm filter (Falcon)\nCentrifuge for 15- and 50-ml tubes\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\n96-well U-bottom plates\nFlow cytometer (preferably BD Biosciences Fortessa) capable of detecting 16 fluorescent labels and with 4 lasers (violet, 405 nm; blue, 488 nm; green, 561 nm; red, 640 nm) or superior; see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-tbl-0001] for recommended configuration and fluorochromes",

Before starting the processing of HCC-bearing or control liver, prepare liver dissociation solution according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Liver Dissociation Kit in a gentleMACS C-Tube, using 200 µl enzyme D, 100 µl enzyme R, 20 µl enzyme A, and 4.7 ml DMEM per reaction. Prepare the solution immediately before use or store in 4°C for use on the same day.\nThe enzymes supplied in the commercial kit are shipped as lyophilized powders and must be reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions before the experiment. Reconstituted enzymes not used immediately can be divided separately into aliquots and stored at −20°C.\n2. In a laminar flow hood, transfer the HCC-bearing liver isolated in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.147#cpz1147-prot-0003] (step 14) to a sterile 10-cm Petri dish containing enough complete medium 10% to submerge the liver.\n3. Remove the gallbladder with forceps and a scalpel. Be careful to not burst the organ open.",
    "4. Carefully dissect the tumor with a scalpel, gently clamping the organ parts with forceps to expose the tumor nodules. The tumor may be fibrotic, mushy, or necrotic, which can interfere with the dissection procedure.\n5. Cut off several small tumor pieces with a scalpel. If more than one nodule is present, take a small piece of each nodule to account for any cancer cell or microenvironmental heterogeneity.\n6. Transfer ∼25 mg of tumor pieces to a C-Tube containing the 5 ml of liver dissociation solution from step 1. Further pipet up and down to ensure that samples are collected from the Petri dish.\n7. Place C-Tubes on the gentleMACS dissociator.

If proteins of mixed molecular weight are probed, the 4%-12% gel listed in Materials is recommended.\nThe number of wells in the gel must be chosen according to the number of samples to be loaded, the amount of protein per sample, and the total volume of sample loaded per well.
