    "Processing and culturing human cartilage tissuesCollect whole cartilage samples from surgical discards of unilateral or total knee replacements, in accordance with our approved IRB protocol.Shave cartilage off the bone using a scalpel. If desired, visual scoring can be done at this time to distinguish between grade 1-4 cartilage (for grading examples, please see Rutgers et al., 2010).Place 1-2 mm cartilage pieces in standard tissue culture treated plates in complete media overnight in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C, with 5% CO2. We generally use 15 cm2 dishes when we receive total knee replacement samples and place samples in 15-20 ml of media (or enough to cover the pieces completely). If the samples are very small, this can be scaled to 10 cm2 dishes.The following day, monitor the sample for any bacterial growth. This will show up as “sandy” looking particulates in the sample, which are observable under a light microscope. Add 10 ml of collagenase solution (1:2 ratio of collagenase solution to media) to the samples and digest overnight in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C, with 5% CO2.Strain cells through a 70 µm filter into a 50 ml tube and spin at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature (RT) to pellet the cells.Plate cells at 30,000-35,000 cells per cm2 on standard tissue culture treated plates using chondrocyte complete medium. Maintain cells at 37°C, with 5% CO2.Monitor cell growth. Passage 0 (P0) cells are usually confluent in 3-4 weeks after plating. In our experience, cells retain the best morphology when kept at high density and allowed to grow until 100% confluent. Cells retain their properties for 1-2 passages. Maintain cells in chondrocyte complete growth medium, changing the media every 3-4 days as necessary.",
    "If you want to expand the number of cells, we recommend passaging at high densities. Cells can be passaged by treating them with collagenase solution (1 ml for every 4 ml media) overnight, spinning them down and washing out the collagenase with 1× PBS, and replating cells at 30,000-35,000 cells per cm2 on standard tissue culture treated plates.Incorporating labels for live/dead screening and proliferationBefore starting:Chill one bottle of PBS to 4°C and keep on ice and place another at RT.Thaw a new 0.25% Trypsin aliquot to RT.Chill the centrifuge to 4°C.Chill low-barium PBS (see Recipes and Notes sections) and cell staining media (CSM) to 4°C and keep on ice.Add Idu directly into existing cell media to a final concentration of 25 µM. Place cells in the 37°C incubator for 15 min.Wash out Idu with cold, sterile PBS, performing a minimum of two washes. Extra cell washes will help remove dead cells.Make a 0.5 µM cisplatin mix in RT PBS (final concentration); for a 10 cm2 plate, add ~5 ml or enough to cover the bottom of the plate.Add the 0.5 µM cisplatin mix directly to washed, aspirated cells on the dish and incubate for 5 min at RT.Wash cells twice with complete media.Harvesting cultured chondrocytesWash the cells with RT PBS.Add 10 ml (or enough to cover your plate surface) of 0.25% trypsin and incubate for 10-15 min in the 37°C cell incubator (monitor plates to see when the cells lift).Neutralize the enzyme using complete media at a 1:1 ratio with the trypsin.Collect the cells from the plate by transferring to a 50 ml conical tube, washing off any remaining cells with RT PBS, and spin at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Wash cells twice with 2 ml of cold PBS to remove excess trypsin.",
    "Between each wash, strain the cells through a 35 µm filter (for example, the ones on the FACS tubes) to make a single-cell suspension. Expect large cell losses here. We normally perform these experiments in 10 cm2 dishes. Before filtration, we expect to collect between 3-4 million chondrocytes. After filtration, this can range between 1-2 million chondrocyte singlets.Count cells using a hemocytometer or equivalent equipment. We count using the 4-square average approach, where total cells/ml = average number of cells counter in 4 squares × dilution factor × 104. Keep cells on ice for the fixation protocol.(Optional) Take 10,000-50,000 cells for RNA extraction to do quality controls on the samples. RNA can be isolated using standard column kits. After cDNA generation (following the manufacturer’s specifications), each sample should be checked for its Col2a1/Col1a1 ratio, and in the case of OA cartilage, for Mmp 3, 9, and 13 expression using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Relative expression can be calculated using the standard delta delta CT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). To ensure samples are not dedifferentiated, the ratio of Col2a1/Col1a Ct values should be >1, although the exact ratio for each sample will vary. In our hands, Mmp expression is anywhere between 10-10,000 fold higher in OA cartilage than in healthy cartilage (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4086/bioprotoc-11-14-4086-g002.jpgFigure 2. Quality control for cartilage samples and cyTOF data. A. Representative values of MMP3, MMP9, and MMP13 expression from 5 healthy (blue) and 20 OA cartilage samples (black). The values plotted are normalized with actin as a housekeeping gene and relative to one normal cartilage sample. Col2a1 and Col1a1 expression is shown as a ratio. All samples retaining a chondrogenic phenotype should have a Col2a1/Col1a1 ratio >1. Data is re-analyzed from the same patients as in Grandi et al. (2020). B.",
    "EU control bead signal before and after run time normalization. This can help to normalize samples internally (over the run time) and between runs, as shown here. C. Dot plot of two healthy cartilage samples, showing expression of SOX9 and CD44, as measured by cyTOF. Expression on each axis is arcsine transformed, and a representative gate is shown, although this will vary with the signal-to-noise ratio of each run. On the left is an example of a high-quality sample where >74% of the live-cell (i.e., cisplatin negative) events have staining for both SOX9 and CD44. On the right is an example of a low-quality sample that was not included in downstream analyses, where <2% of the live cell events were inside the SOX9/CD44 gate. D. A histogram of SOX9 cell expression is plotted for the same cartilage sample profiled on two different temporarily separated batches (orange and blue). The left graph depicts the samples before normalization; note that, while the sample is exactly from the same patient, the intensities look different. The graph on the right depicts the same set of samples but after normalization, when staining intensities are comparable.Preparing single-cell suspensions and fixing chondrocyte samplesResuspend 0.5-1 million cells in 1 ml of Cell Fixation Solution (900 µl of PBS and 100 µl of 16% PFA, for a final 1.6% concentration) in a FACS tube. Always open a new ampule for precious samples, as the PFA degrades quickly with time. Ensuring a homogenous single-cell suspension is key; otherwise, cell clumps will be fixed together. Fixation can be scaled up or down if you have more or fewer cells.Incubate cells for 10 min at RT.Wash twice with 4 ml of CSM. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and store pellet in <100 μl of CSM at -80°C.",
    "Samples can be stored this way for years, with minimum quality loss. Our lab has profiled samples up to three years after collection. To avoid freeze/thaw cycles, we suggest that you aliquot samples in small amounts. Generally, 0.5-1 million cells per sample are necessary for the average barcoded cyTOF run.(Optional) Barcoding multiple samples with the Fluidigm’s Cell-ID 20-plex Pd Barcoding KitThis barcoding step is only necessary if you want to run multiple samples as a single batch run and combine all your samples. We recommend this if looking at multiple conditions, as it minimizes batch staining effects.Thaw frozen cells on ice.Wash cells twice with 4 ml of RT barcoding permeabilization buffer (included in the Cell-ID 20-plex barcoding kit).Resuspend each sample in 800 µl of RT barcoding permeabilization buffer. Make sure that you have equal numbers of cells in the samples you are comparing. For chondrocytes, we aim for 0.5-1 million cells per patient or condition.Resuspend each barcoded sample in 100 µl of RT barcode permeabilization buffer and transfer to the appropriate sample. Mix immediately by pipetting up and down five times. Record which barcode goes with which sample.Incubate samples for 30 min at RT.Centrifuge samples for 5 min at 500 × g at 4°C. Wash twice with 2 ml of CSM.Combine all cells into a single tube.Extracellular and intracellular stainingIf you have barcoded cells (from section E), skip to step 3.If you do not have barcoded cells:Thaw frozen cells on ice.Wash cells twice with 2 ml of CSM.Filter cells through the 35 μm strainer cap of a FACS tube and count the total number of cells. This value will be used to calculate the amount of antibody to use.",
    "Pellet the cells for 5 min at 500 × g at 4°C right before resuspending them in the antibody cocktail (see below).Prepare a surface antibody cocktail in cell staining media according to the total number of cells in the tube and the titration concentrations of your antibodies (see Notes for titration considerations). Try to keep the volume below 500 μl. Consistency between runs is more important; therefore, stain all iterations in the same volume. For more details about the staining protocol, please see Leipold and Maecker (2015) and Lin et al. (2015).Stain cells on ice for 30 min (or longer if necessary, depending on your conditions).Wash cells three times with 1 ml of CSM, spinning them down for 5 min at 500 × g at 4°C.Permeabilize cells by resuspending them in 100% methanol. For chondrocytes, we recommend you vortex the cells gently (on the lowest setting on our Vortex Genie 2; this is setting #1) as you add in the methanol drop wise; otherwise, cells tend to precipitate in a clump. Allow cells to permeabilize for 10 min at RT, vortexing gently as necessary to keep them in solution.Quench the permeabilization reaction with 2 ml of CSM and spin down cells for 5 min at 500 × g at 4°C.Prepare the intracellular antibody cocktail in cell staining media according to the total number of cells in the tube and the titration concentrations of your antibodies. For more details about the staining protocol, please see Leipold and Maecker (2015) and Lin et al. (2015).Stain cells on ice for 30 min.Wash three times with 2 ml of CSM, spinning them down for 5 min at 500 × g at 4°C each time.Resuspend cells in 1 ml of CSM with Cell-ID Intercalator.",
    "Stained cells are stable for up to one week after staining if stored at 4°C. We typically stain the night before running the cyTOF and leave the cells in 1× intercalator and 4% PFA overnight at 4°C.Data acquisitionAcquire data on a cyTOF machine according to the manufacturer’s specifications for the instrument. We find that using the supersampler works better for chondrocytes than direct injection, as the cells are large and oblong and tend to settle in the tubing if not continuously agitated.Determine the cell number to acquire based on the estimated abundance of your population(s) of interest.Right before the run, resuspend cells in dH2O with EQ beads diluted 1:10."
