  "procedures": [
    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.\n1. Placing a laryngeal mask\nSelect appropriately sized SGA (newborn size 1 [2-5 kg]).\nOpen the SGA. Remove the pack that holds the device.\nOpen the pack. Transfer the SGA to the lid of the pack.\nHolding the integral bite block, apply a thin coat of lubricant to the back, sides, and the front of the SGA.\n\t\nCheck for boluses of lubricant and remove them if necessary.\nTake care to avoid contact with the cuff of the device.\nInspect the device carefully.\n\t\nCheck for foreign bodies or a bolus of lubricant obstructing the distal opening, and return the SGA into the cage pack.\nAlways wear gloves.\nDecompress the stomach with an orogastric tube as needed.\nRemove the SGA from the container.\nHold the lubricated SGA firmly.\nStand at the baby's head. Position the device such that the cuff outlet is facing the chin of the baby. Ensure that the baby is in the 'sniffing' position with the head extended and the neck flexed. Gently open the mouth and press down on the chin before proceeding.\nPress the leading soft tip into the mouth against the baby's hard palate on the top of the baby's tongue. Maintain pressure against the palate.\n\t\nAdvance the device inward to follow the contour of the mouth and palate with a continuous but gentle slide until resistance is felt.\nArrange the tip of the airway into the upper esophagus, positioning the cuff against the laryngeal framework.\n2. Confirming correct placement\nAttach the carbon dioxide (CO2) detector and connect it to the PPV device.\nAfter the correct placement, ensure that there is a bilateral chest movement with ventilation and hear equal breath sounds.",
    "If this intervention is successful, notice an increase in heart rate and oxygen saturation.\nBy the time of providing 8-10 breaths, ensure that the CO2 detector turns yellow as it detects exhaled CO2.\n3. Anchoring the laryngeal mask\nSecure the SGA down from maxilla to maxilla with tape.\nMonitor heart rate, oxygen saturation, breathing, and muscle tone. The newborn can cry and make sounds with the SGA in place.\n4. Removing the laryngeal mask\nIf one decides to remove the laryngeal mask, use bulb suction or suction catheter to remove secretions from the mouth and throat.\nThen, remove the SGA device.\nMonitor heart rate, breathing, and oxygen saturation.\nSubscription Required.
