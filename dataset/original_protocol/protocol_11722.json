  "procedures": [
    "Procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Utah State University for studies on human subjects. Care should be taken that IRB procedures are approved by the host institution and considerations regarding the protection of human subjects should take place prior, during, and after performance of any aspect of this protocol. As per IRB regulations, involvement of external parties or companies in the data collection and analysis processes must follow proper protocols to de-identify participant information and protect the confidential nature of the data.\n1. Selection of Participants and Activities to Test\nSelect student participants at the middle of the semester or 3 months after a desired course content was presented by the professor to diminish any short-term memory recollections from the participants.\nExclude any participants from a laboratory study that parallels this work if the participant has a: (a) history of pre-determined condition (e.g. arrhythmia) or metabolic disorder; (b) left-handedness or ambidextrous ability (this can interfere with physiological sampling); (c) psychological history (current or past) or history of behavioral or emotional disorder (this can skew the collection from the self-reports); (d) medical history for heart, metabolic, or cognitive disorders; (e) physical disability that would prevent participation in the laboratory sessions of the study; and (f) traumatic brain injury. Female participants wishing to be part of the hormonal study have additional restrictions explained in step 2.5.\nRecruit according to established Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols by including detailed procedures and restrictions about protection of confidentiality.",
    "NOTE: If a company will have access to the data, (in this case salivary samples and galvanic skin response data were collected from third party companies) ensure that an agreement is in place for proper handling of data (e.g., time for refrigeration), sharing (e.g., security of server), and include a timeline to destroy the data (e.g., one year after publication of data). Include these guidelines in your IRB application and follow proper guidelines as required by the IRB organization within your institution.\nSelect course activities that represent the complexity of knowledge and tasks that students need to perform in.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, freshmen engineering students were selected due to the difficult and complex nature of the course content. The activities that were deemed representative were a combination of two types of engineering problems from two commonly used engineering exams: the Mental Cutting Plane Test (MCT) and the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test (PSVT-R). MCT looks at two-dimensional cut sections that corresponds to a three-dimensional object24 while PSVT-R looks for three-dimensional rotation of an object25. Each were used to test for spatial performance and verbal memory for this student population26, 27.\n2. Prior to the Laboratory Session\nHost an orientation for the volunteer participants at least 1 - 2 weeks prior to the laboratory session. Clarify all terms from the IRB informed consent. Perform a demonstration of the use and fitting of the galvanic skin sensor and proper data collection procedures for salivary hormone collection, according to the manufacturer protocols28. Explain the risks and benefits of the study.",
    "Establish a calendar that participants can enroll in. If participants are enrolling in the salivary biomarker piece of the study, be sure to establish times during the morning before breakfast as cortisol levels are lowest at this time of day and include any disclosures for enrolling in the allotted times (see step 2.5 for more information).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that all participants provide at least three available time slots for the study. Accommodate participants in a randomized fashion to minimize biases and provide more statistically valid results.\nPre-fit the galvanic wrist sensor for each volunteer by ensuring that the sensor straps secure the participant's wrist during the orientation session. Enter the participant study ID code and the unique wrist sensor bar code provided by the supplier to ensure consistency for follow-up laboratory sessions if needed.\nSend a reminder to the participants of the procedures and restrictions for data collection and pre-conditions prior to the day of sampling, according to manufacturer protocols28.\n\tNOTE: Examples of procedures and restrictions can include: (a) no food, dietary or energetic products, or sugary drinks during diurnal collections or at least 1 hr prior to the study; (b) no water consumption 1 hr prior to data collection; (c) no teeth brushing or mouth rinses; (d) no chemical products (e.g., hand lotions, creams, chapsticks, perfumes, dyes) in the required contact areas (e.g., wrists, face, lips); (f) no hair products or styling; and (g) no physical activities (e.g., brisk walking, cycling, running, weights) 24 hr before the study.\nFor female participants, collect salivary samples between 10 - 12 days after the first day of the participant's menstrual period to minimize hormonal fluctuations during salivary collection28.",
    "NOTE: During the stated time period, if female participants are taking any form of hormone-based treatment such as any birth control pills, intrauterine devices, creams or sprays (oral, topical, or vaginal), sublingual and troches, patches, films, injections, allow 12 - 36 hr to pass from the time of ingestion/application to allow the treatment effects to level off. The timeline required to collect salivary samples will vary by the biomarker and the specifications of the company's salivary kit. Galvanic skin response collection is done according to Section 3.2 for female participants. Male participant salivary collection is done according to Section 3.1.5.1 and galvanic skin response according to Section 3.2.\n3. Day of Laboratory Session\nNOTE: The following procedures are presented in recommended order of data collection under the assumption that 1 - 2 researchers are involved. However, some of these procedures could be run in parallel if more than 2 researchers are collaborating in the study.\nSalivary Biomarkers\nProvide participants with a checklist to outline physical activities exerted during the 24 hr period prior to the study (e.g., physical activity, food and drink consumption, use of lotions or hormone based products) as described in the manufacturer protocol28(see step 2.4 and 2.5).\n\t\tNOTE: If a participant has performed any or all of the activities from the checklist, re-assign the participant to meet at another day. If water consumption was the only restriction not met, ask the participant to stay an extended time in the study to allow an appropriate time, according to manufacturer guidelines, to pass (~ 1 hr) before salivary collection occurs.\nAsk the participants to fill out the health information checklist provided by the saliva assay kit28. Ensure that all salivary vials are pre-labelled and time stamped before and after the laboratory sessions.",
    "NOTE: Salivary cortisol has a reactivity of approximately 20 min19,20 and as such, spit collection procedures should be done within this timeframe. Follow spit collection procedures according to step 3.1.5 and manufacturer guidelines28.\nKeep a copy of the health information checklist and shipping information for future record-keeping, tracking, and further analysis. Be sure to follow IRB protocols and procedures during storage of checklist items. Complete a timeline of the laboratory activities, personnel, and collection vials for each participant.\nEnsure that all participants and researchers handling salivary samples are wearing aseptic gloves at all times to minimize cross-contamination.\nWhen collecting spit, instruct the participant to pool saliva in the tip of the participant's lips before spitting into the vial to minimize bubble formation that may affect accuracy of results, according to manufacturer instructions28.\n\t\t\nInstruct participants to not touch the tip of the vial with the participant's lips or fingers as this can introduce contamination to the sample (spit vial method). To encourage salivary production, recommend to the participant to smell a citrus fruit such as a lemon or head tilt forward to speed up formation of saliva.\nStore all collected salivary samples -20 oC for up to 7 days if analysis of these samples will not occur immediately. Longer storage (up to 30 days) will require samples to be stored at -80 oC.\nTo ship the frozen samples to a third party company, have a sealed foam box containing dry ice ready and an airtight and sealed copy of the health information sheet pre-filled by the participant. Make sure that participants place their unique study ID code in the identifier section of the sheet to prevent private information to be sent to the company.",
    "When ready, ship the vials to the company for analysis of biomarker for the Salivary Profile 1: Testosterone, Progesterone, DHEA, Cortisol, and Estradiol. Analysis of biomarkers was carried out by the manufacturer according to established protocols28. Place samples in an immunoassay plate reader and read the sample optical density at a wavelength of 450 nm.\n\t\tNOTE: All biomarkers require a solid-phase, competitive enzyme immunoassay. A fixed amount of the conjugated biomarker competes for the binding sites with an antibody that corresponds to each biomarker. After incubation, unbound components are washed away and an enzyme substrate solution is added, forming a color representative to the biomarker. For example, progesterone begins with a blue color and upon reacting with the enzyme becomes yellow.\nGalvanic Skin Response\nClean the galvanic skin sensors with prepackaged sterile 70% alcohol wipes or a sterile gauze containing a small amount of 70% isopropanol to remove residues from prior participants. Clean the device before and after every data collection session or participant, whichever comes first.\nOne hour before the study session, remind participants to clean and dry their hands.\n\t\tNOTE: Collection of salivary samples in combination with the galvanic skin response will require that collections time points are considered. For example, cortisol salivary collection should be collected within 20 min (step 3.1.2) while galvanic skin sensors need to be fitted and calibrated with 5 - 10 min as described in step 3.2.6.\nPlace a new or clean sports wrist band in the non-dominant writing wrist of the participant before installing the galvanic skin response sensor. Allow the participant to wear the wrist band for 1 hr prior to collecting data.\n\t\tNOTE: The sports wrist band should be pre-labelled according to the unique wrist ID to avoid cross-contamination between participants",
    "After 1 hr, remove the sport wrist band and place the galvanic skin sensor. Ensure that the galvanic skin sensor touches the median nerve of the wrist to ensure proper collection of pulse and heart rates. Unite the bands together in the sensor to ensure a tight fit on the wrist.\nPress the galvanic skin sensor indicator light. Wait until the light turns from red to green to white; a white color indicates that data collection has started.\nAsk the participant to wear the galvanic wrist sensor for a set period of time (5 - 10 min) with no physical movement from the non-dominating wrist to calibrate and collect baseline tonic data.\n\t\tNOTE: A baseline data will be found when the galvanic skin response data levels off and no spikes or noise is longer visible. Check the manufacturer software using the assigned account by the manufacturer. Open a session and verify that data is being collected29.\nStart a slide presentation containing representative and time stamped problem sets for each of the exams activities described in section 1.5. Ask the participant to record the times after completing each slide to allow for timestamps between the collected GSR data and the events to be compared.\nPeriodically check that the galvanic skin sensor lights are white and verify that data is being collected.\n\t\tNOTE: Sampling rate of the sensors presented in this work was based on manufacturer specifications and capabilities (rate of 8 Hz with a low electrical current of 1100 mAh).Galvanic response through electrodermal activity (EDA) was reported in microSiemens (µS) as tonic (baseline responses to an exam event or self-report/interview question) and phasic (acute, immediate response to an exam event or self-report/interview question, above a certain µS threshold).",
    "Have handy a replacement battery and sensor, in case data collection problems occur during the session. At the end of the session, press the indicator light until it is turned off. Carefully remove the wrist sensor and wipe it with alcohol.\nRetrieve the data from the manufacturer software29. Log in to the account and click on Sessions. Select the date of the study and click on the Download tab. Download the data in .csv file for easy use.\nTrack timelines of the events in the study. Download the data in the wrist sensor software session. Download data as a UNIX epoch time, which is the number of seconds that has elapsed since January 1, 1970 (not counting leap seconds). Convert the UNIX time to a GMT time zone if timelines need to be tracked in the data using an open source timestamp converter30. To convert this time, simply convert the time in the data sheet using this conversion (1 year = 365.24 days = 31556926 sec).\nRetrieve electrodermal data in wrist sensor software session. Click View on any of the desired sessions. Present the data as real-time or select by a set period of time by the researcher.\nSelf-report Survey and Emotional Inquiries\nBefore and after the slides, provide a pre- and post- survey.During the second collection point (end of the exam), collect the final salivary sample and then provide the self-report while collecting EDA data. Record all time points.\n\t\tNOTE: This study used a modified Topics in Emotion scale developed by Broughton and colleagues31.\nWhile wearing the galvanic skin sensor, ask the participants questions that paralleled the self-report.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep in mind that timelines need to be considered if you are collecting salivary samples as indicated in step 3.1.2 and 3.3.3.",
    "As possible, record the date and time for cross-checking of GSR data and its alignment with the timing of the self-reported responses in a laboratory notebook. In addition, include instructions in the slide show presentation explaining to the participants to annotate the time after completing the required instructions after each slide to enable cross-comparison of timed events with the GSR data.\nEnsure that the computer based software has consistent instructions and that each slide is clearly labelled. If keystroke setups are needed for the study, indicate in the slide instructions what keystroke should be pressed in each slide.\nWrap-Up Activities\nAfter collecting all the information, remove the wrist sensor and turn off the sensor data in reverse order to step 3.2.5. Guide the participants to a designated room offering food, beverage, drinks, and provide receipts for a future monetary compensation (if it was stated in the IRB consent form) for participation in the study.\nFollow-up the activity with an emailed notification of gratitude for participation and include available timeslots for discussion of the results with the participants.\nSubscription Required.
