    "In this work, a wall-mounted prolate hemispheroid, i.e. a model vocal fold polyp, is positioned on the test section floor of a suction type wind tunnel with a 5:1 contraction ratio. Unsteady, three-dimensional flow separation and its effect on the wall pressure loading are investigated using oil-flow visualization, wall pressure measurements, and particle image velocimetry. The unsteady pressure measurements are acquired using a sixteen channel scanning pressure transducer with piezoresistive pressure sensors. The pressure sensors have a frequency response of 670 Hz. Static pressure taps formed from stainless steel tubulations are flush-mounted upstream and downstream of the model vocal fold polyp to facilitate the surface pressure measurements and short-plumbed to the scanning pressure device. Oil-flow visualization and surface pressure measurements cannot be acquired simultaneously because oil would flow into the pressure taps causing fouling.\nThe following section provides the protocol for setting up and acquiring oil-film visualization and surface pressure measurements around a wall mounted prolate hemispheroid. Although phase-averaged and time resolved particle image velocimetry measurements are being acquired, the PIV acquisition is not included in this protocol. The authors suggest the references by Raffel et al.36 and Adrian and Westerweel39 for an in depth understanding of PIV experimental setup, data acquisition, and data processing.\n1. Generate Protuberance (i.e. Model Polyp)\nBuild a three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) model with the desired geometry. Generate the model vocal fold polyp as a prolate hemispheroid measuring 5.08 cm long, 2.54 cm wide, and 1.27 cm tall. Mount a 2.54 cm square base that is 0.64 cm thick to the bottom of the model vocal fold polyp. This base will be used to anchor the model to the test section floor.",
    "Export the 3D CAD model as a stereolithography (STL) file. The STL file format generates the model surface as a series of triangles. Choose an adequate resolution to ensure a smooth surface on the model polyp. A resolution of at least 600 dots/in is recommended.\nUpload the STL file into the appropriate software and print the STL file using a high resolution three-dimensional printer or rapid prototyper with a build layer resolution of at least 20 μm.\nThe wind tunnel test section is approximately 30.48 cm x 30.48 cm x 121.92 cm with a removable bottom plate as shown in Figure 1. Mill a 2.54 cm square hole approximately 0.85 cm deep into the wind tunnel test section floor removable plate to mount the model vocal fold polyp for testing. The hole should be located in the center of the test section width and be located at the desired downstream location for testing.\n2. Oil-flow Visualization Preparation\nIn order to prepare the test section, cover the test section surface inside of the wind tunnel with white adhesive paper. Carefully place and smooth the adhesive paper to ensure that the test section floor has no bumps due to air bubbles or creases in the adhesive paper. Cut a hole in the adhesive paper above the square hole in the test section floor for the model polyp anchor to attach to the test section wall.\nInsert the protuberance (model vocal fold polyp) into the anchor position to prepare for testing. See Figure 1.",
    "Mount a high resolution camera above the wind tunnel test section. Focus the camera for the chosen field of view including the model polyp and surrounding test section area. Set the camera acquisition parameters for testing. A video setting should be used to capture the transient portion of the oil-flow visualization or if unsteady or pulsatile flows are of interest.\nPrepare the flow-visualization oil mixture by combining baby oil, copy toner powder, and kerosene in a 7:1:2 ratio by volume. For example: combine 35 ml baby oil, 5 ml copy toner powder, and 10 ml kerosene. Mix the baby oil and toner powder together in a container and stir until the toner is completely dissolved. Then add the kerosene and mix well.\nTransfer the mixture to a spray bottle for easy application to the test section surface.\n3. Oil-flow Visualization Measurements\nClean and dry the test section surface before each application of the oil mixture.\nUse the spray bottle filled with the oil mixture to spray a thin, even layer of fluid over the section of interest. A thin, even oil mixture layer is important for producing proper oil-film visualization images.\nInitiate the image or video acquisition on the camera. Begin the camera acquisition before the wind tunnel is powered on in order to capture the initial transient oil mixture motion.\nSet the suction wind tunnel to the desired velocity. The oil mixture will begin to flow along the test section surface.\nOnce the oil mixture stops flowing and has reached a steady state (i.e. the patterns are stationary), or when the desired time has elapsed, stop the camera recording and power down the wind tunnel.",
    "Note: Video 1 displays the oil-mixture flowing until a steady state is reached and the skin friction pattern becomes stationary. In the video the flow is moving from left to right.\n4. Surface Pressure Measurement Preparation\nPrepare the test section floor surface (removable plate) by drilling holes for mounting stainless steel tubulations (0.16 cm outer diameter and 2.54 cm long) into the test section floor to build static pressure taps. Starting at the midline of the anchor position of the prolate hemispheroid, drill the holes on a grid that spans 8.89 cm in the spanwise direction and 22.86 cm downstream with 1.27 cm spanwise grid spacing and 2.54 cm downstream grid spacing (see Figure 1). The stainless steel tubulations have a bulge on one end for attaching flexible tubing and are straight on the other end for mounting.\n\tNote: The static pressure taps can be positioned at closer intervals for a finer grid of pressure acquisition locations.\nMount the tubulations surrounding the anchor position of the wall mounted prolate hemispheroid (i.e. model vocal fold polyp) in the desired configuration on the test section floor to prepare for testing. The tubulations should be mounted flush with the test section floor.\nAttach pieces of short flexible tubing (6.35 cm length, 0.159 cm inner diameter, 0.475 cm outer diameter clear polyvinyl chloride tubing) from the mounted stainless steel tubulations to the scanning pressure transducer measurement ports. The scanning pressure transducer has sixteen pressure ports.\n5. Surface Pressure Measurement Acquisition\nConnect the scanning pressure transducer to a computer and configure the acquisition parameters using the scanning pressure transducer software. Set the acquisition software to acquire data at 500 Hz for the desired duration of data acquisition.",
    "Note: Data was acquired at the maximum sampling rate of the scanning pressure transducer, 500 Hz, due to the small pressure variations at low oscillation frequencies.\nSet the suction wind tunnel to the desired velocity.\nBegin pressure measurement acquisition. The pressure measurements may be acquired simultaneously with any desired flow diagnostic technique (e.g. PIV, laser Doppler anemometry, hot wire anamometry, etc.)\nSubscription Required.
