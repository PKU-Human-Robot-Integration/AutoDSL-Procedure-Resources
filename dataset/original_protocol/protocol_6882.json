    "Obtain approval for the animal use protocol from the affiliated institutionThe animal experiments must follow guidelines and policies set forth by the facility Animal Care Committee in accordance with relevant government legislation.Experimental setup and co-registration of MRI and the FUS systemThe experimental setup of the FUS system is illustrated in Figure 1A to 1D.Mount the ultrasound transducer to the arm of the motorized positioning system and immerse it into the degassed and deionized water tank.Establish connections between the components of the FUS system (see Figure 1A).Place the MR-compatible sled to be spatially registered on the plate over the water bath.Position the transducer underneath the polyimide membrane fixture. Sonicate using continuous mode at 0.5 W and position the transducer focus at the water surface tank to produce a small cone-shaped fountain of water.Tape the focus finding marker at the transducer focus. Turn off the output of the function generator.Place the sled into the MRI scanner and perform a three-axis localizer scan of the focus finding marker. Using the FUS Instruments software, input the MRI spatial coordinates of the marker to co-register the transducer positioning system with the imaging system. In Xhima et al. (2020), a FLASH tripilot sequence with TE/TR = 3 ms/200 ms, slice thickness = 1 mm, and in-plane resolution = 0.23 × 0.23 mm was performed to acquire MR images.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4056/bioprotoc-11-12-4056-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "The mouse must be warmed to dilate the tail vein for successful catheterization. Pre-warm the home cage under a forced-air warming blanket at 38°C for approximately 30 min prior to anesthesia and keep the mouse on a warm water pad while anesthetized during catheterization.Use aseptic technique for tail vein catheterization in a Class IIA2 biosafety cabinet.Place the mouse in an induction chamber and anesthetize using isoflurane (5%) with oxygen carrier gas (flow rate = 1 L/min).When the animal is anesthetized, remove it from the induction chamber and gently fit the nose cone. Set the isoflurane vaporizer to 2% (or dose to effect).Apply lubricant eye ointment to prevent the eyes from overdrying. Re-apply as needed.Clean the tail with an alcohol prep pad.Prime a 26 G angiocatheter with heparinized saline, then insert it into the tail vein. Remove the guiding needle from the catheter and secure the catheter injection cap.Flush heparinized saline through the catheter to confirm correct placement within the tail vein. Back pressure indicates improper placement.Add structural support to the catheter by securing a rigid structure along the long axis of the tail (e.g., the narrow wooden dowel of a cotton-tipped applicator) with medical tape.Remove fur on the dorsal surface of the head (from the eye line to the neck) with an electric hair trimmer and depilatory cream.Wash the depilatory cream with mild detergent and warm water. Wipe the skin with gauze and an alcohol swab.Determine the body weight of the mouse to calculate the volume of injectables.MRIgFUS-mediated BBB permeability in the basal forebrainAn experimental timeline of the procedure is illustrated in Figure 2A.Apply ultrasound gel to the Kapton polyimide window on the MR-compatible sled and position the anesthetized mouse in the supine position on the sled.",
    "Ensure there is an unobstructed path for the ultrasound to propagate from the transducer, through the Kapton polyimide window, to the murine brain. Attach the nose cone to plastic tubing connected to the anesthesia machine using isoflurane (1-1.5% or dose to effect) with medical air carrier gas (flow rate = 1 L/min). Secure the head to the MR-compatible sled with medical tape to minimize movement during the procedure. Movement of the head during the procedure will reduce the accuracy of FUS targeting.Cover the body of the mouse with a heated saline bag to maintain core temperature during the procedure (see Figure 1D).Place the mouse secured on the sled into the MRI scanner and acquire images of the brain for target planning (tripilot, axial T1-weighted, and axial T2-weighted sequences; see Figure 2B and 2C). In Xhima et al. (2020), RARE T1-weighted images were obtained with TE/TR = 10 ms/500 ms, RARE factor = 2, averages = 3, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, number of slices = 5, and in-plane resolution = 0.25 × 0.25 mm. RARE T2-weighted images were obtained with TE/TR = 75 ms/4,000 ms, RARE factor = 10, averages = 4, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, number of slices = 5, and in-plane resolution = 0.25 × 0.25 mm.In the FUS Instruments software, select target spots in the basal forebrain from the T2-weighted scan (Figure 2B). The medial septum/vertical diagonal band of Broca (MS/VDB) are targeted with one focal spot. The nucleus basalis/horizontal band of Broca (NBM/HDB) are targeted with two focal spots. The lateral ventricle is used as the MRI-visible anatomical landmark to position the medial focal spot on the appropriate axial MR image. The lateral foci are positioned according to the stereotaxic coordinates from a mouse neuroanatomical atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2012).",
    "Position the sled on the FUS system. Perform the sonication using the following FUS parameters: 1.68 MHz frequency, 10 ms burst length, 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency, 120 s duration, and 1% duty cycle. The parameters for passive cavitation detection are 20 MHz sampling rate and 800 mV input range. An acoustic feedback control algorithm, similar to the one described by O’Reilly and Hynynen (2012), is used to calibrate peak negative pressure (PNP) based on the in vivo microbubble response. In brief, starting PNP is set to 250 kPa (measured in water without skull attenuation) and increased incrementally every second by 25 kPa. Definity microbubbles are delivered 10 s following the start of sonication to collect baseline acoustic emissions. Once the magnitude of acoustic emissions at 0.5ƒ passes 3.5 times the baseline level at each target, the sonicating pressure is dropped by 75% and maintained at this level for the remainder of the sonication.To prepare Definity microbubbles, allow the vial to reach room temperature prior to activation. Shake the Definity vial in the Vialmix device for 45 s. Use a blunt-fill 18 G needle with a 1 ml syringe to slowly draw 0.5 ml of microbubbles from the vial. Immediately before sonication, add 0.02 ml of microbubbles to 0.98 ml saline in a 1 ml syringe and gently combine until evenly mixed. Use a blunt-fill 18 G needle to slowly inject 1 ml/kg of the microbubble dilution through the tail vein catheter 10 s after the sonication begins, then inject a 0.15 ml saline flush.Inject the desired therapeutic agent, followed by a 0.15 ml saline flush through the catheter immediately after the burst that triggers subharmonic emissions so that the first pass of the drug enters the focal volume following BBB permeability enhancement.Prepare a dilution of Gadovist with 0.",
    "1 ml of Gadovist in 0.9 ml of saline in a 1 ml syringe. Inject 1ml/kg of the diluted solution, followed by a 0.15 ml saline flush.Position the sled into the MRI scanner and acquire images with a T1-weighted sequence (Figure 2D).Return the mouse to the procedure room to remove the tail vein catheter. Press the puncture site with gauze until the bleeding stops. Depending on the experimental timeline, mice should be sacrificed immediately or recovered from anesthesia.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210621/20210621182238_0313.jpgFigure 2.
