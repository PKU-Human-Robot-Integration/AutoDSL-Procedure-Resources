    "1. Production of Culture\nPrepare sterile liquid media: TY10 (5 g/l tryptone, 3 g/l yeast extract, 0.44 g/l  calcium chloride dehydrate), and LB11 (10 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/  sodium chloride, pH 7).\nInoculate from a single colony: SmUW227 (S. meliloti LP-strain:  construction will be described elsewhere, strain construction details available  upon request) () into 5 ml of TY media with 50 μg/ml spectinomycin. Inoculate  the following strains into 5 ml of LB liquid media, supplementing with the  given antibiotic: E. coli DH5α12 containing pJC2, the integrase expression  plasmid, with 10 μg/ml tetracycline; E. coli MT61613, the mobilizer, with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol;  and E. coli DH5α containing pJH110, the donor cassette plasmid, with 5  μg/ml gentamicin.\nIncubate E. coli strains overnight at 37 °C  with constant shaking. Incubate S. meliloti strain at 30 °C for two days with shaking. It is possible to  obtain a S. meliloti culture  overnight with a larger inoculum (1:500 subculture of a saturated culture). \n2. Culture Preparation and Mixing\nWash 1.5 ml of culture for each strain by collecting the cell pellet by  centrifugation at 17,000 x g for 30 seconds and resuspending in 1 ml sterile  0.85% NaCl; repeat once.\nResuspend pellet in 100 μl of sterile 0.85% NaCl.\nIndividually spot 10 μl of washed culture for each strain on a plain TY  agar plate. These spots are control spots.\nAdd 40 μl of each strain excluding the E. coli DH5α12 containing pJC2 in a sterile tube, mix, and spot  120 μl of this mixture on a plain TY agar plate. This spot is the no-integrase  negative control.\nAdd 40 μl of each strain in a  sterile tube, mix, and spot 160 μl of this mixture on a plain TY agar plate.  This spot is the IMCE mating spot.",
    "Allow spots to dry in a laminar flow hood.\nSeal plates and incubate at 30 °C overnight.\n3.  Isolation of Trans-integrants\n    Streak control spots and IMCE spot onto TY agar plates  supplemented with 200 μg/ml streptomycin (SmUW227 is based on Rm1021 which  carries a mutation conferring high-level resistance to streptomycin14) and 30 μg/ml gentamicin.\nFor calculation of the IMCE efficiency, resuspend approximately ¼ of the  IMCE mating spot in 500 μl sterile 0.85% NaCl. Make 10-fold serial dilutions to  10-7. Plate dilutions 10-2 through 10-5 on TY  agar plates supplemented with 200 μg/ml streptomycin and 30 μg/ml gentamicin,  to select for trans-integrants. Plate dilutions 10-3 through 10-7  on TY agar plates supplemented with 200 μg/ml streptomycin, to select for both  trans-integrants and potential recipients, i.e. total recipients.\nFor isolation of markerless trans-integrants resuspend  approximately a quarter of the IMCE mating spot in 500 μl of sterile 0.85%  NaCl. Make 10-fold serial dilutions to 10-6. Plate dilutions 10-4  to 10-6 on four TY agar plates supplemented with 200 μg/ml  streptomycin and 200 μg/ml X-gluc.\nIncubate plates at 30 °C for 3 days.\nView RFP trans-integrants under green light (525 nm) and through a red  filter (>610 nm) 15.\nCalculate the percent IMCE efficiency as CFU of trans-integrants  compared to the CFU of total recipients. Approximately half of trans-integrants  will have undergone true cassette exchange making them white and spectinomycin  sensitive.\nTo find the markerless trans-integrants (where the donor vector does not  contain Gmr like in pJH110) screen for a white colony (an extended  incubation period, 1-2 extra days at room temperature, will enhance the  differentiation of colonies via X-gluc, this is necessary in S. meliloti SmUW227), confirm the  colony's spectinomycin sensitivity by screening on an TY agar plate without  antibiotics and an TY agar plate containing 100 μg/ml spectinomycin.",
    "4. Representative Results\nAfter three days of  incubation on TY supplemented with streptomycin and gentamicin the  control streaks should have no growth. The IMCE streak should have confluent  growth on the head streak and many colonies on the second streak, as seen in  Figure 2. The efficiency of trans-integration, expressed as the percentage of  trans-integrants to total recipients, should be in the range of 0.5%. Approximately  half of trans-integrants will be spectinomycin sensitive and white showing they  have undergone true cassette exchange. Trans-integrants containing the tester rfp donor cassette from pJH110 should display discernable RFP fluorescence when  viewed under green light (525 nm) and through a red filter (>610 nm) 15. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3698/3698fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.  Conjugation mixture illustration: Aided by the expression of the  transfer genes from pRK600, all of the plasmids are transferred randomly from  cell to cell. This transfer results in the creation of trans-integrants in the  mixture, through the LP-strain's acquisition of the two plasmids required for  IMCE, the integrase (int) helper  plasmid pJC2 and the donor plasmid pJH110. The donor cassette from the  non-replicating donor plasmid (pJH110) is exchanged via ΦC31 integrase activity  with the markers of the LP-cassette on the chromosome, resulting in the loss of  the LP-markers (Spr and uidA)  and the maintenance of the donor cassette (rfp and Gmr) in the resulting  trans-integrant.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3698/3698fig2.jpg",

E: 10-2 dilution  of mating spot resuspension on TY streptomycin-X-gluc agar showing lack of  fluorescence. F: 10-2 dilution  of mating spot resuspension on TY streptomycin-gentamicin-X-gluc agar showing  two levels of fluorescence (brighter colonies correspond to blue colonies and  have higher rfp expression presumably  due to promoter read-though from vector sequence, where colonies having  undergone true-cassette exchange contain RFP with only its immediate promoter  with no read-through from the lac promoter in the vector, which is absent.).Subscription Required.
