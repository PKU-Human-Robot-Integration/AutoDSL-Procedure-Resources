Collection of nasal inferior turbinate brushings",
    "NOTE: This section of the protocol requires a collection tube (50 mL) with nasal cell collection media, cytology brushes, tissues, and appropriate Personal Protective Equipment. Avoid brushing during an upper respiratory tract infection. There is a small risk of bleeding, which is increased if inflammation is present. If the purpose of the brushing is to obtain airway epithelial sheets for ex vivo CBF measurements brushing should occur a minimum of 6 weeks post any upper respiratory infection; ideally, more than 10 weeks post infection35.\nPrepare the nasal cell collection media (section 1) and keep the tube on ice.\nDescribe the procedure to the participant as uncomfortable. Explain that a full sensation is felt in the nostril during the brushing, similar to jumping into the ocean/pool and water rushing into the nasal passage. Advise participants that the procedure will induce the production of tears as a reflex.\nAssess which positioning is appropriate for the participant. Lay the participant in supine position if an examination couch is available since supine positioning prevents movement of the participant's head away from the brush during the procedure. Alternatively, seat the participant next to a wall, which they can press their head back against.\nInspect the nasal passage. Note septal deviation, polyps, and any other anatomical abnormalities that may affect the passage of the brush in the nasal passage and increase bleeding risk.\nClean the nose of excess mucus by asking participants to blow their nose into a tissue.\nAsk the participant to breathe through their mouth. Take a cytology brush in the dominant hand. While resting the fifth digit on the participant's chin to anchor the hand, insert the cytology brush into the participant's nasal passage (Figure 2). Insert the brush at ~45° to the participant's face to pass through the nasal meatus.",
    "Pivot the brush upright so that it is perpendicular to the participant's face. Advance the brush gently but firmly against the lateral wall of the nose beneath the inferior turbinate until it is at the mid to posterior part of the inferior turbinate.\n\tNOTE: Avoid over-insertion; if a sudden drop in resistance is felt, the nasal pharynx has been entered, and the brush should be retracted until resistance is again felt by the proceduralist.\nRotate the brush 360° up to three times. Remove the brush gently in reverse of the insertion maneuver, so cells are not dislodged from the brush.\nPlace the brush into the prepared collection tube with nasal cell collection media. Place the collection tube on ice.\nRepeat the brushing in the second nostril if the participant is agreeable/a large number of cells are required (e.g., to initiate cell culture).\n\tNOTE: The same nostril can be brushed again if there were no visible blood cells on the brush, noting, however, that the risk of bleeding is slightly increased with a second brushing in the same nostril.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63090/63090fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Collection of nasal epithelial cells. Illustration of the location of the cytology brush at the mid to posterior part of the inferior turbinate. This position is reached by inserting the brush through the nares, pivoting the brush to a 90° angle to the face and guiding the brush along the nasal passage below the inferior turbinate.

    "NOTE: This section of the protocol requires collection tube (cytology brush(es) + 1 mL of nasal cell collection media) (section 2) and 96-well flat-bottomed plate. If collecting nasal turbinate brushings for the purpose of imaging airway epithelial sheets, only use 1 mL of antibiotic-free nasal cell collection media; otherwise, epithelial sheets will be too dispersed for imaging.\nGently swirl the collection tube containing the cytology brush(es) to dislodge the airway epithelial sheets from the brush(es).\nCollect all media and cells with a P1000 pipette. Dispense 5-6 drops into a well of a 96-well flat-bottomed plate. Repeat for approximately seven wells.\nTransfer plate to the microscope as per step 7.1.4 and follow the remainder of section 7 to image cilia beat frequency.\nImage epithelial sheets (Figure 1) and not single unattached cells since it has been demonstrated that ciliary function differs between epithelial sheets and single unattached cells5.\n4. Airway epithelial cell expansion and maintenance\nAirway epithelial conditional reprogramming cell expansion culture\n\tNOTE: Collagen solution coated vessel (section 1), Irradiated mouse embryonic feeder cells (NIH-3T3), Conditional Reprogramming Cell (CRC) media (section 1), cytology brush(es) in nasal cell collection media (section 2).\n\t\nPlate irradiated feeder cells into prepared Collagen solution coated culture vessel(s) at a seeding density of 8,000 cells/cm2 at least 2 h and no more than 72 h prior to co-culture with airway epithelial cells (see36 for feeder cell culture and irradiation).\nTransfer the brushed cells in the collection tube (cytology brush(es) + nasal cell collection media) to the vortex on ice. On a low speed, vortex tube 10 s on, 10 s off (keep on ice in between) to dislodge cells from the brush(es). Vigorous vortexing may decrease cell viability. Inspect the brush(es) to check if the mucus is still adhered. If so, repeat the vortexing.",
    "Transfer the tube(s) on ice back to the biosafety cabinet. Use a serological pipette to transfer the media from the collection tube to a new tube (Tube B), leaving behind the cytology brushes. Centrifuge Tube B at 300 × g for 7 min at 4 °C.\nRemove Tube B from the centrifuge, discard the supernatant. If the mucus is visible, wash the pellet with another 5 mL of nasal cell collection media and centrifuge again.\nAdd 1 mL of CRC media to resuspend the cell pellet in Tube B. Using a 5 mL serological pipette, pass cells through a cell sieve placed on top of a 50 mL tube (Tube C) in a circular motion.\nRepeat multiple times to form a single cell suspension. Collect the residual media from the bottom of the sieve and incorporate it with the media. Discard the cell sieve.\nUsing a 5 mL serological pipette, take 1 mL of media from Tube C and transfer it into a microcentrifuge tube.\nTake 10 µL of this cell suspension and add it to the microcentrifuge tube pre-aliquoted with 10 µL trypan blue. Mix well and immediately use an automated cell counter to record cell count and viability.\nSeed the airway epithelial cells into the T25 flask pre-seeded with irradiated feeder cells.\nAirway epithelial cell maintenance and dissociation\n\tNOTE: CRC media must be warmed to 37 °C by placing it in a temperature-controlled laboratory water bath or a bead bath device before it is added to the cells.\n\t\nCheck cells under the cell culture microscope (4× objective lens) regularly for attachment, contamination, morphology, and confluence.\nChange CRC media every second day. When reprogrammed cells are observed (Figure 1) and there is no contamination present, reduce or withdraw antibiotics.",
    "When cells reach 90% confluency, use a double trypsin method32 to dissociate the cells and perform a cell count as described in step 4.1.8 (refer to Supplementary File 2 for cell dissociation and freezing).\n5. Seeding and differentiation of airway epithelial cells and maintenance of differentiated ALI models\nSeeding airway epithelial cells to permeable support inserts\n\t\nTransfer the Collagen solution coated permeable support inserts (section 1) from the CO2 incubator to the biosafety cabinet. Aspirate the Collagen solution and discard. Add 750 µL expansion medium (antibiotic-free) to the basal compartment of the permeable support inserts.\nTransfer the dissociated cells or thawed cells on ice to the biosafety cabinet. Add the volume of expansion medium needed to seed 200,000-250,000 cells in 150 µL to the apical compartment of each permeable support insert.\nBeing careful not to create bubbles; mix well to ensure the cells are homogenous and in suspension. Add 150 µL of the cell suspension to the apical side of each permeable support insert.\nResuspend the cells after seeding every three permeable support inserts to maintain a homogenous cell suspension.\nEvery second day until a confluent cell monolayer is formed (usually by Day 4 post seeding), discard the media and add fresh expansion medium warmed to room temperature (RT, 15-25 °C).\nDifferentiation of airway epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface\n\t\nWarm ALI media (antibiotic-free) to RT (15-25 °C).\nRemove the expansion medium and change to differentiation media (ALI) on both apical and basal compartments.\nAfter 2 days of culture in submerged ALI media, aspirate and discard the media.\nAdd 750 µL of ALI media to the basal compartment only to create an air-liquid interface.",
    "NOTE: If after 1 week of culture, the monolayer is not confluent and holes are still observed, cells may no longer have the capacity to expand into the void regions, consider discarding of the airway epithelial cells.\nMaintenance of differentiated ALI model and mucus removal\n\t\nChange the apical and basal media every second day until full differentiation (day 21-25 post air-liquid interface establishment).\nOnce per week, wash mucus from the apical side following steps 5.3.3-5.3.4.\nWarm PBS to RT (15-25 °C).\nAdd 200 µL of PBS to the apical compartment. Incubate in the CO2 incubator for 10 min. Use an aspiration device or pipette to remove the PBS.\n6. Three-dimensional airway epithelial organoids\nPreparations for airway epithelial organoid culture\n\t\nPlace 24-well plate(s) in a CO2 incubator to warm to 37 °C overnight.\nThaw a 10 mL vial of ECM (Table of Materials) on ice as per the manufacturer's instructions. Prepare 500 µL aliquots (one-time use) to minimize the number of freeze-thaw cycles.\n\t\tNOTE: Use ECM with protein concentration >10.5 mg/mL for the best culture outcomes is recommended. Lower concentration will accelerate the disintegration of the ECM dome and increase the occurrence of apical-facing-outwards organoids.\nUse the Airway Organoid Kit (Table of Materials) to prepare Airway Organoid Seeding Media (AOSM) and Differentiation Media (AODM) as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nPrepare airway organoid basal media as per Table 2.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nComponent,Volume\nAdvanced DMEM/F-12,500 mL\nHEPES,5 mL\nAlanyl-glutamine,5 mL\nPenicillin-Streptomycin,5 mL\nTable 2: Components of airway organoid basal media \nUse the number of live airway epithelial cells dissociated in section 4.2 to calculate how many wells can be seeded at a seeding density of 10,000 cells (see Table 3).",
    "Calculate the total volume of ECM and AOSM needed to create 1 x 50 µL of 90% ECM dome (45 µL of ECM and 5 µL of AOSM) per well.\n\tNOTE: The recommended seeding density of 10,000 cells per well is for CRC-expanded nasal epithelial cells at passage 1. Later passage cells may require higher seeding density to achieve the formation of the same number of organoids.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nNumber of wells,Number of cells,Number of domes,Vol of Matrigel ECM,Vol of AOSM\n1,\"10,000 cells\",1,45 µL x 1.1,5 µL x 1.1\n2,\"20,000 cells\",2,90 µL x 1.1,10 µL x 1.1\n5,\"50,000 cells\",5,225 µL x 1.1,25 µL x 1.1\n………,………cells,………,………µL x 1.1,………µL x 1.1\nTable 3: Calculations for seeding airway epithelial cells in ECM domes \nSeeding airway epithelial cells in ECM domes\n\tNOTE: Keep ECM on ice at all times and perform all steps involving ECM on ice, since ECM will start to solidify at temperatures >10°C.\n\t\nResuspend the airway epithelial cells dissociated in section 4.2 with the calculated volume of 90% ECM as per Table 3.\nHolding the pipette at a 90° angle (vertical) as close to the bottom of the well as possible, dispense 50 µL (to the first stop to avoid creating bubbles) of the ECM cell suspension to the center of the well. Avoid touching the wall of the well.\nIncubate plate at 37 °C for 20 min until the ECM solidifies. While the ECM is solidifying, warm AOSM to RT (15-25 °C) to prevent it from causing re-liquification and disintegration of the ECM dome upon addition.\nAdd 500 µL of warmed AOSM to each well by dispensing down the wall of the well. Do not pipette media directly onto the ECM dome.",
    "Change media every 2 days for 4-7 days. To aspirate media, tilt the plate at a 45° angle and aspirate from the bottom edge of the well away from the ECM dome.\nAfter 4-7 days, initiate organoid differentiation by adding 500 µL of AODM (15-25 °C) to each well and change media every 2 days for 7 days.\nReplating airway epithelial organoids at Day 7 of differentiation\n\tNOTE: Replating airway epithelial organoids is necessary because the edge of the ECM domes gradually disintegrate over the 2-week culture period. Airway epithelial organoids at the edge of the dome may be lost (dislodge into the media) or have apical-facing-outwards orientation when not fully embedded in ECM. The replating step also \"cleans up\" the ECM dome by removing cells/debris which does not successfully form organoids.\n\t\nAspirate the media from each well. Add 500 µL of cold airway organoid basal media (henceforth termed basal media) to each well.\nUse the P1000 pipette since this pipette tip has the largest orifice and will reduce the likelihood of organoids bursting during pipetting. Adjust the pipette to 350 µL to avoid creating bubbles, then pipette up and down gently to disrupt the ECM dome in each well. Collect all ECM/basal media into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nRinse each well with 500 µL of cold basal media. Collect the basal media containing any remaining ECM and organoids into the same 15 mL centrifuge tube as above.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Of the three layers visible following centrifuging - (1) supernatant, (2) ECM containing cellular debris (fluffy) and (3) pellet containing organoids - discard the supernatant and ECM layer and preserve the organoid pellet.",
    "Add 1 mL of cold basal media to the organoid pellet and pipette up and down gently to separate any remaining ECM. Add 6 mL of cold basal media to the tube and mix gently.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.\nIf excess ECM is still visible, repeat steps 6.3.5- 6.3.6 to perform another wash.\nResuspend the organoid pellet with an appropriate volume of 90% ECM (use AODM instead of AOSM) to plate ~30 organoids per 50 µL of the dome.\nCheck the density of organoids under the cell culture microscope (4x objective lens) after plating the first dome. If too dense, add an additional 90% ECM to achieve the desired density of ~30 organoids.\nFollow steps 6.2.3- 6.2.4 to solidify ECM and feed cells every second day with 500 µL of warmed AODM to each well for another 14 days until they reach maturity (after 21 days of differentiation) with lumen formation surrounded by inward-facing pseudostratified epithelium containing basal cells, ciliated cells, and goblet cells.\n\t\tNOTE: The airway epithelial organoids described here are terminally differentiated and cannot be passaged or cryopreserved.\n7. Imaging cilia beat frequency\nNOTE: This section of the protocol requires a live-cell imaging microscope with a heating and humidity environmental chamber, a fast frame rate (>100 Hz) scientific camera, a 20x long working distance objective, and imaging software (refer to Table of Materials for recommended equipment used in this protocol).\nMicroscope set up\n\t\nEnsure the microscope heating system is turned on and equilibrated to 37 °C. Turn on the microscope. Adjust the gas to 5% CO2 via the CO2/air gas mixer.",
    "Top up the humidity module bottle that the CO2 passes through with purified water. Set the relative humidity to 85% via the stage top controller so that the water is heated and the cells are supplied with humidified air. Equilibrate the chamber for 30 min.\nPlace the microscope plate insert into the microscope holder.\nTransfer the airway epithelial cell models from the incubator to the microscope on a heat block or thermal beads equilibrated to 37 °C to maintain the sample at a physiological temperature.\nPlace the culture plate containing the airway epithelial cell models into the microscope plate insert. Close the microscope environmental chamber.\nAllow the sample to equilibrate in the pre-warmed 37 °C, 5% CO2-filled microscope chamber for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: A shorter equilibration time may be sufficient. This can be determined by performing an experiment to identify the time required for the stabilization of CBF (refer to Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63090/63090fig03.jpg",
    "Figure 3: Stabilisation of ciliary beat frequency in live-cell imaging microscope. Dot plots of mean cilia beat frequency (CBF) in airway epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI models) following transfer into a live-cell imaging microscope with an environmental chamber. Chamber was equilibrated and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and relative humidity of 85% for 30 min prior to opening the chamber door and placing the culture plate into the microscope plate insert. Cell models were imaged for 60 min at indicated intervals. ALI models were derived from two participants with CF. Six field of view (FOV) images were acquired per ALI model. Each dot (blue) represents the mean CBF in 12-36 FOV images. Data are represented as mean ± SEM, with mean connected by a dotted line.

Select the 20x long working distance objective lens.\nAt the microscope eyepiece, focus on the cell model (~Z = 8000 µm).\nEnsure that the microscope is set up for Kohler illumination so that transmission light source bulb filaments are not focused on the sample plane, avoiding artifacts in the imaging. For this follow steps 7.1.10-7.1.13\nCompletely close the field iris diaphragm above the condenser. Slowly open the field iris diaphragm and move the condenser up/down until an octagon shape appears.\nIf the field iris diaphragm is not aligned (i.e., the octagon is not in the center of the field of view (FOV)), align it to the center using Allen keys.\nOnce the field iris diaphragm is aligned, adjust the condenser focus to bring the octagon into sharp focus.",

Click on the green play (Run) button to visualize the microscope FOV via the software. Check that the cilia are in focus and adjust if required.\nUsing the acquisition software, set up the microscope with the following settings: Filters: empty; Condenser: empty; Format: no binning; Exposure time: 0.003 s; Readout mode: rolling shutter; ROI: 512 × 512 pixels.\n\tNOTE: Exposure time is based on the highest frequency that needs to be measured since 1/exposure time must be at least twice this frequency. E.g., if the maximum physiological range of cilia beating = 30 Hz, then 1/exposure time = 60, and exposure time must be ≤ 0.016 s. ROI depends on camera frame rate specifications. Select an ROI that captures frame rates >100 Hz.\nImage acquisition\n\t\nTo acquire time-lapse images from the menu, click on Acquire and then click on Fast Time Lapse.

Using the microscope joystick, move along the X/Y axis to another FOV.\nAdjust the Z focus to bring the cilia into focus. Click on Run Now to capture another fast time-lapse.",
    "Repeat steps 7.2.3-7.2.4. For ALI models and airway organoids, image 6x FOV in each of 3x replicate samples. For airway epithelial sheets, image a minimum of 4x replicate images per participant.\n8. Data analysis and quantification of CBF\nPreparations for data analysis\n\tNOTE: This section of the protocol requires custom analysis scripts (Supplementary File 3), raw image files (acquired in section 7.2), a computing software, and analysis software.\n\t\nInstall the computing software, preferably the latest version, on the analysis computer.
