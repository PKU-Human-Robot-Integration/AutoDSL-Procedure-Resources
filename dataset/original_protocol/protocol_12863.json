    "All steps involving animals were carried out using protocols approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). No reagents used here are known to pose significant human health risks except for 5-azacytidine (5-AZA).\n1. Generating a reporter cell line with MeCP2-LUC-HR transgene on the Xi\nPreparing mouse tendon fibroblasts from a female XMeCP2-LUC-HR /XMeCP2 mouse\nEuthanize a 10-12 day-old female XMeCP2-LUC-HR/XMeCP2 mouse.\nUsing straight dissection scissors, make a circumferential incision through the skin of the proximal tail portion.\nHolding the carcass near the base of the tail, pull the skin away from the mouse to expose the fibrocartilaginous portion of the tail. Remove and cut the terminal 10 mm of the exposed tissue into 1 mm long fragments using a surgical scalpel.\nTransfer the fragmented tissue to a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 U/mL penicillin, 1 µg/mL streptomycin, and 1.5 mg/mL collagenase, pre-filtered through 0.45 µm and then 0.2 µm mesh filters. Incubate for 3-4 h at 37 °C with continuous rotation.\nCentrifuge the sample at room temperature at 500 x g for 10 min. Resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 U/mL penicillin, and 1 µg/mL streptomycin (DMEM-10) and plate on a 6-well tissue culture plate. Passage the cells once and expand to a 10 cm plate before proceeding to the next step.\nImmortalize the cells by performing a transduction with an expression vector carrying HPV-16 viral oncogenes (E6/E7), as described previously7.\nSelecting single cell clones and characterizing MeCP2 reporter expression",
    "Harvest the cells from a 10 cm plate. First, aspirate the media, add 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 2-5 min at 37 °C. Quench with 9 mL of DMEM-10 and collect the resuspended cells in a 15 mL conical tube.\nDilute the cells with DMEM-10 to a final concentration of 1 cell/100 µL. Transfer to 96-well plates by pipetting 100 µL of the suspension into each well.\nIncubate at 37 °C until the wells are confluent, which can take up to 2-3 weeks. Replace the media with fresh DMEM-10 every 3-5 days. When confluent, mobilize the cells with 20 µL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA per well and split them into two duplicate sets of 96-well plates.\nUse one set of plates to assay for luciferase activity. Use a homogeneous firefly luciferase assay kit which does not require media removal. Follow the protocol included with the kit.\nUse the results from step 1.2.4 to select clones with no detectable luciferase activity from the remaining set of plates. Expand these clones to 24-well and then 6-well plates.\nPerform the same for a clone with the highest luciferase activity; this will be used as a positive control for validation purposes.\nHarvest an aliquot of each well in the 6-well plate for a Western blot. Mobilize the cells with 200 µL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Incubate for 2-5 min at 37 °C. Quench with 2 mL of DMEM-10, and transfer half of the cells to 1.5ml centrifuge tube. Wash the cells once with PBS before lysing for Western blot. Alternatively, transfer half of the cells to another 6-well plate. When the cells attach to the bottom of the plate, rinse with PBS and lyse for Western blot.",
    "Perform a Western blot with anti-MeCP2 antibody to confirm that luciferase-negative cells express, while the luciferase-positive cells do not express wild-type MeCP2 from the active X chromosome; follow the previously described protocol8. Use brain tissue lysate from any wild type mouse as a positive control.\nPlate several negative clones at 2 x 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Treat once with 10 µM 5-AZA, incubate for 72 h without changing the media, and assay for luciferase activity as described in step 1.2.3.\nChoose one negative clone (Xi clone) that gained luciferase activity with 5-AZA and begin expanding it to multiple 10 cm plates. Freeze the remaining negative clones in liquid nitrogen as a backup. The positive clone (Xa clone) can be maintained in the tissue culture or frozen until further use.\n2. Screening the library for reactivation using hygromycin B selection\nInfecting the test clone, applying selection, and harvesting DNA for sequencing\nObtain viral concentrates of retroviral constructs expressing hairpins from an shRNA library, or produce concentrated viral supernatant using the protocol included with the desired library.\nBefore proceeding with the screen, titrate the library (using a GFP marker, if available). Aim for a multiplicity of infection between 0.3 and 0.5.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform at least four independent screens to minimize false positive rates. Use 20 plates per screen to obtain 100-fold coverage of the library to maintain adequate representation of hairpins and avoid random dropouts9. However, given positive selection screen and a large library size, it is likely that a lower coverage would suffice.\nIn the morning, plate 1 x 106 Xi cells onto 10 cm tissue culture plates.\nIn the afternoon, infect the plates by replacing the media with fresh DMEM-10 containing viral supernatant and 5-10 µg/mL of polybrene. Use the amount of viral supernatant determined in step 2.1.2.",
    "After 18-24 h, aspirate the media and add 10 mL of fresh DMEM-10 to each plate. Culture for another 48 h.\nIn the morning, mobilize the cells using 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA per plate and quench with 9 mL of DMEM-10 per plate. Run the suspension through a 100 µm mesh filter. Pool the filtered suspensions together, and seed two sets of 10 cm plates at 1 x 106 cells/plate.\nIn the afternoon, replace the media in one set of plates with DMEM-10 containing 15 µg/mL of hygromycin B (day 0). In the other set, replace the media with fresh DMEM-10 only.\nAfter 48 hours, mobilize the cells from untreated set of plates using 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Incubate for 2-5 min at 37 °C. Quench with 9 mL of DMEM-10. Transfer the cells to 15 ml conical tubes and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatants and proceed immediately with extracting DNA from the pellets. Alternatively, pool the cells into larger tubes before the centrifugation step.\nExtract DNA using a mixture of phenol and chroroform and precipitate DNA with sodium acetate and cold ethanol as previously described10. Pool the individual pre-selection DNA samples and store at -20 °C until further use.\nContinue culturing hygromycin B selection set for 4 more days. Replenish the selection media with fresh DMEM-10 containing hygromycin B after 2 days.\nOn day 7, replace the selection media with fresh DMEM-10 only. Allow 2 to 4 days for recovery, and then harvest the cells as described in step 2.1.8. Proceed with DNA extraction as described in step 2.1.9.\nIdentifying hairpins enriched in the post-selection samples",
    "Use 5' context (5'-ATCGTTGCCTGCACATCTTGG-3') and 3' reverse loop primers (5'-ACATCTGTGGCTTCACTA-3') to amplify half-hairpins from pre- and post-selection DNA samples. Use all extracted DNA in separate PCR reactions with 100-200 ng of DNA per reaction.\n\t\tNOTE: These 5' context primer and 3' reverse loop primers correspond to the miR-30 context sequence upstream of the shRNA insert and the sequence at the shRNA loop, respectively. Different libraries will require different oligos. Adjust purification steps to isolate different product sizes as necessary.\nUse size-selection beads to remove primers and genomic DNA, and recover PCR products between 100 and 200 bp. Follow the protocol included with the beads.\nPrepare a sequencing library to sequence the half-hairpins. Generate at least 50 million reads per screen. Follow the protocol appropriate for the sequencing kit and equipment.\n\t\tNOTE: 50 million reads per screen provides 1000-fold representation of each shRNA in the library and approximately 10-fold coverage of each independent infection (carried out at 100-fold representation of each shRNA), which ensures adequate representation of each infection event.\nEnumerate each shRNA using a Perl script that counts sequences with perfect matches. Chose shRNAs that had at least 10 reads in the preselection pool for further analysis. Calculate the enrichments as ratios of post- to preselection counts and determine false discovery rate (FDR) on the basis of 1000 permutations. Chose genes targeted by shRNAs with <5% FDR as \"hits\" for further testing.\n3. Validating the identified hairpins (\"hits\")\nPackaging lentiviruses containing shRNAs identified in the screen\nSeed 8 x 106 293FT cells per plate on 10 cm plates.\nThe following day, replace the media with 9 mL of antibiotic-free DMEM-10 per plate; do this 30 minutes before transfection.\nDuring the 30-minute interval, prepare two mixes for transfection:",
    "Prepare Mix 1 (per plate/shRNA; scale up according to the total number of shRNAs): 10 µL of 2 mg/mL polyethylenimine (PEI) in 0.5 mL of optimal minimum essential media. Mix by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nPrepare Mix 2 (per shRNA): 4 µg of the shRNA vector to be packaged, 1.5 µg of the VSV-G envelope vector (pMD2.G), and 2.5 µg of the packaging vector (psPAX2), mixed in 0.5 mL of optimal minimum essential media.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Include an empty lentiviral vector in the packaging to use in later infections as a negative control.\nAdd 0.5 mL of mix 1 to each aliquot of mix 2, and mix gently by pipetting. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 20 min.\nApply the mixture onto each plate from step 3.1.2 in a dropwise fashion; swirl the plate gently to mix.\nThe following day, replace the media with 5 mL of fresh DMEM-10.\n48 hours after initial transfection, collect the supernatant and run it through a 0.22 µm filter. Pre-wet the filter with DMEM-10 to maximize recovery.\nAliquot the filtered supernatant into amounts ideal for infecting a 6-well plate well.\nFreeze the aliquots at -80 °C for later use, or proceed immediately with transduction.\nTransduction and testing of individual hairpins for luciferase reporter reactivation and reactivation of wild-type MeCP2 gene on the Xi.\nIn the morning, plate 1 x 105 Xi cells/well onto 6 well plates.\nIn the afternoon, infect the plates by replacing the media with 2 mL of fresh DMEM-10 containing lentiviral supernatant and 5-10 µg/mL of polybrene. Infect a control well with viral supernatant produced from an empty lentiviral vector.\nThe following day, replace the media with 2 mL of DMEM-10 containing 1 mg/mL puromycin. Culture for four days.",
    "Replace the media with 2 mL of fresh DMEM-10 and allow 48-72 h for recovery.\nMobilize the cells with 150 µL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Incubate for 2-5 min at 37 °C. Quench with 1.5 mL of DMEM-10. Transfer the cells to 15 ml conical tubes and centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.\nRemove the media and resuspend the cells in 100 µL lysis buffer provided in the luciferase assay kit. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes. Transfer the lysates to a white 96-well plate and assay for luciferase activity using the protocol included with the kit. Use Xa cells as a positive control and Xi cells infected with an empty lentiviral vector as a negative control.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid exposing the white plates to fluorescent light prior to the assay; this will reduce the background and increase assay sensitivity. The protocol provided in the assay kit was found to be most effective if performed in the dark whenever possible.\nTo determine whether the hairpin had an effect on the expression level of MeCP2 on the active X-chromosome, isolate RNA from tranduced Xi cells and measure MeCP2 mRNA level using quantitative PCR with primers designed to amplify only wild type MeCP2 (F: 5'-TTCCATGCCAAGGCCAAACAG-3', R: 5'-CCCATAAGGAGAAGAGACAACAGC-3').\nOptional: Increase the sensitivity of the assay by adding 5-AZA to a final concentration of 0.2 µM after the cells have recovered from puromycin selection. Culture the cells for 72 h without replacing the media, and then assay for luciferase activity using the commercial luciferase assay kit.",
    "Measure reactivation of the silenced wild-type MeCP2. Infect Xa cells, which harbor the wild type MeCP2 on the Xi, with the vector containing individual hairpins, following the protocol steps 3.2.1. - 3.2.4. Isolate RNA from cells and measure MeCP2 mRNA level using quantitative PCR with primers designed to amplify only wild type MeCP2 (F: 5'-TTCCATGCCAAGGCCAAACAG-3', R: 5'-CCCATAAGGAGAAGAGACAACAGC-3').\nSubscription Required.
