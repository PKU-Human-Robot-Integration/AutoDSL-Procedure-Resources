    "Experimental protocols were carried out on female Long Evans rats (250 - 350 g) in accordance with federally prescribed animal care and use guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California San Diego.\n1. Acclimating the Rat to Body Restraint\nNOTE: Place the rat on a restricted diet. Feed the rat once per day immediately after each daily handling session to acclimate the rat to the restraint (described below). Provide enough feed to maintain the animal at 80% of its initial weight. This amount is approximately 6 grams of feed per day for a 250 g female Long Evans rat.\nAcclimate the rat to being handled by humans. Gently restrain the rat by hand for periods of approximately 5 sec every 30 sec. Do this for 15 min a day on 2 consecutive days. Monitor the rats daily for signs of stress during the training period. Signs include struggling in response to restraint, vocalization, and tooth-chattering.\nOn the 3rd day, place the rat in a body-constraining cloth sock (Figure 1) for 15 min a day on two consecutive days.\nOn the 5th day, place the rat inside the sock, and place the sock inside a rigid tube on the experimental jig (Figure 4). Leave the rat in the tube for 15 min a day on 2 consecutive days.\nFeed the rat immediately after each training session. At the end of the last session (6th day) give unrestricted access to food. Select for implantation only those rats which do not show signs of excessive stress on the last training day.\n\tNOTE: Though selection of rats for implantation is subjective, in our hands over 90% of rats were found to be responsive to habituation and able to undergo implantation.",
    "2. Implanting the Recording Chamber and Head-restraint Mechanism\nMake a reference wire by soldering bare stainless steel wire to a pin connector. Cut the wire so that 3-5 mm remains uncovered by the pin. Autoclave the reference wire, along with all surgical tools.\nAdminister ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Administer 95 mg/kg ketamine mixed with 5 mg/kg xylazine intraperitoneally. The initial dose lasts for 1½ to 2 hr. Supplement the anesthesia every 30-45 min thereafter, as needed. Lubricate the animal’s eyes with an ophthalmic ointment.\nCheck the toe withdrawal reflex to determine the plane of anesthesia, and maintain anesthesia as necessary.\nPlace the rat in a stereotaxic holding frame with ear bars (Figure 3A). Shave the hair on the head and disinfect the wound site with povidone-iodine (10% solution). Take care to insert the ear bars appropriately so that they do not damage the ear drum. Ear bars with blunt tips are preferable.\nMake an incision with a scalpel approximately along the midline of the cranium from the rostro-caudal level of the eyes to the back of the ears. Use scissors to cut and remove a 2-3 mm strip of skin on either side of the incision.\nScrape away the periosteum to expose the surface of the cranium out to the lateral ridges. Cover the exposed cranium with thin layer of superglue.\nDrill a small hole, with a slightly smaller diameter than 0-80 screws, using a ½ mm diameter drill burr (see Materials section). Drill the hole immediately posterior to where the bregma suture meets the lateral ridge, and at a 30-45° angle into the cranium, so that the screw can go in with the top more lateral than the bottom.",
    "Screw in a 0-80 flat-bottom machine screw to the hole (approximately 3 turns), at 30-45° angle. Be careful not to screw in too deeply to avoid damaging the underlying brain tissue.\nRepeat this procedure for 6 additional screws in the configuration shown (Figure 3B). Apply superglue to the base of all screws.\nPlace a syringe needle in the stereotax manipulator. Measure from the bregma suture, and make a dent in the cranium with the needle near, but outside of the desired craniotomy location, as a reference mark.\n\tNOTE: In this demonstration, the stereotaxic coordinates of the mark are 3 mm posterior and 1 mm lateral to the bregma suture.\nMark the dent with a permanent marker. Note the stereotaxic coordinates of the mark, as it will serve as a stereotaxic reference point (Figure 3B).\nMake a craniotomy centered on the desired coordinates (3 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to bregma in this example). Leave the dura mater intact. Cover the craniotomy with modified artificial cerebral spinal fluid (125 mM NaCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 3.1 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4)13 (Figure 3C).\nCut a 0.2 ml centrifuge tube to 4 - 5 mm in length, and cut off the cap. Place the tube on the cranium and center it over the craniotomy.\nApply dental cement around the bottom of the tube to seal the base of the tube to the cranium. Be careful not to leak cement into the exposed craniotomy (Figure 3D).",
    "Drill another small hole (about ½ mm diameter) in the contralateral cranial plate and carefully insert the reference wire. Construct the reference wire by soldering a pin that interfaces with the recording amplifier to the end of the wire (see Equipment section). Do not move the reference wire once it is in the brain as this may cause damage.\nApply superglue to the hole in which the wire was inserted. This will seal the pin and wire in place temporarily.\nMix the two parts of the silicone gel kit (see Materials section) in approximately equal portions. Wait two minutes for mixing and fill the centrifuge tube approximately ⅓ full with gel.\nAttach a right angle post clamp (see Materials section) to the head restraint bar. Attach the head plate (Figure 2A) to the holding bar (Figure 2B) at a 45° pitch angle so that the bottom of the plate is toward the nose of the animal. It is helpful to use an inclinometer to set the pitch angle to match that of the experimental jig (Figure 4).\nAttach the holding bar to the stereotax manipulator arm so that the bar is parallel to the ear bars. Lower the bar and plate so that the plate is posterior of the lambda suture and anterior to the caudal-most screw.\nGrasp the front head-bolt (an 8-32 stud or screw, see Materials section) at approximately 45° angle with a helping hands arm and clamp, so that the head of the screw faces down and towards the tail of the animal. Lower the screw so that it touches the anterior 0-80 screws (Figure 3F, G).",
    "Secure the bolt and plate in place with dental acrylic. Apply dental acrylic around the bone screw heads, reference pin, and around the sides of the centrifuge tube. Wait approximately 10 min for the dental acrylic to dry (Figure 3H).\nApply a layer of dental cement around the edges of the dental acrylic, cementing the skin to the implant. Wait for the cement to dry.\nPoke several holes in the cap of the centrifuge tube, and place the cap on the tube.\nRemove the helping hands clamp. Then carefully remove the head-holding bar from the stereotax, and then remove head plate from the bar (Figure 3I).\nRemove the animal from the stereotax and administer post-operative care and monitoring in accordance with all applicable rules, regulations, and laws (e.g., Buprenorphine 0.02 mg/kg, every 8-12 hr for a minimum of 24 hr). If inflammation develops around the edges of the implant, apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to the affected site daily until resolved.\n3. Juxtacellular Monitoring of Neuronal Units\nPull quartz capillary tubing on a carbon dioxide laser micropipette puller (see Equipment section) with tip diameters of less than 1 μm (Figure 5A).\n\tNOTE: the heating parameters will vary according to the particular instrument, and that the required neck diameter will vary depending on the brain structure of interest. For recordings in rat thalamus, micropipettes have necks ranging from 5-7 mm.\nSecure the pipette in place under a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope equipped with long working distance objectives. Use modeling clay to hold the pipette in place on the microscope’s stage.",
    "Slowly move a glass block (0.5 - 1 cm thick; a piece of glass used for making ultra-microtome knives is convenient) into the field of view with the pipette tip. Using the stage micromanipulator, gently touch the pipette tip to the glass, causing it to break. Repeat as necessary until the pipette tip outer diameter is between 1-3 μm (Figure 5B,C). Ensure that these micropipettes have impedances between approximately 5-15 MΩ.\nPrepare extracellular saline (135 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 with NaOH)8 and add 2% (w/v) Chicago Sky Blue. Using a syringe with a 30 G needle or smaller, fill the back end of the pipette with the solution. Alternatively, for single cell juxtacellular labeling add 2% (w/v) Neurobiotin or biotinylated dextran amine (BDA-3000 or BDA-10000) to the saline solution in place of Chicago Sky Blue.\nPlace the rat inside the cloth sock inside the rigid tube on an appropriate experimental jig (Figure 4).Wait a minimum of 72 hr after surgery before placing the animal on the head-restraint jig. Tighten the drawstring around the upper sternum, rather than the neck, to avoid obstruction of the airway. If breathing appears to be labored or obstructed, loosen the drawstring or move it posteriorly. Carry out this procedure while the rat is alert.",
    "Attach the head-restraining plate on the rat to the corresponding piece on the jig. To do this, first pin the head-restraint plate in place, and then secure it using a 4-40 screw. Be sure to wait until the animal is calm in order to avoid applying excessive torque to the head. Next, place an 8-32 nut on the head-restraining bolt that is implanted on the rat. Then screw in a threaded stainless-steel rod to the head-bolt. Affix the rod to the experimental jig in such a way that it can be tightened in place (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: Securing the animal with head-bolt as well as the head-restraint plate minimizes bending of the apparatus and improves recording stability. In most cases recording can commence on the first day the animal is head-restrained. However, if the animal fidgets excessively or vocalizes, provide one day of head-restraint habituation training before commencing any recordings. In this case, leave the animal on the jig for 15 min and then place it back in its cage. Repeat this step the following day and continue with the protocol.\nOpen the recording chamber and remove the silicone gel. Clean the craniotomy using fine forceps if tissue has re-grown in the craniotomy.\nAttach the pipette to the motorized micromanipulator, and plug in the headstage pre-amplifier.\n\tNOTE: In the present demonstration, a small relay circuit on the headstage is used to switch between the amplifier lead wires and an external current source with high compliance (Figure 6A-C). Note that some amplifiers have an appropriate built-in high compliance source (see Discussion and Materials sections).",
    "Use the motorized micromanipulator to move the tip of the pipette to the stereotaxically identified mark in the recording chamber. Note the coordinates of this location. Be careful not to break the tip of the pipette on the cranium.\nMove the pipette to the desired recording location in the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral axes. Then advance the pipette ventrally through the dura until it is approximately 500 μm dorsal to the intended recording location.\nSlowly advance the pipette while listening for spiking events on an audio monitor of the amplified voltage recorded between the pipette tip and the reference wire. Once spiking events are identified, continue to move the pipette 0-100 μm until positive going voltage deflections greater than approximately 500 μV are observed.\n\tNOTE: The electrode resistance will increase by a factor of approximately 1.5-10 when this occurs.\nBegin recording once a unit has been isolated as according to step 3.11, along with all other behavioral and physiological measures of interest. In the present demonstration, self-generated vibrissa movements are monitored with high speed videography (see Materials section).\nTo label the recording site, switch the electrode leads to connect to the current source. There are several ways to do this, using either a relay circuit (Figure 6A-C), a built-in current source on the amplifier, or manually (Figure 6D, see step 3.8 and Discussion). Pass -4 μA with 2 sec pulses at 50% duty cycle for 4 min to iontophoretically inject Chicago Sky Blue through the pipette.\nKill and perfuse the animal after several labeling procedures according to standard practice. Section the brain and counterstain as necessary to identify the anatomical location of the recording site. Counterstain the tissue for cytochrome oxidase reactivity as per14. Alternatively, identify the Chicago Sky Blue deposits using fluorescence microscopy.",
    "NOTE: To accurately differentiate between different labeled units it is important that all labels are made with the same pipette on the same day, without unclamping the pipette between labels. In this case recording sites can be differentiated by their relative locations in post-hoc histology along with the noted manipulator coordinates of each site (see step 3.9). For unambiguous identification, mark the labels at least 200 μm apart from one another, and no more than 3-5 labels per brain region.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
