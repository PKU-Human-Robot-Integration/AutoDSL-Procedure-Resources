    "All the experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics of Animal Experiment Care Committee of Inner Mongolia Medical University and followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health on animal care and ethics. Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 8 weeks old (200 g ± 20 g) were housed in a room with a controlled temperature (22 °C ± 2 °C) and humidity (55% ± 15%) under a 12 h/12 h regulated light/dark cycle for 1 week. See Figure 1 for the workflow of the network pharmacology analysis.\n1. Behavioral test in rats\nEstablish a CUMS rat model\n\t\nApply the following stimuli combined with isolation for 28 days to all the rats, except for the controls: inversion of the light/dark cycle for 24 h, food deprivation for 24 h, water deprivation for 24 h, high-speed level shaking for 15 min (one time/s), tail clamp for 2 min, swimming in cold water (4 °C) for 5 min, 45 °C heat stimulation, and wet padding for 24 h (Table 1). Raise the rats in individual cages.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid repeating the same type of stimuli for consecutive days.\nDrug preparation\n\t\nPulverize the Zadi-5 pill in a grinder, and prepare a 1.16 g/mL solution in distilled water. Separately prepare a fluoxetine solution of 0.36 mg/mL in distilled water.\nDrug administration\n\t\nDivide the rats randomly into six groups (n = 10): control (CON), model (MOD), Zadi-5 group (Zadi-5, 1.6 g of Zadi-5/kg21), fluoxetine group (Fluoxetine, 3.6 mg of fluoxetine/kg). One time per day for 28 days, administer 1 mL/g per rat of the appropriate drug solution by gavage and treat the CON and MOD groups with an equal volume of distilled water.\n\t\tNOTE: Gavage starts at the beginning of model establishment for all the groups.\nOpen-field test (OFT)",
    "Divide a black box (50 cm x 50 cm x 30 cm) into nine square regions of equal area. Equip the box with a video tracking analysis system. One day after the last gavage, place the rat in the center square, and record its horizontal and vertical activities for 3 min.\nScore the number of squares crossed with all paws as a horizontal activity, and score standing and grooming as a vertical activity. After each test, clean the box with 75% alcohol to remove the smell of the rat for subsequent tests23.\nSucrose consumption test (SCT)\n\t\nWeigh the respective bottles before and after consumption, and calculate the 60 min sucrose preference rates on day 0, day 7, day 14, day 21, and day 28 using equation (1):\n\t\t​Sucrose consumption = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64832/64832eq01.jpg × 100%     (1)\nMorris water maze (MWM)\n\t\nDivide the pool into four quadrants. Order the quadrants from one to four, and place the hidden platform in the third quadrant, 1 cm below the water surface.\nPlace the rat subject into the maze in different quadrants to look for the platform for 120 s, and record the latency time using the MWM video trail analysis system.\nPlace the rat subject in the pool's center. If the subject cannot find the hidden platform in 120 s, record the latency as 120 s.\nNext, dislodge the platform, place the rat in the water, and record the number of zone-crossings for 120 s.\nAdd milk to the pool for some level of opacity. Maintain the water temperature at 23 °C ± 1 °C during the experiment.\n2. Network pharmacological prediction\nScreen the active components in Zadi-5.",
    "Browse the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP, https://old.tcmsp-e.com/tcmsp.php), and input \"Myristicae Semen Seeds,\" \"Aucklandiae Radix roots,\" and \"Piperis Longi Fructus\" in the \"herb name\" section to obtain the names of chemicals. Set the pharmacokinetic index of oral bioavailability (OB) to be >30% and the drug-like (DL) index to be >0.18 (Supplementary File 1).\nSearch \"Rou Dou Kou\" (Myristica fragrans Houtt), \"Tu Mu Xiang\" (Inula helenium L.), \"Mu Xiang\" (Aucklandia lappa Decne.), \"Guang Zao\" (Choerospondias axillaris Roxb. Burtt Hill), and \"Bi Ba\" (Piper longum L.) in the Chinese Medicine Pharmacopeia (http://www.zhongyaocai360.com/zhongguoyaodian/) to identify the chemical names of each component.\nSearch the identified chemical names in PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to find the isomeric SMILES or InChIkey\nIdentify the target proteins of the active components in Zadi-5.\n\t\nIdentify the target proteins of the active components using SEA (http://sea.bkslab.org/), BATMAN (http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/batman-tcm/), and Swiss Target Prediction (http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/) with isomeric SMILES or InChIkey, and find the overlapping proteins.\nUse the protein database UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/uploadlists/) to convert the identified targets to unified gene names.\nSearch for the target proteins for depression.\n\t\nSearch and identify the potential protein targets for depression by using the keywords \"depression\" and \"depressive disorder\" in Genecards (https://www.genecards.org/), Disgenet (https://www.disgenet.org/), and Drugbank (https://www.drugbank.com/).\nFind the target genes.\n\t\nBrowse the Venn diagram (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/), upload the targets of the active components of Zadi-5 in List-1, upload the targets for depression in List-2, and submit. Obtain the Venn diagram, and filter out the overlapping target candidates.\nConstruct the network.\n\t\nConstruct a spreadsheet called \"Type and Network\" (Supplementary File 2). \"Type\" is the network's signature, and \"Network\" illustrates the relationship between the signs.\nExport the \"Type and Network\" to Cytoscape v3.9.0 to construct the network \"Zadi-5 herbs-ingredients-disease targets.\"\nAnalyze the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the target candidates.",
    "Set the common targets in the STRING database (https://cn.string- db.org/) to analyze their interactions. Set the protein type as \"homo sapiens.\" Set the interaction threshold value to 0.9, and select only the experimentally verified types. Do not display the lonely island nodes.\nConduct a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of the target-related pathways.\n\t\nPaste 86 potential antidepressant targets of Zadi-5 into the start analysis bracket in DAVID (https:// david.ncifcrf.gov/) to study the related signaling pathways by performing the Gene Ontology (GO) function-including biological process, cellular component, and molecular function-and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses.\n\t\tNOTE: KEGG is visualized in the bubble chart using an online IMageGP (http://www.ehbio.com /ImageGP/index.php/Home/Index/). The bubble size represents the number of targets enriched in the indicated pathway, and the bubble color represents the enrichment’s ​P-value.\nConstruct the network to illustrate the active compounds in Zadi-5 that interact with the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.\n\t\nDownload the KEGG pathway document, select the genes of the PI3K-AKT pathway from the enrichment analysis, and paste them on the spreadsheet to construct a \"Type and Network\" document.\nExport the \"Type and Network\" document to the Cytoscape to generate the \"PI3K-AKT visualized compounds-targets-pathways network\" (Supplementary File 3).\n\t\t​NOTE: \"Type\" is the network's signature, and \"Network\" illustrates the relationship between the signs.\n3. Statistical analysis\nUse a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Duncan's post hoc test, to determine the significant differences in biochemical and gene expression parameters. Calculate the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and visualize the data. Consider P < 0.05 as statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
