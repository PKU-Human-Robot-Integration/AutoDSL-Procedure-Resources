    "The experiments performed in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of Naresuan University Animal Care and Use Committee (NUACUC), protocol number NU-AE620921, for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes.\n1. Composition of physiological solutions\nFormulate Krebs solution by dissolving chemicals in distilled water to achieve the final concentrations as follows: 122 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM NaHPO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and 11 mM glucose8. Adjust the pH of the solution to 7.3 with 1 M NaOH and preheat to 37 °C prior to use.\nPrepare cold Krebs solution similarly as mentioned in step 1.1. for use as an isolation medium of IPA, as described in step 2.\n2. Isolation of intrapulmonary artery (IPA)\nAnesthetize 8-week-old male Wistar rats with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium thiopental (100 mg/kg)9. Check the rats for their reaction to painful stimuli in deep sleep by using forceps clamped to their feet, then ensure that the rats do not have a foot pull-back reaction before euthanizing them in step 2.2.\nCut open the middle thorax of the rat and the heart terminal with scissors (size 14 cm). Then, locate the root of the lung with scissors (size 14 cm). Harvest the entire lung by cutting with scissors and immerse it in cold Krebs solution10,11.\nSlice a single lobe of the lung with scissors (size 11 cm) and place on a Petri dish (size 9 cm) with the medial side/root of the lung facing upward (Figure 2A, B). Observe and identify the alignment of the vein, bronchia, and artery from top to bottom (Figure 2B).",
    "Cut open the bronchus longitudinally with scissors (size 11 cm). Then, use the forceps (size 11 cm) to grab the tip of the bronchus. Gently dissect and remove the bronchus and veins out of the lung. Note that the IPA is always anatomically aligned beneath the bronchus.\nAfter that, the main IPA can be visualized (Figure 2C). Use the forceps (size 11 cm) to grab the tip of the IPA and carefully dissect it out of the lung tissue with scissors (size 11 cm).\nKeep the isolated IPA in cold Krebs solution until the organ bath assembly is set up (pH 7.3 and temperature 4 °C)11.\n3. Isolation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)\nIsolate IPA as previously described in step 2. Cut open the main branch of the IPA longitudinally with scissors (size 11 cm) and cut into small strips (2 mm) (Figure 3A).\nImmerse the IPA strips in a dissociation medium (DM)10,12 containing 110 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, 0.03 mM phenol red, 10 mM taurine, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 11 mM glucose, and 0.16 mM CaCl2, and adjust the pH to 7.0 with 1 M NaOH. Incubate the strips for 1 h at 4 °C in DM containing 1 mg/mL papain, 0.04% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.4 mM 1,4- dithiothreitol (DTT), and further incubate at 37 °C for 15 min. Add 1 mg/mL collagenase type 1A in DM and further incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: DM is a solution used to preserve cell viability. Papain and collagenase type 1A are enzymes that break down the extracellular matrix proteins to isolate single cells. BSA is a serum albumin protein used for the stabilization of enzymes during storage and enzymatic reactions. DTT is a reducing agent used to stabilize and promote the activity of enzymes during the cell isolation process. Taurine is amino sulfuric acid used for stabilizing the cell membrane and cell integrity.\nTransfer the tissues into fresh DM and disperse by gentle trituration using a glass Pasteur pipette (Figure 3B). Keep triturating until isolated VSMCs become visible in the bathing solution under the microscope (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: Freshly isolated VSMCs can be used for studying vascular physiology/pathophysiology, along with various experimental investigations, such as modulation by pharmacological agents, patch-clamp electrophysiological analysis, calcium imaging, etc. However, the present study focuses only on the vasorelaxation of isolated IPA using the organ bath technique.\n4. Organ bath technique\nIsolate IPA as previously described in step 2. Cut the main branch of the IPA into rings of ~2 mm length (Figure 2D)13.\nAffix the IPA rings in organ bath chambers (Figure 4) by threading them onto two 40 µm diameter stainless steel wires (Figure 2E)11,13,14.\nAttach stainless steel wires mounted with IPA rings to the isometric force transducers connected to the data acquisition device and the computer system installed with the suitable physiological software for data recording and analysis, then gently raise the tension of the IPA ring to 1 g11.",
    "Allow the vessel segments to equilibrate for about 45 min at a resting tension of 1 g. During the equilibration period, ensure that the Krebs solution is regularly changed every 15 min. After this period of equilibration, test the viability of the vessels by measuring their vasoconstriction to high extracellular K+ (80 mM) solution containing 47.4 mM NaCl, 80 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM NaHPO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 11 mM glucose10,11.\nAssess the presence or absence of endothelium by computing the relaxation response to acetylcholine (1 x 10−5 M) in rings precontracted with phenylephrine (PE, 1 x 10−5 M) (Note that vascular contractions remain stable for 1 h after adding PE). Consider the rings as endothelium-intact if they quantify for more than 70% relaxation (Figure 5A). If they have less than 10% relaxation, consider the rings as endothelium-denuded13 (Figure 5B). Mechanically remove the endothelium by gently rubbing inside the vessel with a small wire to induce denudation.\nAgain equilibrate the arterial rings for 30 min before the start of the test experiments.\n5. ​Vasorelaxant response to plant extract\nInvestigate the relaxant effect of the plant extract by precontracting IPA rings with PE (1 x 10−5 M).\nThen, carefully add the plant extract (1-1,000 µg/mL) cumulatively to endothelium-intact rings and endothelium-denuded rings to induce vasorelaxation (Figure 6A, B) and to acquire a concentration-dependent response curve (Figure 6C).\nMake certain that the effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used as a solvent is also evaluated similarly to serve as a negative control (Figure 6C).\n6. Mechanism of plant extract-induced vasorelaxation via the endothelium",
    "Evaluate the vasorelaxant mechanism of action of the plant extract via endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), cyclo-oxygenase (COX)13, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) pathways by incubating the endothelium-intact IPA rings for 30 min with the following inhibitors (Figure 7A): 1 x 10−4 M NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, an eNOS inhibitor)9, 1 x 10−5 M indomethacin (a COX inhibitor)9, or a combination of 1 x 10−7 M apamin (a small calcium-activated potassium channel blocker) and 1 x 10−7 M charybdotoxin (an intermediate and large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel blocker), prior to inducing contractions of IPA with 1 x 10−5 M PE.\nThen, after the contractions to PE stabilize, add cumulative concentrations (0.1-1,000 µg/mL) of the plant extract.\nPresent the effects of plant extract as percentage relaxation of the IPA rings in the presence of inhibitors compared to the response of the IPA rings without inhibitors (Figure 7B-D) and construct the concentration-response curve.\n7. Mechanism of plant extract-induced vasorelaxation via vascular smooth muscle K+ channels\nPre-incubate endothelium-denuded IPA rings for 30 min with 1 x 10−3 M 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a blocker of voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) (Figure 8A), 1 x 10−5 M glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP), or 1 x 10−7 M iberiotoxin, a blocker of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa), prior to inducing contractions of IPA with 1 x 10−5 M PE.\nThen, add cumulative concentrations of the plant extract.\nPresent the effects of plant extract as percentage relaxation of the IPA rings with inhibitor compared to the IPA rings without inhibitor (Figure 8B-D) and construct the concentration-response curve.\n8. Mechanism of plant extract-induced vasorelaxation via inhibition of extracellular calcium (Ca2+) influx in VSMCs\nPre-incubate endothelium-denuded IPA rings for 30 min in Ca2+-free Krebs solution containing 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis (2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (Figure 9A).",
    "Then, replace the bathing solution with Ca2+ free-80 mM K+ solution for 10 min to depolarize the VSMCs, which then open the VOCCs (Figure 9A).\nCumulatively add CaCl2 (0.01-10 mM) to induce vasoconstriction of the IPA and construct the concentration-response curve (Figure 9A).\nRepeat this protocol in the same IPA rings but pre-incubate them with plant extract or 1 µM nicardipine (L-type Ca2+ channel blocker) in Ca2+ containing 80 mM K+ solution for 10 min followed by the cumulative addition of CaCl28.\nLastly, compare the contractile response to the maximum contraction previously elicited by control CaCl2 challenges (Figure 9B).\n9. Mechanism of plant extract-induced vasorelaxation via inhibition of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)\nExpose endothelium-denuded IPA rings to 80 mM K+ solution for approximately 5 min, depolarizing the VSMCs, opening the VOCCs, and ultimately generating the Ca2+ loading into the SR (Figure 10A).\nReplace the bathing solution for 10 min with Ca2+-free Krebs solution containing 1 mM EGTA (Figure 10A).\nThen, challenge the IPA rings with 1 x 10−5 M PE, which activates the phospholipase C/IP3 pathway, ultimately releasing Ca2+ from the SR and evoking a transient contraction of IPA (Figure 10A).\nRepeat the same protocol to ascertain likewise transient contractions to PE.\nChallenge the IPA rings again with 80 mM K+ solution for about 5 min, then replace the bathing solution with Ca2+-free Krebs solution containing 1 mM EGTA with or without the plant extract for 10 min.\nAgain, challenge the IPA rings with 1 x 10−5 M PE.\nCompare the IPA contractions induced by PE between the condition with and without the plant extract (Figure 10B).\n10. Statistical analysis",
    "Express the results as mean ± SEM. Compare these values using the Student's t-test or analyze by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test using suitable statistical software. Consider the differences at p < 0.05 to be statistically significant. Here, there were n = 6 rats/experimental protocol.\n\tNOTE: The recording of vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation can be assessed with suitable software installed on the computer. For example, Figure 5A shows that, when the blood vessels are stimulated by the PE causing contraction, this could be observed from the increased tension of the original tracing. The tracing will stabilize in 20-30 min, which is considered a 100% contraction. After that, the ACh stimulates the blood vessels, causing relaxation, which could be observed from the decreased tension of the original tracing. Thus, the reduced tension is calculated as the percentage compared to 100% contraction.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
