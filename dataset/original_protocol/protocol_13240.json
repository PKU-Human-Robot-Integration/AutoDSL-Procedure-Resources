    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committees of the Institutional Review Boards of the National Institutes of Health (NIDCR IRB #16-D-0040) and Roseman University of Health Sciences. See the Table of Materials for details related to the software used in this protocol. The same protocol can be followed with the use of different software, after adjustments based on their specific settings and technical details. The CBCT scans used for creation of the figure included in this paper, as well as the video demonstration, have been anonymized prior to their use, and informed consent has been acquired from the subjects, allowing the use of their scans in research related publications. Both subjects were seen at the NIH Dental Clinic, where the scans were acquired (Planmeca ProMax 3D system; low dose mode, 400 µm resolution) and had been consented onto an NIH IRB-approved protocol (NCT02639312).\n1. Uploading the CBCT scan and view in the 3DAnalysis module\nOpen the referenced software and click on browse file. Select the scan to be analyzed and click open.\nGo to the 3DAnalysis module.\n2. Uploading a landmark configuration file\nIn the 3DAnalysis module, click on the Save information floppy disk icon. Then, select Load a configuration and browse for the configuration file.\n\t​NOTE: The configuration file including the landmarks used by the authors is included as Supplementary File 1.\n3. Coordinate system setup\nClick on the Reorientation icon.",
    "In the window that opens, select the By picking landmarks option. This allows the user to orientate all the scans in the same way, which is important if their 3D coordinate values are to be compared. The options selected for this protocol are: N as the Origin Landmark, Three-point definition with landmarks Or R, Or L, Po L, and Define A-P Axis (Mid-Sagittal Plane) with landmarks N and Ba.\n4. CBCT scan image adjustments\nAdjust the Brightness and Contrast to reduce image noise from the menu on the left side of the screen.\nZoom in and out by holding down the Ctrl key and left-clicking simultaneously and sliding across the screen. Move the image in a bodily manner by holding down the Shift key and left-clicking simultaneously and sliding across the screen. Enable Clipping from the settings menu to create sectional views in all planes of space.\n5. Addition of new landmarks\nFrom the Settings menu, which has a tool icon, click on landmarks to reveal a list of available landmark options, and then select the landmark of choice.\nTo set a default view for landmarks, select tracing task, click on set up, choose landmark, set the view as desired, and click on use current view settings. Repeat the above steps to change the default view for any additional landmark.\n6. Annotation of 3D anatomical landmarks\nFrom the top of the menu on the left of the screen, select Create Tracing. In the window that opens, click on Start in the left lower corner of the window. Start annotating the 3D landmarks by left-clicking directly on the 3D volume at the location where the landmark should be placed based on its definition.",
    "Confirm and adjust the location of the landmark using the section views on the right of the screen. In case they cannot be seen, from the layout selection menu on the left, select Slice locator. To confirm the placement of a landmark, click Stop and select the desired view to visualize the landmark. Once confirmed, proceed to placing the remaining landmarks.\nTo change the position of the landmark with the use of the 3D volume, stop the analysis by clicking on Stop at the bottom of the Tracing tasks menu, click on the landmark point to be moved, and drag it to the new desired position.\nTo re-annotate a landmark, double-click on the ticked square next to the landmark and then answer Yes to the follow-up question.\n7.
