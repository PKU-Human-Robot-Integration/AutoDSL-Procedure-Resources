    "Caution: Methanol (MeOH) and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), used during extraction, are flammable, and can have, on prolonged exposure and/or contact, respiratory, eye or skin irritation. Please handle them carefully only in a fume hood and use the appropriate safety procedures during the extraction (lab coat, safety glasses, gloves, etc.). Liquid nitrogen and dry ice, used in several steps of this protocol, can cause severe burns by prolonged skin contact. Please handle them carefully by wearing protective gloves and glasses. Users can use different chemicals, reagents or internal standards for sample analysis, some of which may be toxic. Please examine the relevant chemical safety data sheets for all material used.\n1. Collection and Harvesting of Biological Samples\nPrepare labelled harvesting tubes.\n\tNOTE: Here, harvest biological samples in labelled, 2 mL, round-bottom, safe lock microcentrifuge tubes containing two 5 mm diameter, metal balls for the tissue homogenizer.\nPrepare a filled liquid nitrogen dewar.\nHarvest the biological sample and snap freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen. Perform this step as quickly as possible within few seconds to avoid metabolic changes induced by wounding.\n\tNote: For demonstration purposes, use rosette leaves from 30 day-old wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) grown on soil under long day conditions.\nKeep the harvested samples on dry ice for short-term breaks or store them at -80 °C for longer periods.\n2. Grinding and Tissue Disruption\nPre-cool the tube holders of the tissue homogenizer in liquid nitrogen for at least 10 min. If a tissue homogenizer is not available, use clean and pre-cooled mortars and pestles.\nTake the samples from the liquid nitrogen, dry ice or -80 °C freezer and place them in the pre-cooled tube holders.\nQuickly put the tube holders in the tissue homogenizer.",
    "Grind the biological material into a fine and homogeneous powder. Use 20 Hz for 1 min for leaves.\n\tNote; Homogenization time and speed may be varied depending on the tissue, make sure that the sample is homogenized into a fine powder and that this powder is kept frozen at every step of the homogenization.\nTake the biological samples from the tube holders and keep them frozen until further extraction.\n3. Weighing of Tissues\nUse an analytical balance with sufficient precision for the required sample amounts.\nPrepare a labelled 2 mL round bottom safe-lock microcentrifuge tube.\nPre-cool the tubes and spatulas in liquid nitrogen.\nAliquot the required amount of tissue powder into the 2 mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tube.\n\tCaution: Avoid any defrosting of the plant material by minimizing the time taken to weigh the samples.\nReturn the aliquoted samples immediately after weighing to liquid nitrogen.\nRecord for each sample the exact weight. Use 10-50 mg ± 10% for most plant tissues.\nStore the aliquoted samples at -80 °C until further extraction.\n4. Reagent Setup\nUse an extraction mixture of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/ methanol (MeOH).\nFor the preparation of 100 mL extraction solvent, add 75 mL of MTBE to 25 mL of MeOH to make a mixture of MTBE: MeOH (3:1, vol/vol).\nAdd internal standards for the post analysis normalization according to analytical needs. Typically, add 50 µL of 1,2-diheptadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1 mg/mL in chloroform) as an internal standard for the UPLC-MS-based lipid analysis, while adding 50 µL of 13C sorbitol (1 mg/mL in water) as internal standards for the GC-MS-based analysis of primary metabolites. Internal standards for UPLC-MS-based metabolite analysis are 50 µL of corticosterone (1 mg/mL in methanol) and 25 µL of ampicillin (1 mg/mL in methanol).",
    "Transfer the solvent to a clean glass bottle that was rinsed with MTBE: MeOH mixture.\nStore the extraction mixture for up to 1 week at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not store the extraction mixture for longer periods to maintain reproducible results.\nTo induce phase separation, use water (H2O)/ methanol (MeOH).\nFor the preparation of 100-mL H2O: MeOH, add 75 mL of H2O to 25 mL of MeOH to make H2O: MeOH (3:1, vol/vol).\nTransfer the solvent to a clean glass bottle that was rinsed with H2O: MeOH mixture. This solvent can be stored for several weeks at room temperature.\n5. Extraction of Samples\nPre-cool the extraction mixture (MTBE: MeOH, 3:1, vol/vol) to -20 °C using a liquid cooling system or a -20 °C freezer.\nTake out the aliquoted samples one by one and add 1 mL of the pre-cooled extraction mixture to each sample tube. Caution: Perform this step quickly due to low viscosity of MTBE.\nMix immediately on a vortex mixer until the tissue is well homogenized within the extraction mixture.\n\tNOTE: This step is very important, since it is required to precipitate the proteins and inactivates their enzymatic activities.\nIncubate all the samples on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 45 min at 4°C.\nSonicate the samples for 15 min in an ice-cooled sonication bath.\n6. Fractionation by Phase Separation\nAdd 650 µL of H2O: MeOH (3:1, vol/vol) to each sample tube.\nMix well by vortexing for 1 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at a speed of 20,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: After this step, there are two immiscible liquid phases with a solid pellet in the bottom of the tube.\n\tCaution: Handle the tubes with care to avoid mixing of the two liquid phases and avoid disrupting the precipitated pellet.",
    "7. Aliquoting of Polar and Hydrophobic Fractions\nTransfer 500 µL of the solvent from the upper, lipid-containing, phase into a labelled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: The aliquoted lipid samples can be directly concentrated for immediate UPLC-MS analysis (step 8.1) or stored for several weeks at -80 °C.\nOnce the 500 µL are removed from the sample, remove the remaining lipid phase using a 200 µL pipette.\nTransfer 400 µL of the solvent from the lower phase (polar and semi-polar metabolites) into a labelled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. The aliquoted polar samples can be directly concentrated for immediate UPLC-MS analysis (step 8.2) or stored for several weeks at -80 °C.\nTake an additional aliquot of 200 µL to perform additional analysis, e.g. gas chromatography-based metabolite analysis as described preciously16.\nRemove the remainder of the aqueous phase by pipetting off the excess volume.\nWash the obtained protein, starch, cell wall pellet with 500 µL methanol by thoroughly vortexing it for 1 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at a speed of 10,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPerform protein extraction and digestion (step 11) or starch/cell wall analysis as described previously16.\n\tNOTE: If not utilized immediately, these pellets can be stored for several weeks at -80 °C.\n8. Concentration and Storage of Fractions\nEvaporate the solvent from lipid samples (from step 7.1) in either a vacuum concentrator without heating (for 1-2 hours) or preferably use a nitrogen flow evaporator to avoid oxidative modifications of the lipids.\n\tNOTE: Dried samples should be analyzed immediately. For storage, leave samples in MTBE solution, ideally in glass vials (step 7.1).\nEvaporate the solvent from the aqueous samples (from step 7.3 or 7.4) overnight in a vacuum concentrator without heating. NOTE: the dried samples can be stored for several weeks at -80 °C before analysis.",
    "9. Analysis of Lipids using UPLC-MS24\nRe-suspend the dried lipid fractions (from step 8.1) in 400 µL of acetonitrile: 2-propanol (7:3, vol/vol).\nTransfer sufficient liquid to glass vials and cap tightly.\nPut the glass vials in a cooled autosampler (4 °C).\nInject 2 µL per sample and separate the lipids on a Reversed Phase (RP) C8 column held at 60 °C using a UPLC system running at a flow rate of 400 µL/min.\nUse the mobile phases described in Table 1 for the chromatographic separation.\nAcquire the mass spectra in positive and negative ionization mode using a suitable MS instrument covering the mass range between 150 and 1,500 m/z.\n10. Analysis of Polar and Semi-polar Metabolites using UPLC-MS25.\nRe-suspend the polar phase (from step 8.2) in 200 µL UPLC-grade methanol: water (1:1, vol/vol).\nTransfer sufficient liquid to glass vials and cap tightly.\nPut the glass vials in a cooled autosampler (4 °C).\nInject 2 µL from each sample and separate the metabolites on a RP C18 column held at 40 °C using a UPLC system running at a flow rate of 400 µL/min.\nUse the mobile phases for chromatographic separation with the parameters given in Table 2.\nAcquire full scan mass spectra in positive and negative ionization mode using a suitable mass spectrometer covering a mass range between 50 and 1,500 m/z.\n11. Protein Extraction, Digestion and Analysis16\nRe-suspend the washed protein/starch/cell wall pellet (from step 7.8) in 200 µL of the protein extraction buffer of choice. Note: We use urea/thiourea buffer (5 M urea, 2 mM thiourea, 15 mM DTT, 2% CHAPS and protease and phosphatase inhibitors)27.\nSonicate the samples for 10 min in an ice-cooled sonic bath.\nIncubate samples for 30 min on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) at room temperature.",
    "Centrifuge the dissolved proteins at 10,000 x g for 5 min.\nCollect the protein supernatant in a new tube.\nDetermine the protein concentration from the collected supernatant28.\nDigest 50 µg of protein in-solution with a protocol of choice. Typically, use the Trypsin/Lys-C mix according to the instruction manual.\nAfter digestion, perform desalting of the peptides prior to mass spectrometry using C18 stage tips and elute the digested peptides 29.\nConcentrate the samples to near dryness in a vacuum concentrator without heating.\nRe-suspend the samples in appropriate loading buffer (e.g. 5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid) and analyze the peptide mixtures by LC-MS/MS using a high-resolution mass spectrometer connected to a nano LC system.\n\tNOTE: In the exemplary proteomics data set presented in this protocol, we used a gradient as described in Table 3.\nSet the mass spectrometer, using a top 15 strategy, where one full scan (FS) was followed by up to 15 data dependent MS/MS scans, to the following parameters: The FS was in the mass range 200 - 2,000 m/z at a resolution of 70,000 with a target value of 3x106 ions. Obtain the data-dependent MS/MS scans by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). Set the target values for the MS/MS to 1e5 ions, with a maximal ion fill time of 50 ms, an isolation window of 4.0 m/z, normalized collision energy (NCE) of 30% and an underfill ratio of 1%. Measure the MS/MS ions at a resolution 17.500 and the dynamic exclusion was set to 60 s."
