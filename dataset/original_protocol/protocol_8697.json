    "All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978) and with the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of KIST (Seoul, Korea).\n1. Animal Preparation\nPrepare a group of 7-week-old male ICR mice (or C57BL/6).\nLet the mice go through an acclimation process for 3-7 days after transport to restore homeostasis. In general, place a group of 4-5 mice in each cage and maintain them at 22-23 °C and 40% humidity, with a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle. Provide water and food ad libitum.\n\tNote: The acclimation process is critical to allow recovery from the stress of shipping and adaptation to new housing, food, water, and smell as well as a new cage and light cycle. In this experiment, mice were housed in Individually Ventilated Cages (IVCs) located in the Specific Pathogen Free (SPF)-grade facility\nWeigh each mouse and exclude subjects whose weight deviates ± 10% from the average.\nDivide the subjects into two groups: a vehicle-injected group (Aβ(-)) and an Aβ-injected group (Aβ(+)). If the experiment is to test the efficacy of a particular drug candidate, divide the mice into four groups: (1) Aβ(-)/drug(-), (2) Aβ(-)/drug(+), (3) Aβ(+)/drug(-), and (4) Aβ(+)/drug(+).\n2. Aβ Peptide Preparation\nTreat the Aβ peptides, derived through chemical synthesis5 or from commercial sources, with pre-chilled 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) to dissolve any aggregates and to make the peptides homogenous6.\n\t\nSonicate the Aβ/HFIP solution in a water-bath sonicator for 5 min (at RT), gently vortex, and incubate the solution for 30 min at RT. Remove the HFIP completely via evaporation with nitrogen and store the homogenous Aβ at -80 °C until use.",
    "Prepare the Aβ monomers: make 1 mM Aβ dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) stock and dilute it 10-fold in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (100 µM Aβ, 10% DMSO, 90% PBS.)\nPrepare Aβ oligomers.\n\t\nIncubate the Aβ monomer solution (containing Aβ(1-42) or Aβ(1-40)) (step 2.2.) at 37 °C for 3 or 7 days, respectively.\nPlace the Aβ solution in a sealed tube in a zippered bag containing a wet paper towel to provide a humidified environment to prevent water evaporation during the incubation period.\nConfirm prepared Aβ oligomers via sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins6.\nPrepare the control PBS solution containing 10% DMSO for the vehicle ICV injection.\n3. Syringe Preparation\nPrepare a microsyringe with a 26 G stainless steel needle for ICV injection.\nSterilize the syringe in autoclave with all the other apparatus that will be used for surgical procedure. After the autoclave, place the apparatus under the UV light for 20 min.\nWrap the needle of the microsyringe with Parafilm to adjust its length to 3.8 mm to enable maximum accuracy in the depth of the injection into the brain (Figure 1A). (For B6 mice, adjust syringe needle to 3.6 mm).\n\tNote: Compression of the Parafilm will lead to the depth of the injection exceeding 3.6 mm ventral. To prevent the Parafilm from being compressed during needle insertion, densely wrap the needle multiple times.\nWash the inner space of the syringe with 70% ethanol, twice.\nSonicate the syringe and the needle in a water-bath sonicator for 30 min at RT.\nWash the inner space of the syringe with 70% ethanol, twice.",
    "Rinse out the syringe with distilled water and dry it completely in a fume hood for longer than 30 min. Leave the clean syringe under a UV light for 20 min before starting the Aβ injection.\n4. Aβ-injected Mouse Model Preparation\nNote: Clean the operating field with a disinfectant to maintain sterile conditions and sterilize all surgical instruments for ICV injection using 70% ethanol and UV exposure.\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of xylazine (20 mg/kg) and tiletamine·HCl/zolazepam·HCl (80 mg/kg) before the ICV injection. Place the mouse on a warm mat to maintain its body temperature while anesthetized and confirm adequate anesthesia by assessing the foot-pinch response.\nApply sterile PBS drops to both eyes to prevent corneal dryness during the procedure (Figure 1B).\nPrepare two mirrors by drawing multiple straight vertical lines on their surfaces in case of difficulty injecting the syringe perpendicularly.\nPlace one mirror (M1) right next to the body of the mouse and the other (M2) in front of the head. Keep M1 parallel to the imaginary midline between the two eyes of the mouse and arrange M2 perpendicular to M1, so that the two planes form a 90° angle (Figure 1C). Place M1 on the left side of the mouse if the researcher is right-handed. Place M1 on the right side of the mouse if the researcher is left-handed.\nSpray 70% ethanol onto the middle of the forehead of the mouse and rub it with dry cotton swabs. Do not wet too large of an area of the forehead to avoid decreasing the body temperature due to evaporation of the alcohol.\nWipe the same area on the forehead with 2% chlorhexidine solution using a clean cotton swabs. Repeat scrubbings with alcohol and chlorohexidine for total of three times each.",
    "Note: If necessary, shave hair on the forehead of the mouse in order to minimize the possibility of contamination\nLocate bregma.\n\t\nUsing the thumb and index finger, tightly hold down the skin of the forehead, directly above the two eyes to the degree that both eyes protrude. Drag the skin back to make the forehead taut and minimize skull movements under skin.\nForm an invisible triangle by assigning three vertices: the two eyes of the mouse and the point where the thumb and index finger meet, the bregma. (Figures 1B, Red arrow: bregma)\nLocate the injection point with measuring tape: -1.0 ± 0.06 mm posterior to bregma, 1.8 ± 0.1 mm lateral to the sagittal suture, and 2.4 mm in depth (Figure 1D, blue stars: injection points in each hemisphere). (For B6 mice: -0.9 mm posterior, 1.7 mm lateral, and 2.2 mm in depth)\nFill the syringe with 10 µl Aβ solution or vehicle with excess solution in order to avoid accidental air injection.\nPlace the syringe at the injection point (described in protocol 4.7). Make the syringe perpendicular to the plane of injection point. Align reflected images of the syringe in both mirrors with the drawn lines on the mirrors from a fixed perspective (Figure 1C).\nBegin inserting the needle until the parafilm wrapping reaches the skin.\nKeep the hand holding syringe steady and use other hand to inject 5 µl of the Aβ solution or vehicle, slowly over 5 sec without pausing. Make sure the syringe remains perpendicular throughout. After completing the injection, wait 3 to 5 sec before removing the syringe for diffusion.\nAssuming the original triangle position, exert moderate pressure to protect the skull from any unnecessary movements. Remove the syringe without tilting.",
    "Place the Aβ-injected mouse on warm pad for recovery and maintain its sternal recumbency. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it regains consciousness and do not return the mouse to a cage containing non-surgical mice until it has fully recovered.\nWash the syringe according to steps 3.3-3.6.\nPostoperatively monitor the mobility of the mice and check for any sign of infection or illness in the mice for 5-7 days.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53308/53308fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Confirmation of Aβ Injection by Y-maze and Brain Analyses\nAssess the working memory of Aβ-injected mice by Y-maze tests3,7,8\nWait 3 days after the injection for the onset of memory deficits.\nPerform the Y-maze tests using a black plastic maze with three identical arms labeled A, B, and C, each of which branches out at a 120° angle from the center of the maze (width x length x height, 10 cm x 40 cm x 12 cm).\nPlace a mouse at the start arm (arm A) and allow the subject to freely explore the maze for 8 min.",
    "Measure the number of entries into each arm and calculate the alternation rate of each subject3,9.\nDirectly examine postmortem brains to check if the injection targeted the ICV region appropriately.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse by the same procedure as outlined in section 4.1. Then sacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nDecapitate the mouse and remove the skin to expose the skull using surgical scissors. Remove tissues and muscles from the cranium.\nMake cuts on the lambdoid suture (between the parietal and interparietal bones) without damaging the brain. Remove the occipital and interparietal bones, then the parietal and frontal bones. Remove the cranial bone using forceps and isolate the brain from the skull by lifting up the meninges.\nWash the brain in chilled sterile saline and cut the ICV region of the brain in the coronal direction with a surgical knife (Figure 2).\nConfirm the injection region based on the trace of the needle insertion on the brain tissue (Figure 2). Check if the needle trace has reached one of ventricles. If the needle trace does not meet or pass through the ventricles, exclude that subject's data from analysis of the experimental results.\nSubscription Required.
