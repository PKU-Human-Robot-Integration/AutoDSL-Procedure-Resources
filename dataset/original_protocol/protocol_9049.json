    "1. Preparation of Tissue Culture Plates\nCoat each well with enough Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) to cover the bottom of the well. Allow the plates to dry in the hood.\nAfter the wells are dry, rinse with sterile water, and aspirate. Allow the plates to dry in the hood.\nWhen dry, coat with fibronectin (that was dissolved in biowhittaker water overnight at 37 °C at a concentration of 1 mg in 6 ml).\nAdd NCSC medium [95 ml DMEM/F12, 1 ml Penn/Strep (P/S), 1 ml N2, 2 ml B27, 100 μl mercaptoethanol (2ME; 50 mM stock), bFGF (20 ng/ml medium), IGF-1 (20 ng/ml of medium) and EGF(20 ng/ml of medium)] before fibronectin dry in the plates,\n2. Extract Hair Follicle Cells from Human Scalp\nBefore starting the procedure of isolating NCSCs, one needs to prepare the respective medias and reagents (see Table 1).\nFresh adult human scalp skin from facelift procedures or fetal scalp tissue is collected, washed with PBS containing Penicillin-Streptomycin.\nThe skin is then transferred into 50 ml tubes and incubated in DMEM with Dispase (10 mg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Incubation for 2-4 hr at 37 °C is also effective. Skin pieces should be a maximum width of 1 cm to allow for enzyme to penetrate.\nTransfer the skin into a sterilized Petri dish; pull off each hair from the skin by grasping the hair shaft near the skin surface and pulling firmly and smoothly. The hair follicles show morphology of either anagen (Figure 1A) or telogen (Figure 1B).",
    "Incubate the isolated follicle fragments in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for 15-20 min at room temperature with shaking periodically, add 4 ml DMEM with 10% FBS to stop reaction. The follicular epithelium is trypsinized and filtered through 40 μm filter to obtain a single-cell suspension containing cells of varying size and shape.\nSpin at 200 x g for 5 min, discard supernatant carefully, re-suspend in 1 ml PBS containing 2% serum (FBS).\nAlternatively, plucked hair follicles can be placed in culture without trypsin digestion to grow hair spheres in situ.\n3. Isolation of Hair Follicle NCSCs Using Flow Cytometric Cell Sorting\nHair follicle single-cell suspension were obtained by trypsin digestion and labeled with antibodies against CD271 (APC-conjugated) /HNK1 (FITC-conjugated) or CD271/ alpha4 integrin (PE-conjugated) for 40 min on ice in the dark.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in PBS containing 2% serum (FBS), and before sorting, PI is added to gate out the dead cells.\nPerform cell sorting by flow cytometry (FACS). Collect CD271+, HNK1+ double positive cells or CD271+, alpha4 integrin+ double positive cells (Figure 2).\nAfter sorting, CD271+, HNK1+ double positive cells or CD271+, alpha4 integrin+ double positive cells are cultured in ultra-low attachment plates in the NCSC medium\n4. Culture of Primary NCSCs\nCulture the disassociated follicular cells or FACS sorted cells in ultra-low attachment plates in the NCSC medium, change medium every day.",
    "Check cell culture every day under microscope. NCSCs will start to form floating small aggregates after several days and well-formed spheres in 2-5 weeks in the culture depending on age of the donors (Figure 3A). Outgrowth will appear in a few days at the bulge region and well-formed spheres in situ in several weeks (Figure 3B) when entire hair follicles are cultured in the NCSC medium.\n5. Expansion of NCSCs\nWash cells with PBS once.\nAdd pre-warmed (to 37 °C, critical) accutase and incubate at 37 °C for 5-10 min with shaking periodically to make sure Neural stem cell spheres dissociated into single cell( for attachment cultured NCSC, incubate cells with accutase at 37 °C for 5 min to make sure hair follicle stem cells detached).\nWash and centrifuge cells twice for 5 min at 200 x g at room temperature in DMEM/F12 medium to remove any remaining accutase solution.\nRe-suspend cells with NCSC culture medium.\nFor floating culture, put the cells in ultra-low attachment plates. For attachment culture, put the cells in pretreated tissue culture plates.\n6. Representative Results\nNCSC culture medium is sufficient to maintain hNCSCs in an undifferentiated state without the need for feeder cells. Keratinocytes will not proliferate and gradually died in the medium. Certain small round cells will proliferate and form small aggregates in suspension after 3 to 5 days. These floating aggregates slowly increased in size, generated three-dimensional sphere-like structures, which we termed hair spheres (Figure 3A). If cultured in coated plates, the NCSCs will attach to the surface and not form any spheres. The attached NCSCs grow faster than in suspension. The sphere-forming or attached stem cells express NCSCs markers. When entire hair follicles are cultures, spheres are formed at the area corresponding to the bulge region (Figure 3B) .\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3194/3194fig1.jpg",
