    "Preparation of equipment   Glass jars for liquid cultures The mycelia are grown in glass jars (120 ml) with an aluminium cork previously equipped with a nichrome wire enabling to suspend the fungal inoculum at the surface of the liquid solution (see Figure 1).  Preparation: first pierce the centre of an aluminium cap with a nail and a hammer. Then, cover the hole with a small amount of silicone paste and allow the paste to dry for 24 h. Cut the rubber seal in its centre with scissors and place it inside the cap. Meanwhile, cut the nichrome wire with cutting pliers in fragments 15 cm long whose one end is curved to form a kind of hook. Fill each jar with 40 ml of liquid nutrient medium. Take a nichrome wire and slip it into the hole of the cap equipped with its rubber seal through the silicone paste, as centred as possible. Screw the cap onto the glass jar and set the height of the wire just above the nutritive solution. Autoclave the jars at 121 °C for 20 min and allow them to cool before use.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171016/20171016194029_5542.jpg Figure 1.

Preparation of syringe holders, connectors for aeration and syringes 60 ml-syringes are used to rinse each mycelium before measuring either fungal 32P accumulation and/or 32P efflux from the labelled fungus into the interaction medium (IM) (see Recipes). This rinsing step is essential to avoid overestimation of 32P accumulation and/or efflux.",
    "Typically, we used 6 fungal replicates per treatment and we built homemade equipment (Figures 2 and 3) for easy handling of the mycelia.   Preparation of syringe holders (Figure 2):  Cut the different pieces of wood according to the dimensions given in Figure 2. For example, to hold 6 syringes, the top piece is 37 cm long x 6 cm wide and the one underneath is 32 cm long x 6 cm wide. Adjust and maintain the two pieces together to drill the holes in a two-by-two alignment. Afterwards, assemble all the pieces together as shown in Figure 2.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171016/20171016194140_7242.jpg Figure 2. Homemade holders to support syringes for incubation of mycelia in interaction medium    Preparation of connectors (Figure 3)  First, take an 18 G needle with a pair of tweezers, heat its collar over a flame to soften the glue and pull it with another pair of clamps. After cooling, adjust a small piece of silicone tube (1.14 mm internal diameter) of about 3 cm long on the top of the needle. Take a skirt cap and stitch 6 needles into its top and close its bottom by a 1 ml pipette tip previously cut at its finest end. If necessary, add silicone paste to fragile places to strengthen the airproof of the system. To the cut end of the blue pipette tip, add a piece of silicone tube (3.17 mm internal diameter) about 20 cm long that will be plugged later into a sterile air filter placed between the air pump and the connector (see Figure 3). Finally, place the whole system [connector + PTFE tubes + large diameter silicone tube] in an autoclavable bag and sterilize it by autoclaving (115 °C, 40 min).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171016/20171016194215_6510.jpg Figure 3.",
    "Homemade connector to aerate syringes during the incubation of mycelia in interaction medium    Preparation of syringes: remove the plunger of each syringe and discard it. Using a hot nail, drill a hole at the top of the syringe opposite to the graduations giving the volume. This hole will be used to place the microtube for aeration inside the syringe. Place all drilled syringes in an autoclavable bag and sterilize it by autoclaving (115 °C, 40 min).       Preparation of fungal cultures Note: This is done in sterile conditions, in a laminar flow cabinet. The cork-borer and the clamps are flame-sterilized and allowed to cool before use.    Step 1: Growing new cultures in solid medium from fungal stock cultures  For experiments, we use stock cultures renewed approximately every 6 months as sources of fungal material. These fungal stock cultures are grown in the dark at 25 °C on agar nutrient medium (solid N6 medium, see Recipes below) in 90 mm Petri dishes. The nitrogen (N) source in the medium (nitrate) is adapted to this fungal species as it does not grow well on ammonium, in contrast to most ectomycorrhizal species.  At the time of experiments, it is necessary to establish new fungal cultures by transferring one agar plug (7.5 mm diameter) on the centre of a new Petri dish (90 mm diameter) containing 25 ml of solid N6 complete medium, the mycelium face down on the nutritive medium to enhance the growth of the fungus. New cultures are grown for 3 weeks, in the dark, at 25 °C in an incubator.   Step 2: Growing the fungus in glass jars from solid cultures First, prepare the fungal plugs with the cork-borer by punching holes in the 3-week old mycelium agar culture.",
    "Then, unscrew the lid of a jar and hold it in one hand; take a pair of clamps in the other hand and remove a plug of fungal culture from the solid medium; prick the plug on the tip of the hook of the nichrome wire. Screw the lid properly on the jar and put the fungal plug just on the surface of the medium by slipping the nichrome wire (Figure 1A). The fungus is grown at 25 °C for two weeks.    Step 3: Growing the fungus in glass jars from liquid cultures for labelling experiments The 2-week old mycelia grown in liquid medium are then used to produce the fungal material for labelling experiments. For that, disks of the fungus are punched from the mycelium and placed on the tip of the hook of the nichrome wire, as described in step B2. This procedure avoids the presence of agar-agar in the fungal culture, as it can interfere with labelling experiments by accumulating 32P from the labelled solution and releasing 32P into the non-labelled solution. The agar-free mycelia are grown for 7 days, at 25 °C, without shaking.     P pre-treatments   Preparation of nutritive solution Prepare +P and -P nutritive liquid media for fungal pre-treatment that are N6 medium with P (supplied as NaH2PO4 1 mM, see Recipes) or without P (by omitting the addition of NaH2PO4 in the N6 medium), 40 ml per mycelium. Prepare additional N6 medium without P (100 ml per mycelium) to rinse the mycelia (see Figure 4B).   Preparation of jars Pour 40 ml of liquid medium, either +P or -P, in new jars. Screw lids without nichrome wire on the jars and autoclave them as described before. Pour also additional -P N6 medium in 1 L bottles and autoclave.",
    "Transfer of mycelia to new media Bring the flasks containing the seven-day-old mycelia into the flow laminar cabinet and the mycelium is withdrawn from the medium by slipping the nichrome wire up through the lid. The nutritive medium is allowed to drip from the fungus before the lid is unscrewed (Figure 4A).   For the -P treatment only, rinse each mycelium in -P medium by transferring it successively into a 35 mm-Petri dish containing 20 ml of fresh -P medium (Figure 4B) for 3 min. This operation is repeated four times, meaning that 5 Petri dishes are prepared for each mycelium as illustrated in Figure 5. This step is essential to eliminate the carry-over solution that would otherwise contaminate the -P solution with orthophosphate (Pi). After rinsing, transfer each mycelium into a new flask containing 40 ml of -P medium and allow them to grow for 5 additional days at 25 °C, in the dark, to get P-depleted mycelia.    For the +P treatment, transfer the mycelia just allowed to drip dry into new flasks containing 40 ml of +P medium, without rinsing. They are allowed to grow under the same conditions as -P conditions.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171016/20171016194450_3705.jpg Figure 4. Transfer of the mycelia to new media. A. the nichrome wire is first pulled through the lid to allow the solution to drip from the fungus before the lid is unscrewed. B. Then the lid is unscrewed and the mycelium rinsed five times in 20 ml P-deficient medium contained in 35 mm-Petri dishes.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171016/20171016194555_3895.jpg Figure 5.",
    "Picture of Petri dishes arranged in the laminar flow cabinet for rinsing the mycelia      Labelling with 32P   Safety precautions: take care to perform the experiments following safety precautions for the handling of Radioactive materials that are principally (i) wear gloves, a lab coat and a dosimeter to control the radiation dose received by the body, (ii) place the radioactive solutions or material behind plexiglas screens, (iii) use pipette tips with filters, (iv) throw away the radioactive solutions or materials in specific containers, (v) keep these containers behind Plexiglass screens, (vi) eliminate the waste after a period of time of at least 10 times the decay period of 32P namely 140 days and only if the radioactivity of the waste is not higher than twice the background (generally 0.8 to 1.6 counts per second).    Prepare a set of jars with lid without nichrome wire filled with 40 ml of +P medium and autoclave them at least the day before the labelling experiment. Place a Plexiglass screen and protective paper on the bench and open the jars behind the Plexiglas screen. Label the medium with 32P orthophosphate by quickly adding KH232PO4. Dilute the radio-labelled source so as to obtain an initial activity of 3.3 x 104 Bq per µmol Pi in the +P medium. Homogenize the solution by hand shaking of the jars and take a subsample (150 µl) to measure the actual radioactivity in the medium. Store the subsample in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes at -20 °C, in a Plexiglass box. Use 50 µl for radioactivity measurement.   Bring the jars with mycelia next to the jars with labelled medium. Allow the fungus to drip dry (as in Figure 4A).",
    "Put the lid with the fungus in the jar with the radio-labelled medium, screw it and slip the nichrome wire down until the fungus touches the solution surface. Allow the fungus to incubate for 16 h at 25 °C, in the dark.     Rinsing the mycelia in syringes   Place the syringes in the holders on the bench, and equip them with a PTFE microtube for aeration (Figure 6). In each syringe, pour 60 ml of interaction medium (IM) and place a collection vessel under the tap. Plug the connectors for aeration into an air pump and check whether or not IM is well aerated. However, turn off the air pump during the rinsing of mycelia. Place the Plexiglass screens in front of the holders.    Bring the jars with mycelia in the labelled solution behind the screen, one jar in front of one syringe. Allow the labelled solution to drip from each mycelium (as in Figure 4A) for about 5 min. Unscrew the cap, slip the nichrome wire with the fungus down from the cap and place it into a syringe. Bend the nichrome wire so as to hang the mycelium at a level corresponding to 20 ml (see Figure 6).   After all the mycelia are suspended in the syringes, open the tap to allow the IM to flow into the collection vessel placed under the syringe. Close the tap and pour about 30 ml of new IM in each syringe. After 5 min, open the tap again to allow the IM to flow into the collection vessel. Repeat the same operation four times, with the tap open after 10, 15, 20 and 40 min after addition of new IM. On the whole period, each mycelium is rinsed with 150 ml of IM.",
    "At each rinsing time, collect 1 ml of IM and placed it into 6 ml liquid scintillation vial to measure radioactivity.   After the 90 min-rinsing period, you can sample 6 mycelia to measure their fresh weight and their 32P contents. You can also use the mycelia for incubation with plant to measure fungal 32P efflux in the IM over time (see Becquer et al., 2017).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171016/20171016194809_6881.jpg Figure 6. Complete device used to rinse the mycelia after the labelling period. A. Syringe containing the interaction medium; B. Polycarbonate valve; C. Collection vessel; D. Mycelium; E. Nichrome wire; F. Microtube Teflon PTFE for individual aeration; G. Home-made connector for gathering 4 to 7 Teflon tubes; H. Sterile filter; I. Air pump.     Radioactivity measurements   Add 4 ml of scintillation liquid into each 6 ml-vial containing IM or labelled medium, close the vial and mix it several times upside down by hand. Make blank samples by pouring 4 ml of scintillation liquid in a vial. Measure the radioactivity using a Liquid Scintillation Counter, following manufacturer’s instructions.    To measure radioactivity in the fungus, blot each mycelium between filter paper sheets and record its fresh weights. Depending on the size of the mycelium, put it in a 6 ml- or a 20 ml-scintillation vial and add 4 or 12 ml of scintillation cocktail for counting, respectively.    Correct raw data for decay occurring during radioactivity measurement using the equation written in Excel: cpmt0 = Exp(Ln(cpmt-cpmbackground)) + (0.00003366099 x t), with cpm = counts per minute  t0 = time of the beginning of experiment t = time of cpm measurement of the sample in counter in minutes cpmbackground = cpm of solvent (blank sample) cpmt = radioactivity of the sample at time t cpmt0 = radioactivity of the sample at time t0 corresponding to the first measurement.",
    "This value is taken as the reference one for all measurements.   Transform cpm in Becquerel (Bq) using the formula:  1 Bq= 1 cpm x 0.033   Calculate the specific activity (SAi) of phosphate supplied to the fungus (replicatei) as follows, assuming that the concentration of phosphate is 1 mM: SAi (Bq/µmole Phosphate) = [(cpmt0 of labelled medium/volume used for measurement (ml)) x 0.033]   Calculate the amount of P taken up by the fungusi (replicate i) during the exposure to 32P as follows: P accumulation in fungusi (µmoles) = (cpmt0 in the fungusi x 0.033)/SAi"
