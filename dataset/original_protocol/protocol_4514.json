    "The stereotactic apparatus are set up and the weight of rats are recorded before operation (Figure 1).   The rats are deeply anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in an induction chamber.   To ensure the depth of anesthesia, the rats are tested by toe pinch.   After loss of consciousness, the rats are fixed on the stereotactic frame using a nose clamp and two ear bars (Figure 1).   A temperature sensor is inserted into the rats’ anus, and the temperature of rats is maintained at 37 °C by a temperature controller.   The rats are kept anesthetized with 2% isoflurane by gas mask.   After shaving the fur, the superior surface of rat head is prepared by sterile iodophor wipes as surgical field.   A longitudinal incision is made on the surface of head to expose the bregma.   Using the stereotactic apparatus, a left point 3 mm lateral to the bregma is marked.   A burr hole through the skull is drilled at the marked point by a high speed stereotaxic drill.  Note: The Depth of the drilling depended on the experience of the operator. We can assess the damage by Immunohistochemistry.   1 μl collagenase type IV (0.25 IU/μl) is injected into corpus striatum (5 mm below the skull) by a 5 μl Hamilton syringe 26 G at a slow rate of 0.2 μl/min.   The syringe is remained at the place about 7 min after the injection is completed.   For about 7 min later, the syringe is removed slowly.   Once the syringe is removed, sterile bone wax is used to plug the hole quickly.   The skin on the surface of head is closed by using 4-0 monocryl.   The rats are removed from the stereotactic apparatus and are allowed to recover in a warmed cage with free access to food and water.",
    "Note: The recovery period is about 20-30 min.   To evaluate the rat Model of ICH induced by collagenase IV, the rats are sacrificed and the brain is cut into slices after operation to assess the volume of hematoma (see Note 3) (Figure 2A and 2B). Furthermore, the neurobehavior (Bederson test) of ICH rats is assessed (Figure 2C-2F). At last, the volume of hematoma also is analysed by MRI (Figure 2G-2H).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150718/20150718051602_6219.png Figure 1.
