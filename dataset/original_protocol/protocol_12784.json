    "1. Preparation Before O9-1 Cell Culture\nNOTE: Basal media used for O9-1 cell culture must have been conditioned by Sandos inbred mice thioguanine/ouabain-resistant (STO) mouse fibroblast cells; therefore, STO cells need to be obtained and prepared as described below before starting O9-1 cell culture.\nActive STO cell culture\nPrepare media for culturing active STO cells by making complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (embryonic stem cell culture grade), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (final concentrations are indicated).\n\t\tNOTE: STO medium is used for the cultivation of active STO feeder cells. Penicillin, streptomycin, and L-glutamine may form precipitation in storage; dissolve completely by pipetting before use.\nCoat a standard 100 mm cell culture plate with 0.1% gelatin for 30 min at room temperature. After the incubation period, aspirate the extra gelatin. Use the plate immediately after coating.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, cover the plate with STO media and leave the plate in a humidified incubator to avoid the drying of the plate (this is meant only for short-term storage and not for storing precoated plates).\nThaw the STO cells rapidly in a 37 °C water bath; wipe the cryovial with 70% ethanol before opening, and immediately transfer the whole vial of cells to a centrifuge tube.\nAdd the STO media dropwise to the centrifuge tube; the ratio by volume of the cells to media is 1:10.\nCentrifuge the cells at 180 x g for 3 min at RT.\nMix by gentle pipetting and transfer cells to the gelatin-coated plate.\nAllow STO cells to grow for 24 h in a standard incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nChange the medium (only after the cells adhere) 24 h after seeding and discard the old medium.",
    "Check STO cells every day under a microscope and passage at 80% confluency.\n\t\t\nBefore starting STO cell passaging, coat plates with 0.1% gelatin (gelatin volume equals half of growth media volume for that vessel) for 30 min at room temperature.\nTo passage STO cells, aspirate growth media and wash cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice (add PBS in an equal volume of growth media).\nAspirate PBS and add 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (adjust volume according to the vessel size); then, incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For a 100 mm plate, use 10 mL of growth media and 3 mL of trypsin solution. For a 150 mm plate, use 20 mL of growth media and 8 mL of trypsin solution. The volume of wash buffer used is equal to the volume of growth media.\nInactivate trypsin with an equal volume of STO media. Seed STO cells to new plates with a ratio from 1:3 to 1:10.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A common expanding scheme is to expand from one cryovial into one 100 mm plate, then to one 150 mm plate, then to four 150 mm plates, and finally to 16 150 mm plates.\nInactivation and freezing of STO cells\nFor preparing 2x freezing media, add the following to STO media (final concentrations are indicated): 20% FBS, 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nAfter mixing, filter sterilize the 2x freezing media (pore size 0.22 µm) and store it at 4 °C until use. Make 2x freezing media the same day of use and discard unused freezing media.\nPrepare mitomycin C solution in PBS at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. To dissolve mitomycin C in PBS, tape the bottle on a vortexer and vortex at a low setting for approximately 45 min to dissolve the particles completely.",
    "NOTE: Mitomycin C is light sensitive and hard to dissolve.\n\t\tCaution: Mitomycin C is acutely toxic and may cause cancer. Handle only with proper personal protective equipment.\nInactivate STO cells by adding a final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL mitomycin C to the existing media. Incubate for 2 h inside a standard incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nWash plates (150 mm) with 20 mL PBS twice after inactivation with mitomycin C.\nAspirate the PBS solution, dissociate cells by using 8 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and incubate for 5 min inside a standard humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nInactivate trypsin with 8 mL of STO media.\nTransfer the cell solution to a centrifuge tube. Combine more than one plate into one centrifuge tube to save time. Centrifuge for 5 min at 180 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL PBS.\nUse 10 µL of the cell solution to count cells by using a hemocytometer. Count the cells in the central gridded square and multiply the number obtained by 104 to determine the number of cells per 1 mL. Count twice and average the two numbers to obtain the final estimation of the number of cells per milliliter.\nCentrifuge cells for 5 min at 180 x g.\nAspirate PBS and add 1:1 (by volume) STO media and 2x freezing media to the cell pellet. Adjust the volume for a final cell concentration of 4 x 106 cell/mL (this amount is good for one 100 mm plate).",
    "NOTE: For example, from four 150-mm plates yielding a total of 60 x 106 cells, freeze 4 x 106 cells per cryovial, with each cryovial containing 1 mL of cell solution. Four plates yield approximately 15 cryovials (60/4=15). Add 7.5 mL of STO media and 7.5 mL of 2x freezing media to the cell pellet, resuspend, and aliquot 1 mL into each cryovial.\nResuspend by slowly pipetting freezing media with cell pellet. Transfer 1 mL of cell solution to each cryovial and label accordingly.\nPlace cryovials inside a lidded polystyrene box (this provides a slow cooling rate, which improves cell survival). Transfer the box to a -80 °C freezer for at least 24 h before transferring the cryovial to liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: For best results, minimize the cell counting time, as well as the time between adding 2x freezing media to cells and transferring vials to -80 °C.\n2. O9-1 Cell Culture\nPrepare basal media for O9-1 cell culture by adding the following in DMEM (final concentrations are indicated): 15% FBS, 0.1 mM minimum essential media (MEM) nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 55 μM beta-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 103 units/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; added immediately before use, do not add to stock bottle), and 25 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor-basic (bFGF; added immediately before use, do not add to stock bottle).\nFilter sterilize the basal media (pore size 0.22 µm) and wrap in foil to protect from light.\nCollect conditioned basal media from inactivated STO cells.\n\tNOTE: Proceed only after obtaining inactivated STO cells. O9-1 basal media collected from STO cell plates is hereafter referred to as conditioned basal media.",
    "Thaw inactivated STO cells rapidly as described above (one cryovial containing 4 x 106 cells is good for one 100 mm plate and yields approximately 100 mL conditioned basal media after 10 days of collection). Seed inactivated STO cells to the gelatin-coated plate by using STO media. Allow cells to attach overnight in a standard humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\n24 h after thawing STO cells, discard the existing STO media and replace with the basal media.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not add LIF and bFGF to inactivated STO cell culture dishes; only add to O9-1 cell culture dishes.\nEvery 24 h, change media by using O9-1 basal media and collect the basal media from STO cell plates into a bottle. Wrap the bottle containing conditioned basal media in foil to protect from light. Store all the collected media at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Because the cells were inactivated, they may not appear as healthy as they did after several days of collection; this is to be expected.\nOptionally to check for contamination, collect the basal media for each collection day in different tubes (instead of one bottle) wrapped in foil. Using a 24-well plate, place 1 mL of media from each day into each well and incubate overnight in a standard incubator to check for bacterial contamination under the microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The media remains a red color if there is no contamination but changes to yellow if bacterial contamination is present.\nAfter collecting conditioned basal media for 10 days, discard the STO cells. Combine (if applicable) all collected conditional basal media and filter sterilize (pore size 0.22 µm) into a sterile bottle. Wrap the bottle in foil to protect from light. Keep the filtered conditioned basal media at 4 °C for a maximum of one month from the filter date.",
    "3. Maintaining O9-1 Cells\nNOTE: Working O9-1 basal media is filter sterilized conditioned basal media, to which LIF (final concentration 103 units/mL) and bFGF (final concentration 25 ng/mL) are added immediately to the cell culture dish before use. This media needs to be protected from light and stored at 4 °C.\nRecovery of O9-1 cells\nSlowly thaw the stock bottle of the basement membrane matrix (e.g., Matrigel) overnight at 4 °C to prepare aliquots.\nAdd 5 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS to 5 mL of the stock basement membrane matrix membrane. Mix well by pipetting with cold pipette tips stored at -20 °C. Keep the original bottle and aliquot tubes on ice. Freeze aliquots in different volumes (0.5 mL or 1 mL aliquots) depending on the experiment needs. Avoid freeze-thawing basement membrane matrix multiple times.\n\t\tNOTE: Basement membrane matrix polymerizes rapidly at room temperature; use cold pipette tips and keep tubes cold when working to avoid unintentional polymerization.\nThaw an aliquot of the basement membrane matrix at 4 °C or on ice 2 h before starting the experiment. Do not store the matrix at 4 °C for an extended time.\nUse filter-sterilized DMEM with 10% FBS to dilute the basement membrane matrix to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL to coat the plates.Coat plates with the basement membrane matrix (0.5 mg/mL) at room temperature for 1 h. Ensure that it fully covers the plate (as shown in Figure 1).\nTilt the plate when aspirating the basement membrane matrix to avoid touching the coated surface; dry plates at 37 °C for 30 min. Do not over-dry coated plates.\n\t\tNOTE: Proceed only when all media and reagents are ready to use (conditioned basal media, sterile-filtered 10% FBS in DMEM, LIF, and bFGF).",
    "Recover O9-1 cells rapidly by placing the cryovial in a 37 °C water bath; slowly swirl the vial until the solution completely turns to liquid and proceed immediately to the next step.\nTransfer all the cell solution from the cryovial (approximately 1 mL) to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Add 5 volumes of DMEM with 10% FBS (filter sterilized with a filter pore size of 0.22 µm) and resuspend.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 180 x g. Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet (by tapping) in conditioned basal media supplemented with LIF and bFGF. Count the cells by using a hemocytometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Conditioned basal media supplemented with LIF and bFGF is critical to maintain the multipotency of the O9-1 cell line. Use care to add the correct media to avoid unintentional cell differentiation.\nSeed cells from 10,000 to 15,000 cell/cm2 to a 6-well plate. Allow cells to attach and grow in a standard cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) overnight before changing media.\nEnsure that the cells are attached before proceeding to change media (healthy attached cells look like those shown in Figure 2).\nAlways change culture media the next day after the recovery of O9-1 cells (use conditioned basal media supplemented with LIF and bFGF).\nPassage of O9-1 cells\nWhen O9-1 cells reach 80% confluency, thaw the basement membrane matrix and prepare a basement membrane matrix-coated plate as described above. Add conditioned basal media supplemented with LIF and bFGF to the vessel. Alternatively, add DMEM without FBS to keep the basement membrane matrix from drying and store inside a standard humidified incubator for no more than 3 days.\nRinse the O9-1-containing wells (6-well plate) with 2 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) twice and gently pipette to avoid losing cells.",
    "Dissociate cells with 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 3 min. Neutralize trypsin with an equal amount of DMEM with 10% FBS. Repeatedly pipette the liquid over the whole surface of the well to dissociate as many cells from the plate as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: Trypsin concentration is 0.05% instead of 0.25%. Use DPBS to dilute from the stock bottle.\nAvoid generating bubbles when dissociating cells from the plate.\nTransfer all cell solution to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 180 x g. Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet in the centrifuge tube by gentle pipetting in conditioned basal media supplemented with LIF and bFGF.\nUse a hemocytometer to count the total cell number as described above. Seed cells (10,000 to 15,000 cells/cm2) to the coated plate prepared as described in steps 3.1.4 to 3.1.8. One well of a 6-well plate would require 100,000 cells to seed.\nAllow cells to attach and grow in a standard cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Always change culture media the next day after passaging O9-1 cells.\nFreezing of O9-1 cells\nTo prepare 2x freezing media for O9-1 cells, dilute the following in DMEM (final concentrations are indicated): 40% FBS and 20% DMSO.\nFilter sterilize 2x freezing media and keep it at 4 °C. The 2x freezing media must be made on the day it is used. Discard all unused freezing media.\n\t\tNOTE: Freeze O9-1 cells at 80% confluency.\nRinse wells with DPBS twice; pipette gently to avoid losing cells.",
    "Dissociate cells with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 3 min, then neutralize trypsin with an equal amount of 10% FBS in DMEM. Repeatedly pipette the liquid over the whole surface of the well to dissociate as many cells from the plate as possible.\nTransfer all plate contents to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 180 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and add 2 mL of PBS and resuspend by tapping.\nUse 10 µL of cell solution to count cells by using a hemocytometer as described above.\nCentrifuge cell solution for 3 min at 180 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and adjust the amount of basal media needed; then, add an equal amount of 2x freezing media.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells are frozen at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL (1 mL per cryovial).\nTransfer cells to cryovials and label accordingly. Place cryovials inside a lidded polystyrene box for a slow cooling rate at -80 °C for at least 24 h before transferring to liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: For best results, minimize the cell counting time and the time between adding 2x freezing media and transferring vials to -80 °C.\n4. Manipulation of O9-1 cells\nPerforming siRNA knockdown in O9-1 cells\nThaw and coat a 24-well plate with basement membrane matrix as described above (steps 3.1.4–3.1.8) before starting the experiment. Recover and seed O9-1 cells, allowing them to grow to 60% to 80% confluency.\nDilute liposomes in serum-free media according to the appropriate well volume. Dilute siRNA in serum-free media to the final. Add diluted siRNA to diluted liposomes in a ratio recommended by the manufacturer. Mix well by pipetting and incubate.\n\t\tNOTE: Follow the manufacturer's guide on the volume used, time and temperature of incubation.",
    "Add an appropriate volume of siRNA-lipid complex to cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nIncubate cells for 24 h in a standard cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Perform downstream steps as appropriate (extract RNA, extract proteins, staining, etc.)\n\t\tNOTE: siRNA knockdown times and concentrations can vary depending on the individual experiment.\nPerforming gene knockout in O9-1 cells by using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing\n\tNOTE: Refer to the previously published protocol for using CRISPR-Cas9 in mammalian cell lines29. Provided here is a simplified description of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and related steps.\n\t\nObtain sgRNA sequences by using a sgRNA design tool.\nLigate the sgRNA to pSpCas9(bb)-2a-GFP vector30.\nTransfect O9-1 cells with the vector by using a standard lipofection protocol according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nIncubate cells in a standard cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nPerform fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on GFP/7-AAD. Seed GFP+ single cells into 96-well plates.\nGrow the cells in the incubator for an additional 4 days. Discard all wells that have more than one colony.\nPerform PCR with primers designed for detecting the deletion. After PCR, run PCR products on an agarose gel to evaluate the band size. Validate the knockout efficiency achieved by using CRISPR-Cas9 editingby performing Western blotting (an example of Yap knockout results is shown in Figure 3).\n5. O9-1 cell differentiation\nDifferentiation of O9-1 cells into osteoblasts\nTo prepare osteogenic differentiation media, dilute the following in alpha-MEM (final concentrations are indicated): 0.1 μM dexamethasone, 100 ng/mL bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid, 10 mM b-glycerophosphate, 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.\nDetect the osteoblast marker, osteocalcin, in differentiated osteoblasts by immunostaining as shown in Figure 4.",
