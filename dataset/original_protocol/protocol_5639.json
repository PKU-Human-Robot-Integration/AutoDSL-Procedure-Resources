    "All fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C and 70% humidity with a 12 h dark/light cycle on standard fly food. All experiments were performed using 3rd instar larvae at 96 h (hours) after egg laying (AEL). In order to ensure that all larvae were about the same age, the egg laying was restricted to 4-6 h. Experimental crosses were raised on standard fly food at 25 °C with 70% humidity and a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Prepare your genetic crosses 2 days before staging with approx. 20-30 virgins and 10-15 males each (more if you are using weak genotypes). After 2 days, transfer flies to a fresh food vial for timed egg-laying for 4-6 h at 25 °C (Figure 1A). Transfer the adult flies to a fresh vial (for another round of staging on the same or next day). The original vial is maintained at 25 °C until 96 ± 3 h AEL. All larvae should be in the third instar (L3) foraging stage and not yet leaving the food (Figure 1B).Note: Precise staging is important, as nociceptive responses of larvae are reduced after 120 h AEL, likely due to the transition to the wandering stage and preparation for pupariation. The density of larvae in the food will also affect staging: too few animals cannot efficiently process the food, while having too many larvae will result in competition for food, both of which is affecting developmental progression and will broaden the developmental stage of the larval population. In case mutant animals with delayed development are used staging has to be adjusted accordingly (staging either by animal size or molting counting mouth hook teeth). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210225945_4169.jpgFigure 1. Correct staging and larval density. A. A photograph showing appropriate embryo numbers for the used vial size (approx.",
    "100-150 embryos laid within 4-6 h). B. At 96 h AEL, larvae should have processed the food well and still be in the foraging stage.Tool preparationCut the omniflex monofilament fishing line (Shakespeare, 6 lb test, diameter 0.009 inch [0.23 mm]) to a length of 18 mm. 10 mm is attached to a toothpick such that 8 mm of the fiber protruded from the end of the toothpick (Figure 2A). Calibrate the force of the fiber by using it to depress a balance until the fishing line is seen to bend. Record the force (in grams) and convert to milli-Newtons (mN) by multiplying the measured grams by a factor of 9.81. Typically, this length of filament results in a force of 45-50 mN (Figures 2B-2D). Varying the filament length will change the mechanical force (the longer, the less the force), which might be desirable if different forces should be tested. The probability of nociceptive responses of larvae increases with the applied force from 30 to 120 mN (Kim et al., 2012; Almeida-Carvalho et al., 2017). Examine the filament under a stereoscope and make sure that no sharp edges remain, which might potentially injure the animal. Puncturing the body wall will result in altered behavioral responses.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210230110_1482.jpgFigure 2. Tool preparation and calibration. A. 8 mm filament attached to toothpick prepared according to instructions above. B-D. Calibrating the filament: the filament should exert a force of 45-50 mN (4.59-5.10 g). B. Repeated depression of the filament should result in comparable forces (here 46 ± 5 mN). B’. Replicable forces are achieved by correct pressure and bending of the filament at the right angle as shown (approx. 45-60°). C’. Too little pressure and/or wrong angle of deflection result in lower forces. C’. Too much pressure and/or wrong angle of deflection result in too high forces.",
    "Distribute 2 ml of dH2O on a 2% agar plate to create a thin water film, which enables the animals to crawl freely and perform their rolling behavior. Without water, the larvae are not fully mobile and do not display consistent behavioral responses.Prepare 10-20 staged larvae by washing in dH2O to remove any residual food and place them gently on the agar plate using a brush (Figures 3A-3D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210230154_5022.jpgFigure 3. Preparation of mechanonociception assay. A and B. The assay is prepared by gently placing 10-20 staged 3rd instar larvae on a 10 cm 2% agar plate using a brush. C. A thin water film of 2 ml (colored magenta for illustration) is necessary for consistent behavioral responses. D. Agar plate with test animals is placed under a stereoscope with a light source. E. Illustration of a 3rd instar larvae. Boxed region indicates the dorsolateral region of abdominal segments A3-A6, which should be targeted with the filament calibrated to the chosen force (30-120 mN). F-H. Examples of correct and incorrect placement of the filament on the larva are shown. F. Correct placement on dorsolateral A3 region. G. Wrong placement with animal moving away from filament resulting in a bad angle for the stimulus. H. Filament placement at an anterior segment which generally does not elicit rolling behavior.Deliver the mechanical stimulus by rapidly depressing the larva with the filament on the dorsal side (abdominal segments four, five, or six) for approximately 1 sec. The quick release allows the larvae to perform escape behavior. Reapply the stimulus to the same larva after a pause of 2-3 sec.Score the response immediately on a scoring sheet according to Hwang et al.",
    "(2007): no response, stop, stop and turn (non-nociceptive responses), or rolling (nociceptive response); in addition, we introduced bending to score for an incomplete nociceptive response (C-shaped simultaneous convulsive head and tail movements) that did not result in rolling (response classification: 1 = no response, 2 = stop, 3 = stop and turn, 4 = bending, 5 = rolling). A positive rolling response is scored if at least one 360° rotation along the body axis occurred in response to the mechanical stimulus (Figures 4A-4D; Videos 1 and 2). Note: To develop and entrain precision in applying the correct force to the animal the experimenter should practice the correct motion on a balance. Hold the toothpick with the filament and depress the filament at a 45-60° angle until it bends, which should result in a consistent force every time. Practicing with control animals will further ensure consistent results. 50-70% of the animals should respond with rolling escape behavior after the 2nd stimulus.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210230247_7053.jpgFigure 4. Behavioral responses to mechanonociceptive stimulation. A. Montage of nociceptive rolling response after mechanical stimulation. Note that the larva performs a full 360° roll along the body axis as visible following the main trachea. B. Montage of a partial nociceptive response (‘bending’) resulting in C-shaped body bending but no full 360° roll. C. Montage of stop and turn response (stop and at least 45° change in direction). D. Montage of stop response (no major change in direction of movement).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
