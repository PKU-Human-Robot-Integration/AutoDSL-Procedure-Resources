    "Approval by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee must be obtained, indicating that your protocol follows the guidelines of your institution's animal research ethics committee.\n1. Anesthesia and Pre-operative Procedures\nAnesthetize male Wistar rats, weighing around 200 g, with vaporized 3% isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen administered into an acrylic induction chamber.\nConfirm adequate anesthesia through a lack of reaction to a toe and tail pinch. Place ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while the animals are under anesthesia. Position the each rat supine on the plastic operation plate and position a silicone mask to deliver vaporized 2 - 3% isoflurane by continuous inhalation. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nWhile wearing sterile gloves, remove the ventral abdomen hair using a hair remover. Buprenorphine, either subcutaneously or intraperitoneally, is frequently given at this point.\n2. Operative Procedures\nPatch venoplasty\nBefore the surgery, trim the bovine pericardial patch using a microscissor to a 3 mm x 1.5 mm x 0.6 mm size. Soak the patch in 10 mL of sterilized saline for 5 min in a cell culture dish.\nPrepare the incision site with a topical antiseptic according to your institutional protocol and apply a surgical drape. Use sterile gloves and instruments to maintain aseptic technique throughout the surgery. Â Local anesthesia can be injected into the site of the planned skin incision.\nUsing a scalpel, make a midline abdominal incision extending from the level of the xiphoid to just above the pubis.\nInsert a retractor and eviscerate all bowels from the abdominal cavity towards the right side. Wrap the bowels in gauze soaked with saline.",
    "Expose the infrarenal vena cava (IVC). The site of patch implantation is approximately 2 mm below the level of the origin of the renal veins; dissect the IVC free at this site. Ligate and divide all lumbar and tributary veins at this level using 6-0 nylon sutures.\nPlace two microsurgery clips across both the proximal and distal infarenal IVC. Perform a venotomy with a 25 G needle by puncturing the anterior wall of the IVC, and then extend it to around 3 mm using scissors (Figure 1A).\nClose the venotomy with the patch using running or interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures (Figure 1B).\nComplete the venoplasty closure. Remove the distal clamp first to vent the patch and then remove the proximal clamp to restore blood flow to the IVC.\nConfirm hemostasis by observing for 30 s without compression. Return the bowels to their natural position. Close the abdomen with a running suture according to approved animal protocols.\nPatch arterioplasty\nBefore the surgery, trim the bovine pericardial patch using a microscissor to a 3 mm x 1.5 mm x 0.6 mm size. Soak it in sterilized saline.\nPrepare the incision site with a topical antiseptic and apply a surgical drape. Use sterile gloves and instruments to maintain aseptic technique throughout the surgery.\nUsing a scalpel, make a midline abdominal incision extending from the level of the xiphoid to just above the pubis.\nInsert a retractor and eviscerate all bowels from the abdominal cavity towards the right side. Wrap the bowels in gauze soaked with saline.\nExpose the aorta. The site of patch implantation is approximately 2 mm below the level of the origin of the renal arteries; dissect the aorta free at this site. Ligate and divide all lumbar arteries at this level using 6-0 nylon sutures.",
    "Clamp the infrarenal aorta. Use a 25 G needle to perform an arteriotomy by puncturing the anterior wall of the aorta, and then extend it to around 3 mm using scissors (Figure 1C).\nClose the arteriotomy with the patch using running 10-0 nylon sutures (Figure 1D). Complete the arterioplasty closure. Remove the distal clamp first to vent the patch and then remove the proximal clamp to restore blood flow to the aorta.\nConfirm hemostasis by observing for 30 s without compression. Return the bowels to their natural position. Close the abdomen with a running suture according to approved animal protocols.\n3. Post-operative Procedures\nAfter the closure of the abdomen, discontinue the anesthesia. Apply post-operative care, including analgesia and wound care, in accordance with instructions recommended by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nFor analgesia, use buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly no less than every 12 h for 24 h following the surgical procedures. Check the status of the animal every day in the animal room, ensuring proper recovery from the peri-operative period as well as adequate treatment of post-surgical pain. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
