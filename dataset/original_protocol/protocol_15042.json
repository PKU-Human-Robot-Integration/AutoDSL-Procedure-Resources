    "Ethical use and care of animals statement:\nAll animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with European Union and German laws (Tierschutzgesetz) and adhered to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. All animal experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee of the TU Dresden and the Landesdirektion Dresden (approval number: 24D-9168.11-1/2008-33).\n1. Before Starting Cell Dissociation and Cell Sorting\nLabel three 15 ml reaction tubes with: Wash (W), Positive fraction (+) and Negative fraction (-).\n2. Retina Dissociation\nDecapitate the PN 4 pups using a scissor.\nRinse the head of the pups shortly in 70% ethanol followed by washing in PBS.\nTransfer the head to cold HBSS and enucleate the eye (repeat this step for all of the heads). To enucleate, open the eyelids and fixate the eye with curved forceps at the optic nerve region. Then pull the eye carefully out of the orbit.\nAfter enucleating all the eyes, isolate the retina: introduce a closed scissor into the optic nerve and open the blades. Peal the RPE/chorid out. Remove the lenses and blood vessels using curved forceps.\nTransfer the isolated retinas into a 1.5 ml reaction tube containing the papain solution (provided by the papain dissociation kit).\nIncubate the retinas in the papain solution for 30-60 min in a water bath or shaker (400 rpm) at 37 °C.\n\t\t\nWhile retinas incubate in the papain solution, pipette 1 ml of ovomucoid solution to a 15 ml reaction tube (label \"1\").\nAdd 60 µl of DNase I (10 mg/ml) + 60 µl of ovomucoid solution (provided by the kit) + 520 µl of EBSS to a 15 ml reaction tube (label \"2\").\nAfter papain incubation, transfer the papain solution containing the partially digested retinas to reaction tube \"2\".",
    "Using a fire polished pipette, perform mechanical dissociation (10x up and down).\nPipette the single cell suspension to reaction tube \"1\". Try to generate 2 layers by gently layering the cell suspension on top of the ovomucoid solution.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g (approximately 1,300 rpm).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 500 µl of MACS buffer.\n3. Cell Sorting Using Magnetic Associated Cell Sorting (MACS)\nAdd X μl rat anti-CD73 antibody to the 500 µl in order to achieve a final concentration of 10 μg/ml.\nIncubate 5 min on ice.\nFill the 15 ml reaction tube to 10 ml with MACS buffer and centrifuge it for 5 min at a speed of 300 x g.\nRemove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 480 μl MACS buffer and add 120 μl of goat anti-rat IgG microbeads.\nIncubate 15 min on ice; do not agitate, shake or mix it.\nFill the 15 ml reaction tube to 5 ml with MACS buffer and centrifuge it for 5 min at 300 x g.\nAs the reaction tube is been centrifuged:\n\t\t\nAdjust an LS Column into the magnetic stand.\nPut the preseparation filter on top of the LS Column.\nHydrate the preseparation filter and the LS Column with 3 ml MACS buffer and collect the MACS buffer into the wash (W) tube.\nRemove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μl MACS buffer.\nLoad the 500 μl cell suspension to the filter, then add 1 ml MACS buffer to the filter and collect the negative fraction into the negative fraction (-) reaction tube.\nNext, add 3 x 3 ml of MACS buffer to the column to wash off the cells that are not bound to the column",
    "Once these 9 ml are through the LS Column, remove the column from the magnetic stand and install it on top of the positive fraction (+) reaction tube.\nQuickly load 5 ml of MACS buffer into the LS Column and put the plunger in the LS Column and press it down until the entire buffer is through the column.\nCentrifuge the reaction tube containing the positive fraction for 5 min at 300 x g.\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend in 500 µl of MACS buffer and keep at 4 °C.\nCount the total amount of cells using a common cell counting device.\nPrepare a cell suspension from the positive sorted fraction containing 2 x 105 cells/µl in MACS buffer and keep at 4 °C\n4. Transplantation of MAC-sorted Photoreceptor Precursor Cells into the Mouse Retina\nMake sure to have all of the following solutions ready: 1 ml sterile PBS or HBSS, 10 µl DNAse I, 1-2 ml sterile deionized H2O, aliquots of the cell suspension fractions at 4 °C.\nAnesthetize the adult mouse (i.e. 2-4 months old) with an intraperitoneal injection of medetomidine hydrochloride (0.01 mg/10 g body weight), ketamine (0.75 mg/10 g body weight). Then do a subcutaneous injection of Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg body weight) for pain relief.\nDilate pupils with a drop of Phenylephrin 2.5%-Tropicamid 0.5%.\nFix mouse in mouse head holder and place under stereo microscope.\nApply a drop of Visidic gel to prevent drying of the eye.\nMake a small hole at the border between sclera and cornea (respectively ora serrata) using a sterile 30 G ½ in needle.\nCut a common cover slide into small (approximately 5 mm x 5 mm) pieces using a diamond pen, place one of these pieces on top of the cornea, allowing direct visualization of the retina.",
    "Flush the presterilized microliter syringe several times with deionized water.\nLoad the microliter syringe with 1 µl of cell suspension, direct needle tangentially through the conjunctiva and sclera and place under visual control in the nasal half of the retina.\nPunch gently a hole into the retina until reaching the subretinal space, inject the cell suspension into the subretinal space.\nObserve the bullous detachment of retina, which should be uniform, covering approximately ¼ of the retinal space without any bleeding.\nWithdraw the syringe gently, the retinal hole seals automatically.\nFlush the microliter syringe several times with deionized water.\nRelease mouse from head holder.\nWake up mouse by injecting atipamozole hydrochloride for reversal of the medetomidine hydrochloride effect.\nPlace mouse for wake up time in warm dark chamber (approximately 25 °C).\nThe next 2 days after transplantation, Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg of body weight) should be administered by subcutaneous injection in the morning and in the afternoon for pain relief.\nSubscription Required.
