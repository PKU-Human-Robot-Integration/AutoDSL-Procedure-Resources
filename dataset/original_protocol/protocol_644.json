    "**Generation of NKL reporter cells by lentiviral transduction**\n1. Plate 0.5X10<sup>6</sup> 293TN cells/well into 6well plate with 2ml of DMEM \\(10% FBS) and culture in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator overnight\n  2. Prepare transfection mix:\n   OptiMEM 150μl + XtremeGENE9 6μl\n Flick and incubate for 5min at room temperature\n Add pGreenFire-NF-κB-EF1-Puro 1.67μg + pPACKH1 1.67μg\n  Flick and incubate for 30min at room temperature\n3. Transfer transfection mix dropwise into medium with cultured 293TN cells and incubate for 18hr in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator\n  4. Change medium with 2.5ml DMEM \\(10% FBS, 11mg/ml BSA) and incubate for 24hr in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator\n  5. Gently harvest 2ml of supernatant \\(1st harvest) and store at 4°C\n  6. Add another 2.5ml DMEM \\(10% FBS, 11mg/ml BSA) and incubate 24hr in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator\n  7. Gently harvest 2ml of supernatant \\(2nd harvest) and pool with 1st harvest\n  8. Centrifuge virus-containing supernatant pool at 1250rpm for 5min to exclude debris.\n  9. Add 10μg/ml polybrene and 200U/ml recombinant human IL-2 to virus-supernatant\n  10. Resuspend 0.5X10<sup>6</sup> NKL cells \\(2 days after split) with 2ml of virus-supernatant, transfer to 12 well plate and incubate for 10min in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator\n  11. Seal the plate with parafilm and centrifuge at 700g for 30min at 32°C \\(1st spin-infection)\n  12. Remove parafilm and incubate for 3hr in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator\n  13. Seal the plate with parafilm and centrifuge at 700g for 30min at 32°C \\(2nd spin-infection)\n  14. Remove parafilm and incubate for 4hr in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator\n  15. Centrifuge at 1400rpm for 5min to remove supernatant and resuspend transduced NKL cells with 10ml of NKL culture medium \\(RPMI1640, 10% FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 200U/ml IL-2)\n  16. Transfer cell suspension to T25 flask and incubate in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator\n  17. At 2 days after infection, add 1μg/ml puromycin",
    "18. At 3 days after infection, centrifuge cells at 1400rpm for 5min and resuspend with 10ml of NKL culture medium with 1μg/ml puromycin and transfer to T25 flask\n  19. Maintain transduced cells with NKL culture medium containing 1μg/ml puromycin by splitting cells with 3days interval\n  20. Further select transduced NKL cells showing upregulation of GFP after TNF-α \\(10ng/ml) treatment by sorting with FACSAria\n  \n**NF-κB reporter assay with NKL reporter cells**\n1. Prepare 5μg/ml stimulating antibodies specific for NK receptors in PBS\n  2. Pipette 100μl/well in flat-bottom high-binding 96well plate\n  3. Cover plate with sealing tape and incubate overnight at room temperature\n  4. Resuspend NKL cells, those are rested for 24hr in NKL resting medium \\(RPMI1640, 5% FBS, 0.5mM sodium pyruvate, without IL-2) following 2days culture after split, with NKL resting medium at 2X10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml\n  5. Empty plate contents and wash wells 3 times with 240μl/well of PBS\n  6. Pipette resuspended NKL cells 100μl/well in antibody-immobilized plate\n  7. Cover plate with lid and incubate for 6hr in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator\n  8. Place the plate on ice, harvest from each wells and transfer cells into each 1.5ml eppendorf-tubes\n  9. Place 1.5ml eppendorf-tubes on ice and add 500μl/sample of FACS buffer \\(DPBS, 1% FBS)\n  10. Centrifuge at 2000rpm for 5min at 4°C and remove supernatant\n  11. Resuspend cells with 200μl of FACS buffer and analyze the upregulation of GFP with FACS Accuri"
