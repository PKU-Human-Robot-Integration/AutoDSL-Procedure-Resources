    "The experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the European Community and local laws and policies (Directive 2010/63/EU), and all the procedures were approved by the Food and Veterinary Service, Riga, Latvia.\n1. Heart staining and slicing\nNOTE: Techniques described in this protocol can be used after both Langendorff-perfused isolated rat or mouse heart6,7 and in vivo rat heart IR injury assays8,9,10,11. For staining after an in vivo IR injury assay, it is assumed that the heart is excised, mounted on a cannula, and briefly perfused in the Langendorff perfusion mode.\nDetach the heart cannula from the syringe filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution and connect it to a syringe filled with a warm (37 °C) solution of 0.1% methylene blue in Krebs-Henseleit solution. Use a 5 mL syringe for rat hearts and a 1-2 mL syringe for mouse hearts.\n\tNOTE: An alternative is to fill the pressure- or flow-controlled (e.g., Langendorff) apparatus with a blue dye-containing solution. During the detachment and mounting procedure, it is essential not to leave any air bubbles in the cannula and not loosen the suture used for coronary artery reocclusion.\nFurther perfuse rat hearts with 4 mL of the methylene blue solution at a rate of ~4 mL/min and perfuse mouse hearts with 1 mL of methylene blue solution at a rate of ~0.5-1 mL/min.\n\tNOTE: Based on experience, both techniques are safe and provide adequate staining; however, using a pressure-controlled pump/hydrostatic pressure system is a more time-consuming but safer option against overstaining for novice scientists.\nDisconnect the cannula from the syringe and remove the heart from the cannula.",
    "Remove excess methylene blue by gentle rolling of the heart on tissue paper. Loosen the ligature around the coronary artery by opening the hemostatic forceps and removing the plastic tubing from the surgical suture only after removing excess methylene blue.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, it is possible to place the mouse heart in a small plastic bag or a 5 mL centrifuge microtube in the freezer (-20 °C) for up to 5-10 min. Maximal freezing time should be determined experimentally in each laboratory. Short-term freezing of a mouse heart can help a novice experimenter cut it into 1-mm-thick slices. The freezing of rat hearts is not recommended. Overfreezing for more than 10 min at -20 °C must be avoided.\nPlace the stained rat heart in a stainless-steel matrix (see the Table of Materials) for heart slicing (Figure 1A). Then, cut the ventricles of the heart into 2-mm-thick slices (aim for 6-7 slices of an adult rat heart). For mouse hearts, cut the ventricles of the heart into 1.5-mm-thick slices (aim for at least 4 slices of an adult mouse heart).\n\tNOTE: Slicing matrix-compatible razor blades must be used. In general, compatible single-edge razor blades (e.g., thickness of up to 0.01 inch (0.254 mm)) can be used for slicing rat hearts. Double-edge razor blades are generally used for mouse hearts and are usually up to 0.004 inches (0.1 mm) in thickness.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62942/62942fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Matrices for the rat heart and brain slicing.

    "After cutting, transfer the slices to a 15 mL plastic tube. Add 5 mL of 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the tube with the heart slices, and incubate for 10 min in a water bath at 37 °C.\nAfter incubation in TTC solution, wash the heart slices at least 2-3 times with PBS and prepare for image capture.\n2. Brain staining and slicing\nAfter the middle cerebral artery occlusion experiment3,12, remove the brain, including the brainstem, from the skull, and wash it in ice-cold PBS.\nChoose the correct size of the brain stainless-steel matrix (see the Table of Materials) depending on the weight of the animals (Figure 1B). Place the brain with its ventral side up in the brain matrix.\n\tNOTE: When seated in the matrix, the brain's ventral surface must be parallel to the top surface of the mold.\nUsing blades, restrict the frontal and caudal parts (2 blades from both sides) of the brain.\n\tNOTE: Slicing matrix-compatible razor blades must be used. In general, a compatible, single-edge razor blade (thickness of up to 0.01 inch (0.254 mm)) can be used for rat brain slicing.\nPut the blades partially (not fully cutting the brain) into the channels between the first and the last blades. When all the blades are inserted and arranged in parallel, press all the blades down with the palm at the same time to cut the brain into 2 mm coronal slices.\nGrasp the blades firmly along the sides with two fingers and remove them together with the sliced brain from the matrix.\nArrange the brain slices one by one in a tray (70 mL, 72 x 72 mm). When arranging the slices, ensure that the anterior surface of each slice is always facing up.",
    "Pour warm (+37 °C) 1% TTC solution in PBS onto the brain slices, and incubate them for 8 min at 37 °C in the dark.\n\tNOTE: The brain slices must be fully immersed in TTC solution during the incubation.\nAfter incubation in 1% TTC solution, transfer the brain slices to the blue plastic tray to capture images. Arrange the brain slices in sequential order from the frontal to the caudal part, and use a scalpel to separate the hemispheres in the sagittal plane.\n\tNOTE: The surface of the tray should be washable, matte, and of a color that contrasts brain slices (i.e., not red, white, or pale pink).\n3. Macro photography\nPhotograph the tissue slices immediately after staining.\n\tNOTE: Heart slices can be stored in cold PBS (at +4 °C) or formalin solution for up to 30 min. Brain slices can be stored in formalin for a prolonged period (1-2 weeks).\nSet up the camera of choice with a charged battery, memory card, and attached lens on a stand (Figure 2)\n\tNOTE: Turn the lights on at least 5-10 min before image acquisition to warm up the equipment. LED lights reach full brightness in microseconds.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62942/62942fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Camera and lights set up for macro photography. Camera is perpendicular to the imaging surface to ensure that the focal plane of the camera is parallel to the samples. Abbreviation: LED = light-emitting diode.

    "Switch the camera to fully manual mode, set the ISO 100 and aperture to f/10, and adjust the shutter speed for optimal image exposure. Ensure that the camera focal plane is parallel to the surface where the sample will be placed.\n\tNOTE: Histogram function is useful to ensure that tissue slices are not overexposed.\nAttach or enable a wired or wireless remote trigger to prevent camera shake when the shutter is released.\n\tNOTE: An alternative is to enable a delayed shutter function, which will delay the trigger for 2 or 10 s after pressing the trigger button.\nImmerse the heart slices completely in a container with PBS.\n\tNOTE: Immersed slides tend to float away from their position. To minimize floating of the slices, use the smallest possible tray into which all slices can fit and the minimal amount of immersion solution, ensuring that the specimen is fully immersed. Alternative methods include placing the slices between glass slides or using a polarizing filter on the lens. A circular polarizing filter is attached to the lens and rotated until reflections in a live-view display of the camera disappear.\nArrange the brain slices in a dry tray without PBS or other liquids.\n\tNOTE: A polarizing filter is very convenient to capture images of brain slices.\nPlace the container with slices under the camera with the macro lens and ensure that all slices fully fit in the field of view. Ensure that the slices are on the same plane, i.e., not curved or rolled.\nCheck the exposure and adjust the camera settings if needed.\n\tNOTE: Once set, do not change the exposure and other settings during the entire experiment.\nCapture the number (or other identification) of the sample and image the tissue slice using a remote trigger.",
    "NOTE: A size marker, such as a mm ruler, should be included in the field of view when absolute quantification of specimen size is necessary.\nRotate the slices and capture their images from the other side."
