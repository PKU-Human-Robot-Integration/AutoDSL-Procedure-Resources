    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing IdU and CldU labeled genomic DNA in agarose plugs – day 1\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIn this major step, 2 thymidine analogs, CldU and IdU, are added to cells sequentially to label replicating DNA. Then genomic DNA is purified in agarose plugs in order to prevent DNA breakage and obtain very long DNA fibers.\nReplace medium of the HCT116 cells in 6 well-plates with 2 mL pre-warmed fresh medium containing 25 μM of CldU (add 100 mM CldU stock solution to the pre-warmed medium before adding to cells). Incubate for 20 min in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Pre-warmed medium avoids perturbing or slowing of DNA replication. Minimize the time cells spend outside of the incubator. With this protocol, there is no need to wash with PBS during medium changes.\nNote: HCT116 cells are small and do not spread sparsely on the culture surface. Therefore, 6-well plates are sufficient to obtain enough cells for combing. For some larger cells and/or cells that are spreading very sparsely on the plate surface, for example, fibroblast cells, use larger containers such as 10 cm dishes or flasks.\nCompletely aspirate the CldU-containing medium and add 2 mL pre-warmed fresh medium containing 100 μM of IdU (add 100 mM IdU stock solution to the pre-warmed medium before adding to cells). Incubate for 20 min in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nOptional: Completely aspirate the medium and add 2 mL pre-warmed fresh medium containing 200 μM of thymidine. Incubate for 60 min in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. This step prevents the formation of single strands of ongoing forks on the IdU labeled DNA, which can significantly reduce mechanical breaks at IdU-labeled DNA fibers.\nHarvest cells.",
    "Trypsinize cells at 20°C–37°C, monitoring the cells periodically under a microscope. Once cells round up, stop the trypsin digestion immediately with 2 mL of cold DMEM containing 10% FBS to keep cells healthy.\nTransfer cells to 15 mL centrifuge tubes and spin at approximately 220 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nWash cells once with 10 mL cold PBS. Resuspend the cells in cold PBS at 1 × 106/mL.\nCritical: To avoid DNA degradation, it is critical to keep cells cold at all times after the trypsin digestion till the cells embedded in plugs are in lysis buffer.\nCritical: Make sure to count cells and use an accurate and consistent cell number for all the samples to obtain similar DNA densities on all slides.\nNote: We normally use 5 × 104 cells per plug. It could be adjusted to have the best fiber density using 2.5–10 × 104 cells per plug (Resuspend the cells in cold PBS at 0.5 to 2 × 106/mL). If cell number is limited, the minimal number of cells that yield interpretable results could be as low as 1 × 104 cells/plug.\nNote: Cell number is critical for optimal fiber density. The number above is optimized for HCT116 cells, but we have used similar densities in all diploid or pseudo-diploid cells. Confluence depends on the tissue culture conditions and cell size – cells should not be too crowded to facilitate a larger S-phase fraction. For polyploid cells, fewer cells should be used in the protocol and the exact number should be determined empirically for cancer cells with unstable karyotypes.",
    "Add 0.35 mL of 1.5% of LMP agarose, which is kept in a 50°C water bath before use, to an Eppendorf tube. Mix cells completely by pipetting, then transfer 0.35 mL cells to the Eppendorf tube with the same volume agarose and mix cells completely by pipetting again. Fill plug molds with the cell-agarose mixture, about 90–100 μL/plug, 6 plugs per sample.\nNote: Typically, only one plug is needed for the following steps. We usually prepare 3-6 plugs/samples as backups. One plug per sample is fine for limited material.\nCritical: In this step, genomic DNA is prepared in low melting point (LMP) agarose plugs to preserve the long DNA fibers and prevent mechanical shearing. Mix cells with agarose thoroughly to ensure that cells are distributed homogeneously in the plugs.\nLet agarose plugs solidify for 20–30 min at 4°C. Transfer all the 6 plugs from one biological sample directly into one 15 mL tube containing 2 mL of plug lysis buffer (1 mg/mL proteinase K is added to lysis buffer right before use) (see the picture below for the procedure required to make and transfer plugs to 15 mL tubes) Incubate 16–18 h at 50°C in a water bath. Gentle rocking is helpful, but not essential.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1560-InFig2.jpg\nNote: Transfer the agarose plugs to the agarose plug lysis buffer ASAP once agarose is solid. It’s not necessary to let the plugs to solidify for more than 30 min. Too long time could lead death and DNA degradation.\nRelease purified DNA from agarose plug-day 2\nTiming: 8–20 h\nIn this major step, the day 1 prepared agarose plugs are melted, and the melted agarose is degraded by β-agarase to release the purified long genomic fibers into MES solution.\nWash plugs.\nDiscard plug lysis buffer.",
    "Rinse plugs once with 10 mL of TE buffer per tube.\nWash plugs 3 times on a rocker with a low speed (about 80 rpm) at room temperature using 10 mL of TE per tube. 1 h per wash.\nStore plugs in TE buffer at 4°C. DNA in plugs are stable for at least 1 year at 4°C.\nCritical: Make sure all buffers and containers are DNase free from this step until the completion of the immunostaining steps. Even residual DNase can shorten the DNA fiber length before combing.\nTransfer a single plug to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1.6 mL of 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5. Melt the agarose plugs at 70°C by incubating them for 20 min in a heating block.\nNote: Agarose plugs are melted, and DNA is released to the MES solution. After the 20-min 70°C heating step, the samples should be manipulated very gently to avoid mechanical DNA shearing.\nLet the solution cool to 42°C by leaving the tubes for 10 min in a 42°C water bath, then add 2 μL of β-agarase to each sample and incubate 16–18 h to remove the melted agarose in the MES solution.\nNote: The β-agarase digestion time can be as short as 4 h.\nDNA combing and immunodetection-day 3 - day 4\nTiming: about 8–24 h\nIn this major step, we first comb the genomic DNA in MES solution onto a silanized coverslip by a combing machine, then check DNA fiber quality by YOYO-1 staining. If DNA fibers are sufficiently long, we continue the immunostaining procedure to detect CldU, IdU and single-strand DNA to trace replication signals and DNA fibers.",
    "Carefully pour the DNA solution from the 2 mL Eppendorf tube into a Teflon reservoir, which can hold about 1.7 mL solution. A little residual solution in the tube that is hard to pour out is OK.\nNote: To avoid DNA shearing, don’t use pipetting to transfer DNA.\nDNA is combed onto a silanized coverslip by a combing machine (see the combing machine picture in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section). Silanized coverslips held by the coverslip holders slowly dip into the Teflon reservoirs containing the DNA solution and incubate for 1–2 min, then slowly pull it out.\nStain the coverslip with YOYO-1 by dropping the coverslips into YOYO-1 solution and incubate for 1 min. Check the length of DNA fibers under a fluorescent microscope (most fibers should be >300 kb) and verify that DNA fiber density is appropriate (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1560-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. DNA fibers stained by YOYO-1\nDNA purified in agarose plugs was stretched on silanized coverslips, stained with YOYO-1 for 1 min. DNA was visualized by an Olympus fluorescent microscope with a 60× objective lens to evaluate fiber density.\n(A–D) Representative images with appropriate and unsatisfactory fibers are shown.\nNote: We use a Coulter counter analyzer sample cup to hold the 10 mL YOYO-1 solution. The coverslip can be dropped in vertically (standing, to facilitate removal), and just submerged (see picture below; the red tape on the coverslip is a label for easy visualization). Other small cups/bottles with similar diameter are fine.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1560-InFig3.jpg",
    "Note: Since the DNA solutions for all samples in the same experiment are prepared concomitantly under the same conditions from plating the cells to preparing the DNA solutions, and the same number of cells are used to make plugs, the DNA concentration of all samples should be very similar. It’s not necessary to perform YOYO-1 staining for all the samples. You may randomly choose one sample’s DNA solution to comb a coverslip and stain with YOYO-1 to check the DNA density and length. This will save time and coverslips.\nNote: Optimizing the length of coverslip incubation with the DNA solution (step 10) somewhat helps to improve DNA fiber density. Increase the incubation time to increase density and vice versa. Repeating step 10 also helps to increase fiber density.\nNote: If needed, it is possible to increase fiber density by combining up to two plugs in step 7 or to decrease fiber density by using half a plug or diluting the DNA with 0.1 M MES. The best way to control DNA fiber density on the coverslip is to use a consistent and accurate number of cells in step 3.\nIf fiber density and length are both appropriate, comb a new silanized coverslip for each sample, put the coverslips in a glass staining rack, and bake for 2 h at 60°C to crosslink DNA to the coverslips.\nNote: Repeat the combing step to obtain additional combed coverslips per sample as needed.\nDNA denaturation.\nPour about 150 of 0.5 N NaOH to a 200 mL glass beaker.",
    "Put the cover glass staining rack holding the combed coverslips (see picture below, the red tape on coverslip is just for easy visualization) into the beaker with NaOH. The coverslips should be submerged in the 0.5 N NaOH solution and incubate for 20 min with gentle rocking.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1560-InFig4.jpg\nWash the coverslips with PBS to neutralize the NaOH for 1 min, 5 times by transferring the glass staining rack with coverslips to a new beaker containing fresh PBS.\nNote: Never put the rack with coverslips into a beaker before pouring PBS over the coverslips.\nFor blocking, incubate coverslips in a wet chamber with 25 μL of 5% BSA in PBS for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: All the blocking and antibody incubations are performed by adding 25 μL of blocking agents/antibodies on the glass slides, then putting coverslips, DNA side down, on the glass slides to form a sandwich. One glass slide can host 2 coverslips.\nCritical: To avoid a high staining background, like all the immunofluorescent staining experiments, never let the coverslips dry before completing the last wash at the end of the immunostaining.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution: mouse anti-BrdU antibody for IdU, 1:20; rat anti-BrdU antibody for CldU, 1:100 in PBS with 5% BSA. Incubate 16–18 h at 4°C in a wet chamber.\nNote: As for the blocking step, use 25 μl the above diluted antibodies per coverslip to form sandwiches between coverslips and glass slides.\nPause point: This step is considered as a pause point. The primary antibody step can be performed for 1–2 h at 20°C–25°C if you plan to complete your experiment from combing to immunodetection in one day.\nWash.\nPut the coverslip staining into a beaker containing about 150 mL PBS/T.",
    "Transfer the coverslips to the coverslip staining rack quickly once removed from the glass slides to avoid coverslip drying. Leave the beaker on a shaker with gentle shaking for 5 min.\nTransfer the coverslips on the staining rack to a new beaker with 150 mL PBS/T and leave the beaker on a shaker with gentle shaking for 5 min.\nRepeat one more time.\nPrepare second antibody solution: goat anti-rat cy5, 1:100; goat anti-mouse cy3, 1:100 in PBS with 5% BSA. Incubate coverslips with the secondary antibodies for 45 min to 1 h at 20°C–25°C in a wet chamber.\nCritical: The fluorophores for the secondary antibodies here are selected for the Genomic Vision scanner. You may choose the fluorescent dyes for all the second antibodies according to the filters on your microscope.\nWash with PBS/T for 5 min × 3 times as above for primary antibodies (step 17).\nPrepare mouse anti-single stranded DNA antibody solution by 1:200 dilution of the antibody in PBS with 5% BSA. Incubate coverslips with the diluted mouse anti-single stranded DNA antibody in a wet chamber for 1–2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: It is advantageous to use 2 secondary antibodies prepared from 2 different anti-mouse IgG subclasses and conjugated with 2 distinct fluorescent dyes matching your microscope (for example, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 for IdU (# A-21121, Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated goat oat anti-mouse IgG2a for anti-single-stranded DNA (# A-21241, Invitrogen)) This will allow the user to perform 2 rounds antibody incubations with coverslips instead of 4 rounds as above. With secondary antibodies from distinct subclasses, all the primary antibodies (anti-IdU, CldU, and ssDNA) can be mixed in one tube and incubated with coverslips. After the PBS/T wash, all the secondary antibodies can be mixed in one tube and incubated with coverslips.",
    "Wash for 5 min × 3 times with PBS/T.\nDilute goat anti-mouse (Brilliant Violet 480) in PBS with 5% BSA, 1:50, incubate for 45–60 min at 20°C–25°C in a wet chamber.\nWash for 5 min × 3 times with PBS/T.\nRinse slide with water and dehydrate the coverslips sequentially in 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol, 2 min each concentration and air dry.\nAttach coverslips to coverslip carriers and scan the coverslips.\nNote: The last 2 steps are for the Genomic Vision scanner only. For other microscopes, add mounting medium to mount the slide and visualize using fluorescent imaging after step 23."
