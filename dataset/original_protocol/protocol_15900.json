    "In this protocol, we describe in detail the steps for the guided differentiation of human iPSC into keratinocytes. As outlined in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0001], key steps include the generation of embryoid bodies (EB), the initiation of differentiation into the keratinocyte lineage through exposure of the cells to retinoic acid (RA) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4), and the selection and expansion of keratinocytes. Please note that Rock inhibitor is used at different stages during this protocol. Rock inhibitor facilitates EB formation and increases the plating efficiency of iPSC and iPSC-K. Optimal concentrations of Rock inhibitor for each of these steps were determined empirically. Prior to starting this protocol, users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the processes of culturing and passaging human iPSC (Rivera, Zhao, Ni, & Wang, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-bib-0019]). It is important to note that, even when conducted properly, a subset of cultures will fail to differentiate into keratinocytes (see “Critical Parameters”). Although the underlying reason for this is not always clear, it is important that investigators observe cultures regularly (at least every other day) to ensure they are progressing as expected. Morphological criteria are described in the protocol and shown in later figures. Investigators should also analyze expression of keratinocyte markers to ensure iPSC differentiation into keratinocytes.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/77db98de-70cb-4df3-aa9a-746ab3e64da6/cpz1408-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nTimeline for iPSC-K generation.

Prior to starting this step, coat one well of a 6-well plate with Vitronectin XF™ (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-prot-0002]).\n2. Prepare a 15-ml tube with 5 ml prewarmed mTESR™ Plus medium.\n3. Thaw one vial of frozen iPSC in a 37°C water bath until there is a small cube of ice left (∼2 min).\n4. Transfer the contents of the vial into the 15-ml tube prefilled with 5 ml prewarmed mTESR™ Plus medium.\n5. Gently invert the 15-ml tube 2-3 times to mix.\nA 10-ml serological pipette can be used for mixing, but do not use anything with a smaller diameter as this will break up the colonies.\n6. Centrifuge for 5 min at 150 × g, room temperature.\n7. Aspirate media, being careful to leave the cell pellet intact.\n8. Add 2 ml mTESR™ Plus medium supplemented with 10 µM Rock inhibitor.\n9. Gently resuspend the cell pellet using a 10-ml serological pipette.\n10. Transfer the cell suspension into one well of a 6-well plate precoated with Vitronectin XF™.\n11. Culture overnight in a cell culture incubator at 37°C.",
    "12. Change media to mTESR™ Plus without Rock inhibitor.\n13. Culture for 4-5 days in mTESR™ Plus medium. Change the medium every other day until the culture is ∼60% confluent (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/37407fcc-c3d8-43df-ac5b-bc629bde2a45/cpz1408-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nPhase-contrast images showing morphology of human iPSC colonies.

(C,D) Normal iPSC colonies surrounded by scattered spontaneously differentiating cells (circles).\nExpand hiPSC\n14. Prior to starting this step, coat two 10-cm cell culture dishes with Vitronectin XF™ and add 9 ml mTESR™ Plus medium supplemented with 10 µM Rock inhibitor per dish (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-prot-0002]).\n15. Aspirate the medium from the wells containing ∼60% confluent iPSC (step 13).\n16. Wash the wells with 3 ml Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS.\n17. Add 1 ml prewarmed Accutase™.\nAccutase™ is the preferred reagent to release cells from the culture dish as this will maintain cells in small clumps.\n18. Incubate the plates in the cell culture incubator for 3-5 min until all colonies have lifted off the plate.\nCheck under inverted light microscope to ensure all colonies have lifted off the plate.\nEnsure that cells are maintained in small clumps of ∼50-200 µm in diameter. Avoid generating a single-cell suspension as this will reduce cell viability. Loss of cell viability is judged by a strongly diminished ability to attach to the culture plate and proliferate.\n19. Collect cell clusters with a 5-ml serological pipette and transfer into a 15-ml tube prefilled with 5 ml prewarmed mTESR™ Plus medium.\n20. Invert the tubes 2-3 times to mix.\n21. Centrifuge at 150 × g for 5 min, room temperature.",
    "22. Aspirate media, leaving the cell pellet intact.\n23. Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml mTESR™ Plus medium supplemented with 10 µM Rock inhibitor.\n24. Add 1 ml cell suspension to each 10-cm dish that was precoated with Vitronectin XF™ and prefilled with mTESR™ Plus medium in step 14.\n25. Culture overnight in a cell culture incubator.\n26. Change the medium to mTESR™ Plus without Rock inhibitor.\n27. Culture to ∼60% confluency changing mTESR™ Plus medium every other day (4-5 days total).\nDuring this time, make sure to observe cultures regularly and remove cells that do not form tight clusters. Remove cells by scraping with a 200-µl filtered pipette tip. This step should be performed using an inverted light microscope placed in a laminar flow hood to maintain sterility of the cells. Wash with Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS and add fresh medium after cleaning.\nExamples of iPSC colonies with typical morphology are shown in Figures 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0002]-B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0002]\nFreeze excess iPSC using Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-prot-0003]\nGenerate single-cell iPSC suspension in preparation for embryoid body (EB) formation\nIn our experience, forming embryoid bodies as the starting point for the generation of iPSC-K is the most efficient and reproducible method.\nNote that this is the only step in the protocol where single iPSC are desired.\n28. Feed the cells with fresh mTESR™ Plus medium 1-2 hr prior to starting EB formation.\n29. Aspirate the medium and wash iPSC with 3-5 ml Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS.\n30. Add 3 ml prewarmed Accutase™.\n31. Incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\n32. Add 3 ml Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS and gently mix the cells by pipetting using a 10-ml serological pipette. It is essential to perform this step gently but thoroughly to generate a single-cell suspension for EB formation.\n33. Collect the cell suspension in a 15-ml tube.",
    "34. Centrifuge for 5 min at 150 × g, room temperature.\n35. Aspirate the medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 3-5 ml hEB medium.\n36. Count live cells as follows:, \n         \nMix 10 µl cell suspension with 10 µl trypan blue.\nCount unstained (not blue) cells using a manual or automatic cell counter.\nGenerate EBs (day 0)\n37. Prepare an AggreWell™400 plate prior to starting this step (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-prot-0004]).\n38. Prepare cell suspension of 6.5 × 106 cells in 3 ml hEB medium.\n39. Add cell suspension to 1 well of a prepared 6-well AggreWell™400 plate.\nAs 2 ml hEB medium are added to each well during plate preparation, the total volume per well will be 5 ml.\nA 6-well AggreWell™400 plate contains 5900 microwells per well. Therefore, each microwell will contain ∼900 cells.\nThe recommended cell number per microwell is 50-3,000. In our experience, ∼900 cells per microwell leads to the formation of a homogeneous population of EBs with an optimal potential to differentiate into iPSC-K.\n40. Centrifuge the AggreWell™400 plate for 5 min at 130 × g, room temperature using a plate spinner in the centrifuge.\n41. Incubate the plates for 2 days in a cell culture incubator to generate EBs. Do not disturb the plates during this time.\nNote that the EBs will not attach to the AggreWell™400 plate.\nTransfer EBs to ultra-low attachment plate (day 2)\nThe purpose of this step is to ensure expansion of the EBs without them attaching to the plate, as this could cause differentiation into unintended cell types.\n42. Create a homogeneous EB suspension by gently pipetting the medium containing the EBs using a 5-ml serological pipette.\n43. Transfer the suspension into a 15-ml tube.",
    "44. Gently wash each well with 5 ml Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS and add this to the 15-ml tube.\nThis step ensures that any remaining EBs from the AggreWell™400 plate are collected.\n45. Gently mix the EB suspension in the 15-ml tube by pipetting up and down with a 5-ml serological pipette.\nEnsure that EBs remain intact during this time.\n46. Allow EBs to settle down to the bottom of the 15-ml tube for 5-10 min (do not centrifuge the tubes at this step). You should see a large soft pellet at the bottom of the tube.\n47. Carefully aspirate media leaving about 0.5 ml of media containing the EBs.\n48. Add 5 ml of prewarmed hEB media plus 100 µM Rock inhibitor and transfer the suspension to 1 well of a 6-well ultra-low attachment microplate.\nNote that the concentration of Rock inhibitor is 100 µM for EB formation and 10 µM for iPSC culture and differentiation.\n49. Culture overnight in a cell culture incubator.\nNote that the EBs will not attach to the ultra-low attachment plates.\nSeed EBs on Collagen IV-coated plates (day 3)\nCollagen IV will facilitate the differentiation of iPSC into keratinocytes.\n50. Prepare Collagen IV-coated 10-cm plates prior to starting this step (see Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-prot-0005]).\n51. Wash EBs three times, with Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS as follows:\n         \nCollect EBs into a 15-ml tube and add 5 ml Mg/Ca-free PBS. Allow EBs to settle at the bottom of the tube (∼5-10 min). Do not centrifuge the tubes.\nCarefully aspirate the PBS, leaving about 1 ml of PBS with EBs at the bottom of the tube.\nRepeat step 51a and 51b two more times for a total of three washes.",
    "52. Plate EBs in one Collagen IV-coated 10-cm plate in 10 ml hEB medium supplemented with 10 µM Rock inhibitor and 2% ES-qualified FBS.\nAdding FBS facilitates adhesion of the EBs to the cell culture dish.\n53. Culture EBs overnight in a cell culture incubator.\nDo not disturb the plates during this time to allow the EBs to attach to the Collagen IV-coated plate.\nStart of keratinocyte differentiation (day 4-10)\nDay 4\n54. Aspirate media to remove unattached EBs\n55. Add 10 ml hEB medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), 1 µM Retinoic Acid (RA), and 10 µM Rock inhibitor\nFigures 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0003]-B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0003] show examples of EBs at day 5 of differentiation. EBs with a high potential to differentiate into iPSC-K are characterized by a smooth edge and are composed of large cells with a clearly visible nucleus (arrowheads in Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0003]-B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0003]). Dashed arrows in Figure 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0003] point to EBs that did not attach as a monolayer and will likely die.

    "Day 6 and day 8\n56. Replace the medium with 10 ml fresh DKSFM plus 25 ng/ml BMP4, 1 µM RA, and 10 µM Rock inhibitor.\nFigure 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0003] shows examples of EBs with high potential to differentiate into iPSC-K at day 7. Note the increase in cell size and pronounced cell nuclei in the cells at the edges of the EBs.\nDay 10\n57. Change the medium to DKSFM without BMP4, RA, or Rock inhibitor.\nFigure 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0003] shows an example of an EB with high potential to differentiate into iPSC-K at Day 10. Note the keratinocyte-like morphology of cells at the edges of the EB. The arrow in Figure 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.408#cpz1408-fig-0003] points to the keratinocyte-like cells. Note that these cells are larger and have acquired a cobblestone morphology.\nSelection phase for keratinocytes (day 10-30)\nThe purpose of this phase is to enrich for keratinocytes. This is accomplished by removing cells that fail to display the expected cobblestone morphology. Frequently encountered cell types that need to be removed are cells with a spindle-like shape.\n58. Feed cells with fresh DKSFM (without BMP4, RA, or Rock inhibitor) every other day between day 10 and day 30.\nDo not split the cells during this phase.\nMonitor cultures regularly during this period. Some cell death will occur, and cultures need to be washed with Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS periodically to remove dead cells.\nObserve colony growth and expansion daily to determine whether cleaning (removal of cells with non-epithelial morphology) is required.\n59. Cultures may need cleaning to remove non-keratinocytes. Cleaning should be performed by scratching non-epithelial cells off the plate using a 200-µl filtered pipette tip.",
