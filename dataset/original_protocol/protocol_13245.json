    "All research was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines with approval by the hospital's Institutional Review Board (IRB), and all subjects have provided informed consent for publication of the data collected within the context of the trial.\nNOTE: The first section of the Protocol provides a high-level overview of the CAR-T manufacturing process. The remaining sections provide the step-by-step instructions. The protocol describes the workflow using TCT software version 1.4, which is the current version as of this writing. The user interface of other versions of the TCT software may vary.\n1. Process timeline and overview (Table 1)\nPrepare for the procedure on a Monday (Day -1) with preflight checks. Ensure that the processor and other equipment are running as expected and that all reagents and consumables are available and in-date for the entire manufacturing run.\nOn day 0, install the tubing set on the machine. Thaw previously cryopreserved T cells in a dry bath and connect them by sterile welding to the tubing set installed on the instrument.\n\tNOTE: This protocol assumes that autologous T cells were collected via apheresis, cryopreserved, and stored until the start of manufacturing. While it is possible to use freshly collected T cells, this increases the logistical burden as it requires coordinating apheresis collection with CAR-T cell manufacturing. We strongly recommend using a dry-thaw process instead of a water bath to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination.\nLabel T cells with CD4 and CD8 reagents (see Table of Materials) and enrich by magnetic selection.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to omit T cell enrichment or perform it prior to loading cells onto the processor. See section 5 of the Protocol.",
    "After enrichment of CD4+/CD8+ cells, take a sample for a cell count. Seed the culture with 1-2 × 108 cells in an initial volume of 70 mL of medium (see Table of Materials) supplemented with 5% human AB serum and recombinant human IL2 (25 ng/mL).\nAdd a vial of activation reagent (a colloidal polymeric nanomatrix conjugated to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies; see Table of Materials) to activate T cells and incubate the culture without agitation for 24 h at 37 ºC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cryopreserve any leftover CD4+/CD8+ cells as backup, if desired.\n\tNOTE: In case of manufacturing failure, leftover CD4+/CD8+ selected cells may be used as starting material. If the failure is purely technical, such as contamination or operator error, and sufficient cells remain, then using leftover cells to perform an additional manufacturing run can be considered. If the quality of starting material is of concern, then a new apheresis procedure could be warranted; however, this is ultimately a clinical decision. In either case, a manufacturing failure is a significant event that should be investigated, and the sponsor and possibly regulators should be informed.\nAfter 24 h of activation, transduce T cells with lentiviral vector at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI).\n\tNOTE: It is critical to determine the lentiviral vector titer and establish an appropriate MOI before starting to manufacture clinical products. The vector titer should be determined by performing a small-scale experiment in which human primary T cells are transduced at various concentrations of the vector. Considerations for the appropriate MOI include the cost of the vector, the desired transduction efficiency, and an acceptable vector copy number. This protocol uses an MOI of 30-50% to minimize the cost of the vector and keep the average vector copy number below 8 copies per transduced cell.",
    "On Day 3, trigger the Culture Wash activity, and start low-level agitation. Increase the culture volume to 200 mL.\nOn Day 5, add 50 mL of medium to the culture, increasing the culture volume to 250 mL.\nOn Day 6 of cultivation, take a sample from the culture, and enumerate CAR-T cells by flow cytometry. Use this measurement to estimate the rate at which the culture is growing and identify the optimal time of harvest.\n\tNOTE: Each in-process sampling yields 3 mL for testing and removes 7 mL total of culture volume.\nFrom Day 7 to 13, if the culture has not been terminated, take up to two additional in-process samples on alternate days, and perform daily media exchanges to feed the growing culture. Harvest the product when the total nucleated cell (TNC) count reaches 5 × 109 and/or when sufficient cells are available for the required number of doses and release testing.\nOn the day of harvest, take an in-process sample from the actively growing culture. Use this sample for mycoplasma, endotoxin, replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) testing, vector copy number (VCN) testing, cell count, cell size analysis, flow cytometry, and gram stain.\nInitiate the final harvest program, which triggers the removal of the culture medium and a cell wash with the final formulation buffer (a sterile isotonic crystalloid solution supplemented with 4% human serum albumin; see Table of Materials). After harvest is completed, the target cell bag will hold 100 mL of cell product in final formulation buffer. Add dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 10% (v/v), aliquot the product into individual doses, and cryopreserve using a controlled-rate freezer.\n2. Day -1: Preparation and preflight checks\nVerify that CO2 gas levels and compressed air are sufficient to produce an inlet pressure of at least 20 psi on each line.",
    "Turn on the processor and confirm that there are no errors on startup. If needed, set the clock to the correct time. Shut down the processor.\nEnsure cell count, volume, and total CD4+ and total CD8+ count of the T cell starting material are known.\nEnsure there are sufficient quantities of the viral vector, reagents, and consumables for the entire manufacturing run.\nPlace a bottle of human AB serum in the refrigerator to thaw overnight.\n3. Day 0: Tubing set installation\nPrepare 3 L of processing buffer (0.5 % (w/v) human serum albumin (HSA) in phosphate-buffered saline / ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (PBS/EDTA) buffer).\nPrepare 2 L of culture medium (2 L of medium supplemented with 100 mL of human AB serum to a final concentration of 5% and two vials of recombinant human IL2 at 25 µg/vial; see Table of Materials for more information on these reagents). Transfer 10 mL culture medium into a 20 mL reagent bag and store at 4 ºC overnight.\nTurn on the instrument and select the T Cell Transduction Process (TCT) from the touch screen interface. Click Run to start the TCT process; let the instrument guide the user through the procedure using on-screen instructions and prompts.\nOn the Parameter Input screen, enter the operator's initials, the tubing set lot number, and its expiration date when prompted.\nThe Process Setup screen presents four different processes. Choose Full process (1).\n\tNOTE: Other available processes include starting from CD4+/CD8+ selected T cells (see section 5 below) and restarting a previously aborted manufacturing run.\nWhen prompted, choose two vials of selection reagent to reflect the CD4+/CD8+ selection method.\nInstall the tubing set per the on-screen instructions. Ensure all Luer connections are tight and that there are no defects in the tubing set.",
    "Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the automated upper and lower integrity tests.\n\tNOTE: An integrity test may fail due to a faulty tubing set, an incorrectly installed tubing set, or a defect in the machine's peristaltic pump. We strongly recommend having at least one additional tubing set on hand for production runs. We also recommend that a second technologist verify the correct installation of the tubing set.\nFollow the on-screen instructions for attaching the medium and processing buffer bags.\nBegin the automatic priming of the tubing set.\n\tNOTE: The TCT process must continue within 3 h after priming. Ensure T cell starting material will be ready.\n4. T cell enrichment\nWhen the Transfer cell product screen appears, begin thawing the cryopreserved T cell product.\n\tNOTE: The acceptable volume of T cells that can be added to the tubing set ranges from 50 to 280 mL. The maximum number of target (sum of CD4+ and CD8+) cells is 3 × 109, and the maximum TNC count is 2 × 1010.\nTransfer the thawed cells to a 150 mL transfer bag. Sterile weld the transfer bag to the Application bag of the tubing set.\nRemove a sample from the Application bag using the QC pouch and perform a cell count.\nConnect the CD4 and CD8 reagent vials.\nStart the selection (T cell enrichment) process.\nAfter enrichment, remove a sample of the CD4+/CD8+ selected cells from the Reapplication bag's QC pouch for cell count, flow cytometry, and cell size analysis.\n\t​NOTE: The cell count result is needed to proceed to the next step.\n5. Alternative: Starting with CD4+/CD8+ selected cells\nPrepare the Medium as described in step 3.2. No processing buffer is needed.",
    "Turn on the processor and select T cell cultivation with TS installation (3) on the Process Setup screen. Follow the on-screen instructions and prompts.\nFollowing the on-screen instructions, prime the tubing set with medium instead of processing buffer.\nWhen the \"Prepare cultivation-Connect cell product\" screen appears, begin thawing the CD4+/CD8+ selected T cells.\n\tNOTE: The minimum number of T cells (sum of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) for the process is 1.0 × 108.\nTransfer cells to a 150 mL transfer bag and dilute with medium to a final volume of 50 mL.\nSterile weld the cell suspension to the instrument's Reapplication bag.\nRemove a sample of the CD4+/CD8+ selected cells from the Reapplication bag's QC pouch for cell count and cell size analysis.\n6. Culture setup and programming of the Activity Matrix\nEnter the cell concentration and desired starting number (1-2 × 108 T cells).\n\tNOTE: The instrument will automatically pump the appropriate volume from the Reapplication bag into the culture chamber and adjust the final volume to 70 mL.\nAttach a vial of the activation reagent per the on-screen instructions.\nEnter 5% for CO2 concentration and 39 °C for culture chamber temperature.\n\tNOTE: The manufacturer recommends entering 39 °C or a value specifically calibrated for the instrument.\nSet up the Activity Matrix. Use the Enhanced feeding protocol as a starting point and modify individual steps within the protocol to user-defined specifications (Figure 2).\n\t\nEnsure that the time of Transduction activity is 24 h after seeding (Day 1).\nEnsure that the time of Culture Wash activity is 48 h after Transduction (Day 3).\nSet the time of Activate Shaker (shaker type 2) to 30 min after the start of the Culture Wash.\nDelete any Medium Bag Exchange and Waste Bag Exchange activities.",
    "Touch ok on the screen to begin cultivation.\nCryopreserve any leftover CD4+/CD8+ selected cells in the Application bag for future use, if needed.\n7. Day 1: T cell transduction\nCalculate the volume of the lentiviral vector to use based on the desired MOI.\nRetrieve the 20 mL reagent bag containing 10 mL culture medium that was stored at 4 ºC overnight (step 3.2). Thaw the vector vial and transfer the volume calculated in 7.1 into the 20 mL reagent bag.\n\tNOTE: We recommend freezing any leftover vector for retention or for research and development.\nModify the Activity matrix to set the time of Transduction to 2 min into the future. When prompted, touch ok to start the Transduction activity.\nSterile weld the vector bag to the tubing set following the on-screen instructions.\nModify the Activity matrix based on the actual time that the Transduction activity was started.\n\tNOTE: We suggest starting transduction within 20-24 h after seeding to ensure hands-on activities are performed during normal working hours.\n\t\nEnsure that the time of Culture Wash is 48 h after Transduction (Day 3).\nSet the time of Activate Shaker (shaker type 2) to 30 min after Culture Wash (Day 3).\nEnsure that the time of Media Exchange is in the afternoon (1 PM) of Day 6.\n8. Day 6: First in-process sample\nTouch the Sample button and follow the on-screen instructions to obtain a QC sample from the active culture.\nPerform cell count, flow cytometry, and cell size analyses. Send 1 mL of the sample for a Gram stain.\n\tNOTE: Cell counts should be repeated approximately every other day to monitor culture growth.\nPrepare another 2 L of culture medium (see step 3.2).",
    "Add a Medium Bag Exchange activity to the Activity Matrix, timed to start 2 min into the future. Adjust the Media Exchange activity to start 20 min into the future. Follow on-screen instructions.\n\tNOTE: Media Exchange is the replacement of the culture medium in the cultivation chamber. Medium Bag Exchange is the replacement of the culture medium bag hung on the instrument.\n9. Day of harvest (anywhere from day 7 to 13): Harvest and cryopreservation\nTouch the Sample button and follow the on-screen instructions to obtain a QC sample from the active culture.\nSeparate the QC sample into three aliquots of 1 mL each. Use 1 mL for flow cytometry, cell count, and cell size analyses. Use 1 mL for mycoplasma, vector copy number, replication-competent lentivirus, and endotoxin testing. Send the final 1 mL for Gram stain.\nPrepare the final formulation buffer (a sterile isotonic crystalloid solution supplemented with 4 % HSA in a 2 L bag, see Table of Materials). Save 100 mL of this buffer to prepare the cryoprotectant solution at a later step.\nModify the Activity Matrix to set the time of End of Culture to 2 min into the future and delete all other remaining activities. Follow the on-screen instructions to attach the final formulation buffer to the tubing set and begin harvest.\n\tNOTE: The processor will automatically transfer the cells into the Target cell bag. The volume will be 100 mL.\nTake a 0.5 mL sample from the Target cell bag QC pouch and perform a cell count.\nSeal off the Target cell bag and remove it from the tubing set. Divide the CAR-T product into appropriate doses and cryopreserve them in a controlled-rate freezer. Store cells in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen storage tank at ≤ -150 ºC.",
    "NOTE: Final formulation and aliquoting of doses are specific to the protocol. We provide here an example in which three equal doses of CAR-T cells and QC vials are cryopreserved. See section 10 for details.\nDownload the process data from the instrument, remove and dispose of the tubing set, and perform a shutdown.\n10. Cryopreservation of CAR-T cells\nNOTE: This protocol assumes CAR-T cells are cryopreserved after manufacture and stored until the patient is ready for infusion. While it is possible to infuse freshly manufactured CAR-T cells, this increases the logistical burden as it requires coordinating CAR-T cell manufacturing with CAR-T cell infusion. This may be problematic in case of a manufacturing failure. Especially if the clinical protocol requires lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR-T infusion, we strongly suggest cryopreserving, because a manufacturing failure may expose the patient to the risk of unnecessary chemotherapy. Regulators may require investigators to demonstrate the product passes all release testing prior to infusion, which may be difficult to achieve without cryopreservation.\nFrom the final 100 mL of harvested product, determine and remove the volume required to meet the desired CAR-T doses and quality control (QC) vials for performing additional release testing (e.g., viability), retention, and a sterility sample.",
    "NOTE: It is critical to develop a fully defined strategy for aliquoting the final product. We suggest manufacturing multiple doses of the product to allow for reinfusions, given that sufficient material is available. A product volume of 10-20 mL in a bag allows for rapid thawing and easy infusion by syringe push. It is recommended to fill each product to the desired CAR-T cell dose (e.g., 5 × 106 CAR-T cells per kg or 2.5 × 108 CAR-T cells) as this will avoid the need for dose calculations on the day of infusion. Also recommended are cryopreserving at least four QC vials and accounting for the possibility that there might be leftover material; we suggest saving this material as it can be useful for research and development purposes.\nCentrifuge the cells to reduce the volume.\nBring up the product(s) to half of the desired final volume using the portion of final formulation buffer put aside in step 9.3.\nPrepare 2x cryoprotectant by creating a 20% DMSO solution in final formulation buffer.\n\tNOTE: Cryoprotectant formulation and DMSO concentration can be modified.\nAdd 2x cryoprotectant to cells at equal volume for a final DMSO concentration of 10%.\n\tNOTE: Duration of exposure of the product to cryoprotectant should be minimized.\nFill the dose bags and QC vials. Send 1 mL for sterility.\n\tNOTE: Regulators commonly require a 14-day sterility assay performed on the final product. However, rapid sterility assays are emerging; at this time, the compendial 14-day method is the most common.\nCryopreserve products using a controlled-rate freezer.\n\tNOTE: The controlled-rate freezer program should be validated to produce a cooling rate of ~ -1 ºC/min to ~ -45 ºC, with compensation for the eutectic point.\nStore the product in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen ultralow freezer at ≤ -150 °C.",
    "11. Examination of procedure performance\nNOTE: Throughout the TCT process, several QC samples are drawn from the active culture. Table 2 provides a grid that can help the reader organize the results for reference and calculate procedure performance metrics. The terms below consisting of a letter and a number (e.g., \"B4\") refer to cells in the grid of this table. The following values are used in the performance calculations: B3 = total nucleated cells (TNC) pre-enrichment; B4 = TNC post-enrichment; E2 = The sum of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a percentage of the total cells of the initial apheresis product; E4 = The sum of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a percentage of the total cells post-enrichment; G2 = CD19+ cells as a percentage of the total cells of the initial product; G4 = CD19+ cells as a percentage of the total cells after CD4+/CD8+ enrichment; B10 = TNC of the Active Culture on day of harvest.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65488/65488table2.jpg\nTable 2: Procedure performance grid. We provide this grid to help organize in-process test reults needed to calculate procedure performance statistics. Rows represent samples analyzed at various time points during the procedure and are labeled with numbers 1-11. Rows 6-9 can be used to capture results from samples taken after day 6 of cultivation but prior to the day of harvest. Columns represent measured parameters and are labeled with letters A-H. Fields that are shaded gray do not apply. Some additional fields may not apply depending on whether CD4+/CD8+ enrichment is performed as part of the procedure and the length of the cultivation. We suggest writing \"N/A\" into those fields. Abbreviations: TNC = total nucleated cell count; QC = quality control.
