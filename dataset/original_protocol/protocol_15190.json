    "1. Preparation of Surgical Tubing, Vascular Catheters, Chest Wall Window\nIntravital microscopy stage. We custom-made a plexiglass stage upon which the anesthetized mouse lies during microscopy. This stage accommodates both a 15 cm by 10 cm flexible plastic cutting board (upon which the mouse lies during induction of anesthesia, tracheostomy placement, and venous catheterization) as well as a similarly-sized heating element (located underneath the cutting board).\nMouse thoracostomy tube preparation (Figure 1). A 10 cm length of PE 50 tubing (Intramedic, inner diameter 0.58 mm, outer diameter 0.965 mm) is cut. One end is attached to the blunt end of a curved 23 gauge needle; this needle will be used to pass the tube through the thoracic wall (inside → outside) prior to closure of the thoracic window.\n\tThe distal end of the tubing (1.5 cm in length, opposite to the attached 23 gauge needle) is repeatedly punctured by a 30 gauge needle, creating \"side ports\" to facilitate effective aspiration of intrathoracic air.\n\tThis fenestrated portion is then separated from the rest of the tube by several circumferential loops of 4:0 silk suture; these loops will serve as a \"stopper\", ultimately anchoring the 1.5 cm fenestrated portion within the chest cavity.\nJugular venous catheters. Two 15 cm lengths of PE 10 tubing (Intramedic, inner diameter 0.28 mm, outer diameter 0.61 mm) are cut. A scalpel is used to bevel the ends of the tube, thereby increasing the ease of venipuncture. The tubing is flushed via a 1 ml syringe containing 6% 150 kDa dextran solution (in PBS) attached to the non-beveled end of the tubing.",
    "Chest wall window preparation (Figure 2). Transparent polyvinylidene membrane (New Kure Wrap, Kuresha, Tokyo) is cut into an oval shape (major axis 6 cm, minor axis 4 cm). A circular 5 mm #1 coverslip (Bellco) is affixed to the membrane using α-cyanoacrylate glue (Pattex flüssig, Henkel, Düsseldorf).\nTube for pneumothorax induction (\"blow tube\"). A 10 cm length of tubing (inner diameter 3 mm, outer diameter 5 mm) is attached to a 5 ml syringe; the opposite end will be used to introduce air into the animal thoracic cage prior to chest wall window engraftment.\nSyringe for water immersion of objective. A 23 gauge needle is attached to a 30 ml syringe containing distilled water. The tip of the needle is blunted (using a metal file) in order to prevent damage to the objective.\n2. Mouse Anesthesia\nA mouse is anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (10 mg/ml) and xylazine (2 mg/ml), administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 8 μl per gram mouse body weight. Sedation occurs within 3 - 6 min and should not impede spontaneous respiration.\nUsing an electric razor, shave the throat, chest, abdomen, and right side of the mouse.\nUsing tape, secure the mouse to a thin plastic cutting board. The head of the mouse should point towards the operator (Figure 3). Gentle tension provided by a loop of suture passing underneath the upper teeth serves to maintain head extension. The cutting board is placed upon a heating pad, maintaining mouse euthermia during tracheostomy and venous catheter placement.\nWet shaved areas with 100% ethanol.\nConfirm adequate anesthesia with a tail/paw pinch. Proceed if minimal response; provide an extra bolus of ketamine/xylazine if not adequately anesthetized.\n3. Tracheostomy",
    "A 1 cm incision is made over the throat. Underlying connective tissue is dissected, and the salivary glands are separated and reflected laterally. The sternohyoid muscle immediately anterior to the trachea is resected.\nA loop of 4:0 suture is advanced under the trachea (Figure 4). The loop is then cut, creating two separate strands of suture underlying the trachea. The caudal suture will be used to secure the tracheostomy tube; the cranial suture will be used to provide tension on the trachea during tracheostomy placement.\nUsing two fingers, the upper suture is grasped and gentle tension is applied to the trachea. A horizontal incision is made in the trachea between upper and lower sutures. This incision should cross approximately two thirds of the tracheal circumference. A flanged tracheostomy tube (Harvard Apparatus, 1.22 mm outer diameter) is inserted into the distal trachea and secured into place using the caudal tracheal suture.\nThe tracheostomy is connected to a volume-controlled small animal ventilator (Inspira, Harvard Apparatus), and the mouse is ventilated with 40% inspired oxygen and 9 ml/kg tidal volumes (settings optimized to maintain adequate oxygenation/ventilation in our laboratory). Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is not begun at this point. Of note, ventilator settings should be optimized to unique conditions within individual laboratories. Different lengths of redundant tubing (interposed between the ventilator tubing Y-connector and tracheostomy) can be used to adjust dead space, ensuring stable alveolar ventilation for any chosen tidal volume.\n4. Venous Catheterization\nThe junction of the internal and external jugular vein may be identified by tracking distal venous branches proximally. The external jugular is found underneath the reflected salivary glands; this can be traced proximally to find the external-internal jugular junction.\nUse gentle blunt dissection to separate the jugular junction from surrounding connective tissue.",
    "Using 4:0 sutures, tie off the external jugular and internal jugular veins distal (cranial) to the jugular junction.\nMake a small incision into the carina of the jugular junction; bleeding should be minimal.\nTwo catheters may be incrementally advanced through the incision and into the jugular trunk. After gentle aspiration to ensure blood return, catheters are secured within the vein using 4:0 sutures.\nTape venous catheters to the cutting board to prevent against accidental dislodgement.\n5. Intravital Mouse Lung Microscopy Surgery (adapted from Tabuchi et al.18)\nThe cutting board (containing the restrained, anesthetized mouse as well as taped venous catheters) is transitioned to the intravital microscopy stage, where the remaining surgical interventions will be performed. A rectal temperature probe is placed; this interfaces with an adaptive heating system (located under the cutting board), allowing maintenance of mouse euthermia.\nOne jugular venous catheter is attached to a syringe pump that delivers a ketamine (10 mg/ml)-xylazine (2 mg/ml) mixture at 200 μl per hour. Adequate anesthesia is again confirmed using tail/paw pinch.\nThe midline incision is extended from the neck to the xyphoid process, then proceeding laterally to the right side (Figure 5).\nUsing electrocautery, the chest musculature is removed, exposing the thoracic cage. Care is taken to ensure complete hemostasis.\nCross the mouse's right hindleg over the left side and tape down. The resulting abdominal torsion rotates the thorax slightly, improving ease of the surgery.\nPlace the stage at a 45 degree angle (Figure 6); this positioning allows the lung to fall away from the chest wall once the pneumothorax is induced.\nThe 1st rib (most inferior rib) is grasped with a forceps and raised; a curved forceps is bluntly pushed underneath the rib. This separates parietal pleura from the chest wall. The pleura should remain unpunctured.",
    "Using the blow tube and a syringe, air is forcibly introduced against the parietal pleura. This leads to rupture of the pleural surface and pneumothorax without damaging the underlying lung. The underlying lung will fall away from the chest wall, allowing introduction of an electrocautery forceps without damaging the lung. A decrease in ventilator tidal volume is typically not required during this step.\nUsing electrocautery forceps, dissect the chest wall musculature and cut across the 5th and 6th ribs/parietal pleura, making a ~8 mm circular hole into the chest wall. It is essential that complete hemostasis be maintained, as the presence of bleeding will obscure microscopy (Figure 7).\nUsing a needle driver, insert the thoracostomy tube into the chest wall hole. The needle should puncture the chest wall and exit the thoracic cavity inferior and lateral to the thoracic window (Figure 7). Take care to avoid puncturing the diaphragm. The tube is then gently pulled out of the chest wall until it resistance occurs from the suture \"stopper\" located at the edge of the fenestrated portion of the tube.\nPlace the stage flat.\nAdd 3 cm H2O PEEP to the ventilator to help assist lung reexpansion.\nGlue (Pattex gel, Henkel) is placed circumferentially around the chest window. The membrane is attached, with the glass cover slip facing exterior to the thoracic cavity. Carefully (and circumferentially) approximate the membrane to the glue using a cotton applicator.\nWhile performing a lung recruitment maneuver (3 tidal volumes during which the PEEP ventilator port is obstructed), -3 mm Hg suction is applied to the chest tube. The lung should persistently approximate the membrane while freely moving during tidal ventilation (Figure 8).",
    "The right foreleg of the mouse is crossed over to the left side, resulting in a left lateral decubitus position of the mouse. Sponge wedges can be used to properly position the mouse so the chest window is aligned with the microscopy water immersion objective.\nDistilled water is placed on the cover slip prior to microscopy, allowing for visualization of the lung using a water immersion objective. Water will need to be intermittently replenished throughout imaging.\n6. Measurement of the Pulmonary Endothelial Surface Layer Thickness\nImmediately after chest wall closure, 500 μl FITC-labeled 150 kDa dextran (6% solution in PBS) is administered via the second (non-anesthesia) jugular venous catheter. This bolus serves as volume resuscitation as well as the vascular tracer for ESL measurement. The dextran bolus does not influence neutrophil adhesion or lung edema formation2.\nThe water immersion objective is centered over the cover slip. The choice of objective is essential-to visualize small differences in ESL thickness, a high numerical aperture is needed (> 0.8) while still maintaining a 2 - 3 mm working distance (allowing penetration through the lung window and pleural surface). We use the Nikon CFI 75 LWD 16x (NA 0.8) and CFI 75 LWD 25x (NA 1.1) objectives for this purpose.\nTo accurately measure ESL thickness in a moving organ, it is essential that brightfield and fluorescent vascular widths are performed simultaneously. This may be accomplished using an image splitter (Dual View, Photometrics) that allows for simultaneous capture of reflected light differential interference contrast (DIC, brightfield) and FITC images (Figure 9).\nDuring a 5 sec inspiratory pause, continuous imaging is performed and recorded. Later, these images may be reviewed to identify in-focus frames.",
    "Using an in-focus frame, subpleural microvessels (< 20 μm diameter) are identified; at least 3 microvessels are typically found on a single frame. After completion of the experiment, DIC and FITC-dextran vascular widths are measured (by a blinded observer) by averaging the lengths of three perpendicular intercepts per microvessel. Assuming equal ESL thickness at both edges of the vessel, the ESL size can be defined by one-half the difference between DIC and FITC-dextran vascular widths, as described in the Representative Results section.\nTypically, intravital microscopy can be performed for > 90 min without any evidence of lung injury or hypotension2. Preliminary experiments should be performed to confirm mouse stability (blood pressure, oxygenation, ventilation, lung injury) during the period of observation. Experimental drugs may be introduced through the second (non-anesthetic) jugular catheter at any point during the procedure.\n7. Alternative Measurement of the Pulmonary Endothelial Surface Layer Integrity\nThe intact endothelial surface layer functions (in part) to exclude circulating elements from the endothelial surface2. ESL integrity can therefore be measured by the ability of a circulating element (e.g. a fluorescent microsphere) to access and interact with cell surface adhesion molecules (such as ICAM-1).\nAnti-ICAM-1 labeled fluorescent microspheres are prepared prior to surgery. Streptavidin-coated 0.97 μm fluorescent microspheres are incubated with biotinylated anti-ICAM-1 (YN1/1.7.4 clone, 1:50, eBioscience) antibody or isotype control for 30 min at room temperature. The microspheres are washed thrice and suspended in PBS at 1 x 109 microspheres per ml.\nDuring intravital microscopy, the microsphere suspension (100 μl) is injected into the jugular venous catheter. After 15 min of circulation, fluorescent images are captured over 5 min. Microspheres immobile for > 5 min are considered adherent and quantified using image processing software.\n8. Euthanasia",
    "After completion of the procedure, anesthetized mice are euthanized by exsanguination via direct cardiac puncture. Euthanasia is confirmed via bilateral pneumothoraces, after which lungs are harvested and snap-frozen for later analysis.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
