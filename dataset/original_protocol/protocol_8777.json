    "Animals (male or female Wistar rats) were born and bred in an accredited animal facility (approval B.76-451-04), according to the French guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Experiments were conducted under the supervision of authorized investigators (M.B, D.V. and L.G.) in accordance with the European Community Council Directive (2010/63/UE of September 22, 2010) and the French Ministry of Agriculture.\n1. Preparation of Media and Tools\nIn a biological safety cabinet, prepare 1x Hank’s BSS (HBSS) in sterile water from 10x stock solution containing CaCl2 (1.85 g/l) /MgSO4 (0.9767 g/l) without MgCl2. Add NaHCO3 (350 µg/ml) to 1x solution of HBSS.\nIn a biological safety cabinet, add N2 supplement (from a 100x stock solution) and penicillin (100 units/ml) -streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) solution to Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) nutrient mixture F-12 (1 : 1).\nIn sterile conditions, prepare an aliquot (25 µl, 2 mM) of the cytoplasmic fluorescent dye called Cell Tracker Green in DMSO (1.075 ml for 1 mg). Dilute one aliquot in 5 ml of DMEM in a 15 ml conical tube.\nPrepare filled ice-bucket to keep media at 4 °C.\nDecontaminate laboratory bench tops and tools with 70% ethanol.\n2. Dissection of Cerebellum from P10 Rats\nRapidly decapitate rat pups (P10) with curved operating scissors behind ears in order to get the beginning of the spinal cord.\nAt the back-side of the decapitated head, make midline incision of the skin from the neck to the nose with fine iris scissors and separate the skin from the skull with fine iris scissors and Dumont #3 forceps.",
    "Use fine iris scissors to delicately make two lateral incisions from the base to the rostral region of the skull. Remove the dissected skull with two #3 forceps. Detach the brain from any adherence with the skull using the same forceps.\nTransfer the brain with the spoon end of a spatula to Petri dish (Ø 35 mm) containing 2 ml of ice-cold HBSS medium.\nPut the Petri dish containing the brain in a larger Petri dish (Ø 100 mm) full of ice and transfer to the stage of the stereomicroscope.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, isolate the cerebellum from the brain by dilaceration using two #3 forceps. Similarly, remove the residual spinal cord and the pial-membrane.\nTransfer the cerebellum in a new HBSS-filled Petri dish (Ø 35 mm, 2 ml) with the spoon end of a spatula and keep on ice.\n3. Preparation of Acute Cerebellar Slices\nUnder the stereomicroscope, cut the cerebellum between the vermis and the right hemisphere as indicated by the two heads arrow in Figure 2A with a standard scalpel handle #3 solid and a #15 surgical blade.\nPut one drop of cyanoacrylate glue on the vibratome specimen disc and wait 15-25 sec to eliminate toxic solvent vapors.\nCollect the cut cerebellum with the spoon end of a spatula and remove excess HBSS with clean paper towels.\nBring the cerebellum close to the specimen disc. Fix the cut edge to the specimen disc and wait 10 sec.\nInsert the specimen disc into the buffer tray with the manipulator, and rotate it so the transverse axis of the cerebellum is perpendicular to the knife holder. Fix the specimen disc with an Allen key and fill gently the buffer tray with HBSS medium until the cerebellum is covered.\nLoad crushed ice into the cooling bath.",
    "Clean the blade three times with 70% ethanol to eliminate any oil.\nInsert the blade into the knife holder and secure with clamping screw.\nPlace the blade edge right behind the rear edge (from user's view) of the specimen and define it as a starting point. Use forward command to define the ending point after the front edge of the specimen.\nSelect sectioning speed at 2.5 and sectioning frequency at 8. Select trimming thickness at 180 µm. Start tissue sectioning.\nPick up each section using a wide-bore glass truncated Pasteur pipette and transfer to HBSS-containing Petri dish (Ø 35 mm) kept on ice.\nUsing two #5 forceps, remove the meninges carefully from the cerebellum when interfering with the blade. Collect a maximum of 5 slices per cerebellum (Figure 2B, C).\nRemove the meninges from the cerebellar slices carefully with two #5 forceps under the stereomicroscope and separate the lobules gently for better probe loading.\n4. Fluorescent Staining of Living Interneurons\nTransfer cerebellar slices with a wide-bore glass truncated Pasteur pipette to a 6-well plate (max 3 slices/per well). Aspirate the HBSS medium.\nIncubate slices (3 max) in 5 ml of loading solution of the fluorescent dye (10 µM).\nTo protect from light, cover the microplate with aluminum foil. Put it on a gyro-moving table at 35 rpm for 10 min at RT to facilitate cell labeling.\nTransfer slices on the membrane of a Transwell insert (3.0 µm pore size; Figure 2D) with a wide-bore glass truncated Pasteur pipette. Aspirate the loading medium with pipette.\nRemove the insert and fill the well with 1.9 ml of DMEM. Replace the insert and add 100 µl of DMEM on top of the slice to cover the tissue.",
    "Place the plate containing the culture inserts in the incubator chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 2 hrs which is sufficient to observe GCs in the ML. Lie tissues flat to allow attachment on the insert membrane (Figure 2E). Ensure that slices are not drying.\n5. Ex vivo Imaging Through Confocal Macroscopy\nTransfer the plate without the plastic lid into an incubator attached to the stand of a confocal macroscope. Place a glass cover on the plate insert of the macroscope. Keep the temperature of the chamber at 37.0 °C ± 0.5 °C, and supply the slices with constant gas flow (95% O2, 5% CO2) through the plate insert to maintain the pH constant. Wait for 2 additional hr before time-lapse experiment.\nTo visualize GC migration in the tissue slices, illuminate the preparation with a 488 nm wavelength light by means of a laser diode through a confocal laser scanning macroscope equipped with a X2 dry objective (working distance: 39 mm, diameter: 58 mm, NA = 0.234), and detect fluorescence emission from 500 to 530 nm.\n\t\nTo finely resolve the movement of GCs, acquire images with an additional optical zoom factor of 1.5 to 2.0. Collect images of GNs in a single focal plane or up to 10 different focal planes along the z-axis every 30 min for up to 12 hr.\nWhen necessary, remove the glass cover and add small volumes (1-10 µl) of biological activators or inhibitors in DMEM with a 10 µl pipette to study their effect on GC migration.\n6. Cell Tracking",
    "For each time of the movie, perform z-stack projection through the ecart-type mode in ImageJ. Modulate the contrast and the brightness levels of the successive images to facilitate the identification and the tracking of labeled GCs. Map manually each position on the reference snapshot (at t = 0).\n\t\nUse the “Manual tracking” plugin in the Analyse Particle Menu and determine by clicking the gravity point of each cell body during time-lapse. Export the raw tracking data in a spreadsheet.\nReorganize the exported raw tracking data from ImageJ with a smart home-made program (http://primacen.fr, written in PHP code) that identify each cell and associated positions. Using the program, calculate the total traveled distance and the average speed of migration for each cell. Classify and compare characteristics of cell migration in control and treatment conditions under appropriate filters using the same program."
