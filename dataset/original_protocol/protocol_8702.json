    "1. Preparing Buffers\nLB broth\nUse pre-mixed granules (see Materials Table) and follow manufacturer's protocol for preparation.\nNematode Growth Media (NGM) Agar\nMix 23 g of agar, 3 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of bacto peptone, and deionized water to 0.972 L. Autoclave and let cool to 60 °C, then add 25 mL of 1 M potassium phosphate (KPO4) buffer (pH 6.0), 1 mL of 1 M magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), 1 mL of 1 M calcium chloride (CaCl2), and 1 mL of 5 mg/mL cholesterol (in ethanol).\nHypochlorite solution\nMix 5 mL of 5 M KOH, 4 mL of sodium hypochlorite solution (6%), and deionized H2O to a total volume of 50 mL.\nS basal\nMix 5 g of NaCl, 1 g of K2HPO4, 6 g of KH2PO4, and de-ionized water to 1 L, then autoclave.\n2. Preparation of Concentrated E. coli (OP50)\nNOTE: This step concentrates 1 L of a saturated E. coli solution into 25 mL of S basal buffer.\nInoculate 5 mL of autoclaved LB broth (step 1.1) with a single colony of E. coli (Strain OP50), and incubate for 4-6 h at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). Use 0.1 mL of this solution to inoculate 1 L of LB in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate the 1 L flasks overnight (12-16 h) at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm).\nCentrifuge 1 L overnight cultures in 500 mL centrifuge bottles for 5 min at 10,000 x g and 4 °C to pellet the bacteria and decant away remaining media. Resuspend pellet in 25 mL of S Basal (step 1.4). Store at 4 °C.\n3. Preparation of NGM Culture Plates",
    "For mass culture plates used to produce large numbers of worms, dispense 30 mL of molten (60 °C) NGM agar (step 1.2) in a laminar flow cabinet onto 10 cm culture plates with an automated fluid dispensing apparatus or a serological pipette. Allow to dry overnight.\nPipet 2 mL of concentrated OP50 onto each 10 cm plate, spread to completely cover the agar surface by tilting and rotating the plate, then allow plates to dry. Store plates at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nFor high throughput assay culture plates used for screening, utilize an automated 8 channel dispenser to dispense 0.15 mL of molten NGM agar into each well of a 96 well plate in a laminar flow cabinet. Use care to make sure wells are devoid of bubbles, as these will enable burrowing of worms that will compromise the assay in that well. Allow to dry overnight. Store plates at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\n4. Preparation of Temperature Sensitive (ts) Sterile C. Elegans Mass Cultures\nTo start cultures, using a 'worm pick' (a glass pipette with an attached platinum wire or a manufactured worm pick) under a dissecting microscope, transfer 20 eggs (strain TJ1060: spe-9(hc88)I; rrf-3(b26)II) onto mass culture plate(s) prepared in step 3.1. Then, incubate plates at 20 °C for 6 days (allows for more than one generation of growth, as you are targeting for collection of the progeny of the 20 eggs moved).\nVisually confirm presence of gravid adults (eggs present in the uterus) with a dissecting microscope. Collect the gravid adults by dispensing 2-3 mL of S basal onto the plate using a glass pipette. Swirl the liquid around the plate by hand, then collect the liquid into a 15 mL tube using a glass pipette.",
    "Spin down the tube (1,000 x g for 1.5 min at 20 °C) to pellet worms, then aspirate off supernatant. Add 10 mL hypochlorite solution (step 1.3) to the worm pellet and rapidly shake the tube by hand in a top-to-bottom direction for 5 s. Incubate for 5 min, shaking every 2.5 min.\nAgain, spin down the tube (1,000 x g for 1.5 min); the pellet should be yellowish-brown. Aspirate off the supernatant. Add 10 mL hypochlorite solution to the egg pellet and vigorously shake the tube. Incubate 1-3 min, with occasional shaking, and while monitoring appearance with the dissecting microscope. Visually confirm only eggs are remaining, and proceed to the next step.\nSpin down the tube (1,000 x g for 1.5 min) and aspirate off the supernatant. The pellet should be white with no brown coloration.\n\tNOTE: After the removal of the hypochlorite solution, it is critical to use sterile techniques and buffers, since contamination (bacterial and fungal, in particular) can ruin the experiment, wasting valuable time and reagents. This study used a filtered laminar flow cabinet and moved liquids using only sterile pipettes and tips.\nOpen the tubes in a sterile space. Wash the pellet 3 times with S basal, spinning down (1,000 x g for 1.5 min) and aspirating away the supernatant each time. Re-suspend the egg pellet in 2-3 mL S basal. These eggs can now be used for an overnight hatch in buffer to collect L1 larva (step 5).\n5. Hatching C. Elegans Eggs in Buffer to Get Synchronous Cultures (Preparing L1 Larval C. Elegans )",
    "Decant the egg pellet and buffer into a sterile glass petri dish with a cover. Rinse the remaining eggs from the tube into a dish using a serological pipette with 2-3 mL of S basal. Add 5 mL of S basal to ease crowding, as this may encourage hatching, as will light shaking (20 rpm with a belly dancer orbital shaker). Incubate overnight at 20 °C, to allow eggs time to hatch (16-24 h). All hatchlings will arrest at the 1st larval stage (L1) due to the absence of food.\n\tNOTE: Anecdotal evidence indicates that fresh L1 preparations (16-36 h after egg collection) generate the most synchronous populations of adult worms.\nCollect L1s in a 15 mL tube with a serological pipette. Spin down L1s in a centrifuge (1,000 x g for 1.5 min), aspirate away the supernatant, and repeat until all L1s have been collected from hatching plates, while leaving 10 mL of S basal for next step.\nFrom the tube containing L1s, micropipette out 0.01 mL (immediately after mixing) and dispense it onto an unseeded (no E. coli) NGM plate. Count the number of L1s on the plate. Repeat 10 times and obtain an average for the number of L1s in each aliquot. Generally, expect between 1-3 L1s per µL (when starting with 1 mass culture plate containing 20 eggs).\nDetermine with a serological pipette the volume of S basal holding the L1s. Then extrapolate with the determined average number of worms per 0.01 mL, obtained in the previous step, to estimate the total number of L1s. Generally, expect between 10,000-30,000 L1s (per mass culture plate containing 20 eggs).",
    "To use this culture in 96-well assay, dilute the L1 suspension to 1 L1 per µL in a sterile round media bottle, then proceed to step 7. If this culture is to be used to generate additional C. elegans mass cultures, then proceed to step 6.\n6. Large Scale Synchronous Culture Preparation\nNOTE: L1 solutions can be used to quickly increase worm populations.\nTo generate large worm numbers with an L1 solution, dispense up to 5,000 L1s on each of the desired number of mass culture plates. Collect gravid adults 2.5 days later (20 °C) as described in steps 4.1-2, and proceed to step 4.3 to collect the eggs.\nAs it has been anecdotally observed that repeated hypochlorite collection can stress the subjugated population, split populations by picking eggs for propagation prior to subjecting the remaining population to hypochlorite treatments, so that multiple generations of the population are not repeatedly subjected to hypochlorite solution treatment.\n7. Setup of 96-Well Assay Plates\nAllow the assay plates (prepared in step 3.3) to reach room temperature. Then, in a laminar flow cabinet, add 5 µL of concentrated OP50 (prepared in step 2.2) to each well. As before, use an automated 8 channel dispenser.\nAdd 10 µL of L1 suspension to each well using an automated 8 channel dispenser. This will yield on average 10 worms per well, since they are present in the suspension at 1 L1 per µL. To promote equal distribution of L1s from the slurry, dispense L1s from a round media bottle actively mixed with a moderately slowly turning stir bar.\nCover plate with lid, box batches of plates, and incubate at 25 °C for 2 days.\n8. Treating 1 st Day Adult C. elegans  with Chemicals",
    "Remove chemical library plates from the freezer, and allow plates to reach room temperature before proceeding.\n\tNOTE: Chemical library plates as described here are 96 well plates containing discrete compounds in each well, all of which are at the same concentration and dissolved in DMSO. These libraries do not utilize the outer columns, and so each plate has a maximum of 80 distinct chemicals. In the protocol described here, the library concentration is 10 mM. It is important to consider solvent effects on phenotypes. While this study screens at a DMSO concentration of 0.5%, this level was never exceeded in these lifespan assays and in low throughput assays, where it is more likely to pick a compound stock solution concentration. This protocol does not exceed 0.25%, which is a level at which lifespan modifications do not occur16, at least in the N2 strain.\nGently shake plate at 60 rpm on a microplate shaker for 1 min immediately prior to use.\nUsing an automated 96-well liquid handler, transfer 0.75 µL of compound (or DMSO) from the library plate to the assay plate. The depth of the pipette during liquid delivery to the assay plate is controlled carefully, such that the pipette tips of the liquid handler are delivering the 0.75 µL volume to the ~15 µL of liquid on the surface of the agar (with worms and concentrated OP50 from steps 7.1-2) and does not pierce the agar surface in the well. Do not use manual 8 or 12 multi-channel pipettes except in very small screens (<10 plates), as they can increase error and often result in puncturing of the agar surface, which compromises the assay.",
    "Prepare chemical library negative control plates with DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), assuming the library being tested uses DMSO as the solvent. Make 1 negative control plate for every 5 test plates, up to 10 negative control plates. If possible, also make a positive control plate (NP11 at 20 mM, for a final assay concentration of 0.1 mM, is effective for this purpose; see Representative Results section). Do not add chemicals (test or control) to the 2 exterior columns of the plates, as they are particularly susceptible to desiccation.\n9. Drying Cultures\nTo remove liquid from the surface of the agar, dry plates in the laminar flow cabinet for 4-8 h. It is critical that these plates are dried completely but do not become desiccated. As some plates will take longer to dry than others, monitor all plates closely and remove as soon as they are dry. Confirm drying by careful visual inspection of the individual wells of the plate.\n\tNOTE: Depending on factors that include the exhaust rate of the cabinet, the time this takes must be empirically determined. This drying step can take about 4-8 h for a full cabinet.\nSeal plates with transparent film, then put on the plate lids.\nSpin the 96-well assay plates for 45 s at 1,000 x g.\nStore plates inverted at 25 °C.\n10. Scoring C. Elegans Cultures for Longevity\nMonitor negative control plates until >95% mortality is observed. Check plates weekly for the first two weeks and daily thereafter. Caenorhabditis cohorts of the same strain and species can display significantly different lifespans by trial17.\n\tNOTE: For the lifespan assay described here, with TJ1060 animals cultured at 25 °C, 95% mortality in these populations has occurred from adult day 16-20.",
    "When negative control wells are considered to have reached the >95% mark, spin down all 96-well assay plates for 45 s on a table top centrifuge with a microplate adapted rotor (250 x g for 45 s at 20 °C).\nScore all wells in the control plates. This is done by counting and recording the number of alive and dead animals in each well. Dead worms can be differentiated from alive worms by their complete lack of movement. Provoke movement in alive worms by dropping the 96 well plate from approximately 7 cm onto the dissecting microscope surface while looking through the eyepiece for any evoked response. Dead worms will not respond, and nearby lab mates may not appreciate the repetitive noise.\nFor the test plates, count and record only wells containing live worms. When a live worm is observed, count all alive and dead animals in that well, along with the well position and plate.\n\tNOTE: It is often useful to re-score the plates after >99% of negative control worms are dead. In large scale screens, this may be the best point to do the initial scoring. In either case, score/re-score as described above\n11. Re-Testing Compounds\nWhen testing only a small number of candidate compounds (<320 compounds), as with a re-test or a candidate screen (see Representative Results), restrict the assay to the 32 central wells in an effort to minimize possible plate effects. This leaves the 2 wells closest to the edge of the plate untreated but still containing agar, food, and worms."
