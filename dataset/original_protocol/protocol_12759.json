    "1. In Vitro SHAPE\nNOTE: The protocol is modified from the published protocol1.\nPreparing the RNA template\nNOTE: The template for T7 transcription was ordered as a synthetic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and amplified by either insertion into an E. coli vector that carries a unique pair of EcoRI/BamHI restriction endonuclease sites, such as pET28a, or by PCR. The protocol for PCR amplification is illustrated below.\n\t\nMix the following material: 50 μL of PCR master mix (see Table of Materials), 2 μL for each primer in 10 μM (see Table 1 for sequences), 200 ng of dsDNA template in 2 μL and 3 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 41 μL of H2O. Aliquot into two PCR tubes (each tube contains 50 μL of reaction mixture).\nSet up the thermal cycler as follows: stage 1) 95 °C for 30 s; stage 2) 95 °C for 20 s; stage 3) 56 °C for 20 s; stage 4) 72 °C for 20 s; stage 5) loop back to stage 2 for 30 cycles; stage 6) 72 °C for 3 min; and stage 7) infinite holding at 4 °C until the following step.\nPurify the PCR amplicon by extraction of gel slices (see Table of Materials and use the manufacturer’s protocol). Elute the product DNA with 35 μL of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer, containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA, to yield a 0.1–0.5 μg/μL template. Normalize the purified DNA template into 0.10 μg/μL.\nNOTE: Optionally, the quality of the template may be analyzed on a 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis with 0.10 μg of DNA. A single band of desired template DNA is expected on the gel.",
    "Set up the T7 transcription reaction (total volume 40 μL) by adding the following materials into a PCR tube: 4 μL of 10x reaction buffer, 4 μL of ATP, 4 μL of CTP, 4 μL of GTP, 4 μL of UTP, 4 μL of T7 enzyme (see Table of Materials), 4 μL of purified PCR amplicon from step 1.1.3 (0.4 μg), and 12 μL of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. Mix by pipetting up and down 4x. Incubate at 37 °C for 4–16 h in a thermal cycler or in a 37 °C incubator.\nNOTE: Start to set up step 1.1.6 while the reaction in step 1.1.4 is ongoing.\nAdd 2 μL of DNase, mix by pipetting up and down 4x, and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min. Mix with equal volume of 2x Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE)-urea sample buffer (see Table of Materials). Heat at 70 °C for 3 min to inactivate.\nIn an RNase-free bottle, mix 75 mL of 40% acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution (29:1, see Table of Materials), 180.2 g of urea, and 50 mL of 10x TBE buffer (RNase-free, see Table of Materials). Put the bottle on an orbital shaker (250 rpm) until all crystals of urea are dissolved (may take up to 2 h). Adjust the volume to 500 mL with DEPC-treated water. Filter the solution with a 0.2 μm membrane (see Table of Materials).\nNOTE: In this process, avoid using specular and stir-bar to prevent RNase contamination. The solution can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 year.",
    "Clean two electrophoresis glass plates of a proper size (16.5 cm x 24 cm) with deionized water and 70% EtOH using a piece of wiping paper. Align the plates with a pair of 2.0 mm spacers (the plate with a siliconized surface is facing inward) and seal the edge of the plates with tape. Double-tape the corner of the plate to prevent leaking.\nIn a beaker, mix 200 mL of acrylamide solution from step 1.1.6, 2.0 mL of 10% ammonium persulfate solution, and 100 μL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) with an RNase-free pipette tip by stirring rapidly for 30 s. Tilt the plates on a piece of benchtop cover and pour the solution from the gap of the plates. Tap the plate to lift any bubbles and lay the plate flat on the benchtop cover. Immediately insert the comb and let the gel polymerize for at least 1 h.\nNOTE: If the gel is to be used within the next day, cover the top of the gel with a piece of wet paper towel and wrap up with a larger piece of plastic wrap. Place it lying flat at 4 °C.\nRemove the tape and clamp the plate in an electrophoresis stand. Remove the comb and add adequate 1x TBE buffer at the top and bottom of the reservoir. Pre-run the gel for 30 min at 20 W.\nNOTE: Optionally, if the content of the desired RNA is ~90% or more, a mini-gel can be used in substitution of a preparative gel.",
    "Wash each of the loading wells by pipetting up and down twice with the liquid in the reservoir. Add crude RNA from step 1.1.5 into the wells. Run the gel at 20 W until the xylene cyanol FF dye (light blue) passes about two-thirds of the gel’s length (~60 min).\nNOTE: Ensure to load no more than one-third of the height of the well (use multiple wells if necessary).\nImmerse the gel in 1x TBE buffer with 1:10,000 dilution of the safe dye (see Table of Materials) in a container large enough for the gel. Put the container on an orbital shaker for 5 min at 80 rpm.\nUnder UV light, identify the desired RNA band and swiftly cut a thin band of the gel using a clean razor blade. Place 1–2 gel slices in a 1.7 mL tube.\nRecover the RNA from the gel slice by passive elution. Add adequate elution/precipitation mix (~0.3 mL per slice) to each tube: 0.3 M NaOAc (pH 5.2), 2.5 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in DEPC-treated water. Rotate the tube that contains the gel splice(s) at 4 °C for 16 h.\nNOTE: A typical recovery rate is ~75% in this step. To increase the yield, remove and collect the eluent and add the same volume of elution buffer, then repeat this step.\nCombine the eluent in a new 1.7 mL tube. Add 2.5x ice-cold EtOH, invert the tubes six times to mix the liquid, and place the tubes at -80 °C for at least 1 h.",
    "Centrifuge for 10 min at 10,000 x g and 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting. Wash the RNA pellet by adding 80% EtOH (1 mL per tube), vortex for 15 s, and centrifuge for 10 min at 10,000 x g and 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and air-dry the RNA pellet for 5 min. Add 50 μL of RNase-free water and mix by pipetting up and down 10 times. Normalize the RNA concentration to 0.10 μg/μL. Store the purified RNA at -80 °C.\nNOTE: Do not over-dry the RNA pellet.\nOptionally, to analyze the quality of the RNA, dilute 1 μL (100 ng) of RNA from step 1.1.16 in 5 μL of water and mix with 5 μL of 2x TBE-urea sample buffer. Then, heat at 70 °C for 3 min and load on a 6% TBE-urea mini-gel.\n\t\t\nRun the gel at 180 V for 1 h. Perform the staining as done in step 1.1.11. Visualize the gel with UV in an imaging system. A single band is expected at the desired length.\nPreparing the 32P-labeled primer\nSet up the reaction by mixing the following materials: 10 μL of γ-32P-ATP (~1.5 mCi, ~25 μM, see Table of Materials), 2 μL of reverse transcription (RT) primer (100 μM, for sequence see Table 1), 2 μL of 10x T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) reaction buffer, 1 μL of T4 PNK (see Table of Materials), and 5 μL of RNase-free water. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nCAUTION: Proper protection is need for steps 1.2-1.5 in an authorized workplace for radioactive materials. \nHeat-inactivate for 20 min at 65 °C. Add the samples onto a desalting column and centrifuge at 1,000x g for 1 min. Mix the eluent with 25 μL of 2x TBE-urea sample buffer. .",
    "NOTE: Store the labeled crude product at -20 °C if it is not to be immediately purified.\nRun a 10% acrylamide gel at 20 W for 1 h.\nCAUTION: Load the 32P-labeled primer from step 1.2.1 onto the gel and avoid bleeding the radioactivity into the top reservoir. Do not load more than one-third of the height of the well to ensure a thin band on the gel (use multiple wells if necessary). The liquid in the bottom reservoir can be highly radioactive.\nRemove the glass plates of the gel cassette and lay the gel on a piece of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic wrap to cover the top of the gel to make an air-tight sandwich. Place the gel sandwich on a calcium tungstate phosphor screen and expose with an imaging instrument. Image the gel again with regular light to know where the edges of the gel are.\nUse an image processing software to overlay the two images. Align the gel on to the printed image. Use a fresh razor blade to cut the desired bands out of the gel . Place 1 to 2 gel slices in a 1.7 mL tube.\nNOTE: Make sure the printed image has the same size as the actual gel. Double check the alignment by imaging the leftover gel again after cutting out the gel slice.\nRecover the 32P-labeled primer by following steps 1.1.13 to 1.1.16. Take 1.0 μL of solution into a 0.4 mL tube and dilute the primer with 1x TE buffer to obtain the radioactivity of 1.0 μL at ~100,000 cpm. Store the purified 32P-labeled primer at -80 °C until RNA 2’-OH modification reaction but for no longer than 4 weeks.\nSmall molecule binding and RNA 2’-OH modification",
    "To prepare four samples, add 8 pmol RNA in 32 μL of 0.5x TE buffer to a 1.7 mL tube, heat at 80 °C for 2 min, and snap-cool on ice for at least 1 min.\nNOTE: Use the following equation to calculate the approximate molecular weight of RNA: MW = (# of bases) x 340 Da.\nAdd 8 μL of 5x folding mix containing 500 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 20 mM MgCl2, and 500 mM NaCl. Aliquot 9 μL of the RNA mixture into each of the four PCR tubes and label them #1-#4. Add 1 μL of 10% DMSO into the #1 tube, 1 μL of concentrated small molecule solution (10% DMSO) into #2, 1 μL of diluted small molecule solution (10% DMSO) into #3, and 1 μL of water into #4.\nIncubate the PCR tubes at 37 °C in a thermal cycler for 30 min.\nRight before the 2’-OH modification reaction, dilute 1 μL of NAI stock solution (2 M) with 3 μL of DEPC-treated water to yield a 0.5 M working solution. Without delay, add 1 μL of NAI working solution into tubes #1, #2, and #3, and 1 μL of 25% DMSO into #4. Incubate at 37 °C in a thermal cycler for 15 min.\nAdd 100 μL of elution/precipitation mix (see step 1.1.13 for recipe), 2 μL of glycogen (15 mg/mL), and transfer all the liquid in each PCR tube into a 1.7 mL tube. Add 0.34 mL of ice-cold 200-proof EtOH (3x volume) into each tube. Mix by vortexing for 5 s and place the tubes in a -80 °C freezer for at least 1 h.\nNOTE: During this period, start setting up the sequencing gel to be used in step 1.5.1.",
    "Centrifuge for 15 min at 14,000 x g and 4 °C. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the RNA pellet. Wash the RNA pellet by adding 80% EtOH (0.5 mL per tube), vortex for 15 s, and centrifuge for 15 min at 20,000 x g and 4 °C. Remove the supernatant again.\nNOTE: Optionally, use a Geiger counter to ensure the radioactive pellet retaining in the tube.\nAir-dry the RNA pellet for 5 min. Add 9 μL of RNase-free water and mix by pipetting up and down 10 times.\nNOTE: Do not over-dry the RNA pellet. All precipitation is expected to be dissolved at the end of this step.\nMarker preparation and primer extension\nTransfer the modified RNA into 4 new PCR tubes and label them #1-#4 as previously. Add 2 pmol control RNA in 7 μL of DEPC-treated water to 4 additional PCR tubes and label them #5–#8. Add 2 μL of radiolabeled primer (step 1.2.6) in all eight tubes. Heat to anneal at 65 °C for 5 min, then immediately cool down to 4 °C in the thermal cycler.\nAdd 4 μL of 5x RT buffer (see Table of Materials), 1 μL of dithiothreitol (DTT, 0.1 M), and 1 μL of dNTP mix (10 mM each) to each of the eight PCR tubes.\nAdd 2 μL of DEPC-treated H2O to tubes #1–#4. Add 4 μL of ddATP (5 mM), 4 μL of ddTTP (5 mM), and 4 μL of ddCTP (5 mM) into tubes #5–#7, respectively. Add 1 μL of ddGTP (5 mM) and 3 μL of DEPC-treated water to tube #8. Pipette four times to mix.",
    "Heat at 52 °C for 1 min in the thermal cycler. Add 1 μL of reverse transcriptase (see Table of Materials), then mix by pipetting up and down four times. Incubate the reaction at 52 °C for 20 min.\nAdd 1 μL of 5 M NaOH into each of the tubes to hydrolyze the RNA. Heat the tubes at 95 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 5 μL of 1 M HCl and repeat the ethanol precipitation (steps 1.3.5 and 1.3.6), except omit the glycogen and liquid transfer.\nNOTE: Omitting step 1.4.6 results in a blurring region in the middle of the gel known as the “salt front”.\nAir-dry the DNA pellet for 5 min. Add 10 μL of H2O and 10 μL of 2x TBE-urea sample loading buffer and pipette up and down 10 times to redissolve. Heat at 70 °C for 5 min. Place the tubes on ice before loading onto the gel.\nPAGE analysis\nTo prepare an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, follow steps 1.1.6 to 1.1.10 with the following modifications: use 100 mL of 40% acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution (29:1) to prepare an 8% acrylamide solution, and use sequencing gel glass plates (e.g., 46 x 57 cm) with a 0.4 mm spacer.\nLoad 10 μL of the sample from step 1.4.7. Run the gel at 65 W for 2 h or until the bottom dye reaches 3/4 of the gel.\nNOTE: Store the rest of the samples at -80 °C for repeating if needed.",
    "Remove the top siliconized glass plate by removing the spacer and gently inserting a spatula. Place a piece of large filter paper to cover the gel and press gently to allow the gel to adhere to the filter paper. Starting from the bottom end, lift the filter paper and remove the gel from the glass plate together.\nPlace the gel together with the filter paper on a piece of plastic wrap that is large enough to cover the whole gel (filter paper facing up). Transfer the filter paper/gel/plastic wrap sandwich to a gel drier with the filter paper side facing down.\nCAUTION: To avoid radioactive material contamination, use 3 to 4 more pieces of large filter paper between the gel sandwich and gel drier.\nDry the gel at 70 °C for 1 h with a vacuum. Transfer the gel sandwich onto a photo-bleached phosphor storage screen cassette. Expose the radioactivity of the gel to the screen for 4–16 h.\nPlace the phosphor storage screen on an imaging device and scan with medium resolution (~30 min).\nNOTE: If a smile-like artifact is present on the gel image, use correcting software (e.g., SAFA) to process the image to a publishable quality. Keep in mind that the standard marker lane is 1 nucleotide longer than the 2’-OH modification lanes.\n2. In-cell SHAPE\nPrimer design\nNOTE: Unlike in vitro SHAPE, in-cell SHAPE does not need to design an expression cassette. However, an optimal primer set should be used and must be evaluated before SHAPE experiment.\n\t\nGenerate at least three unique primer pairs by a BLAST-based primer design tool (e.g., Primer-BLAST). To study pre-mRNA in human cells, select the human genome (not transcriptome) as a reference database in Primer Pair Specificity Checking Parameters. Pick the size of amplicon in the range of 200–1,000 base-pair (bp).",
