    "The clinical trial has been approved by the Approval Committee of the Respiratory Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (No. KY2022022). In this study, the diagnostic criteria of bronchial asthma refer to the Guidelines for Bronchial Asthma Prevent and Management (2020 edition)8 and TCM operations refer to the Criteria of Diagnosis and Therapeutic Effect of Diseases and Syndromes in Traditional Chinese Medicine15. The typical case was a diagnosed bronchial asthma patient admitted to the Respiratory Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The patient's informed consent was obtained. All material sources used in the protocol can be obtained (see Table of Materials).\n1. Material preparation\nMoxa Stick: Please ensure that the items listed below are available:\n\t-Moxa sticks (made of moxa; their specifications are as follows: 200 mm in length and 18 mm in diameter [Table of Materials]).\n\t-Ignition device (lighter [Table of Materials])\n\t-Surgical curved plate (200 mm in length and 125 mm in width [Table of Materials]) with water\n\t-Gauze (minimum specification: 80 mm x 80 mm-8P [Table of Materials])\n\t-Forceps (all sterile medical forcipes are acceptable and nonessential. No special requirements [Table of Materials])\n\tNOTE: The ignition devices include matches, alcohol lamps, and lighters, according to the medical production standards, and any of them can be selected during operation. The ignition devices will extinguish the flame in time according to its manual after use. The surgical curved plate with water is to extinguish the moxa stick fire and clean the ashes after burning.\nGather all the materials mentioned in steps 1.1 and put them in a medical cart for use in the procedure room (Figure 1).\n2. Patient assessment\nInclusion criteria\n\t\nInclude patients diagnosed with bronchial asthma according to diagnostic criteria8.",
    "NOTE: Fully communicate with the patient and inform them of the risks brought by the operation. Have the patient sign the informed consent form. Moxibustion should be applied cautiously to those who are afraid of moxibustion. The skin area to be operated on should be complete.\nExclusion criteria\n\t\nExclude pregnant women, children, and other special groups who should not be operated on.\nExclude people allergic to argyi, alcohol, and other materials.\n\t\t​NOTE: The purpose of patient assessment is to judge whether the patient is in the appropriate condition for a moxibustion operation.\n3. Preoperative preparation\nCleaning the skin area\n\t\nThe day before the operation, clean the skin area where the operation site is located two or three times with clean water to ensure that surface contaminants are removed. The radius of the cleaning range should be greater than 10 cm. Keep the skin dry after cleaning.\nIf conditions permit, bathe and clean the skin. Ensure the water temperature is comfortable for the patient.\nAfter selecting the point, use an iodophor cotton swab to disinfect the skin from inside to outside two or three times, with the acupoint as the center. The area of the sterilized skin should not be less than 5 cm x 5 cm.\nBefore the operation, the operator must clean their hands with soapy water, according to the specification of hand hygiene for healthcare workers16.\n4. Operation procedure\nBody position selection: Select the supine position or prone position for this procedure.\n\tNOTE: The body position should be correctly selected according to the position of the acupoints to expose the acupoints fully.\nAcupoint selection\n\t\nLocate the following acupoints according to Meridians and Acupoints17 (version 2016, published by China Traditional Chinese Medicine Publishing House): Dingchuan (EX-B1), Feishu (BL13), and Zhongfu (LU1).",
    "Locate EX-B1 at the nape back, on both sides of the midpoint of the lower edge of the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra 0.5 F-cun18 (Figure 2).\nLocate BL13 on the back side, on both sides of the midpoint of the lower edge of the spinous process of the third thoracic vertebra 1.5 F-cun (Figure 3).\nLocate LU1 on the chest, parallel to the first rib gap, on both sides of the anterior median line 6 F-cun (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: Take the width of the interphalangeal joint of the patient's thumb as 1 F-cun (Figure 5).\nLight the moxa stick\n\t\nHold the middle and upper 1/3 of the moxa stick and light with the lighter.\n\t\tNOTE: No other inflammable is allowed in the surrounding environment.\nSelection of moxibustion methods\n\t\nMild moxibustion\n\t\t\nHold the middle and upper 1/3 of the moxa stick, aim the lighted end above the acupoint 2-3 cm away from the skin, and keep the distance constant during the operation (Figure 6).\nMake the operation position appear warm, local skin flushed, but with no burning pain. Keep moxibustion at each acupoint for 10-15 min; the skin temperature of the acupoint is maintained at 40-45 °C, measured by a portable infrared thermometer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The degree is chosen such that the patient feels warm and the skin is slightly red.\nSparrow-pecking moxibustion\n\t\t\nHold the middle and upper 1/3 of the moxa stick and aim the lighted end above the acupoint, 2-3 cm away from the skin.\nMove the burning end of the moxa stick by moving up and down, perpendicular to the skin above the acupoint (like a bird pecking), and keep the same up and down movement (Figure 7).",
    "Make the operation position appear warm, local skin flushed, but with no burning pain. Keep moxibustion at each acupoint for 10-15 min; the skin temperature of the acupoint is maintained at 40-45 °C, measured by a portable infrared thermometer.\nConvoluted moxibustion\n\t\t\nHold the middle and upper 1/3 of the moxa stick and aim the lighted end above the acupoint, 2-3 cm away from the skin.\nApply moxibustion by repeatedly rotating (like drawing a circle); draw a circle with a radius of 2.5 cm centered on the acupoint (Figure 8).\nMake the operation position appear warm, local skin flushed, but with no burning pain. Keep moxibustion at each acupoint for 10-15 min; the skin temperature of the acupoint is maintained at 40-45 °C, measured by a portable infrared thermometer.\n\t\t\t\nSense the temperature during the operation. If the patient feels warm and comfortable, keep the distance unchanged. If the patient has a burning sensation, increase the distance between the moxa stick and the skin.\nIf the patient's local skin sensation is weakened, separate the index finger and middle finger and place them on both sides of the acupoint to feel the temperature, adjust the time and distance of moxibustion according to the situation, and avoid burns.\nExtinguish the fire and clean the ashes.\n\t\nAfter the operation, put the ignited part of the moxa stick into a curved plate filled with water to extinguish the moxa fire. Use forceps to remove the large ash, then gently wipe the residual stains with gauze.\n\t\tNOTE: Small blisters can naturally get absorbed. If the blisters are large, they can be punctured with a syringe or a needle and then an antibiotic ointment applied.\nPostoperative care\n\t\nUse forceps to remove large ashes and clean the local skin area. Then, gently wipe the residual stains with gauze.",
    "Do not touch or take cold water within half an hour after the operation. Pay attention to keep the procedure area warm. Seek timely medical advice if the patient is feeling unwell.\n5. Statistical analysis\nExpress the continuous variables as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Use a paired t-test to compare the differences between before and after treatment.\n\tNOTE: No categorical variables were involved in this study variable. All statistical tests were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using statistical software.\nSubscription Required.
