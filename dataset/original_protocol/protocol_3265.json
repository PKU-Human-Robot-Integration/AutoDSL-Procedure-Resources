    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart one: Preparation of OVA-Listeria monocytogenes and tail vein injection in mice\nTiming: 16–18 h\nThis section details how to prepare OVA-Listeria monocytogenes and perform tail vein injection.\nNote: The previous data determined the relationship between time, OD600 and bacterial concentration. After 12 h of activation, the Listeria monocytogenes was transferred. The OD600 was measured to be 0.35 after 2.5 h of transfer, and the concentration of Listeria monocytogenes in the bacterial solution was 8.4 × 107 CFU/mL. The bacterial injection per mouse was 1.25 × 107 CFU. A total of 150 μL of bacterial solution with OD600 = 3.5 was required for each mouse.\nPreparation of OVA-Listeria monocytogenes.\nAdd 10 μL bacterial solution (frozen at −80°C) to 2 mL BHI medium containing erythromycin. Incubate in a shaker at 220 rpm/min for 12 h at 37°C.\nAdd 20 μL activated bacterial solution to 2 mL BHI medium containing erythromycin. Incubate in a shaker at 220 rpm/min for 2.5 h at 37°C.\nNote: If more mice need to be injected, the culture system can be scaled up. The culture volume used here was 2 mL.\nCritical: After 2.5 h of bacterial transfer culture, the logarithmic growth phase was reached, and the growth rate of Listeria monocytogenes was very fast. The incubation time needs to be strictly controlled. It should be stopped immediately after 2.5 h.\nCollect the bacterial solution into 1.5 EP tubes, centrifuge at 2100 × g for 10 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS to resuspend Listeria monocytogenes, centrifuge at 2100 × g for 10 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step d. three times.\nResuspend the bacterial solution in PBS to a concentration of 1.25 × 108 CFU/mL.\nTail vein injection.",
    "Immobilization of the mouse with a mouse immobilizer.\nWipe the mouse tail with an alcohol swab to make the veins more visible.\nInject 100 μL of bacterial suspension into mice from the tail vein with a syringe.\nCritical: When injecting into the tail vein of mice, be careful not to make mistakes and apply pressure to the wound with cotton after withdrawing the syringe to avoid fluid leakage.\nKeep the mice with free access to water and food after the injection of OVA-Listeria monocytogenes. Observe the mouse’s status every day.\nPart two: Detection of bacterial load in the liver (on day 7 after infection)\nTiming: 3–5 h\nThis section details the detection of mouse liver bacterial load. Includes liver processing, extraction, and quantification of OVA-Listeria monocytogenes.\nNote: This experimental result reflects the ability of CD8+ T cells to clear OVA-Listeria monocytogenes in mice.\nPrepare BHI plates in advance, preheat and dry them in a 37°C incubator for 1 h.\nPreparation of Liver Tissue Grinding Suspension.\nPrepare and label homogenization bags.\nRemove and weigh the whole livers from mice. Place the whole liver into a homogenization bag.\nSeal the homogenization bag and use a cylindrical tool to roll the surface of the homogenization bag to thoroughly homogenize the liver.\nAdd 5 mL of PBS.\nFilter through a 70 μm sieve.\nDiluted liver suspension.\nTransfer 200 μL of liver suspension to a 96-well plate.\nPerform 1:10 serial dilutions of liver suspension in PBS to 10−5 dilution within the wells of the 96-well plate.\nSpread Liver Suspension.\nSpread 100 μL of each dilution onto a predried BHI plate using a spreader. Incubate plates at 37°C for 12 h.\nCount the number of CFU for each dilution, and calculate the CFU per tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3035-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Liver homogenate from OVA-Listeria monocytogenes-infected and uninfected mice cultured on BHI plates\nLivers were collected from OVA-Listeria monocytogenes-infected and uninfected mice at 7 days post-infection. Tissue homogenate was prepared and spread on plates. The plates were then incubated at 37°C 12 h. Plate spread of liver homogenate from OVA-Listeria monocytogenes-uninfected mice (left) and infected mice (right).\nCFU\n/\ntissue\n=\n(\nCFU\n/\n0.1\nmL\n×\ndilution\nfactor\n×\n5\nmL\n)\n/\nliver\nweight\nCritical: Be careful to grind the liver thoroughly and mix well before diluting the liver suspension.\nCritical: Make sure the BHI plate is dry before coating it. Additionally, ensure that it is completely dry before finishing the coating process. Two control samples need to be set up. The first control is the coating plate of liver suspension from uninjected mice to rule out non-specificity and cross-contamination. The second control is the coating plate of the serially diluted suspension of known OVA-Listeria monocytogenes quantity to ensure the quality control of the agar plate.\nPart three: Detection of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen (on day 7 after infection)\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThis section details the detection of OVA-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses in mice.\nPrepare mouse splenocytes.\nRemove the whole spleens from mice.\nCut the whole spleen in half with scissors and place on a 40 μm sieve.\nHouse the sieve in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.

Add 0.2% BSA PBS buffer while grinding.\nCentrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C), and discard the supernatant.\nLyse red blood cells.",
    "Add 2 mL erythrocyte lysate and gently resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down. Let stand at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 2 min.\nAdd 8 mL 0.2% BSA PBS buffer. Centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C), and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 8 mL 0.2% BSA PBS buffer, repeat centrifugation as in step b.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 2 mL 0.2% BSA PBS buffer to resuspend the cells.\nCell count.\nCount viable cells and adjust to 1 × 107 cells/mL with 0.2% BSA PBS buffer.\nDistribute the cell suspension into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with 100 μL/tube (1×106 cells/tube).\nBlock Fc receptors.\nNote: Fc receptors bind antibody-antigen immune complexes and mediate adaptive immune responses. TruStain FcX PLUS is specific to the common epitope of CD16/CD32. It is useful for blocking nonspecific binding of immunoglobulin to Fc receptors.\nAdd 0.5 μL TruStain FcX PLUS (anti-mouse CD16/32) Antibody to each sample tube.\nMix well by vortexing. Place on ice for 10 min.\nCell surface staining with PE H-2Kb OVA tetramer.\nAdd 10 μL H-2Kb OVA Tetramer-PE to each test tube and mixed well.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in the dark.\nCell surface staining with FITC anti-mouse CD8 and PE/Cy7 anti-mouse CD44 antibodies.\nNote: CD44 is a marker of T-cell activation.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Colabeling of mouse spleen cells with CD8 antibody and CD44 antibody enables precise analysis of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells.\nAdd 0.625 μL FITC anti-mouse CD8 antibody and 1.25 μL PE/Cy7 anti-mouse CD44 antibody to each test tube and mixed well. Incubate for 20 min on ice in the dark.\nAdd 1.5 mL 0.2% BSA PBS buffer, and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant carefully.\nRepeat step b twice.",
    "Suspend the cells in 500 μL of 0.2% BSA PBS buffer.\nResuspend cell pellet in 0.5 mL of 0.2% BSA PBS buffer and add 5 μL of 7-AAD per million cells and incubate for 5–10 min in the dark before analysis.\nPerform flow cytometric analysis. Representative data and a gating strategy are shown in (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3035-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. OVA-specific CD8+ T cells from the spleen before and after OVA-Listeria monocytogenes infection\nSpleens were harvested from OVA-Listeria monocytogenes-infected and uninfected mice at 7 days post-infection.

Data are representative of three independent experiments (B). Unpaired t test for the measurements between the two groups(B):∗∗p < 0.01.\nNote: If the samples cannot be analyzed in time after processing, they can be stored at 4°C–8°C degrees in the dark but should not exceed 4 h.\nCritical: Mouse cells are fragile, so dissociating mouse spleen cells needs to be gentle and always moist.\nCritical: When lysing mouse spleen erythrocytes with erythrocyte lysing solution, it is important to strictly control the time and not exceed the recommended duration. This is to avoid any potential damage to other cells present in the sample.\nPart four: Detection of functional subsets of spleen T cells (on day 7 after infection)\nTiming: 8–10 h\nThis section describes the detection of functional T-cell immune responses in mice. Here, we assessed the function of T cells by detecting the expression of intracellular IFNγ, GzmB, TNFα and IL2.",
