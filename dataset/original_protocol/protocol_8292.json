    "1. Equipment and Materials\nPrepare the required components (listed in Table of Materials) of the electrophysiology rig to perform suction electrode recordings of the Drosophila CNS.\n\tNOTE: Prior to experimentation, it is necessary to construct chambers for dissection of the Drosophila CNS and to be used for bathing the ganglia in saline during recordings. A step-by-step outline of chamber construction is provided below.\nPrepare the larval chamber.\n\t\nMelt the black wax using a hot plate.\nPour 2 mL of melted wax into a chamber that has a maximum volume of 2 - 2.5 mL.\nLet the wax cool and harden for approximately 2 h.\nUse a razor blade to carve a hole in the hardened wax that will hold a volume of 500 µL, which has a surface area of approximately 0.5 cm2 and a depth of approximately 0.25 cm.\n2. Equipment and Software Configuration\nNOTE: The setup of the extracellular recording is briefly described below.\nPrepare equipment for dissection and recording.\n\t\nPosition the tissue preparation, microscope, suction electrode, micromanipulators, light source inside the Faraday cage to reduce noise and eliminate extraneous electrical fields (Figure 2).\nConnect (preferably solder) ground and positive wires onto shielded alligator clips that will be connected to the bath and microelectrode holder, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: Soldered and exposed wires can be covered with aluminum foil to reduce noise.\nConnect the ground and positive wires to input 1 of the AC/DC differential amplifier.\nConnect the data acquisition system to the AC/DC differential amplifier by connecting a Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) cable from input 1 of the data acquisition system to the channel 1 output of the amplifier.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to incorporate a 50/60 Hz noise eliminator between the data acquisition software and the amplifier. The use of a BNC T-connector is required.",
    "If desired, include an audio monitor into the setup by connecting input 1 of the audio monitor to input 1 of the data acquisition software.\nFill the 10 mL syringe with saline and connect it to the pressure port of the electrode holder.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that no air bubbles exist between the syringe, the Ag/AgCl pellet, and the electrode opening.\nPrepare the software for dissection and recording.\n\tNOTE: The outline of methods for software setup is based on the acquisition/analysis software listed in the Table of Materials which will digitize the raw electrical output and convert the data to spike frequency. However, other software can be used and multiple recording conversions can be used.\n\t\nOpen the acquisition/analysis software.\nClick on \"setup\" from the main toolbar and select \"channel settings,\" which will open a dialogue box.\nReduce the number of total channels to three.\nFor Channel 1, select a range of 100 mV. \nFor Channel 2, click on the \"calculation\" tab that will open a drop-down menu. Select \"cyclic measurements,\" which will open a second dialogue box.\nSelect channel 1 as the source. Then on the drop down menu measurement, select unit spike at events. Finally, in the detection settings area, from the drop down menu select simple threshold. \nTo convert the electrical activity into a rate plot expressed in hertz, the 3rd channel must be set in arithmetic mode: On the input window, type in \"1000*smoothsec(ch2,2)\". Then select as the units drop down menu hertz.",
    "NOTE: Successful recordings can be performed with multiple different recording setups, but \"Unit spike at events and simple threshold\" is likely the easiest, since it allows for adjustment of the threshold above the background activity for each individual recording. Recordings under the setting of \"Custom-Source Input\" increase reproducibility of the data assuming the background activity is not different between recordings.\nClose dialogue boxes to return to the main screen. The y-axis should be expressed in Hz and the x-axis in time.\n3. Dissect and Prepare the Larval Drosophila CNS\nNOTE: Methods for larval CNS dissection are clearly illustrated in Hafer and Schedl27, but these previously published methods reduce the length of the descending neurons that are important for measuring spike frequency. Here, an additional method is outlined to excise the larval CNS that maintains long, intact descending neurons.\nSaline preparation.\n\t\nPrepare the dissection and recording saline to the following in mM28: 157 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 4 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES); titrate pH to 7.25.\nDissect the larval Drosophila CNS.\n\t\nIdentify and extract a wandering third-instar Drosophila melanogaster from the culture vial and place into 200 µL of saline (Figure 3A).\nGrasp the mouth hooks with a pair of fine forceps and grasp the abdomen of the maggot with a second pair of forceps (Figure 3B).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not apply too much pressure to the abdomen as this can result in tearing of the thin cuticular layer of the maggot.\nGently pull the mouth hooks and abdomen in different directions to separate the caudal end of the maggot from the head region and expose the viscera of the maggot (Figure 3C).\n\t\tNOTE: The CNS will be intertwined with the trachea and digestive tract. Do not cut the CNS away from any tissue to prevent cutting the descending peripheral nerves.",
    "Tease the CNS out of the digestive tract and trachea with forceps (Figure 3D).\nIf necessary, disrupt the blood brain barrier by manually transecting the CNS posterior to the cerebral lobes with Vannas spring scissors.\n\t\tNOTE: This should be done based on the physiochemical properties of the chemical being used. The red line in Figure 4A is the suggested transection point and the transected CNS with intact descending peripheral nerve trunks shown in Figure 4B. The transected CNS is ready for experimentation after completion of step 3.2.5.\n4. Extracellular Recording of Drosophila  CNS.\nPrepare the CNS for recording.\n\t\nPull a glass pipette electrode from borosilicate glass capillaries to a resistance of 5-15 mΩ.\nInsert the transected CNS into the wax chamber that contains 200 µL of saline. Clamp an uncoated insect pin with the alligator clip soldered to the ground wire and insert the pin into the saline to complete the circuit.\nUsing the micromanipulators, orient the electrode to the caudal end of the transected CNS. Eliminate recording of background noise by adjusting the threshold level in the acquisition/analysis software prior to contacting the peripheral nerve trunks.\nDraw any convenient peripheral nerves into the suction electrode by applying slight negative pressure on the syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: The baseline firing frequency is correlated to the number of neurons drawn into the electrode where more neurons oftentimes result in increased resistance of the electrode.\nBegin extracellular recording of CNS descending nerve activity.\n\t\nStart the recording on the data acquisition software and monitor the baseline firing frequency. Allow the firing rate to equilibrate for 5 min prior to collecting baseline firing rate data.\nDiscard the preparation and recording if the pattern of firing of control treatment is not a bursting pattern similar to that shown in Figure 5A.",
    "NOTE: Altered pattern of firing suggests abnormal or unstable activity of the central pattern generator, which can alter neural function.\nAfter 5 min, add 200 µL of saline + vehicle to bring the total volume of the chamber to 400 µL to begin recording control firing rates.\nAfter baseline has been established (3-5 min), withdraw 200 µL of saline and add 200 µL of the experimental agent solubilized in saline.\n\t\tNOTE: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is the recommended solvent for lipophilic compounds and should not exceed 0.1% v/v.\nApply drug concentrations in a serial manner (low to high concentrations) and record each concentration for a select period of time (determined by the investigator based on the chemical properties of the drug29). Label this time point of drug application in the acquisition/analysis software by including a comment that includes the drug and the final concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: Firing activity of the CNS will decline by approximately 10-20% after 30-50 min after the dissection and therefore, appropriate untreated controls should be performed, and drug treatments should not exceed this time period.\nAnalyze the data.\n\tNOTE: Multiple analyses can be performed on the collected data, such as changes in action potential bursts29, spike waveform amplitude and time course, and determining mean spike frequencies after drug treatment26,30,31,32. The most common is determining the influence a drug has to the mean spike frequencies over a specified period of time, which is described below.\n\t\nTabulate mean spike frequencies by selecting the entire region of interest (i.e., the drug treatment time period) and determine mean spike frequencies automatically through the \"Datapad\" located on the main toolbar of the acquisition/analysis software.",
    "Determine the mean spike frequency of the CNS after drug treatment to the mean spike frequency of the vehicle control (baseline). Calculate the percent change of firing rate after drug treatment by the formula: (Treated Frequency/Baseline Frequency) × 100.\nUse the mean spike frequencies or percent firing of control for each concentration to construct a concentration response curve with standard graphing software.\nPerform statistical analysis (e.g., unpaired t-test) to determine significance between time points, concentrations, or drug treatments.\n\t\tNOTE: There are two primary methods for generating and analyzing concentration-response curves. The first method is one concentration per individual preparation. Here, the spike rate of the single concentration is normalized to baseline spike rate for each preparation. The benefits are reduced run down of the preparation due to shortened recording time, while the pitfalls are increased dissection time because this method will consist of 5-7 individual CNS preparations per concentration, and larger error bars on the averaged data set. The second method is multiple concentrations per individual preparation. Here, the spike rate for each of the 3-5 concentrations are normalized to the same baseline spike rate. The benefits are less dissection time and less variability between replicates for drug concentrations, while the pitfalls are the requirement of a fast-acting drug and unknown impact of previous drug concentration treatments on subsequent chemical treatments.\nSubscription Required.
