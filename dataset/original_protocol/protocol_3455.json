You need to take more practices before the experiments to avoid injecting drugs into muscle or connective tissues. A suitable volume for intravenous injection is about 200 μL/mice, and TNF can be diluted with PBS or saline. (2) In our lab, mice are injected intravenously with 300 mg/kg TNF (75 mg/mL) diluted in endotoxin free PBS. (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1])\nAlternatives: The mouse tail vein injection instrument can help new beginners to inject TNF into the mice through i.v. easier.\nTissue fixation and sectioning\nTiming: ≈2 days\nGenerally, cecum samples are harvested at 8 h after TNF injection.\nCut the cecum from mouse. Place tissue sample into a labeled 10-mL-tube containing 8 mL 4% paraformaldehyde to fix, and put these tubes on a shaker by 220 rpm shaking for 24–48 h at room temperature (25°C) (critical 1, 2, 3).\nCut the fixed cecum open to let all the feces out, and put the cleaned cecum into an embedding cassette, and label it clearly with pencil. (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3])\nTransfer tissue cassettes to the Semi-enclosed Benchtop Tissue Processor for dehydration: incubate sequentially in 50%, 70%, 80%, 95% v/v ethanol in water for 25 min each, in 95% v/v ethanol in water twice for 15 min each, in 100% v/v ethanol in water twice for 30 min each, in ethanol and xylene mixture (1:1 v/v) for 30 min, and then in xylene twice for 20 min each. Perform all the incubation processes at room temperature (25°C).\nInfiltrate tissues in processor with paraplast tissue embedding medium twice at 60°C for 1.5 h.",
    "Select an appropriately sized embedding mold and add molten embedding medium from the embedding workstation so that the mold is approximately three quarters full.\nUse warmed forceps to transfer the infiltrated tissue into the mold, and then place the mold on the 5°C cold plate of the embedding workstation. Use warmed forceps to keep the tissue in the desired orientation and press the tissue gently to make sure that all the air in the tissue is excluded before the paraffin cools and anchors the tissue in place.\nPlace the labeled tissue cassette lid over the top of the mold and dispense sufficient embedding medium over the lid to fill the mold. Transfer the mold and its lid to the 5°C cold plate for 10 min or until the paraffin has hardened enough for manual release of the tissue block from the base mold.\nPause Point: After embedded by paraffin, the sample can be stored for at least 6 months at room temperature (25°C).\nTrim blocks at room temperature (25°C) on a RM2016 microtome: cut 20 μm at a time in a continuous way until the appropriate surfaces of tissue in a block are visible.\nPut the trimmed blocks in refrigerator for 30 min and then manually section 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] μm thick tissue ribbons using a new disposable microtome blade.\nFloat tissue ribbons in a 42°C tissue flotation bath for 1–2 min and then lift individual tissue sections onto CITOGLAS slides (critical 4).\nPlace slides on a 42°C slide drier for 2 h until sample is free of visible moisture, and make sure there is no water under the tissue. If there is water, please use filter paper to absorb it.\nDry slides in a 56°C oven for 30 min and proceed with deparaffinization and immunohistochemical labeling.",
    "Pause Point: The dry slides can be stored for at least 6 months at room temperature (25°C).\nCritical: (1) The feces of cecum must be cleared after fixed by 4% PFA in order to avoid artificial damages to the epithelium of cecum and the blade. (2) Please make sure all the tissues are immersed in the 4% PFA buffer when the shaker is working. (3) Use at least 15 tissue volumes of 10% PFA to achieve adequate fixation. (4) It is very important to absorb all the water under the tissue otherwise the tissue may detach from the slide under these following steps.\nDeparaffinization and immunohistochemistry\nTiming: ≈2 days\nDeparaffinization: incubate three times in xylene for 10 min each, twice in 100% ethanol for 10 min each, 90% v/v ethanol in water for 5 min, 80% v/v ethanol in water for 5 min, 70% v/v ethanol in water for 5 min, and last wash three times for 5 min each by ddwater.\nPerform antigen retrieval: put the slide in the antigen retrieval buffer in a pressure cooker, and make sure the whole tissue is embedded in the buffer. Put the pressure cooker on an electromagnetic oven, and heat it under 1800 W. After the cooker begins to vent, start timing for 1.5 min and then let the cooker cool to room temperature naturally (critical 1, 2, 3).\nAfter antigen retrieval, use a Super PAP Pen to draw a circle around the tissue, and all the following regents and antibodies except the wash buffer are added in the circle (critical 4).\nThen, slides are washed three times for 5 min on a shaker under 220 rpm condition and then incubated in 50 μL 10% H2O2 v/v in ddwater for 5 min at room temperature (25°C).",
    "After three times of 5-min wash by wash buffer on a shaker under 220 rpm condition, these nonspecific binding sites are blocked by 50 μL 2% horse serum for 30 min at room temperature (25°C).\nStain with 1.05 μg/mL phospho-MLKL (S345) antibody (dilution rate: 1:1500) in 2.5% horse serum (total volume: 50 μL). Put the side in a slide holder, and then put the side holder in a refrigerator of 4°C for 12 h.\nNote: The side holder should have some water in side or the antibody dilution may evaporate owing to the refrigerator condition.\nAfter phospho-MLKL nurturing, put the slide holder at bench for 30 min to make sure the slide warm up to the room temperature.\nAfter three times of 5 min wash by wash buffer on a shaker under 220 rpm condition, incubate slides with ImmPRESS HRP Universal Antibody for 1 h at room temperature (25°C) and then wash the slides three times for 5 min each time by wash buffer on a shaker under 220 rpm condition, and develop the slides with DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine) for 2 min (critical 5).\nUse ddwater to wash the slides 3 times for 5 min each time on a shaker under 220 rpm condition.\nCounterstain the slides with 50 μL Hematoxylin for 1.5 min at room temperature (25°C).\nAfter 3 times of 10 s wash each time by ddwater, put the slide in 0.08% ammonia for 6 s, and wash 3 times for 10 s each time by ddwater.\nDehydrate slides by incubating them in 80% v/v ethanol in water for 1 min, 90% ethanol for 1 min, twice in 100% ethanol for 1 min, and then twice in xylene for 1 min.",
    "Place coverslip over the slides with permanent mounting medium using neutral balsam. Press softly to exclude all the air between the slides and coverslips in and around the tissue (critical 6).\nPut the neutral balsam to dry in a fume hood at room temperature (25°C) for 12 h.\nPause Point: These slides can be stored permanently at room temperature (25°C).\nUse Aperio VERSA to capture the image and analysis the data (critical 7).\nCritical: (1) The concentration and pH of the antigen retrieval buffer are critical. The wrong concentration and pH may cause very strong false positive signaling! (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]) (2) Please count the time of antigen retrieval when the pressure cooker begins to vent. (3) The time course of antigen retrieval is also very important to expose antigenic sites, because too long or too short exposure will cause false positive signaling or signaling loss. (4) The circle drawn around the tissue should not get too close to the tissue or the edge of the tissue might not get enough nurturing of every treatment. (5) When you develop phospho-MLKL, you should do it under the microscope to check the developing status. When you see the signaling of phospho-MLKL, stop the time of development. Generally, it takes 2 min. (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]) (6) To exclude the air between the slide and cover slips, you must avoid pressing the tissue too hard which may cause artificial damage to the tissue. (7) The signaling of phospho-MLKL will appear in these damage areas, as described in Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]. Hence, when you find the damaged area, it will help you find the signaling of phospho-MLKL more quickly and correctly."
