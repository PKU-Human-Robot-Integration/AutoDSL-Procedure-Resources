Make the solutions above for the decellularization process. Store at 4 °C. Approximately 2.5 L will be needed for one porcine lung.\n1. Hydrogel Formation\nPorcine Lung Decellularization (adapted from references9,10)\nObtain, an en bloc normal porcine lung, from a slaughterhouse, with heart and vasculature intact.\nUse tissue scissors or a scalpel to dissect away the heart, cutting vasculature as close as possible to the heart, remaining vasculature will be used in later steps for perfusion.\nCarefully dissect away the connective tissue surrounding the trachea, bronchi, and vasculature using a scalpel or scissors.\n\t\tNOTE: Determine the best lung to use for the rest of the procedure by choosing a lung without large cuts or punctures through the pleura and large amounts of atelectasis or vascular occlusion that may impede the effectiveness of the decellularization process.\nCut away the suboptimal lung leaving as much bronchus attached to the trachea as possible (heart, connective tissue and the lobes of the removed lung may be disposed of). There should be one lung remaining attached to the trachea and vasculature.",
    "NOTE: Retain sections for histology if desired.9\nClose disconnected bronchi with clamps or suture to prevent excess backflow.\nPrepare the decellularization solutions and refrigerate at 4 °C until needed (Table 1).\nUsing a hand pump cannulated to fit the pulmonary artery, perfuse the lung tissue 3 times with DI water through both pulmonary artery and trachea. Perfuse vasculature first each time. Begin with around 1 L into vasculature and 1.5 L into trachea for each perfusion, but as cellular debris is removed more liquid can be perfused through the system.\nPerfuse both vasculature and trachea with Triton X-100 solution.\nSubmerge lung tissue in Triton X-100 solution for 24 hr at 4 °C.\nPerfuse vasculature and trachea 3 times with DI water to rinse.\nPerfuse both vasculature and trachea with deoxycholate solution.\nSubmerge the tissue sections in deoxycholate for 24 hr at 4°C.\nPerfuse vasculature and trachea 3 times with DI water to rinse.\nPerfuse both vasculature and trachea with NaCl solution.\nSubmerge tissue in filtered NaCl solution for 1 hr at 4 °C.\nPerfuse vasculature and trachea 3 times with DI water to rinse.\nPerfuse both vasculature and trachea with DNase solution.\nSubmerge tissue in filtered DNase solution for 1 hr at 4 °C.\nPerfuse both vasculature and trachea 5 times with PBS.\nDissect away noticeable cartilaginous tissue, trachea and all tubules 2 mm or larger in diameter (primarily found around the hilum and medial portions of the lungs) from conducting airways, leaving only respiratory zones (primarily the peripheral areas).\nDissect tissue into 1 inch sections or smaller. Orientation of the tissue does not matter for this step.\nPour off excess liquid and place tissue in 50 ml conical tubes. Freeze the tissue at -80 °C.",
    "NOTE: Retain sections for histology to ensure removal of cells and cellular debris, if desired. We use H&E, α-galactosidase, picogreen, hydroxyproline, ninhydrin, alcian blue, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry to characterize.9\nLung Processing\nRemove lids from frozen tubes containing decellularized lung tissue.\nPlace filter paper over the tube opening and secure with rubber band.\n\t\tNOTE: Tube and contents should still be frozen otherwise place in -80 °C until frozen.\nLyophilize the tissue until all excess liquid is gone, using a freeze dryer according to manufacturer directions. Store at -80 °C until ready to mill.\nBefore beginning add liquid nitrogen to freezer mill to cool insulation and internal components to working conditions.\nRemove magnetic mill bar from mill tube and add tissue to cover bottom.\nReplace mill bar and add loosely packed tissue. The mill bar should still move freely.\nClose the mill tube and place in freezer mill.\nFill liquid nitrogen to max fill line.\nFreezer mill all tissue into fine powder (approximately 5 min, impaction rate of ~600 min-1), in a polycarbonate cylinder with a stainless steel impactor as well as stainless steel end plugs using the freezer mill according to manufacturer directions. Store at -80 °C until ready for use.\nMicro-porous gel formation (8 mg/ml) (adapted from references9,11)\nAdd 1% (w/v) of the decellularized powder and 0.1% (w/v) of pepsin to 0.01 M HCl, under constant agitation (should be able to see flow at the top level of liquid), at room temperature, for 48 hr.\n\t\tNOTE: The powder is statically charged, so adding the HCl after the powder affords the opportunity to wash the excess off the tube walls.\nAfter digestion for 48 h, place the solution and reagents on ice for 5 min.",
    "Using refrigerated 10% (v/v) 0.1 M NaOH, and 11.11% (v/v) 10x PBS (to bring the entire solution to 1x concentration), bring the digested protein solution to physiologic pH of 7.4.\n\t\tNOTE: The solution can now be stored at 4 °C for up to one week. Perform gelation kinetics using rheometry9 if desired.\n2. Cross-linking Hydrogels to Improve Mechanical Strength\nSolutions of 1%, 0.1%, and 0.01% w/v genipin crosslinking solution were prepared by dissolving the necessary amount of genipin powder in 10% DMSO.\nVortex the solution every 15 min for 1 hr.\nAdd genipin solution to cover ECM hydrogels (100 µL for each well of a 96-well plate) that have previously been assembled in part 1.3.4.\nLeave each ECM hydrogel to crosslink for 24 hr at 37 °C.\nRinse the ECM hydrogel 3 times with PBS until the washing solution is no longer blue. The crosslinked hydrogels will then be ready for further characterization and cell culture studies.\n3. Cell Culture with Microporous Gel\nTwo-dimensional coating\nUsing the solution from 1.3.3, add 20 µl of pregel solution to each well of a 96-well non-treated tissue culture plate.\nRefrigerate overnight at 4 °C to allow protein adsorption to plate.\nAspirate pregel solution and rinse with PBS.\nPassage cells9.\nAdd 10,000 cells/cm2 to wells.\nIncrease media to 100 µl per well and incubate at 37 °C.\nThree dimensional cell culture9\nUsing solution from 1.3.3, resuspend pelleted cells to a concentration of 1,000,000 cells/ml of pregel solution.\nQuickly dispense 16 µl of pregel-cell suspension into each well of a 96-well plate, to form a ~500 µm thick hydrogel for 3D cell culture.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min for gel to form.\nAdd 100 µl of media to the top of formed hydrogels and incubate at 37 °C.",
    "Three dimensional cell culture on variable stiffness gels\nUsing solution from 1.3.3, pipette 100 µl of pregel solution into each well of a 96-well plate.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 minutes for gel to form.\n\t\tNote: Cross-linking steps from part 2 can be used here.\nPassage cells9.\nAdd 10,000 cells/cm2 to wells.\nIncrease media to 100 µl per well and incubate at 37 °C.\nSubscription Required.
