    "The present protocol has been performed with the approval of an ethical committee (agreement VD3602, Lausanne, Switzerland) and follows European guidelines for the use of animals.\n1. Rat hippocampal astrocyte primary culture\nSacrifice five rat pups (Wistar IGS Rat) by decapitation at postnatal day 1-2.\nRemove the brain and keep it in a Petri dish containing 5 mL of fresh astrocyte medium (DMEM with GlutaMAX supplemented with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 10% fresh Horse Serum).\nIsolate the hippocampus. Dissociate in 5 mL of the astrocytic medium by three passages through a 21 G needle and three passages through a 25 G needle.\nTransfer the dissociated cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and count in a hemocytometer.\nPlate 20,000-25,000 cells/cm2 in multiwell dishes (9.4 mm x 10.7 mm x 9.3 mm) and store them at 37 °C under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for the rest of the experiment.\nReplace the medium entirely at 3 days in vitro (DIV3).\nAt DIV8, add 0.6 pg of p24 antigen per cell of lentiviral vector coding for mitochondrial biosensor MitoTimer (LV-G1-MitoTimer22) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS + 0.01% BSA).\nAt DIV9, wash with pre-warmed 1x sterile PBS (37 °C) and add fresh astrocyte medium.\nAt DIV11, perform 2 washes with pre-warmed 1x sterile PBS (37 °C) and add fresh astrocyte medium without phenol red.",
    "​NOTE: Choice of the coating depends on the intended assay. As a standard coating for astrocyte primary culture, it is recommended to use 0.2 mg/mL poly-D-lysine or 8.7 µg/cm2 of basement membrane matrix (e.g., Matrigel). To visualize the mitochondrial system of astrocytes, it is essential to work on flattened and stretched cells. In this context, the combination of basement membrane matrix on IBIDI u-slides is the most suitable. It is also crucial not to work with phenol red, which is toxic for the cell under repeated exposure to light.\n2. Long-term monitoring of the mitochondrial system.\nAssess the astrocytic mitochondrial system a minimum of 3-5 days after the lentiviral infections with LV-G1-MitoTimer (to allow a sufficient level of fluorescence in the mitochondria).\nImage the cells with an inverted microscope controlled by the acquisition and analysis software and a module for full automation of acquisition.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for the details of the software and module used in this study.\nEnsure that the microscope is equipped with a cage incubator (see Table of Materials) to maintain astrocyte culture at 5% CO2 and 37 °C throughout the experiment.\nCapture fluorescence images using sequential excitation at 490 nm (for green channel) and 550 nm (for red channel) with detection of green (500-540 nm for green channel) and red (550-600 nm for red channel) fluorescence signals.\nSelect 5 astrocytes per well with a mitochondrial network expressing sufficient levels of LV-G1-MitoTimer using a magnification of 40x. Take care to select astrocytes as flat and large as possible and not located in clusters of cells (to work on individual cells).\nSave the coordinates of the 5 selected cells in an xlm file (map.xlm). This map.xlm allows the user to return to the same cells over time.",
    "Acquire image sequences (1 image/s for 60 s) using a magnification of 150x (100x oil immersion objective, 1.5x intermediate magnification) for each coordinates.\nRepeat image acquisition (1 image/s for 60 s) for the same astrocytes 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after treatments.\n\t​NOTE: Use a microscope equipped with a fast and efficient autofocus system. In this context, the hardware solution called Perfect Focus System (PFS) was used. PFS uses near-infrared 870-nm LED and CCD line sensors to combat axial focus fluctuations in real-time during long-term imaging investigations.\n3. Analysis of individual mitochondrial morphology and LV-G1-MitoTimer ratio\nNOTE: NIS General Analysis 3 (GA3) from Nikon was used to automatize morphometric analysis in this study.\nFor each image sequence (baseline, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h), select the first frame for red and green channels by clicking on ND Processing > Select Frame.\nMerge the red and the green channels by selecting Conversions > Merge Channel.\nTo correct image shading, select Preprocessing > Auto Shading Correction.\nApply the Rolling Ball algorithm by selecting Preprocessing > Rolling Ball.\nTo generate binary masks for each mitochondrion, select Segmentation > Threshold.\nRemove any objects truncated by the border by selecting Binary processing > Touching Border.\nTo measure the surface area, select Measurement > Object Area.\nTo measure the diameter, select Measurement > Eq Diameter.\nTo measure the length, select Measurement > Length.\nTo measure the width, select Measurement > Width.\nTo measure roughness, select Measurement > Roughness.\nTo measure circularity, select Measurement > Circularity.\nTo measure elongation, select Measurement > Elongation.\nCompose a group (right-click) with the above measurement and rename it as MorphoData.\nMeasure mean green intensity by selecting Measurement > Mean Intensity.\nMeasure mean red intensity by selecting Measurement > Mean Intensity.\nTo measure the Red/Green ratio, select Measurement > Ratio.",
    "Compose a group (right-click) with the above measurement and rename it as RatioData.\nExport the table to a CSV file by selecting Reference > Table to CSV.\nSave the GA3 script of analysis by selecting Save As\n\tNOTE: A non-exhaustive list of the criteria used in this procedure is summarized in Figure 1, Table 1, and Table 2. The analysis GA3 script file is available in supplemental (Supplemental Coding File 1 and Figure 2). The thresholds used were adapted to individualize as many mitochondria as possible (excluding large mitochondrial networks where possible). Wherever possible, mitochondrial networks are either individualized manually or excluded from the analyses. Due to intercellular variability, perform these analyses on at least 20-25 cells per condition (with a minimum of 50 mitochondria by cell).\n4. Analysis of mitochondrial motility\nNOTE: Due to the high complexity of mitochondrial movements, manual motility analysis is preferred. Here, Nikon's NIS Element system was used to manually track mitochondria.\nOpen the tracking module in NIS, select View > Analysis > Tracking.\nClick on Define New ROI.\nWith the Automatic Detection Tool, select 25-50 mitochondria on the first image of the image sequence.\nClick on Track Autodetected ROIs Analyze.\nIf necessary, delete the incorrect ROI tracks.\nExport the table to a CSV file.",
    "​NOTE: A non-exhaustive list of the criteria used in this procedure is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 3. A tracking analysis generally gives a path depicting the movements of the center of every tracked object. The different tracking options must be set in the tracking option. Favor the selection of isolated mitochondria that are sufficiently distant from each other to facilitate tracking. Keep only the objects that could consistently be tracked over the whole sequence. Proceed the same way to remove outliers due to bad quality tracking. Consequently, the set of objects analyzed in this section is different from the one analyzed for static morphological analyses and will generally be smaller.\n5. Data transformation, normalization, and statistical analysis\nNOTE: Mainly due to the high heterogeneity of the mitochondria, data generated often have a non-normal distribution.\nManually log-transform the measurements prior to processing.\nFor each analysis and time frame, manually normalize the resulting data by the mean of those obtained in the reference acquisition.\nIn addition, consider a second/double normalization to a control condition, for example, to evaluate the effect of a treatment.\nThen, perform statistical analysis using a two-way matched ANOVA. Here GraphPad Prism V8 was used."
