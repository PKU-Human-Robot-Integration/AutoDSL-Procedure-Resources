    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: Each perfusion will take between 10 and 20 min. We strongly advise that you transport the mice from the mouse facility to your lab room in their cage at least 30 min before beginning the perfusion. Some labs routinely remove food and water 30 min before anesthesia, but we have not found any scientific justification for this practice for mice that are going to be sacrificed.\nNote: Before you begin: i) double-check that the pump is operational. Install all of the tubes in the order specified in the procedure section; and ii) clean your chemical hood with alcohol. If you plan to perfuse your mice on a regular basis, we recommend to have a dedicated chemical hood. Follow the approved mouse protocol from the IACUC - American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.\nBrain mouse perfusion\nTiming: 15–30 min per animal\nThis section will walk you through the steps necessary to ensure appropriate PFA perfusion of the brain.\nPrepare milliQ water, PBS 1× solution, and 4% PFA. If PFA was previously stored at −20°C, unfreeze the solution at room temperature.\nFill the required number of 20 mL HDPE Scintillation vials with polypropylene cap (one per brain) with about 10 mL of 4% PFA in PBS 1× solution.\nPrepare surgical instruments needed for brain extraction: scissors, forceps, spatula.\nFill the tubing with PBS 1× by inserting the free end to the falcon tube (50 mL conical falcon tube) containing PBS 1× solution and turning on the peristaltic pump until the solution starts coming from the needle on the other end (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1713-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mouse perfusion and brain dissection\n(A) Peristaltic pump setup highlighting the tubing and needle positioning.\n(B) After the mouse is anesthetized, immobilize the animal using tapes on a flat surface.",
    "(C) Pull the skin taut to make an incision.\n(D) Find the diaphragm, gently cut through it and along the rib cage to reveal the heart.\n(E) Insert the needle in the left ventricle (LV) and start pumping with PBS 1×.\n(F) Make a small incision on the right atrium (RA).\n(G) A good sign of PFA 4% solution entering the system is a twitching tail (TT).\n(H) Cut the skin longitudinally.\n(I) Expose the skull as much as you can.\n(J) Cut the skull longitudinally.\n(K) Lift the right and left portion of the skull to reveal the brain (an optimal perfusion will reveal a white brain with no blood).\n(L) Delicately lift the brain from the bottom with a spatula to collect the tissue.\nUnder the fume hood, anesthetize the mouse by injecting 240 mg/kg of Avertin. Alternatively, use a IACUC-approved option for anesthesia, e.g., Ketamine cocktail.\nCritical: To check if an animal is fully anesthetized, after 10 min pinch the foot with surgical tweezers. A fully anesthetized animal will not respond.\nPlace the animal on its back on a raised flat surface (use a plastic tray or styrofoam) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nFix paws with tape (or needle if you use a styrofoam) to immobilized them (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPull the skin on the abdomen and make an incision with standard dissecting scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nInsert the tip of the scissors and expand the gap, being careful not to damage the liver.\nCritical: Do not damage or touch the liver, or the perfusion will be compromised.\nAfter visualizing the diaphragm, gently cut through it and along the rib cage to reveal the heart.",
    "Cut between the ribs toward the spinal cord, avoiding the lungs, in order to lift the upper part of the rib cage and expose the heart (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nInsert the 27G needle into the left ventricle shallowly to avoid damaging the heart (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nTurn on the pump at 36 mL/min from the PBS 1× falcon tube (see step 4 above).\nQuickly make a small incision on the right atrium. Thick blood should be seen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nContinue to perfuse with PBS 1× until the liver changes color from dark to light brown and the body structures (paws, for instance) become white.\nNote: Another way to check the success of the perfusion is to cut the end of the tail and wait until you see clear drops of PBS 1×; by this point the entire body and brain would be perfused.\nStop the pump and transfer the free end of tubing into the falcon containing 50 mL of 4% PFA (usually 25 mL are enough) solution and resume the pumping.\nNote: When the PFA solution enters the system, the tail and paws will move or twitch (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). When the paws and tail become rigid and inflexible, stop the pump.\nRemove the needle from the heart, flush the needle and the tubes with water, refill with 1× PBS in preparation for the next animal.\nDecapitate the mouse with the bandage scissors: cut at the neck and remove the skin longitudinally with standard scissors starting from the neck to the ears (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nUsing Iris scissors, remove the skull from the occipital region longitudinally to the nasal bones (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I and 1J).\nUsing forceps, lift the right and left portions of the skull bone in order to reveal the brain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).",
    "Use a spatula to remove the brain and place it in the 20 mL vial containing 10 mL of 4% PFA (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L).\nKeep brain overnight in 4% PFA solution at 4°C.\nBrain saturation in sucrose solution\nTiming: 3–4 days\nSucrose prevents the formation of crystal formations within the tissue during the cryo-preservation and -embedding process. Here, we will go over a step-by-step procedure to ensure proper treatment.\nThe next day the brain should have sunk to the bottom of the vial. Replace with 5% sucrose in PBS 1×, gently shake for 1 h at 4°C.\nReplace the sucrose 5% solution with 10% sucrose water solution, gently shake for 1 h at 4°C.\nReplace with 20% sucrose water solution and wait until the brain sinks to the bottom of the vial. This can take from 2 h to overnight.\nWhen the brain has sunk to the bottom of the vial again, after 2 h or the next day, replace with 30% sucrose water solution and place the vial at 4°C overnight (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1713-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Brain saturation in sucrose and O.C.T. embedding\n(A) Brain at the bottom of the vial with 30% sucrose water solution.\n(B) Remove the extra sucrose from the brain with a Kimwipe.\n(C and D) Remove the extra sucrose from the hemispheres with a Kimwipe and a 10 μm tip.\n(E) Place the brain in O.C.T. and align the tissue.\n(F) Place the O.C.T. brain in dry ice.\n(G) When frozen take out the embedded tissues in O.C.T. and fix it into the cryostat chuck in dry ice.\n(H) Place the chuck with the embedded tissue in the cryostat and align it to be sectioned.\n(I) Collect the sectioned slices in a 12-well plate. OB, olfactory bulb; CB, cerebellum.\nCryostat brain sectioning\nTiming: 1 day",
    "This section will explain how to properly embed tissue for a sagittal section.\nCarefully remove the brain from 30% sucrose solution with a spatula, place the brain on a Kimwipe and dry it by applying extremely light pressure (do not damage the brain) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nRemove the extra sucrose between the brain hemispheres with the use of a small 10 μL tip and delicately push the Kimwipe between the hemispheres (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nPlace the brain into a freezing mold, cover with Tissue-Plus™ O.C.T. Compound (an embedding medium for frozen tissues specimens to ensure optimal cutting temperature) and with the spatula flip over itself a couple of times to coat the brain with O.C.T.\nGently transfer the brain at the bottom of a new freezing mold and gently push it down to make it as flat as possible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCritical: When covering with O.C.T. do it first at room temperature very slowly to avoid bubbles. Too many bubbles, in particular close to the tissue, will affect the sectioning process.\nNote: In this protocol we use sagittal sections. Be sure the brain is flat when placed at the bottom of the mold and annotate the front (olfactory bulbs), rear (cerebellum), left, and right side of the brain outside the mold with a permanent marker in order to preserve the orientation. Alternatively, you can first cut the brain in half along the sagittal axis and include the two half separately in order to process them in two different phases.\nSurround the freezing mold containing the brain and O.C.T. with dry ice in order to slowly solidify the O.C.T (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).",
    "Take the frozen O.C.T. embedded brain out from the mold and fix it into the cryostat chuck attaching the frontal-occipital part of the brain with a small amount of O.C.T. in dry ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G); in this way the brain is ready to be sectioned sagittally.\nMount the frozen O.C.T. embedded tissue on Leica CM3050S Cryostat and start sectioning sagittally at 40 μm thickness (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nNote: Brain tissues embedded in O.C.T. can be stored at -80°C for a long time. Before sectioning the tissue, place the O.C.T.-embedded tissues at -20°C in the cryostat for two hours to equilibrate the tissue. Do not leave the O.C.T.-embedded tissues in the cryostat overnight because the cryostat usually is set to defrost every 24 h. Alternatively, you may take out the O.C.T.-embedded tissue out of -80°C and leave it in the -20°C the night before sectioning.\nCollect the slices in a 12-well plate filled with 1 mL of PBS 1× with 0.02% of Sodium Azide.\nNote: The wells can accommodate four slices from adult mice without crowding. While the number of slices you can accommodate for wells depends on your genotype (e.g., smaller brain), we nevertheless recommend that you don’t go over four.\nKeep track of how many slices you suspend in each well and store them at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I) this information will help you estimate where the middle of the brain is (for the next step).\nAfter all the slices have been collected, we recommend mounting them beginning with the middle sections of the brain, which will be the largest sagittal sections (and also contain the largest sections of the cerebellum).",
    "Note: If you are dissecting a wild-type adult mouse, and you do not lose any slices, you will likely place four slices in each well and use six 12-well plates. 6 × 12 = 72 wells, so your 36th well will contain slices from the middle of the brain. Start the mounting from this well and move one well at a time toward either side of the brain.\nCritical: One adult mouse brain sectioned into 40 μm slices can be accommodated in five to six 12-well plates. Considering the large number of sections, we recommend the use of Sodium Azide at 0.02% to avoid bacterial growth over longer storage periods.\nPurkinje cells immunofluorescence\nTiming: 5 days\nThe immunofluorescence method and imaging of Purkinje neurons will be described in this section.\nUse the disposable 2 mL plastic transfer pipet (cut off the thin tip first for this passage) to transfer the sections from the 12 well plate where they were collected during the sectioning to a new 12 well plate already filled with PBS 1×.\nRinse for 10′ on a Rocker II at room temperature.\nRemove the PBS 1× using a transfer pipette and block the sections with 0.5 mL–1 mL blocking solution. Gently shake the sections for 1 h at 4°C on a Rocker II.\nNote: Select 4–5 sections per brain from the middle of the brain to cover the entire structure of the cerebellum.\nCritical: We find that 0.5 mL of blocking solution seems to work best with the Leica microscope, but 1 mL seems to give a better signal with other confocal microscopes.",
    "Remove the blocking solution and incubate the sections in 0.5 mL blocking solution containing the primary antibody Rabbit α-IP3R1 (1:500, Pierce) and mouse α-Calbindin (1:1000) for 48 h at 4°C gently shaking on a Rocker II.\nWash the sections 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] times with TBS-T 1× gently shaking, 20 min per wash.\nWrap the 12-well plate with an aluminum foil to avoid the bleach of the fluorescent signal.\nIncubate the sections in 0.5 mL of blocking solution containing 1:1500 of secondary antibody conjugate to a fluorophore for 48 h at 4°C, gently shaking.\nWash the sections 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] times with TBS-T, gently shaking, 20 min per wash.\nRinse off TBS-T 1× with PBS 1× before mounting the sections.\nCut off the thin tip of the plastic transfer pipette, treat the inside of the pipette with 2% BSA in PBS 1×. Use this treated pipette for transferring the sections to the slides.\nFill in half the PIREX reusable Petri dish bottom with PBS 1×.\nTransfer the sections to the Petri dish using a transfer pipet (we suggest to cut the tip by 1–2 cm to make it blunt).\nGently arrange the sections to the slides using the brush without folds or wrinkles. Be careful to not damage the tissue sections (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1713-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Transferring the O.C.T. brain sections to slides\n(A) Handling brain sections in a PIREX reusable Petri dish bottom filled in half with PBS 1×.\n(B–D) Gently spread the sections on the slides using the brush to flatten them. One to three sections can easily fit onto one microscope slide.\nRemove the extra PBS 1× with vacuum or Kimwipe, 1–3 sections can be mounted on one slide with one 25 mm × 25 mm cover glass (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).",
    "Use one drop of PROLONG-GOLD antifade mounting medium for one 25 mm × 25 mm cover glass.\nUse the vacuum with a 200 μL tip to remove the excess mounting medium around the cover glass and between the slide and cover glass.\nLeave the slides in the dark and let them dry overnight. Seal the slides the following day with clear nail polish, let dry, and store at 4°C.\nCritical: From step 42 onward the 12-well plates and the mounted sections need to be protected from light as much as possible.\nImages for immunohistochemistry are taken from anterior lobules with confocal microscopy.\nAcquire images of the cerebella stained with IP3R1 and Calbindin at 20× and 63× magnification using the Z-Stack imaging function and acquiring at least 40 images at 1 μm thickness.\nUsing Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence make 3D-reconstruction of the Z-Stack acquired, using the pre-standard and automatic “Volume reconstruction” function.\nSave all the images in single channel and in 3D.\nNote: The fully developed cerebellum is composed of ten folia (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A), each of which contains three layers (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Because Purkinje cells degenerate at different rates in different folia, we recommend that you scan the entire cerebellum first with a 10× or 20× objective, then focus on the larger/middle folia (V to VIII) that include more aligned Purkinje cells.\nNote: Here we used two antibodies, Calbindin and IP3R1. Both can, in principle, mark both soma and dendrites. We find, however, that Calbindin is best for visualizing Purkinje cell bodies, while IP3R1, which is a large-conductance cation channel mediating Ca2+ release, is best for marking the dendrites.",
    "Note: The more images acquired by Z-stack, the higher the 3D resolution will be. Since acquiring more images takes more time and increases the likelihood of signal bleaching, we recommend the acquisition to 40 images (1 μm thick).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1713-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
