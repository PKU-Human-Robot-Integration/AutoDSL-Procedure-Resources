    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue homogenization\nTiming: ∼5 min/sample\nFully homogenizing your tissue is critical for assay reproducibility. These steps walk through tissue homogenization and quality control to ensure sample opacity will not interfere with the assay.\nPlace your Dounce homogenizer(s) on ice and add 750 μL Endotoxin free water to each one.\nNote: The amount of water you are homogenizing your sample in should be optimized in house for each sample type. We found 750 μL worked well for ∼85 mg of tissue, so this would be a good starting point. However, the properties of each tissue – such as amount of connective tissue - will dictate how much water is needed for thorough homogenization. To run your sample in triplicate (with one replicate being spiked to ensure accurate recovery), a minimum of 300 μL will be needed. To optimize water volume, homogenize one sample in 350 μL endotoxin free water. Add more water (50–100 μL at a time) if needed to ensure tissue is fully homogenized.\nTransfer your tubes containing your frozen tissue from the −80°C to your workspace on dry ice, and quickly tip your tissue from the tube to the glass homogenizer.\nCritical: Do not let your tissue start to thaw in the tube – work in batches if needed!\nHomogenize your sample manually by twisting and re-inserting the T-shaped pestle into the collection piece of the Dounce homogenizer until there are no visible tissue pieces left.\nCritical: Avoid raising the pestle above the tissue suspension volume as this creates bubbles which can make it difficult to see when the tissue is fully homogenized.\nCritical: To avoid the tissue suspension spilling out of the homogenizer, be sure the suspension does not exceed one-third the total volume of the chamber.",
    "Transfer your tissue homogenate to a sterile glass tube (Pyrogen-free Dilution Tube), and seal well with parafilm and tape (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1989-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sealing glass tubes for sample storage\nSealing the tube thoroughly prevents contamination between homogenization and running the assay.\nPause point: Once homogenized, your samples can be stored at −20°C for a short period of time. We have stored them for up to one week without issue.\nWash and re-sterilize your Dounce homogenizers before preparing another sample (see “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” step 1).\nRunning the assay\nTiming: ∼3 h\nThe following steps are based on the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/US/en/download/product/asset/30977]. Briefly, standards are generated by serial dilution for a standard curve, and samples are diluted prior to being loaded onto the plate. Samples and standards are assayed for endotoxin levels [EU/mL].\nNote: Plan your plate layout before you begin. While not required, we recommend including a blank (water only) in every run using the water aliquot(s) used to homogenize your tissue. This will inform you of any potential contamination within your water (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for expected blank trace/data).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1989-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Serial dilution for endotoxin standards\nThe amount of water needed to add to the lyophilized standard to obtain 50 EU/mL is lot dependent. Figure made with BioRender.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1989-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example trace results of kinetic LAL assay\nOptical density (absorbance at 405 nm) versus time is used to determine the 0.2 ΔO.D. threshold (when the absorbance has changed by ≥0.2 compared to the baseline reading). The time to threshold from this baseline corrected data is then used to extrapolate EU/mL from the standard curve. Example graphs in this figure correspond to example data in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1989_1.csv\nVisualization of kinetic results corresponds to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].",
    "Critical: Run each sample in triplicate, where one of the triplicates is a spiked sample (see step 11 below). A spiked sample will allow you to ensure that your sample has no intrinsic properties that inhibit the enzymatic activity required for endotoxin detection.\nTurn the plate reader on and set it to incubate at 37°C.\nBring kit reagents to room temperature (20°C–24°C).\nPrepare standards in sterile glass tubes by serial dilution (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We used the same standard concentrations as recommended in the protocol, but these could be adjusted depending on your sample.\nAdd 900 μL LAL Reagent water to 4 glass tubes.\nReconstitute the endotoxin standard (E. coli 055:B5) in the volume of water specified by your specific kit.\nNote: You can find the volume of water needed for reconstituting your standard at lonza.com/coa[href=http://lonza.com/coa]. You will need the catalog number and lot number of the kit (not the catalog or lot number from the bottle of endotoxin within the kit). The volume will be listed under “CSE Reconstitution Volume (mL)” on the Certificate of Analysis.\nVortex the reconstituted standard for a minimum of 15 min. This standard is 50.0 Endotoxin Units (EU)/mL.\nAdd 100 μL of 50.0 EU/mL endotoxin stock to 900 μL LAL Reagent Water in a glass tube. Vortex for at least one minute (This is now your 5.0 EU/mL stock).\nAdd 100 μL of 5.0 EU/mL endotoxin standard to 900 μL LAL Reagent Water in a glass tube. Vortex for at least one minute (This is now your 0.5 EU/mL stock).\nAdd 100 μL of 0.5 EU/mL endotoxin standard to 900 μL LAL Reagent Water in a glass tube. Vortex for at least one minute (This is now your 0.05 EU/mL stock).",
    "Add 100 μL of 0.05 EU/mL endotoxin standard to 900 μL LAL Reagent Water in a glass tube. Vortex for at least one minute (This is now your 0.005 EU/mL stock).\nDilute your samples 1:5 in LAL Reagent Water.\nCritical: Dilution factors will need to be optimized for each tissue type to ensure the opacity of the tissue homogenate does not interfere with the assay. We had success with 1:2-1:5 dilution factors for fetal tissue. To optimize dilution factors, measure the absorbance of your undiluted sample at 405 nm. According to the manufacturer, any sample that has an OD >1.5 at 405 nm needs to be diluted before running. However, we have found that samples with an OD >1 can also be less reliable, and we recommend diluting your sample until you reach an OD <1. To do this, add endotoxin free water (50–100 μL at a time), briefly vortex your tissue homogenate, and re-measure the absorbance of your sample at 405 nm. Use the final volume of added water in your test sample for all other samples moving forward and make note of the dilution factor for data analysis. If working with larger tissues, it is possible that the tissue suspension could interfere with the assay in the case of incomplete homogenization. See “Limitations: use of adult tissue\" for further optimization.\nLoad 100 μL of your standards and diluted samples to the plate in triplicate.\nAdd 10 μL of 5.0 EU/mL standard (from step 8d) to one replicate of each sample. This sample should give you an endotoxin readout of 0.5 EU/mL within 50%–200% (0.25–1.0 EU/mL).",
    "Critical: Running a spiked sample is essential when working with tissue, as tissue opacity (among other intrinsic tissue properties) can significantly interfere with endotoxin detection. If your spiked sample returns an [EU/mL] outside the expected range (see Note following Quantification details), do not use any measurements pertaining to that sample in further analyses. With this protocol, we experienced ∼5% samples that needed to be excluded due to inaccurate spiked sample recovery.\nNote: If you anticipate the endotoxin levels in your samples to be >1 EU/mL, use the 50.0 EU/mL standard to spike your samples, which should give you a final endotoxin concentration of 5.0 EU/mL within 50%–200% (2.5–10 EU/mL).\nOnce all standards and samples are loaded, place your plate in the prewarmed (37°C) plate reader and incubate for 10 min.\nNear the end of the 10-min incubation, reconstitute Kinetic-QCL reagent vial(s) with 2.6 mL LAL Reagent Water/vial.\nCritical: Mix gently – do not vortex.\nDispense 100 μL Kinetic-QCL Reagent into all microplate wells and immediately run the Kinetic-QCL program.\nCritical: Do not place lid on the plate!\nNote: If working with a lot of samples, use a multichannel pipette and pyrogen-free reservoir (Lonza, Cat# 00190035).\nQuantification\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nThese steps walk through how to analyze the data and check for sample inhibition (when a property of a sample, such as opacity, interferes with endotoxin detection and invalidates the results). For more detail on using MARS software, see: https://www.bmglabtech.com/lonzas-kinetic-kit-for-endotoxin-detection-using-bmg-labtechs-microplate-reader-and-mars-data-analysis/[href=https://www.bmglabtech.com/lonzas-kinetic-kit-for-endotoxin-detection-using-bmg-labtechs-microplate-reader-and-mars-data-analysis/].\nSave your data and open your run in MARS.\nPerform a baseline correction for each well based on the raw data (Subtract each measurement from the first measurement).",
    "Note: You can also use the average of the first few cycles as your baseline if your data are variable, although sample variability in early O.D. readings usually indicates that either 1) your sample is too opaque (see example “Sample 1” in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]/Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) or 2) your sample was not fully homogenized (see example “Sample 2” in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]/Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPerform a Time to Threshold analysis on your baseline corrected data. Use a threshold of change in optical density (ΔO.D.) 0.2.\nNote: This will return the time (in minutes) that it took for each well to change by ≥ 0.2.\nGenerate a linear standard curve (Log time (min) to threshold versus Log EU/mL).\nSample standard curve:     log   10   ( Y )  =  (  s l o p e ×   log   10   ( X )   )  + Y − intercept  \nY = Time to Threshold (in seconds).\nX = EU/mL.\nSlope = -0.249998291.\nY-Intercept = 3.042474473.\nExtrapolate the EU/mL for each sample from the standard curve.\nFor Sample 3 (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] below) the time to threshold is 33.3 min.\n  X = 10  (   (  log  ( Y )  − Y − intercept  )   s l o p e   )   \n  Y = 33.3 × 60 = 1998  seconds  \n    log   10   ( Y )  =   log   10   ( 1998 )  = 3.300595484  \n  X = 10  (   (  3.00595484 − 3.042474473  )   − 0.249998291   )   \nX = 0.09279165.\nAverage technical replicates.\nMultiply the extrapolated value by dilution factors as needed.\nNote: If your spiked samples do not fall within the accepted recovery range (50%–200%, which is 0.25-1 EU/mL if you used the 5 EU/mL standard to give a 0.5 EU/mL final concentration) you should discard those samples or dilute them further and run them again."
