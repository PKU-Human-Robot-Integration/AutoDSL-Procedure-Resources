  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described here have been carried out using an approved protocol and in accordance with the regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Notre Dame.\n1. Cell Seeding and Culture\nBefore starting, prepare the required items: a small funnel, pipettes, and warm Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin antibiotic (DMEM complete).\nTake T-25 flasks along with the functionalized device (biological actuator or the biorobot) within it. Refer to section 4 of Part 1 of this two-part manuscript for details regarding device preparation, functionalization, and storage prior to cell seeding.\nPrepare a funnel, which can be made by rolling a small, square plastic sheet. Place it over the biological actuator or biorobot inside the T-25 flask. Adjust the diameter of the wider end to fit the entire device and the height so that it fits snugly when the top of the flask is tightened.\n\t\nFor the biorobots, use a magnet to hold the device in place at the bottom of the flask throughout the seeding process.\nNote: Here, a single neodymium disc magnet (1.26\" in diameter) was used, but any magnet of similar size and strength can also be used to hold down the biorobot with the magnetic nickel-PDMS composite base.\nUV sterilize the plastic sheet for at least 30 min prior usage.\nEnsure that there is not a large gap between the base of the funnel and the flask.\nResuspend the cardiomyocytes in DMEM complete at a density of 1.6 x 107 cells/mL and slowly drop 400 µL of suspension onto the device through the funnel. Use a hemocytometer or any other cell counter to determine the number of cells obtained.",
    "Slowly move the system back into the incubator without disturbing the device and the funnel within. Culture for 24 h at 37 °C.\nAfter the incubation period, slowly remove the funnel, gently wash the sample with PBS, and refill the flask with 10 mL of fresh DMEM complete.\nNote: For the biorobots, remove the magnet so that the device is afloat.\n2. Biochemical Characterization\nCalcium flux assay\nNote: The calcium flux assay is carried out to assess cell interconnectivity. The procedure for loading the cells with the fluorescent, calcium ion-specific dye follows the process described in a previously established protocol11.\n\t\nFirst, prepare the required materials, calcium fluo-4-acetomethyl (AM) ester, nonionic surfactant polyol (see the Table of Materials), and Tyrode's salt solution.\nUsing long tweezers, gently transfer the device from the culture flask to a 35-mm Petri dish with 2 mL of Tyrode's salt solution.\nIn a separate centrifuge tube, take 1 mL of warm Tyrode's solution (warmed to 37 °C) and add 3-5 µL of stock calcium fluo-4 AM dye (working concentration: 3-5 µM) and an equal part of nonionic surfactant polyol (working concentration: 0.2 %). Replace the sample solution with warm Tyrode's solution supplemented with the calcium indicator dye, fluo-4, and 0.2% nonionic surfactant. Incubate for 25 - 30 min at 37 °C.\nRemove the dye solution and gently wash the sample with fresh Tyrode's solution. Re-incubate the sample in 2 mL of fresh DMEM complete for another 30 min at 37 °C prior to imaging.\nNote: The results of this assay and related video are provided in the previously published work7.\nImmunofluorescence\nNote: The double immunostaining of all the samples was performed following previously established protocol12.",
    "First, prepare 10% goat serum (GS) in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in diH2O, 0.1% cell lyse detergent (see the Table of Materials) in PBS, primary antibodies (anti-mouse monoclonal antibody cardiac troponin-I and anti-rabbit monoclonal antibody connexins-43), secondary antibodies (Alexa 594 conjugate and goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Alexa 488 conjugate), and DAPI.\nCaution: Paraformaldehyde is carcinogenic.\nRemove the sample of interest from the flask and gently wash it twice with PBS. Refer to section 4 in Part 1 of this two-part manuscript for details regarding sample preparation and functionalization.\nAdd a droplet of PBS onto a small coverslip (diameter: 12 mm or 15 mm). Gently hold the base of the device with tweezers and cut the thin PDMS arms (cantilever, Figure 1) using scissors from the end where it connects to the top of the base. Transfer the cantilever arms onto the droplet with the cell-adhered side facing upward. The PBS droplet will prevent the cells from drying.\nFix the samples with 4% PFA and perform double immunostaining of the samples, as described previously12.\nAfter immunostaining, mount the samples onto a clean glass slide using anti-fade mounting reagent and set aside, undisturbed, in the dark for 24 h.\nRepeat the procedure for all samples.\nNote: The results of this assay and the related images are discussed in depth in the previously published work7.\n3. Imaging\nPlace the T-25 flask upright in a CO2 incubator and prepare the imaging system inside the incubator. Record the device using a camera (see the Table of Materials) with a zoom lens (see the Table of Materials). For a light source, use a strip of LED lights.\nNote: A strip of white-light LEDs was used here, but any normal LEDs will also work.",
    "Connect the camera to an operating system and open the camera-specific software (see the Table of Materials). Click on the camera image underneath the \"File\" tab, in the top panel, to open all camera options, and choose the correct camera.\nChoose \"live\" from the list of tabs on the top panel within the software.\nManually bring the image into focus by adjusting the lens dial. Select \"Crop to region of interest (ROI)\" from the top panel. Then, manually draw a rectangle in the video frame, enclosing the biological actuator device and the cantilever arms, to mark the ROI.\nNote: Choosing an appropriate ROI minimizes the size of the image files.\n\t\nIn the case of biorobots, capture the whole screen in order to record the swimming motion of the device.\nNOTE: There is no need to draw an ROI for the biorobots\nBefore starting the recording, select \"Camera Settings\" from one of the tabs in the top panel on the screen. Set the frame rate by adjusting the exposure and pixel ratio of the live image by sliding the bar for each or by manually entering the values. Set the frame rates to about 30 ± 2 fps.\nNote: Changing the exposure and pixel ratio changes the brightness and contrast of the live image.\nClick the \"Record\" button from the top panel in the software to start recording the videos of the actuators with 1,000 x 1,000 pixel resolution for precisely 30 s. Repeat the process for all samples.\n4. Image Analysis of the Biological Actuators on a Stationary Base\nAnalyze the images using a programming software (e.g., Matlab) running the custom script. See the Table of Materials and the Supplemental File for further details.",
    "Note: The script displays each frame of the recorded videos, receives the user's mouse input to record the coordination of the points of the cantilever on the images, calculates the diameter and center of the circle that passes the inputted points via least square fitting, and exports all of the inputted and calculated data for further use.\n\t\nOpen the programming software by clicking on the icon. Click \"File\" -> \"Open\" from the menu bar at the top and select the .m script file for image analysis. Ensure that recorded TIFF images are in the same folder as the .m file. Click \"Run\" to run the script.\nNote: An interactive display will pop up for altering.\nPress \"play\" to start the actual program. Click the \"open\" button and locate the TIFF file that is going to be analyzed.\nClick the \"base\" button and then click on the point where the cantilever attaches to the base at the top; hit enter. This will place a square marker on the image for each frame to denote the location of the cantilever base.\nClick the \"Scale\" button and then manually click on one edge of the glass bead. Bring the mouse pointer to the opposite side of the glass bead and press \"Enter.\"\nNote: This should draw a line that measures the diameter of the glass bead. Since the glass bead is 3 mm in diameter, this will relate 3 mm to the pixels displayed.\nClick the \"Analyze\" button. Click along the cantilever at a short distance from the first square marker that represents the cantilever base.",
    "Click the “Analyze” button. Then, click along the cantilever at a short distance from the first square marker that represents the cantilever base. Continue to click along the cantilever, including the tip, and press enter when done. This will place an “x” on each point clicked on the cantilever.\nNote: Based on the coordination of the square marker and on the x markers, the center and diameter of a circle will be calculated using a least square fitting function (refer to the attached supplemental file for the script used). The circle, which passes the x markers and the square maker, will be superimposed on the image automatically.\nCheck if the superimposed circle correctly traces the cantilever profile.\nNote: When the cantilever is very flat, it is hard to judge if the cantilever profile is traced correctly. Refer to Figure 3.\nClick the \"next frame\" button. This will switch to the next frame in the TIFF file. The base and scale are already set from the previous step.\nRepeat steps 4.1.5 through 4.1.7 until all of the frames in the TIFF file have been completed. Once all frames have been processed, click the \"Export\" button.\nNote: This will make a spreadsheet file with the TIFF file name for the cantilever that was just analyzed. Edit the filename to include which side (left or right) of the cantilever was analyzed.\nCalculating stress in the spreadsheet.\n\t\nCalculate the surface stress, \"σ,\" on the cantilever using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55643/55643eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere E, R, v, and h are Young's modulus, the radius of curvature, Poisson's ratio, and the cantilever thickness, respectively.\nNote: The thickness of the cantilever can be altered to change the sensitivity. In this study, the values were as follows: E = 750 kPa, v = 0.49, and h = 25 µm13,14.",
    "Calculate the surface stress using the equation in step 4.2.1. Open the .xls spreadsheet file. Note that the output has multiple columns showing first the x and y coordinates of base and circle and then the radius of curvature. Calculate the x and y coordinates of each point clicked based on these.\nNote: Plotting the stresses over the time-lapse image frames shows changes in the force exerted on the cantilever over time. The troughs show the stress on the cantilever during the relaxation of the cardiomyocytes or the static stress exerted on the cantilever due to cell traction forces. The peaks show the dynamic stress on the cantilever, which was exerted by the beating of the cardiomyocytes. This value corresponds to the maximum amount of force generated by the contraction of the cardiomyocytes.\n5. Analysis of Swimming Biorobots\nRecord the position of the biorobot using image analysis software.\nNote: See the Materials list for the software used in this section.\n\t\nOpen the image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ). Press \"File\" and \"Open\" and select the swimming biorobot video file. Click \"OK\" and let the program load the file. Open the spreadsheet software.\nIn the loaded biorobot video, find a reference of known dimensions (e.g., the glass bead 3 mm in diameter that was embedded in the biological actuator).\nNote: Any object with known dimension will work. This will determine the pixel-to-length ratios in each video.\nUse the \"Straight\" tool to draw a line across the glass bead. Click \"Analyze\" and select \"Set scale.\" Set the \"Known distance\" field to \"3,000 µm\" and click \"Ok.\"\nNote: This will set the x and y coordinates to micrometers.\nChoose a point on the device that does not wobble between frames to act as a marker.",
    "Note: It is recommend to choose a corner of the base.\nPoint to the selected point in 5.1.4 on the first frame. Record the x and y coordinates on the spreadsheet.\nSwitch back to the image analysis software window and press the right arrow key to change to the next frame. Point to the marker again (from step 5.1.4) and record the x and y coordinates on the spreadsheet.\nRepeat step 5.1.6 for all frames.\nCalculate the swimming parameters of the biorobot using the spreadsheet of coordinates7.\n\t\nCalculate the period between frames from the known frame rate of each video.\nCalculate the change in the x and y coordinates between frames to find the distance moved, including the total distance.\nCalculate the amplitude of contraction from the maximum change along the y-axis. Determine the beating frequency for each biorobot from the inverse of the period between two contractions.\nCalculate the swimming speed of each device from the total time and distance moved in the x-direction.\nRepeat step 5.2 for each biorobot video that was analyzed.\nNormalize each measured parameter.\nNote: Normalize all the values to better visualize the differences. This protocol demonstrates normalization with respect to a horizontal mode biorobot with low-frequency contractions (horizontal LF) (Figure 4)7.\n6. Analysis of Protein Expression\nNote: The mounted samples prepared in steps 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 were imaged using a confocal microscope. Images were acquired at 20X, 40X, and 60X magnification sequentially in three channels simultaneously: 460 nm, 488 nm, and 594 nm. A set of 5 images were captured at 40X magnification, from different positions for each sample, and each channel was saved as an individual .TIFF file. The exposure setting was determined by the magnification of the objective used and was set constant for all the captures at that magnification.",
    "Open the image analysis software and select \"File\" -> \"Open\" to load the images.\nDraw a rectangular polygon on the image frame to mark the ROI. Select \"Analyze\" -> \"Measure\" to measure the mean fluorescent intensity.\nRepeat step 6.2 to collect intensity measurements from all the samples and calculate the respective mean intensity for each condition.\nNote: Here, a different condition refers to different time points, as in, day 1, day 2, and up to day 6.\nExport the results on a spreadsheet for further statistical analysis and for the production of data plots.\nSubscription Required.
