  "procedures": [
    "This protocol can be easily applied to any cell line. The current study also includes the optimized procedure for preparation and analysis of untreated and UV- and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)–treated MCF10A OxiDIP-Seq samples. UV- and NAC-treated MCF10A cells could be used as a positive and negative control, respectively, as described in Amente et al. (2019), Gorini et al. (2020), and Scala et al. (2022). Compared to untreated cells, a significantly higher level of 8-oxodG has been detected in UV-treated and a lower level of 8-oxodG in NAC-treated MCF10A cells, which demonstrates the sensibility and specificity of our method to detect 8-oxodG. Please refer to the above mentioned original papers for more information.Day I Optional:Treat MCF10A cells with 1 mM NAC for 1 h, as negative control.Irradiate MCF10A cells as positive control, as follows:Remove the medium from the 100 mm2 plate and put it in a new 15 mL tube.Insert plate into the Stratalinker® UV crosslinker equipped with a 254 nm UV light.Irradiate cells by setting 40 J/m2 on the instrument.After irradiation, add the medium recovered at step 2a on the irradiated cells and incubate cells at 37 °C for 30 min.Extraction of genomic DNA Trypsinize untreated and (optionally) treated cells (at least 5 × 106 cells; optimal cell number should be experimentally determined) by adding 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin to a 100 mm2 plate. Incubate in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C for 10 min.Add 5 mL of growth medium to neutralize trypsin and transfer the cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the cells at 300 × g and room temperature (RT) for 3 min.Carefully aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 200 μL PBS of 1× PBS, and add 20 μL of Proteinase K.",
    "Add 200 μL of buffer AL (see DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit), mix thoroughly by vortexing, and incubate samples at 37 °C for 4 h.Add 200 μL of ethanol 100%. Mix thoroughly by vortexing.Pipet the mixture into a DNeasy mini spin column (see DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit) placed in a 2 mL collection tube.Centrifuge at 6,000 × g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and collection tube.Place the DNeasy mini spin column in a new 2 mL collection tube. Add 500 μL of buffer AW1 (see DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit).Centrifuge at 6,000 × g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and collection tube.Place the spin column in a new 2 mL collection tube. Add 500 μL of buffer AW2 (see DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit).Centrifuge at 6,000 × g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and collection tube.Repeat step A12.Transfer the DNeasy mini spin column to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Elute the DNA by adding 50 μL of sterile nuclease-free water. Wait for 5 min and centrifuge at 6,000 × g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min.Elute the remaining DNA by adding another 50 μL of sterile nuclease-free water. Wait for 5 min and centrifuge at 6,000 × g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min. Pool together the DNA eluted from steps A15 and A16.Note: Work under low luminosity throughout as much as possible (by turning off the lights and covering the windows with a blackout panel in the laboratory), as we experienced that light might reduce the yield of 8-oxodG IP. Also, add PBN (stock 28 mM in nuclease-free water; working 0.",
    "07 mM) to each solution indicated in steps A4–A16 just before use to preserve the oxidized state of DNA extracted from cells and to prevent the introduction of possible new nonspecific 8-oxodGs during DNA handling. Moreover, it is suggested reading the recommendations and troubleshooting guide displayed in the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit handbook. Sonication of genomic DNA Note: Make sure that the Bioruptor is cold. Quantify the eluted DNA using the Nanodrop.Transfer 5 μg of quantified DNA, in a final volume of 100 μL of TE buffer (see Recipe 3), to a new 1.5 mL tube.Sonicate using 15–20 cycles (30 s ON and 30 s OFF) in high power mode.Note: The optimal number of cycles must be determined experimentally. Use 400 ng of sonicated DNA to test the sonication on agarose gel (1.5%); a good sonication should produce fragments ranging in size between 200 and 800 bp. Keep samples on ice before and after sonication.Note: Work under low luminosity throughout as much as possible and add PBN (stock 28 mM in nuclease-free water; working 0.07 mM) to each solution indicated in steps B1–B3. Immunoprecipitation of 8-oxodG-containg ssDNA Dilute 4 μg of sonicated DNA in 500 μL of IP buffer (see Recipe 6).Take 3% as Input (15 μL), collect it in a new tube, and store it at -20 °C until step D7.Denature the samples for 5 min at 95 °C on the thermo-shaker (except for the Input that must be stored at -20 °C). Then transfer to ice for 15 min.Add 4 μL of polyclonal antibody against 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine to the sample and incubate overnight at 4 °C under constant rotation.Block magnetic beads with BSA as follow:Put 30 μL/sample in a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Wash the magnetic beads with 1 mL of IP buffer.",
    "Resuspend the magnetic beads in 1 mL IP buffer + BSA (0.5 mg/mL) and incubate overnight at 4 °C under constant rotation.Day II Wash the magnetic beads with 1 mL of cold IP buffer twice.Resuspend the beads in a final volume of 30 μL/sample of cold IP buffer.Add 30 μL of BSA-blocked magnetic beads to the sample of step C4 and incubate under constant rotation for 3 h in a cold room (at 4 °C).Note: Work under low luminosity throughout as much as possible for step C1–C6 and add PBN (stock 28 mM in nuclease-free water; working 0.07 mM) to each solution indicated in steps C1–C5. Wash the beads–antibody–ssDNA complex with 1 mL of washing buffer (see Recipe 7) as follows:Put the sample on the magnetic rack for 5 min.Discard the flow-through.Add 1 mL of washing buffer.Take the sample under constant rotation for 10 min in a cold room (at 4 °C).Repeat step 7 four times.Note: From step 7 onwards, work under normal light condition in the laboratory. Purification of 8-oxodG-containg ssDNA and Input DNA When washes are finished, discard the flow-through and resuspend the beads with 250 μL of elution buffer (see Recipe 8).Incubate O/N at 37 °C on the thermo-shaker (800 rpm).Day III Increase temperature to 52 °C and leave for 1 extra hour.Spin the sample for 3 min at 13,000 rpm, capture beads on magnetic rack, and transfer supernatant to new 2 mL tubes.Resuspend beads in 100 μL of elution buffer (see Recipe 8) again and re-incubate at 52 °C for 10 min on the thermo-shaker (800 rpm).Spin the sample for 3 min at 13,000 rpm, capture beads on magnetic rack, and transfer supernatant into the same 2 mL tubes previously used in step D4.",
    "Note: Elution is performed in one tube per sample to have 8-oxodG-containing ssDNA sample (IP) in a total 350 μL volume. Thaw Input DNA sample (previously stored at -20 °C, step C2) and add 160 μL of elution buffer to reach the total volume of 175 μL.Purify both IP and Input samples using Qiagen mini elute PCR purification kit:Add 1,750 μL and 875 μL of PB buffer (without pH indicator, see Qiagen mini elute PCR purification kit) to IP and Input, respectively.Vortex and spin briefly.Transfer the samples to MiniElute columns (see Qiagen mini elute PCR purification kit).Note: Only for the IP sample, as its volume is higher than what can be loaded on a single MiniElute column, split IP sample into two MiniElute columns (1,050 μL each) by loading 525 μL of IP sample on the same column twice. Spin samples for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.Discard the flow-through.Wash the columns with 750 μL of PE buffer (wash buffer containing ethanol, see Qiagen mini elute PCR purification kit).Spin samples for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.Discard the flow-through and spin again for 1 min to dry the columns as much as possible.Elute the DNA in a total volume of 30 μL of nuclease-free water by performing two elutions with 15 μL for each column.Note: For IP sample, collect the eluted DNA from the two MiniElute columns in one 1.5 mL tube (so the final volume of each IP sample is 60 μL); for Input sample, add further 30 μL nuclease-free water to reach the same IP final volume (60 μL). Optional: qPCR quality test of UV- and NAC-treated MCF10A samples Design DNA oligonucleotides using IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies) platform considering both positive and negative regions (see Table 1).Table 1.

Briefly, mix 1 μL of purified DNA (from step F7) and 199 μL of Qubit® working solution (Qubit dsDNA HS reagent 200× and Qubit dsDNA HS buffer) in a clean Qubit assay tube. Incubate at RT for 2 min and then measure the concentration in a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. Usually, the Qubit dsDNA HS assay requires two standards. Each standard tube requires 10 µL of each Qubit standard and 190 µL of Qubit working solution.The assay is highly selective for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and is accurate for initial sample concentrations from 10 pg/µL to 100 ng/µL.Library preparation and sequencing Prepare NGS Library using 1–2 ng of IP or Input DNA with TruSeq ChIP sample prep kit.
