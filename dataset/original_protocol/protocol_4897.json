    "Preparation of alcohol insoluble residue (AIR)Flash freeze < 300 mg fresh tissue in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube (Note 1). Homogenization and solvent extractions will be inefficient if more tissue is used. If plants are derived from agar-solidified plates, care must be taken to avoid taking any agar with the seedlings, as it will be hydrolyzed and quantified as Gal in later steps. If a freeze-dryer is not available, see Note 2 and skip to step A6.Leave the lid of the tube open, but cover the opening with a small piece of aluminum foil. Ensure the foil is vented by poking a small hole with a needle or pipet tip.Lyophilize frozen samples for 2-3 days.Add 3 steel balls to each tube and close the lids.Homogenize the dried samples for 2 min, shaking at 25 Hz at room temperature. Reverse the orientation of the tube holder and shake for an additional 2 min at 25 Hz.Ensure that a fine powder with no clumps is obtained before proceeding.Add 1.5 ml of 70% (v/v) ethanol to the tube and vortex. Remove the steel balls from the slurry using a magnet and discard them.Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 10 min.Discard the supernatant using an aspirator that is compatible with organic solvents or pipet.Add 1.5 ml of 1:1 (v:v) chloroform:methanol. Disrupt the pellet with a small metal spatula and then thoroughly vortex the sample.Repeat steps A8-10 two more times for a total of 3 washes with chloroform:methanol.Centrifuge and remove the solvents as before (steps A8-9).Add 1.5 ml of acetone, disrupt the pellet, vortex, centrifuge, and discard the supernatant as before.Dry the final pellet either by using a vacuum centrifuge for at least 30 min or let air-dry overnight. The resulting material is the AIR (Note 3, Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012190433_0308.jpgFigure 2.",
    "AIR material after step A14One-step two-step hydrolysisFor each AIR sample, accurately weigh ~1 mg of material into each of four 2 ml Sarstedt tubes on an analytical balance (Note 4). Avoid clumps of material. Record the exact weight of AIR in each tube. These four tubes are technical replicates that will be subjected to two different hydrolysis regimes as duplicates.Saeman hydrolysis samplesTo two tubes containing AIR, add 50 μl of 72% (w/w) sulfuric acid. Immediately cap the tubes, vortex vigorously, and centrifuge briefly to collect the sample in the bottom of the tube. Delayed or insufficient initial mixing can result in poor rehydration of the sample and incomplete hydrolysis.Incubate the tube at room temperature for 1 h. Vortex every 10 min or continuously with an Eppendorf Thermomixer.Add 1,400 μl water to each tube to adjust the sulfuric acid concentration to 4% (w/v). Vortex to mix.Matrix hydrolysis samplesTo the second set of two tubes, add 1,400 μl water first and then add 50 μl 72% (w/w) sulfuric acid to give a 4% (w/v) concentration of sulfuric acid. Cap the tubes and vortex.Recovery standardsPrepare a standard mix consisting of 9 sugars (Fuc, Rha, Ara, Gal, Glc, Xyl, Man, GalA, and GluA), each at a concentration of 100 µg ml-1. It is recommended to prepare a concentrated stock of each sugar individually and then combine. Account for the extra mass of water if hydrated sugars are used. Prepare at least enough for use in this part of the protocol (1 ml) as well as for preparation of a standard curve in the next part of the protocol (138 μl). Sugar standards can be stored frozen once prepared.To account for sugar-specific losses during hydrolysis, a recovery standard is subjected to the same conditions as the matrix hydrolysis samples (Note 5).",
    "Pipet 500 μl of the standard mixture and 900 μl of water into a 2 ml Sarstedt tubes. Add 50 μl of 72% (w/w) sulfuric acid. Repeat with a second tube. Cap the tubes and vortex.Set all tubes except for one of the recovery standards in an autoclave-compatible rack and autoclave at 121 °C for 60 min. The second recovery standard tube is not autoclaved and serves as a control for calculating monosaccharide-specific correction factors.Cool samples to room temperature and centrifuge for 1 min at 20,000 x g to pellet any insoluble material.Dilute samples, recovery standard, and recovery standard control 100 fold by transferring 10 μl into an autosampler vial containing 990 μl of MilliQ water. Store samples at 4 °C for up to two weeks. Samples can be stored for a month or more if they are frozen at -20 °C. This dilution factor is convenient for AIR isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings, for more cellulose-rich AIR prepared from stems, wood, or other secondary tissues, a higher dilution factor should be used (200-500 fold).Standard curve samplesDilute standard mix from step B4 (9 sugars, 100 µg ml-1 each) to yield a standard curve between 0.05 µg ml-1 and 5 µg ml-1. Prepare this directly into 2 ml autosampler vials with pre-slit septa (Table 1). This range of concentrations generally covers the complete linear range of the instrument. Table 1. Preparation of standard curve samplesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161019/20161019234430_6175.jpg*Note: Standard 8 is further diluted to prepare standards 1-4.HPAEC-PAD analysisHPAEC-PAD analysis #1 (All samples)Inject 25 μl of each standard, recovery standard, and sample onto a 3 x 150 mm CarboPac PA-20 analytical column equipped with a 3 x 50 mm guard column of the same material. Elute the compounds with 2 mM KOH at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min-1 for 30 min (Note 6).",
    "This run will resolve Fuc, Gal, Glc, Xyl, and Man. Rha and Ara are not consistently separated with these conditions, so they are quantified by a second analysis that is only necessary for the matrix hydrolysis samples.In our experience, retention times of peaks will shift earlier as more samples are run, and after ~50-100 samples it is necessary to perform a column flush with sodium acetate (see below, step C4).HPAEC-PAD analysis #2 (Matrix hydrolysis samples only)Inject 25 μl of each standard, recovery standard, and sample onto a 3 x 150 mm CarboPac PA-20 analytical column equipped with a 3 x 50 mm guard column of the same material. Elute the compounds with 18 mM KOH 0.4 ml min-1 for 30 min. This run will resolve Rha and Ara.A column flush may be required after ~50-100 samples are run (see below, step C4).HPAEC-PAD analysis #3 (Matrix hydrolysis samples only)Inject 25 μl of each standard, recovery standard, and sample onto a 3 x 150 mm CarboPac PA-200 analytical column equipped with a 3 x 50 mm guard column of the same material. Elute the compounds with a 10 min gradient of 50 mM to 200 mM sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOH at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min-1 (This is accomplished with a gradient of 5%-20% eluent B [100 mM NaOH, 1 M sodium acetate]. Eluent A consists of 100 mM NaOH and makes up the remaining volume). This run will resolve GalA and GluA.Column flushing procedureThe performance of the CarboPac PA20 column degrades after running ~50-100 samples, leading to increasingly early retention times until peaks cannot be sufficiently resolved. This is remedied by flushing the column with 100 mM NaOH/1 M sodium acetate for 30 min followed by water for 30 min at 0.2 ml min-1.",
    "If the CarboPac PA20 column is being used with an HPAEC-PAD system that is equipped with an eluent generator, it will need to be temporarily moved to a different system or port in order to complete this procedure."
