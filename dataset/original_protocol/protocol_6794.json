    "Prepare dissociated hippocampal neuronal culture for live imagingCoat the glass coverslips or glass bottom dishes with 0.1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine overnight, and rinse with ddH2O 3 times before using.Dissect hippocampi from P0 (Post-natal day 0) C57/BL6 mice in ice-cold Leibovitz’s L-15 medium.Collected all hippocampi in a 15 ml Falcon tube filled with ice-cold Leibovitz’s L-15 medium.Remove Leibovitz’s L-15 medium. Incubate tissues in 5 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution at 37 °C for 15 min. Trypsin will digest extracellular proteins to facilitate cell dissociation.Remove 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution, and replace with complete DMEM medium to stop the reaction.Then remove the DMEM medium, and wash the tissue with 5 ml complete Neurobasal A medium.Add 1 ml complete Neurobasal A medium in the tube. Dissociate cells mechanically by pipetting up and down with a 200 µl tip for 10-15 strokes.Incubate the cell suspension for 3 min to allow the sedimentation of large tissue debris. Take the 800 µl upper suspension and avoid sampling of tissue clusters.Measure cell density and plate cells to pre-coated poly-L-lysine glass coverslips/glass bottom dishes at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2.Note: Cells are grown in 2 ml complete Neurobasal A medium in the well of 12-well plate, or 3 ml medium in a 35 mm glass bottom dish. Cells are grown in complete Neurobasal A medium for 5 days in-vitro (DIV).From DIV 5-6, replace half conditioned medium (1 ml for each well of 12-well plate, and 1.5 ml for 35 mm glass bottom dishes) with complete BrainPhys medium every 2-3 days.Viral transduction of reporter geneOn DIV 1 or 2, transduce cells with the lentivirus vector allowing for the expression of a fluorescent reporter of synaptic vesicles. We use F(syn)W-RBN::Synaptobrevin2-EGFP or F(syn)W-RBN::VGLUT1-venus.",
    "For each vector batch, Western-blot and fluorescent imaging are performed to adjust the dilution to limit protein overexpression to 2-fold of wild-type levels.The lenti vector dilution and protein expression are measured by Western-blot and fluorescent imaging:Cells are grown in 6 cm dishes that are pre-coated with poly-L-lysine with the same cell density as described above.On DIV 1 or 2, lentivirus (titer range in ~×108 TU/ml) is diluted to 1/100 with Neurobasal A medium. Add 20/40/80 µl diluted virus to each dish of the culture for transduction. Return the culture to the incubator.On DIV17, the cells are scraped and collected from the dishes. The targeted protein expression level in each sample is measured by Western-blot. VGLUT1-venus or Synaptobrevin2-EGFP has ~27 kDa higher molecular weight, thus can be easily distinguished from the corresponding endogenous wildtype protein. The increased virus transduction normally will result a linearized increase of protein expression.Compare the expression of VGLUT1-venus/Synaptobervin2-EGFP with the wildtype VGLUT1/Synaptovervin2. Calculate the right dilution of virus which results less than 2-fold of protein overexpression. Normally, the fluorescent intensity of the presynaptic boutons is bright enough and is suitable for FRAP imaging with this protein expression level.Based on the cell amount, proportionally add the right dilution of virus to the 12-well plates or 35 mm glass bottom dishes culture on DIV 1 or 2 that are prepared for FRAP imaging (Figure 2A).FRAP ImagingNote: FRAP imaging is performed with a spinning disk confocal microscope that is controlled by MetaMorph microscopy automation software. Take DIV 17-21 cell culture for imaging, normally neurons are mature and synaptic networks are well established at this time point. Incubate the cultures in conditioned culture medium (cells are grown in) containing HEPES (40 mM) and at physiological temperature (37 °C) during the imaging procedure. Use MetaMorph to control the entire FRAP procedure.",
    "Randomly select one field of the cell culture for imaging with a 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective (Figure 2B).Select up to 5 fluorescent boutons that are distant from each other as Regions of Interest (ROIs) for bleaching (Figure 2B). Selecting too many boutons that are closely related on the same axon would affect the measurement. Before bleaching, monitor the boutons fluorescence every 30 s for 3 min (Figure 2A). Image as a Z-stack of 4.8 µm thickness with 0.8 µm step interval. ROIs should be at the midplane of the stack. Stack imaging allows for a more robust measurement of bouton intensity and to buffer fluctuations due to small Z-directed movements.Apply three passes of 491 nm laser (40 mW) to bleach the Syb2EGFP labeling boutons; two laser passes of 491 nm laser (30 mW) and the 405 nm laser (10 mW) to bleach the VGLUT1venus labeling boutons (Figure 2B). After bleaching, the fluorescence of ROIs should remain around 40%-60% of the initial fluorescence intensity (Figure 2C). VENUS and EYFP related dyes require a stimulation at 405 nm to prevent fluorescence recovery from a reversible dark state of the fluorescent proteins (McAnaney et al., 2005; Herzog et al., 2011).Monitor the fluorescence recovery after bleaching every 30 s during the first 3 min and then every 5 min during the next 70 min (Figure 2A)."
