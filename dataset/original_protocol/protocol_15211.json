    "B7-H1/PD-L1, a member of the B7 family of immune-regulatory cell-surface proteins, plays an important role in the negative regulation of cell-mediated immune responses through its interaction with its receptor, programmed death-1 (PD-1) 1,2. Overexpression of B7-H1 by tumor cells has been noted in a number of human cancers, including melanoma, glioblastoma, and carcinomas of the lung, breast, colon, ovary, and renal cells, and has been shown to impair anti-tumor T-cell immunity3-8.\nRecently, B7-H1 expression by pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues has been identified as a potential prognostic marker9,10. Additionally, blockade of B7-H1 in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer has been shown to produce an anti-tumor response11. These data suggest the importance of B7-H1 as a potential therapeutic target. Anti-B7-H1 blockade antibodies are therefore being tested in clinical trials for multiple human solid tumors including melanoma and cancers of lung, colon, kidney, stomach and pancreas12.\nIn order to eventually be able to identify the patients who will benefit from B7-H1 targeting therapies, it is critical to investigate the correlation between expression and localization of B7-H1 and patient response to treatment with B7-H1 blockade antibodies. Examining the expression of B7-H1 in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues through immunohistochemistry will give a better understanding of how this co-inhibitory signaling molecule contributes to the suppression of antitumor immunity in the tumor's microenvironment. The anti-B7-H1 monoclonal antibody (clone 5H1) developed by Chen and coworkers has been shown to produce reliable staining results in cryosections of multiple types of human neoplastic tissues4,8, but staining on paraffin-embedded slides had been a challenge until recently13-18. We have developed the B7-H1 staining protocol for paraffin-embedded slides of pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues. The B7-H1 staining protocol described here produces consistent membranous and cytoplasmic staining of B7-H1 with little background.\n1. De-parafinization\nBake slides at 55 °C for 20 min.",
    "In a chemical hood, immerse slides in xylene for 10 min. \nImmerse slides in fresh xylene for 10 min. \nImmerse slides in 100% ethanol for 5 min. \nImmerse slides in fresh 100% ethanol for 5 min. \nImmerse slides in 95% ethanol for 5 min. \nImmerse slides in 80% ethanol for 5 min. \nImmerse slides in deionized water for 5 min. \n2. Antigen Retrieval\nImmerse slides in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) and heat in a pressure cooker to 125 °C for 30 sec, then 90 °C for 10 sec.    \nLet slides cool for 60 min. \nImmerse slides in TBST for 5 min; repeat twice. \n3. Staining\nWipe off solutions around the tissue on the slides.  Mark a circle around the tissue with a hydrophobic pen.\nPlace the slides in a humidity chamber and avoid the drying of the tissue on the slide throughout the entire staining process.  Place one drop (approximately 200 μl or more to cover the tissue area completely) of peroxidase block within the hydrophobic circle on the slide and incubate slides in peroxidase block for 5 min. \nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min. \nPlace one drop of BLOCK ACE blocking buffer on each slide and incubate for 15 min. \nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min.\nPlace one drop of Avidin solution on each slide and incubate for 15 min. \nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min. \nPlace one drop of Biotin solution on each slide and incubate for 15 min.\nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min.",
    "Incubate slides with 1:1,000 dilution of mouse anti-B7-H1 monoclonal antibody (clone 5H1) or a mouse IgG1 κ isotype control in 200 μl TBST at 4 °C overnight for 22 hr+/- 1 hr. The final antibody concentration in TBST is 2.57 μg/ml. \nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min. Repeat twice. \nIncubate slides with a biotin conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1 secondary antibody at a 1:500 concentration (in 200 μl 2% goat serum solution) for 30 min. \nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min. Repeat twice.\nPlace one drop of Streptavidin-Biotin Complex (must be prepared at least 30 min prior to use) on each slide and incubate for 15 min. \nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min. Repeat twice. \nPlace one drop of Amplification Reagent (diluted 2:1 with TBST) on each slide and incubate for 4 min.\nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min. Repeat twice. \nPlace one drop of Streptavidin-HRP on each slide and incubate for 15 min. \nRinse slides with TBST, then place in TBST for 5 min. Repeat twice.    \nPlace one drop of 3,3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate and chromogen on each slide and develop the color for 2 min. \nImmediately after the color development, wash slides with ddH2O for 1-2 min. \nIncubate slides with one drop of hematoxylin for 90 sec. \nWash with ddH2O for 1-2 min. \nWash with soapy tap water for 1-2 min. \nWash with ddH2O for 1-2 min. \n4. Dehydration and Mounting\nImmerse the slides in 80% ethanol for 3 min.\nImmerse the slides in 95% ethanol for 3 min.\nImmerse the slides in 100% ethanol for 5 min.

    "Add one drop of Cytoseal 60 to the slide and place the coverslip.\nTable 1 lists the reagents used in the above described procedures.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
