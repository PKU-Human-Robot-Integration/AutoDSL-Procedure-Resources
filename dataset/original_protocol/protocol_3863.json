    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollagen gel preparation and spheroid transfer\nTiming: 30–60 min\nPreparation of the collagen embedded HeLa spheroids as basis for further experiments in an ibidi 8-well μ-slide.\nPreparation of the collagen gel mixtures with a total volume of 200 μL per well. Keep everything on ice.\nPlace 150 μL of a collagen Type I solution (8.35 mg/mL) per well in Eppendorf tube on ice.\nPrepare NaOH solution with a mixture of 2.5 μL NaOH (1 M) and 47.5 μL PBS per well in an Eppendorf tube on ice.\nCombine both solutions and mix by gently pipetting up and down approximately 3 times before applying 200 μL to each well of an 8-well slide.\nCarefully collect spheroids and surrounding medium directly from the low adhesion 96-well plate using disposable plastic pipettes and add two of them to each well of your 8-well slide. This should result in a total volume (including collagen solution) of 400 μL in each well. If collection of spheroids did not yield 200 μL of transferred medium, addition of fresh medium to reach 400 μL is recommended.\nOptional: Carefully mix the gel after adding the spheroids. (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nPlace 8-well slide in incubator at 37°C/5% CO2 for 30 min for successful gelation.\nCheck presence and shape of embedded spheroids in light microscope. If they are not damaged (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] a and b for comparison) proceed to next step. (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/777-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Brightfield images of spheroids in collagen gel\n(A) Spheroid embedded in collagen before activation of optoYAP.\n(B) Damaged spheroid in collagen.\n(C) Invasion of spheroid after photoactivation of optoYAP in the entire spheroid.\n(D) Site-directed invasion of spheroid after photoactivation of optoYAP on the upper right side.",
    "Scale bars: 100 μm. Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope with a 25×, 1.1. N.A. water immersion objective (A, B, D) and on an ImageXpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices) with a 10× objective (C).\nCritical: Control of pH of the ensuing gel by addition of the correct amount of NaOH is extremely important as it affects gel formation and may have adverse effects on the cells. Final pH should be 7.4. Also, ensure the collagen stays at low temperatures, as gel formation will immediately start at higher temperatures and affect gel properties and handling.\nNote: Collagen concentration may vary in different lots, it should be adjusted by varying the volume of added collagen solution to yield a final collagen concentration of 3.13 mg/mL in each well. However, in this case, the amount of NaOH may be necessary to adjust as well to maintain a neutral pH in the final solution. Different final collagen concentrations may be used. However, concentrations below 3 mg/mL may lead to spontaneous invasion and to sinking of the spheroids to the bottom of the slide, which leads to disintegration of the spheroid.",
    "Critical: Spheroids should be handled with care avoiding strong shear flow. Thus, we recommend slow pipetting, avoiding narrow pipette tips, and instead using disposable plastic pipettes as described in the protocol steps above. Shear flow may tear spheroids apart or damage them reducing cell viability. Also, pH lower than physiological pH can reduce cell viability. Damage to spheroids (both in terms of shape as well as cell viability) will be visible in the morphology (cf. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A of an intact spheroid and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B of a damaged spheroid). However, to ensure cell viability, additional standard viability tests are recommended. The specific test should be chosen such that it does not interfere with the final readout.\nSpheroid transfection\nTiming: 1 day\nTransfection of HeLa spheroids embedded in collagen with optoYAP plasmids.\nPreparation of the transfection mixture in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Amounts given per 100 μL total volume, i.e., for 8 wells of an 8-well slide including some excess for losses.\n1 μg optoYAP plasmid\n1 μg PAG plasmid\n3 μL Xtreme Gene 9 transfection reagent\nFill up to a total volume of 100 μL with Optimem\nCarefully mix by tapping the tube. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nUse 10 μL of transfection mixture per well for an 8-well slide.\nAdd 3 μL of photocaged lysine per well (final concentration: 0.75 μg/μL).\nIncubate for at least 24 h at 37°C/5% CO2 before the next major step.\nCritical: The incubation time of step 9 should be at least 24 h. Best results will be achieved after about 36 h of incubation time, but the difference in result compared to 24 h is not very big. Waiting significantly longer than 48 h will result in decreased efficiency.\nOptional: Transfection in 2D\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Generally, transfection in 2D uses the same steps as spheroid transfection. However, extra steps are necessary to keep YAP out of the nucleus (and thus inactivated) prior to the experiment. Cells seeded on normal well plates will have almost exclusively nuclear YAP due to the hard surface (Dupont et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The following are two main methods to avoid nuclear YAP in 2D cell culture.\nSerum depletion\nThaw cells normally as described above\nSeed cells on 8-well slide at desired concentration (e.g., 5000 cells per well).\nExchange medium for DMEM without FBS and with 1% PenStrep.\nWait 24–48 h for cells to settle and adjust to new medium.\nTransfect as described above and perform experiments\nThis method has the drawback of changing culture conditions and starving cells, which will affect their behavior and may even lead to cell death. It may be the method of choice though for cells cultured in FBS-free (and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) free) medium (Yu et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). However, the protocol has not been tested yet with such cells.\nSeeding cells on Matrigel\nCells on a thick enough layer of matrigel will not sense the stiff bottom of the well and thus YAP will be cytosolic, i.e., inactive. In this case, cells exhibit a round shape.\nEvery reagent and tool should be pre-cooled on ice.\nAdd 50 μL of matrigel to each well of an 8-well slide and carefully spread it with the tip of a pipette until the entire well is covered.\nIncubate well plate for 30 min at 37°C/5% CO2.\nCarefully seed cells on top of the gel as usual (e.g., 5000 cells per well).\nIncubate for 24 h. Cells should be round, if viewed under a microscope.\nTransfect as described above.",
    "Visualization of cells on matrigel via fluorescence microscopy can become more difficult. Both due to the thick gel and due to the round shape of the cell adding more background and scattering the light.\nThis method is also very susceptible to cooling as gelation is reversible.\noptoYAP activation\nTiming: 3 d\nActivation of optoYAP to induce growth and invasive behavior from activated area (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D).\nActivation of optoYAP via UV-illumination.\nIlluminate full well with 365 nm UV lamp for general optoYAP-activation in spheroids.\nUse 365 nm laser or LED and a suitable microscope for site-selective activation of optoYAP\nIlluminate desired area of spheroid for 20 s at 0.6 mW/mm2 and take images of target areas for comparison\nIncubate for 72 h at 37°C/5% CO2.\nCheck for growth at illuminated regions under a microscope. (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9])\nAntibody staining of spheroids embedded in collagen gel\nTiming: 7 d\nStaining of spheroids with YAP antibodies or other antibodies of choice. Amounts are given per well of an 8-well slide.\nCarefully remove medium with a pipette.\nFix spheroids with 200 μL 4% formaldehyde for 40 min in the wells of the slide.\nWash twice with 300 μL cold PBS for 20 min each.\nPermeabilize cells for 20 min with 200 μL 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS.\nWash with 300 μL PBS for 30 min.\nBlock with 200 μL PBS containing 1% BSA overnight (10–24 h). (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11])\nDilute 1 μg primary antibodies in 200 μL PBS containing 1% BSA, add to cells and incubate for 72 h.\nWash twice with 300 μL cold PBS for 20 min each.\nIncubate for 48 h with 1 μg secondary antibodies in 200 μL PBS containing 1% BSA.\nWash with 300 μL cold PBS for 20 min.",
    "Stain with a 0.5 μg/mL solution of Hoechst in PBS for 40 min.\nWash with 300 μL cold PBS for 30 min.\nRenew PBS and assure sample remains wet during storage\nNote: Samples are stable for months at 4°C in this state, if the sample is kept from drying out and protected from light. Prevent drying, since salt crystals from evaporated PBS will also obscure microscopy – even before the sample is entirely dried out.\nNote: We recommend using non-illuminated spheroids as well as non-transfected or Mock-transfected, illuminated spheroids as negative controls. As positive controls, we recommend cells on plastic substrates or spheroids transfected with YAP fused to a nuclear localization sequence."
