    "Preparation of RSV crude extractionsFor RSV extraction, use 100-200 whole bodies of viruliferous small brown planthoppers as samples. Note: Insects should be directly grinded upon collection.Brush down the viruliferous planthoppers into a 15 ml tube, and put it on ice for 2-3 min in order to freeze them. Fully grind total planthoppers in 800 μl of PBS-buffer (pH 7.2) (v:v, 1:1) with TGrinder, and maintain the tube in ice. Note: No research has been reported how to extract plant viruses from insect vectors, whereas several researches suggested that RSV-infected plants should be extracted in PBS buffer at 4 °C (Ishikawa et al., 1982; Ishikawa et al., 1989). So in this work, we grind the planthoppers at the same condition. Shake the mixture thoroughly until well blended, and then place the tube in ice for 30 min. Centrifuge the mixture at 1,344 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, and transfer the supernatant into a 1.5 ml pre-cooling RNA-free tube.Repeat step A5.Centrifuge at 8,400 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, and store the supernatant at 4 °C for further usage.Note: The supernatant is RSV crude extraction.Use the same protocol to isolate the crude extractions from nonviruliferous small brown planthoppers as negative controls. Note: Both RSV crude extractions and the extractions from nonviruliferous planthoppers that used for mechanical inoculation should be microinjected into rice leaves as soon as possible.Detection of RSV through Western blotsFor RSV detection, mix 20 µl 5x protein loading buffer with 80 µl extractions from both viruliferous and nonviruliferous planthoppers, and boil the mixture for 5 min.Load 20 µl of the treated samples into each well of the ExpressPlus TMPAGE gel, along with prestained marker.Note: Make sure that the treated samples from viruliferous and nonviruliferous planthoppers will not become cross-contamination.",
    "Run the gel for 40 min at 140 V.Prepare a PVDF membrane which was slightly bigger than the size of the gel. Place the PVDF membrane in methanol for 5 min.Place the PVDF membrane and gel in 1x transfer buffer (see Recipes) for 10 min.Prepare the transfer sandwich and place it in a transfer tank with 25 mA for 30 min. Note: The transfer sandwich includes a layer of filter paper at each end, the PVDF membrane, and gel. The PVDF membrane is placed between the gel surface and the positive electrode in the sandwich.Block the membrane in 5% skimmed milk in TBST at room temperature (RT) for 0.5-1 h. Wash the membrane with PBST (see Recipes) three times for 5 min each time. Incubate the membrane in the monoclonal anti-Cp antibody solution (see Recipes) by using Decolorizing Orbital Shaker at RT for 1.5 h or at 4 °C overnight. Repeat step B9.Incubate in the HRP-conjugated antibody solution by using Decolorizing Orbital Shaker at RT for 1.5 h. Wash the membrane with PBST five times for 5 min each time.Use the West Femto Substrate Trial Kit to the blot according to the manufacturer’s instruction.Note: Prepare working solution by mixing 100 µl of the stable peroxide solution and the luminol/enhancer solution. Use 100 µl working solution per cm2 of membrane.Capture the chemiluminescent signals through Chemiluminescent Imaging System.Note: Cp could be only detected from the extractions of the viruliferous small brown planthoppers (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171031/20171031023354_0124.jpgFigure 2. RSV detection of the crude extractions from nonviruliferous (lane 1) and viruliferous (lane 2) small brown planthoppers. The monoclonal anti-Cp antibody was used as the primary antibody.Quantification of RSV crude extractionsPrepare the Cp standards in PBS-buffer (pH 7.2) according to previously optimized standard ELISA protocol (Nemzek et al., 2001). Nine dilutions are made (0, 0.0045, 0.",
    "045, 0.45, 4.5, 12.5, 25, 45, 90 ng/ml).Use RSV crude extractions as samples. Note: Samples for ELISA should be tested in duplicate.Add 100 µl of the standards and samples into each well of a 96-well ELISA plate, and mix them with 100 µl 1x coating buffer. Cover the plate with an adhesive plastic and incubate at 4 °C overnight. Wash the plate three times by filling each well with 200 µl PBST, at least for 3 min each time.Block the remaining protein-binding sites in the wells by adding 200 µl blocking buffer (see Recipes) per well. Cover the plate with an adhesive plastic and incubate at RT for no less than 30 min. Repeat step C4.Add 100 µl of diluted monoclonal anti-Cp antibody to each well. Cover the plate with an adhesive plastic and incubate at RT for 1.5 h. Repeat step C4.Add 100 µl of diluted Goat anti-mouse IgG, HRP-conjugated antibody to each well (see Recipes). Cover the plate with an adhesive plastic and incubate at RT for 1.5 h. Remove the supernatant and wash the plate five times with PBST, for 1 min each time.Dispense 100 µl of TMB solution into each well. Gently mix on Decolorizing Orbital Shaker at RT for 30 min.Note: This reaction should be protected from light. Add 100 µl of 2 M H2SO4 or 1% SDS to stop the reaction.Note: Make sure that the color has changed from blue to yellow in all the wells.Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm on the SpectraMax® Paradigm® Multi-Mode Detection Platform within 5 min.Note: You can also read the absorbance value of OD630 after chromogenic reaction without adding stop solution.Microinjection of RSV into rice leavesPrepare the needles for microinjection on a Micropipette Puller (Dean, 2006) (Video 1).",
    "Note: Needles for microinjection are pulled from glass capillaries, and 25 G ⅝ to 30 G ½ gauge needle is ideal for injection. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Preparing the needles for microinjection on the Micropipette Puller Fill the glass capillary with mineral oil before installation. Dilute the RSV crude extraction with PBS buffer to a concentration of Cp around 10 ng/ml. Empty the needle and fill with the diluted RSV crude extraction.Note: The diluted RSV crude extraction should be placed on a Parafilm and then be inhaled into the needle.Microinject 23 nl of the diluted RSV crude extraction into the midribs of the healthy 2-week-old rice leaves for five times through a glass needle at slow speed using Nanoliter 2000. The interval between each injection site is 1 cm (Video 2). Both sides of the leaves were OK for microinjection.Note: The midrib should be observed to be filled with RSV crude extraction upon microinjection (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171031/20171031023700_1693.jpgFigure 3. RSV microinjection and symptom observation. A. RSV microinjection. RSV crude extractions were microinjected into the midribs of rice leaves through Nanoliter 2000. The red arrow indicates the injection site. Symptoms of rice leaves inoculated with extractions from nonviruliferous planthoppers (B) and from viruliferous planthoppers (C) were observed two weeks later. The RSV extractions from viruliferous planthoppers induced typical disease symptoms.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Microinjection of RSV through Nanoject II Programmable Nanoliter injector Microinject the extractions from nonviruliferous small brown planthoppers into the midribs of healthy rice leaves as negative control. Note: The negative control is very important as it can tell you whether or not the experimental system works.Evaluate the development of disease symptoms of both the injected leaves and systemic leaves after about 2-3 weeks post inoculation. The disease symptoms are evaluated as described by Toriyama and Sakurai (1969).",
    "Note: Make at least three replicates, and each group contains at least 30 seedlings. The incidence of RSV by mechanical transmission is about 17% after the midrib microinjection of insect-derived RSV crude extractions."
