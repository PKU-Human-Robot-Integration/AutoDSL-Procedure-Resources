    "This experimental protocol was approved by the Doshisha Committee of Animal Experiment.\nNOTE: Conduct all experimental sessions during the light period.\n1. Animals\nUse 15 experimentally naïve male albino Wistar rats that weigh 300−350 g. House them in individual cages of a controlled breeding room with the appropriate temperature and humidity (23 ± 2 °C, 70%) and ad libitum access to the water. Maintain the light/dark cycle at 12 h/12 h (the light period begins at 8:00 AM).\nAssign 10 rats as subjects, and the remaining as confederate rats using randomization.\nMaintain rats’ weights at 85−90% of their free-feeding weights throughout the experiment by food deprivation.\nNOTE: The assignment of confederate is to reduce the number of animals required and time for one study. \n2. Apparatus\nNOTE: The overview of the apparatus is shown in Figure 1. The apparatus was developed and modified in reference to previous studies16,17.\nConstruct a clear acrylic box (19 cm x 110 cm x 20 cm) with a central partition (5 cm wide) and insert two guillotine doors. Place the guillotine doors 15 cm away from each end of the box. Mount a buzzer (400 Hz, 75 dB) on the partition, and set up a pellet dispenser for serving a reward pellet (45 mg) into a food receptacle on the subject’s side of the box.\nSet up a metal lever (grip bar: φ3 mm, 5 cm high) on a shelf inside the central partition, which has a slit (1.5 cm wide) on each wall facing the runway (Figure 2), in order to allow the subject rat to access the lever by using its forelimbs. On the confederate’s side, however, insert a transparent wall in front of the partition’s wall that prohibits the confederate from accessing the lever.",
    "Place a switch for activating the dispenser under the lever that is pressed by the lever-pull movement of rats. Tie the proper length of gut to the lever, which is needed for the experimenter to pull up the lever.\nUse Arduino Mega 2560 REV3 to control the guillotine doors, buzzer, and pellet dispenser, and to obtain the value from the infrared sensors and switch of the dispenser. Prepare an air compressor (25 L) to operate the air cylinder and open the guillotine door.\nPlace a video camera near the partition of the outside of the apparatus, in order to record lever-pull performance of the rats from a lateral view (60 frames per second [fps]). Use an adequate video playback software to conduct frame-by-frame analysis of the video recording.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: A schematic of the apparatus used in this protocol. A central partition divides the box into two fields. There is a guillotine door on each side of the box, and the door divides the field into the start area and runway.

Procedure\nHandling and habituation for the reward pellets\nBefore the training procedures, handle all rats for 10 min/day for 3 days by the experimenter.\nAs a habituation for the reward pellets, give each rat 3 g of reward pellets for 3 days after handling.\nHabituation to the apparatus\nSubject rats",
    "On the third day of habituation for the reward pellets, before the experimenter gives daily pellets, place each rat in the runway of the subject’s side of the apparatus for 15 min for habituation, with the guillotine door closed.\nConfederate rats\nNOTE: There are two habituation sessions.\n\t\t\nAt the first habituation, place each rat on the runway of the confederate’s side of the apparatus for 15 min during the same period as step 3.2.1.1.\nAt the second habituation, follow the method in step 3.2.2.1 on the day after subject rats completed training for the run-and-pull sequence (as mentioned in section 3.6).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Conduct habituation sessions for confederate rats and subject rats separately, i.e., one rat at a time. Do not let a rat meet another rat in the apparatus until the test phase starts.\nMagazine training\nNOTE: For the subject rats, conduct a magazine training session on the next day of the habituation to the apparatus as follows. If rats do not eat all the food pellets, then conduct the magazine training session again on the next day.\n\t\nPut one reward pellet on the food receptacle on the confederate’s side to exclude the effect of the olfactory property of the pellet, which the confederate eats in the test phase (refer to section 3.7).\nPlace a subject rat on the runway of the subject’s side, with the guillotine door closed.\nDeliver a reward pellet into the food receptacle 60 times using the pellet dispenser on a variable time 30-s schedule. Ensure that the subject rat eats all the delivered pellets.\nShaping for the lever-pull action\nNOTE: Figure 3 is a flowchart of the experiment.\n\t\nPut one reward pellet on the food receptacle on each subject’s side and confederate’s side. Do not place the confederate rat in shaping sessions.",
    "Place the subject rat on the runway of the subject’s side with the guillotine door closed. Then train the rats to pull down the lever. Shape the lever-pull behavior gradually with following five reinforcement criteria (A-E): (A) Approach the slit. (B) Touch the grip bar to the rat’s muzzle or forelimbs, with the lever beforehand pulled down to the subject’s side. (C) Touch the grip bar, with the lever inclined to the rat’s side (at an angle of 60°−30°). (D) Grasp and pull down the bar to rat’s side using the same condition as in criterion C. (E) Grasp and pull down the bar to rat’s side with the lever standing upright.\nFinish daily sessions when 60 rewards are given, or 30 min has elapsed. When a rat completes criterion E 40 times in a session, the lever-pull shaping phase is finished on that day.\nNOTE: Almost all rats finish the daily shaping session within 20 min. Wistar rats need about 3 days to reach criterion E.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: A flowchart of the experimental procedure. Subject rats go through the training phases and test phases in this order. This figure has been modified from Sekiguchi and Hata12.

Do not place the confederate rat in the training sessions. Present the buzzer tone for 5 s, and then open the door. When the subject rat pulls down the lever, deliver a food pellet and pull the lever up using a gut tied to the lever.",
    "After rats pull down the lever for 10 times (first 3 days of the phase) or 6 times (last 3 days of the phase) and consume all reward pellets, close the door and move them to the start area by the experimenter’s hand.\nAfter an inter-trial interval (ITI) of 20 s, repeat steps 3.5.1 and 3.5.2. Finish daily sessions when each rat has earned 60 pellets.\nNOTE: This training also aims to habituate rats to the buzzer tone and door opening because Wistar rats ordinarily show freezing behavior at first in response to door movement. A daily session for each rat requires about 15 min. Six days are needed for this training phase.\nTraining phase for the run-and-pull sequence\nConduct the same procedure in step 3.5.1.\nWhen rats pull down the lever one time and consume a reward pellet, close the door and move them to the start area by the experimenter’s hand.\nAfter an ITI of 20 s, start the next trial (steps 3.6.1 and 3.6.2). Finish the daily session when each rat has earned 30 pellets.\nNOTE: A daily session for each rat requires about 20 min. About 10 days are needed for rats’ scores to reach asymptote.\nTest phases\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Description of each test condition. In single phases, the subject rat performed the task solitarily. In the pair phases, place the confederate rat in the runway on the opposite side to the subject rat. A transparent wall in front of the partition precludes the confederate rat from accessing the lever. This figure has been modified from Sekiguchi and Hata12. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig04largev3.jpg]",
    "NOTE: Test phases include sessions in two conditions, single or pair (Figure 4). In the single condition, rats perform the task solitarily; that is, trials are identical to the session of the training for the run-and-pull sequence (section 3.6). In the pair condition, the confederate rat is present at the opposite side of the box. The confederate rat cannot access the lever because of the clear acrylic wall in front of the partition.\nConduct a single session that is identical to the sessions in the training phase for the run-and-pull sequence (section 3.6). Finish the daily session when each rat has earned 30 pellets. Put one reward pellet on the food receptacle on the confederate’s side, especially during sessions in the single condition.\nIn pair sessions, give the confederate rat a reward pellet during the ITI of the subject rat in order to keep the confederate rat near the partition.\n4. Data Analysis\nIndex of performance accuracy\nRecord videos of rats’ lever-pull movement using the video camera near the partition of the outside of the apparatus. After all sessions are completed, confirm the evaluation by frame-by-frame analysis of the video recordings using an adequate video playback software.\nEvaluate whether the rat’s pulling movement of a trial was the first-hit or not by visual observation of the experimenter during the experiment.\nNOTE: The first-hit trial is defined as the trial in which rats could grasp and pull down the lever during their first attempt to the lever.\nCalculate first-hit rates for each subject as the proportion of ﬁrst-hit trials to all trials in each session (for the run-and-pull training phase) or in each phase (for test phases) to use in the analysis.\nIndices of performance speed",
    "Calculate the time needed to complete a trial from the value of the switch of the pellet dispenser: the time needed to complete a trial = (the time when the switch is pressed) - (the time when the door is opened). Then divide the time needed for completion of a trial into three sections using values from the infrared sensors (Figure 5).\nNOTE: Start latency (Figure 5a) is defined as the time from the door opening to the arrival of the rat at the ﬁrst sensor. Similarly, running time (Figure 5b) is the time from the arrival at the ﬁrst sensor to the arrival at the second sensor. Lever-pull latency (Figure 5c) is the time from the arrival at the second sensor to the time point when the switch of the dispenser is pressed.\nUse only the durations from the ﬁrst-hit trials for analysis. Calculate median values of each subject for each session (of the training sessions) and each phase (of the test phases) for analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Measurement of the indices of performance speed. (a) Start latency: the duration from the door opening to the arrival of the rat at the ﬁrst sensor. (b) Running time: the duration from the arrival of the rat at the ﬁrst sensor to its arrival at the second sensor. (c) Lever-pull latency: the duration from the arrival of the rat at the second sensor to the completion of a lever-pull response. This figure has been modified from Sekiguchi and Hata12.

    "For the indices in the test phase, conduct two-way repeated-measure ANOVA with the number of the phase (phase 1 or 2) and condition (pair or single) as the within-subject factors for each index in the test phases. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at α = 0.05."
