    "The methods described were approved and performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the University of Western Australia Animal Ethics Committee.\n1. Isolation of mice TDSCs\nEuthanize the 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 mice by cervical dislocation.\nHarvest patellar tendons24 and Achilles tendons25.\nDigest tendons from one with 6 mL of type I collagenase (3 mg/mL) for 3 h.\n\tNOTE: As the size of tendon in the mouse is small, all tendons harvested from one mouse should be used in this step.\nCollect the cells and culture in complete Minimal Essential Medium (Alpha-MEM) containing 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% of streptomycin and penicillin mixture for 7 days.\nIdentify TDSCs using fluorescence-activated cell sorting by flow cytometry (expression of cell surface markers including CD44, CD90 and Sca-1; lack of the expression of CD34 and CD45).\nPassage and freeze cells (passage 4 cells will be used for further steps).\n2. Culture and expansion of mice TDSCs\nNOTE: Conduct all steps in a sterile biosafety hood.\nTake the warmed-up cells (mice TDSCs, 1 million cells, passage 4, to 37 °C).\nSlowly add extra 4-5 mL of complete Minimal Essential Medium (Alpha-MEM).\nTransfer the mixture to a 15 mL centrifuge tube with a pipette.\nTop up with medium to 8 mL total with a pipette.\n\t\nPrewarm medium in a 37 °C oven incubator.\nPlace the tube into centrifuge and balance.\nCentrifuge and pellet cells at 347 x g for 5 min.\nTake out after centrifuge and check the pellet at the bottom.\nDecant the freezing medium, and resuspend cells gently in 1-2 mL of complete medium (avoid making too many bubbles).\nTransfer resuspended cells to a T-75 flask by a pipette.",
    "Use a pipette to add complete Alpha-MEM Medium to the flask to reach a total volume of 10 mL with final concentration of 13,000 cells/cm2.\nPlace the flask into the incubator and culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nChange the medium every 3 days.\nObserve and monitor the cells under a microscope when changing the medium until cells are cultured to 100% confluence (about 40,000 cells/cm2).\n3. Preparation of stimulation culture medium for cell sheet formation\nNOTE: Conduct all steps in a sterile biosafety hood.\nPour 15 mL of complete Alpha-MEM medium into a 15 mL sterile tube.\nAdd 6 µL of ascorbic acid (11 mg/mL) into 15 mL of medium for a final concentration of 4.4 µg/mL.\n\tNOTE: Additionally adding 25 ng/mL connective tissue growth factor in the stimulation culture medium can accelerate the whole growth and differentiation process.\nMix gently by inverting up and down.\n4. Cell sheet formation by culturing in stimulation medium\nNOTE: Conduct all steps in a sterile biosafety hood.\nDiscard the normal complete alpha-MEM medium carefully, and avoid touching the cells attached to the bottom of the flask.\nAdd 10 mL of stimulation medium slowly and avoid causing any disturbance to the fully confluent cells.\nCulture the cells in stimulation medium for 9 days (change the medium every 3 days) to sufficiently generate the cell sheet at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Extracellular matrix will become thick and present to be cloudy when observed from the bottom of the flask after stimulated by ascorbic acid, which means the cell sheet is sufficiently generated.\n5. Preparation of 3D tendon stem cell construct\nNOTE: Conduct all steps in a sterile biosafety hood.\nTake the flask out of the incubator.\nDiscard the stimulation medium completely.",
    "Wash the monolayer cell sheet with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) by swirling the flask.\nDiscard the PBS completely.\nUse a pipette to add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin to the corner of the flask.\nTap the corner of the flask to de-attach the monolayer cell sheet until the corner of the cell sheet is off the bottom of the flask.\nImmediately add 9 mL of complete Alpha-MEM medium to stop the trypsinization.\nContinue swirling the flask to peel off the monolayer cell sheet completely.\nPour the total de-attached cell sheet into a Petri dish with medium.\nUse a sterile tweezer to pick up one corner of the cell sheet and rotate in a clockwise direction for 15 times.\nPick up another end of the cell sheet and rotate in an anti-clockwise direction for 10 times to firmly generate a tendon-like in vitro construct (Figure 1A).\n6. Assembly of the uniaxial-stretching mechanical stimulation complex in unique designed bioreactor\nNOTE: Conduct all steps in a sterile biosafety hood.\nConnect the hooks by the connecter and adjust to the desired distance (2 cm) between two hooks.\nGently wind the 3D TDSCs construct on the assembled hook for 3 times on each hook (Figure 1B).\nSecure the hooks with cell construct onto the chamber of the bioreactor by tightening the screws on two ends.\n\tNOTE: The whole chamber, including screws and hooks, is sterile (autoclave for 1.5 h at 134 °C and ultraviolet rays (UV) expose for 24 hours before use). For the metal holder of chambers, UV light expose for 48 hours before use.\nFill up the chamber with complete Alpha-MEM medium.\nConnect the actuator to the culture chamber by cable.\nCut the hooks connecter by sterile scissors.\nSwitch on the power and corresponding channel controller to start mechanical stimulation.",
    "Put the lid on the chamber.\nCheck the indicator lights and assure the bioreactor can function properly.\nPut the bioreactor in the incubator and subject the 3D cell construct to mechanical stretching for 6 days (6% stretching, 0.25 Hz, 8 h, followed by 16 h rest).\n7. Evaluation of the mechanical stimulated in vitro tendon-like tissue\nLoosen the screws by a screwdriver and take the assembly off carefully.\nPut the tendon-like tissue into 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation for 15 min.\nPlace the fixed tendon-like tissue into a biopsy cassette with biopsy foam pads.\nProcess to dehydrate the sample and finally evaluate by H&E histological staining.\nRepeat the whole protocol and extract RNA from the tendon-like tissue for evaluating the expression of tenogenic markers by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Primers for the selected genes are listed in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: Histology protocol and qPCR protocol are standard and following a previous study21.\nSubscription Required.
