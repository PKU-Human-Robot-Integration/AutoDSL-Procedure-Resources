    "Note: The APP endocytosis assay is performed on neurons cultivated for 9 days in vitro (9 DIV). Cell culture and transfection (Day 1, Day 6, Day 8)Day 1: Prepare primary cortical neurons from cortices and hippocampi from wild-type females and males mouse embryos (E16) as previously described (Almeida et al., 2005 and 2006; Ubelmann et al., 2017). Briefly, dissociated neurons are plated on 24-well plates containing poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips (5-10 x 104 cells/cm2) in plating medium (DIV 0). After 3 h or overnight, replace the plating medium with Neurobasal medium allowing only neurons to grow and differentiate until use. (Almeida et al., 2005 and 2006; Ubelmann et al., 2017)Day 8: For expression of APP-RFP cDNA, 8 DIV primary cortical neurons are transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer’s protocol, using 0.5 µg cDNA: 0.5 µl Lipofectamine mix in 25 µl Opti-MEM per well of 24-well plate with 250 µl fresh antibiotics-free Neurobasal medium and incubated overnight until assaying APP endocytosis .Note: Expect on average 10 transfected healthy neurons at 8 DIV at stage 5 of differentiation (Dotti et al., 1988) and the neurites should not show bead-like structures that indicate degeneration. This efficiency can be achieved using freshly prepared cDNA with a regular midi-prep kit (we use a local NZYTECH brand).(Optional) Day 6: For knockdown analysis, primary neurons at 6 days in vitro (6 DIV) were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax according to manufacturer’s protocol, after substituting culture media with fresh antibiotics-free Neurobasal medium.APP endocytosis assay of 9 DIV primary neurons expressing APP-RFP (Figure 1) by the following steps (Day 9)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128173830_9159.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of APP endocytosis monitored using anti-APP antibody incubation for 10 min in axon, dendrite and cell body. EE: Early endosome; Lys: Lysosome.",
    "Remove cell culture media with a plastic Pasteur pipette, add 400 µl B27-free Neurobasal medium for 30 min at 37 °C in cell culture incubator. All pipetting should be done slowly against the wall of the well without touching the cells.Dilute 0.25 µl of anti-APP antibody (22C11; 0.25 µg/µl stock concentration) into 25 µl complete Neurobasal medium with 10 mM HEPES (0.25 µl of stock solution at 1 M, pH 7.2-7.5) per coverslip. Place one 25 µl droplet of diluted anti-APP antibody per glass coverslip onto Parafilm stretched on a 24 wells plate lid. Place the coverslips, carefully and as fast as possible, over the droplets with cells facing the antibody solution, cover the reaction in a container to avoid evaporation and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min in a cell culture incubator. This step allows for anti-APP antibody binding to cell surface APP and subsequent endocytosis.(Optional)To monitor endocytosed APP lysosomal degradation, further incubate cells for 60 min upon washing by dipping coverslips once for 4 s in 500 µl pre-warmed PBS. To detect APP at the plasma membrane, incubate cells with anti-APP antibody for only 4 min at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. This optional step allows labelling anti-APP antibody bound to cell surface APP without significant detection of endocytosis.Wash each coverslip by dipping once in 500 µl pre-warmed PBS for 4 s.Fix cells by placing coverslips back in a 24-well plate and add 500 µl 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Replace fixative solution with 500 µl PBS, and after 3 washes proceed for detection of anti-APP.Anti-APP antibody detection (Day 9)For detection of endocytosed APP bound to anti-APP antibody, permeabilize fixed cells with 500 µl 0.1% saponin/PBS (permeabilization buffer) for 60 min at RT.",
    "Remove the permeabilization buffer and wash each coverslip with PBS. Optional: For detection of anti-APP bound to APP at the cell surface (4 min), no permeabilization is required. Do not include saponin in steps C2 and C3.Block non-specific binding of the antibody to serum proteins with 500 µl of blocking buffer (3% FBS/0.1% saponin/PBS) for 60 min at RT. Place each coverslip (cells facing down) onto a 50 µl droplet of diluted donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:250) in 3% FBS/0.1% saponin/PBS. Optional: Include DAPI in the antibody solution (1:10,000 of a stock of 1 mg/ml) to counterstain cell nuclei.Cover the reaction and incubate it for 60 min at RT, in the dark.Place coverslips back on a 24-well plate and wash 3 times with PBS at RT.Mount coverslips with cells facing down onto a 25 µl droplet of Fluoromount G at RT on microscope slides and let dry overnight in the dark to preserve the fluorescence signal.Note: Pipette Fluoromount G quickly to prevent it from drying but gently to avoid bubbles.Image acquisition (Day 10)Image acquisition is done using epifluorescence microscopy (such as ZEISS Z2) with a 60x NA 1.4 oil immersion objective and a CCD camera (see Equipment for details on microscope used). See Figure 2 for a representative image.Neuronal cell body, portions of dendrites and axons must be in focus. Not well-developed neurons or neurons expressing low or high levels of APP-RFP should be excluded. Exposure times should be determined based on the sample with the brightest expected signal, to use as much of the dynamic range of the camera (ideally use a camera with 16-bit binary range) without saturating any of the pixels. Acquire 10-20 neurons per condition to have sufficient data for statistical analysis. To image the whole neuron, it may be necessary to acquire multiple fields.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128174039_6886.",

Identify the cell body, a dendrite and the axon based on neuronal morphology and on RFP signal and roughly outline composite selections (non-contiguous ROIs) corresponding to cell body, two to five ~20 µm segments in dendrites and one in the axon (usually thinner, longer and with branches at 90° angle) using ‘polygon selection’ while pressing ‘shift’ (see Figure 3). Axons and dendrites can alternatively be counterstained with Ankyrin-G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or MAP2 (Sigma-Aldrich).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128174201_8786.jpgFigure 3.
