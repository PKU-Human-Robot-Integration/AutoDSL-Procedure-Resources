    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCheck the female estrus cycle phase by examining vaginal cells\nTiming: 30 min\nPlace the mice on the surface of a metal cage rack. Hold the tail base securely elevating the rear end with one hand. The mouse will have her front paws grasping the cage.\nWith the other hand hold the pipette tip with 20 μL of 1× PBS and flush the vagina gently by pushing the end of the pipette tip into the opening of the vaginal canal. Flush the fluid into the vagina and back up into the pipette two to three times using the same tip.\nCollect the final flush on a glass slide (25 × 75 × 1.0 mm) and place a cover slip (thickness 1 ½, 22 × 50 mm).\nExamine the slide under a bright field microscope (for example, Leica DMi8) using a 10× or 20× objective.\nCollect cervical tissue from females at the desired cycle phase. As shown in the examples, the estrus stage is characterized by the presence of cornified epithelial cells in the vaginal lavage. Diestrus phase is dominated by leukocytes (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3086-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mouse estrus cycle using vaginal cytology\n(A) Estrus stage.\n(B) Diestrus stage. 20× objective and Scale bar 50 μm.\nCritical: It is important to check the estrus cycle using vaginal cytology just before collecting cervical tissue.\nHarvest cervix from non-pregnant and pregnant mice\nTiming: 15 min\nSacrifice the mouse using method approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (e.g., cervical dislocation and/or ketamine injection).\nLay the mouse back side up on an absorbent pad and generously spray the abdomen and other exposed side of the mouse with 70% ethanol to reduce the risk of contamination.",
    "Using clean forceps and scissors, lift the skin and make an incision at the midline cutting through the viscera and the peritoneum, into the abdominal cavity.\nExpose the abdominal cavity by lifting the skin up and away from you. Push the intestines aside to visualize the uterus, cervix and vagina. Remove the mesometrial fat and other connective tissues.\nCut the upper end of the uterine horns, hold both horns with the forceps and pull upward. Simultaneously using the scissors cut the vagina with intact cervix.\nPlace the dissected uterine horn, cervix and vagina on a new absorbent pad and remove the vagina and the uterine horns under the dissecting microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3086-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mouse female reproductive tract\nMouse female reproductive tract (A) uterus, cervix and vagina.\n(B) Vagina and cervix separated from the uterus.\nTransfer the cervix to a 30 mm Petri dish containing cold PBS on ice.\nWeigh the tissue followed by washing the tissue with enough PBS twice to get rid of hair and blood. The weight of mouse cervix obtained varies between 10–30 mg per cervix depending on non-pregnant stage and pregnant gestational age.\nSplit or pool the cervices in 5 mL Eppendorf tubes such as each tube has no more than 30 mg of tissue.\nCritical: Do not digest more than 30 mg of tissue in a single tube.\nEnzymatic dissociation of cervix from non-pregnant and pregnant mice\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: All subsequent steps must be carried out under sterile condition on ice.\nWorking inside a hood under sterile conditions, transfer the cervix to a new Petri dish with 20–30 μL of digestion solution on ice.\nStart chopping the cervix into tiny pieces (less than 0.5 mm3) using sterile scissors followed by finely mincing with razor blades.",
    "Note: Chopping with scissors followed by mincing with razor blade is a critical step to get representation of different cell types.\nTransfer minced tissue to a 5 mL Eppendorf containing 2 mL of digestion solution depending on the weight of the cervix and incubate for 1 h 15 min at 4°C with mild shaking/rocking in the nutating mixer.\nNote: Use 2 mL digestion solution for 20–30 mg tissue.\nCentrifuge the 5-mL tube at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS by gently pipetting up and down a few times.\nGently pass the cell suspension (1 mL) 3–5 times through a 21-gauge blunt-end needle using a 1 mL syringe to break the cell chunks (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nTransfer the entire cell suspension through a 40 μm filter into a 1.5 mL Lobind tube to remove any cell clumps.\nNote: Prewet the 40 μm filter using 1 mL PBS.\nCentrifuge the 1.5 mL tube at 1200 rpm for 5 min 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS by gently pipetting up and down few times.\nOptional: Perform red blood cell lysis if necessary (if you see red blood cells on the bottom of the tube)by resuspending the cells in 300 μL of RBC lysis buffer and incubating for 5 minutes on ice. Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tube at 1200 rpm for 5 mins. Discard the supernatant. A white pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube. Resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS (to remove lysis buffer) by gently pipetting up and down few times.",
    "Repeat step 21 and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL ice cold 10× Chromium buffer containing PBS and 0.04% BSA to reduce cell loss and clumping. Keep cells/samples on ice and proceed immediately to determine cell counts and viability.\nOptional: Perform red blood cell lysis if necessary (if you see red blood cells on the bottom of the tube)by resuspending the cells in 300 μL of RBC lysis buffer and incubating for 5 minutes on ice. Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tube at 1200 rpm for 5 mins. Discard the supernatant. A white pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube. Resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS (to remove lysis buffer) by gently pipetting up and down few times.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Method video S1. Demonstration of mechanical disruption of cells by passing the cell suspension through the 21G syringe needle, related to step 19\n    \nCell counting, viability, and morphology\nTiming: 15 mins\nOn a small piece of Parafilm or in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube mix 5 μL of cell suspension with 5 μL of Trypan blue.\nLoad 10 μL onto the Neubauer hemocytometer and count the cells under the microscope to check the cell density and viability.\nOptional: Count cells twice and take the average cell count.\nAdd 5 μL of cell suspension to a clean slide and place a cover slip to check the morphology.\nAdjust the concentration to 1000 cells/ μL for optimal density in the 10× Genomics Chromium system and reconfirm the cell count again by repeating steps 24 and 257.",
    "Load the cells onto the 10× Genomic Chromium Controller chip and reverse transcription of single-cell GEMs to get barcoded cDNA. Using the Thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) the cDNA was amplified. 10× Chromium controller chip was used to partition single cells into nanoliter-scale Gel-Bead-In-Emulsions (GEMs) and reverse transcription performed using Single-cell 3′ Reagent Kit v2 and library construction for Illumina sequencing. (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v2-chemistry[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v2-chemistry]).\nThe cDNA Libraries were quantified using the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer and the quality was checked using a 2100 Bioanalyzer with a High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent). Sequencing was performed in paired-end mode with S1-100 cycles kit using a Novaseq 6000 sequencer (Illumina). Approximately 400 million reads were allocated per sample with at least 70,000 reads per cell.\nCritical: Minimize the amount of time between cell counting and library preparation."
