    "ProcedureThe procedure for organotypic raft culture and EBV infection for primary oral keratinocytes has been described in detail (Temple et al., 2017). Here, we show that organotypic rafts can also be generated from nasopharyngeal CRCs. For nasopharyngeal-derived organotypic rafts, CRCs are similarly seeded on top of a collagen plug embedded with live 3T3-J2 cells and lifted to ALI on a metal grid. The protocol by     Temple et al. (2017)     is provided below with modifications (underlined) and additional tips:Generation of Raft CultureThe following procedure is for collagen plugs prepared in 6-well plate sized wells.To prepare the 3T3-J2 collagen plugs, use low-passage 3T3-J2 cells grown in 3T3-J2 growth medium (10% bovine calf serum, iron-supplemented) as described for pseudostratified-ALI in Section A above. Note, for organotypic rafts do not irradiate 3T3-J2 cells.Prepare Type 1 collagen from rat tail to exactly 4 mg/mL, by mixing low and high concentration Type I collagen on ice. Prepare extra, as some collagen will be lost in pipetting.Tip: Mixing high and low concentration is required because diluting high concentration collagen with acetic acid, as recommended by the manufacturer, results in a very low pH and is also difficult to achieve accurately due to high viscosity. Trypsinize subconfluent 3T3-J2 cells with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Neutralize with 3T3-J2 growth media and pellet cells. For each raft, resuspend 6.25 × 105 3T3-J2 cells in 0.25 mL of 10× reconstitution buffer. All work moving forward should be performed on ice, to prevent cell clumping and premature collagen solidification.Add 0.25 mL of 10× DMEM and mix well by pipetting.Add 2 mL of 4 mg/mL Type I collagen. Adjust pH with 6 µL of 10 N NaOH per 2.5 mL collagen plug. Mix thoroughly by inverting the tube.Aliquot 2.",
    "5 mL of collagen-3T3-J2 cell mixture into one well of a 6-well plate, to form the collagen plug. Tilt to distribute evenly, and remove air bubbles with a sterile pipette tip.Incubate the collagen plugs at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1–2 h, to allow the collagen plug to solidify.Once the collagen plug has solidified, add 2–3 mL of E-media without EGF, and equilibrate at room temperature for at least 10 min. The presence of EGF can damage the 3T3-J2 fibroblasts. E-media should completely cover the collagen plug. The collagen plug in E-media can be prepared up to 2 days in advance, and left in a 37°C tissue culture incubator until ready to seed nasopharyngeal CRCs.When ready to seed nasopharyngeal CRCs, aspirate the E-media covering the collagen plug.  Seed 3 × 106 nasopharyngeal CRCs  onto the collagen plug in 1 mL of E-media supplemented with 5 ng/mL EGF. Incubate at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator for 2–4 h, to allow the CRCs to adhere. Do not rock the culture, as this may result in uneven distribution of the CRCs. After 2 h, check that the CRCs have adhered using an inverted phase/contrast microscope. The adhered CRCs should fill the entire surface of the collagen plug. This is critical, or the resulting organotypic rafts will be thin. Do not leave the CRCs on the collagen plug with EGF-supplemented media for extended periods beyond 4 h, as this will damage the 3T3-J2 fibroblasts.Note: It is possible to transduce nasopharyngeal CRCs with lentivirus expression vectors at the time of expansion before seeding into organotypic rafts. Stable selection of transduced cells is not recommended, as increased passage number will affect the quality of the organotypic raft. A transient selection is possible if the transduction is efficient.",
    "Once the CRCs have adhered, gently aspirate residual media, and carefully transfer the collagen plug with adhered CRCs from the 6-well plate to an autoclave-sterilized metal grid in a 100 mm plate. Loosen the plug with a sterile spatula around the perimeter and spread the collagen plug onto the metal grid, avoiding folds or air bubbles underneath. Up to two collagen plugs can be placed onto each metal grid. Apply E-media without EGF to the bottom of the plate until it reaches the bottom surface of the raft. Aspirate any air bubbles. In order to generate an air-liquid interface, do not allow any portion of the raft to be submerged (see Video 2). Incubate the raft cultures in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C for 9–12 days, to allow differentiation. Extending the differentiating period will result in thinning of the rafts. Change the underlying E-media every other day  (Figure 5A) .<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.

A white layer of differentiated cells is visible on top of the pink collagen plug which contains the embedded 3T3-J2 fibroblasts.Infecting Raft Cultures with EBV (Video 3)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Scoring and EBV infection of organotypic rafts. Prepare anti-human IgG-reactivated Akata cells one day prior to infection (day 3 post air-lifting). Resuspend Akata cells to 5 × 105 cells/mL in RPMI media with 10% FBS. Add 100 µg/mL α-human IgG goat antiserum. Incubate at 5% CO2 and 37°C for 24 h.",
    "At day 4 post air-lifting, aspirate E-media from the raft, and score the raft surface in a grid format with a sterile scalpel, ten times horizontally and ten times vertically. Scoring is a form of wounding of the tissue that enables the inoculum to directly contact all epithelial cell layers in the raft. Note: EBV infection without scoring the raft is possible with oral keratinocyte-derived organotypic rafts (Temple et al., 2017), although we have not attempted this with nasopharyngeal organotypic rafts.  Inoculate the scored raft surface with reactivated Akata cells from step B1, by spinning down the reactivated Akata cells and resuspending 2.5 × 106 cells in 200 µL of PBS. Add the inoculum dropwise and evenly distribute across the surface of the raft, using a 200 µL pipette. Note: The inoculum size was optimized for 2.5 × 106 Akata cells per raft. Because this is a co-culture method of infection, the size of the inoculum is simply calculated by the number of co-cultured EBV producing B-cells. The reactivated Akata inoculum is continually producing infectious EBV while co-cultured with the raft.  Allow the inoculum to absorb, and then replace the basolateral E-media. Place in a 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator at 37°C for the desired length of time (4–7 days post-infection). Do not wash off the EBV inoculum. Replenish with fresh E-media every other day.Harvesting Raft Cultures by FFPE for Histology and Immunostaining (Video 4)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Harvesting of fixed organotypic raft for FFPE processing. Aspirate media from the raft.Rinse the raft twice with PBS, by gently pipetting into the 100 mm plate and allowing the raft to submerge.Fix the raft directly on the metal grid, by submerging in 4% PFA at room temperature for 1 h.",
    "Using a spatula, transfer the fixed raft to a biopsy sponge soaked in PBS. Close the tissue cassette lid and store in 70% ethanol for FFPE processing  (Figure 4) . Note: Unlike ethanol, tert-Butanol preserves the fluorescence of fluorescent proteins (Zhanmu et al., 2019). If visualization of a reporter fluorescent protein is desired after fixation, store the PFA-fixed raft in 50% tert-Butanol and dehydrate in graded (50%, 75%, 95%, and 100%) tert-Butanol for 30 mins each, before FFPE processing. Rehydration should also be carried out in graded (100%, 95%, 75%, and 50%) tert-Butanol.  Proceed to histology and immunostaining. Representative immunostains for cellular and EBV proteins denoting lytic infection (EBV Zebra+) in the suprabasal layers (involucrin+) are shown in Figure 6.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4365/bioprotoc-12-06-4365-g006.jpgFigure 6. Immunostains of FFPE sections from nasopharyngeal organotypic rafts mock-treated or recombinantly-infected with EBV. EBV-infected rafts were infected by the co-culture method with Akata B-cells. Shown are representative FFPE sections stained for cellular or EBV marker proteins and counterstained with DAPI or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). A. Representative FFPE sections stained for cellular marker proteins (keratin 5 [K5], involucrin [Inv], and human IgG [hIgG]). Basal cells are strongly positive for K5 but weakly positive for Inv. Suprabasal cells are strongly positive for Inv and positive for K5. The green dotted line denotes the border between the basal and suprabasal layers. B. Representative FFPE sections stained for EBV (Zebra) protein and hIgG. Zebra+ cells can be quantified, and the percent of Zebra+ nuclei per image plotted (see Part IV: Image Data Analysis). In the images shown, no contaminating B-cells (Akata inoculum) were observed with the anti-hIgG stain. H&E, hematoxylin and eosin. Arrow, keratin pearl. Scale bars = 50 µm.",
    "Part IV: Image Data Analysis Generating Overlaid Histograms with CellSens Dimension Software(CellSens Dimension software available from Olympus)The purpose of generating an overlaid histogram is to show signal-to-noise ratio. A typical example would compare the Zebra-stained signal in a pseudo-ALI culture infected with EBV compared to the mock control, as shown in Figure 3.Open the multichannel Z-stack infected and mock images in CellSens Dimension.Generate a maximum intensity projection of the z-stacks by selecting Process -> Maximum Intensity, and save as new images.Select Image -> Separate -> Channels, so that each color channel is now displayed as an individual image.Create a new image containing the channel displaying the stain by selecting Image -> Combine -> Channels, and select the images to compare. There are options to change the pseudocolor of each channel, so ensure that each is displayed as a different color. This color will appear in the histogram.Ensure that both channels are visible. The histograms of each channel are now overlaid in the histogram window. Select the button labeled with an arrow in Figure 7, to switch from logarithmic to linear view. Screenshot and crop the histogram window to display as desired. Additional examples of overlaid histograms are shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4365/bioprotoc-12-06-4365-g007.jpgFigure 7. Generating an overlaid histogram with CellSens Dimension Software to illustrate signal to noise. The cropped images illustrate steps 2–5 described in Part IV: Image Data Analysis (A). This example compares the signal of a Zebra-stained image, from a nasopharyngeal pseudo-ALI culture (donor NPH10A) infected with EBV harvested at 5 days p.i., with a mock-infected control (Ziegler et al., 2021). A. Maximum intensity projection of a Zebra-stained z-stack image (red) with DAPI (blue) in the EBV-infected sample. B. The red channel displaying the signal of the Zebra stain is separated for further analysis. C.",
    "The two red channel images corresponding to the Zebra stain in the EBV-infected and mock control are selected, and the color for the mock image is pseudocolored blue. D. The final overlaid histogram for the Zebra-stained channel is shown. Red denotes the EBV-infected sample and blue denotes the mock-infected sample. The arrow indicates the button to toggle between the logarithmic and linear display scale, whichever best shows the signal-to-noise ratio between the EBV-infected vs mock sample.Quantification of Fluorescent Particles with ImageJ Software and Fiji Plugin(ImageJ software and Fiji plugin available at https://imagej.net/software/[href=https://imagej.net/software/])The purpose of Particle Analysis is to score for Zebra+ nuclei. A typical example may show the percent DAPI+ nuclei that are Zebra+ in an EBV-infected organotypic raft compared to a mock control, as shown in Figure 3.Set LUTs and adjust images as necessary in the microscope software. Export/save separate channels as TIFF images.Open the DAPI and TRITC images in Fiji.First rotate and crop to the region of interest (the membrane/cells).Select the area to crop in the DAPI image. Switch to the red image and select Edit -> Selection -> Restore selection (or press Ctrl – Shift – E). Then select crop (or push Ctrl – Shift – X in each) for each image. This will crop the same area of each channel.In the DAPI image, Select Image -> Adjust -> Color Threshold, and adjust the brightness threshold, so that the background is removed while nuclei are still observed.Analyze -> Analyze Particles. Adjust settings to include all nuclei. This number is the number of DAPI positive cells.When analyzing, ensure “Add to Manager” is selected.Click in the ROI manager, then select More -> Fill, and it should fill particles in green color.Select Image -> Color -> Split, to create a binary image containing only the DAPI nuclei.",
    "Select Edit -> Selection -> Create Selection to select the nuclei in the binary image.In the red channel image (Zebra staining), press Ctrl – Shift – E or select restore selection, to select only the nuclei area from the blue image.Threshold again (set the value as high as needed, so that each nuclei area is counted as one cell) and click apply, to generate a black and white image containing only the Zebra staining inside the DAPI nuclei area. Analyze particles again to determine the number of Zebra positive cells. An example of the commands and graphed result are shown in Figure 8.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4365/bioprotoc-12-06-4365-g008.jpgFigure 8. Particle Analysis with ImageJ software and Fiji plugin to quantify positively stained nuclei. The cropped images illustrate steps 4–11 described in Part IV: Image Data Analysis (B). This example compares the signal of a Zebra-stained image from nasopharyngeal organotypic rafts infected with EBV or mock control. Shown are results from donor NPH17A (Ziegler et al., 2021). A. A threshold is applied to the DAPI channel in ImageJ. B. Results from Particle Analysis on the thresholded DAPI images. Each number on the left column denotes a particle. C. Zebra-stained images are evaluated for percent DAPI+ nuclei that are Zebra+. Zebra staining is displayed as a binary image within the DAPI nuclei, and the results from Particle Analysis are shown. Note that the settings detect no Zebra+ particles in the mock, but many Zebra+ particles in the EBV-infected sample. D. An example of percent Zebra+ nuclei in organotypic rafts at 7 days p.i., calculated with ImageJ software. This example is calculated from the images in Figure 6B."
