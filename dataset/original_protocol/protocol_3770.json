Coating dishes with gelatin (EmbryoMax 0.1% Gelatin Solution) can enhance MEF cells adhesion. Coat 35 mm dish with 1 mL gelatin for at least 0.5 h at 37°C.\nSplit MEFs\nRemove the gelatin and plate MEFs at 40,000 cells per dish. Gently put the dish into a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h for cell attachment.\nCritical: MEFs are likely to aggregate. Cells should be evenly distributed to facilitate viral infection, which is important for reprogramming. MEFs are likely to aggregate in the gelatin-coated dish, so the cells should be diluted to an appropriate amount before plating. For 35 mm dish, appropriate number of cells was diluted to 1 mL culture medium and mixed well. Add the cells into dish and gently rock the dish to distribute the cells.\nNote: The proliferation rate of MEFs varies among different batches of mouse. We need to prepare 160,000 MEFs to repeat this experiment with appropriate cell confluence. The 30%–40% confluence of the initial cells will be hard for us to image at day 8 because of the rapid emergence of clones (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). So we need to prepare appropriate cell number in each dish and don’t plate more than 40,000 cells per dish.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/692-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Calcein release assay\n(A) The morphological change occurs during reprogramming. The amount of cells is appropriate (Day 8-a) compared with too many ones, which form clones (Day 8-b). Scale bar corresponds to 100 μm.\n(B) Opening of mPTP was analyzed at days 0, 3, 5, and 8 during reprogramming. Scale bar corresponds to 20 μm.\nInfect MEFs with SKOM retroviruses",
    "Remove the medium and add 2.5 mL SKOM viral supernatants to dish with 24 h incubation and infect two rounds (24 h each round).\nCalcein release assay\nTiming: [30–45 min]\nThis assay employs calcein-AM, a colorless and nonfluorescent esterase substrate, and CoCl2, a quencher of calcein fluorescence, to selectively label mitochondria. Cells are loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of calcein dye, calcein-AM, which passively diffuses into the cells and accumulates in cytosolic compartments, including the mitochondria. Once inside cells, intracellular esterases cleave the acetoxymethyl esters to liberate the very polar fluorescent dye calcein, which does not cross the mitochondrial or plasma membranes in appreciable amounts over relatively short periods of time. The fluorescence from cytosolic calcein is quenched by the addition of CoCl2, while the fluorescence from the mitochondrial calcein is maintained. When mPTP is open, more CoCl2 will go into mitochondria and quench calcein. The calcein fluorescence intensity indicates the opening of mPTP.\nWash cells twice with modified HBSS buffer.\nIncubate cells in 1 mL labeling solution for 15 min protected from light at 37°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_692_4.csv\nNote: Labeling solution must be used immediately\nAfter incubation, cells were washed with 1 mL warm modified HBSS buffer for once to remove residual dye and minimize background.\nNote: Calcein release assay was carried out according to manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp35103.pdf&title=SW1hZ2UtaVQgTElWRSBNaXRvY2hvbmRyaWFsIFRyYW5zaXRpb24gUG9yZSBBc3NheSBLaXQ=[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp35103.pdf&title=SW1hZ2UtaVQgTElWRSBNaXRvY2hvbmRyaWFsIFRyYW5zaXRpb24gUG9yZSBBc3NheSBLaXQ=]) in Transition Pore Assay Kit. The hoechst and CoCl2 were stock solution in the Kit, we need to prepare the stock solution of calcein-AM (1 mM) with DMSO. Prepare labeling solution with these stock solutions and label cells for imaging as described at step 5.\nConfocal imaging\nTiming: [2 h/day]\nImage cells with Zeiss LSM710 (Calcein: Ex 488 and Emi 509; DAPI: Ex 405 and Emi 420) and find the reprogramming cells.",
    "At day 0, the reprogramming just begin and we can't select which cell will undergo reprogramming, so we image the cells at random.\nThe cells will go through MET (mesenchymal - epithelial transition) during reprogramming (Li et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and we found the cells begin undergoing epithelial-like morphological change from elongated cells to rounded cells at day 3 in our system (Ying et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). So image the morphology changed cells which are reprogramming cells at days 3, 5 and 8 during reprogramming process as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nPrepare four dishes and the mPTP opening analysis was carried out at days 0, 3, 5 and 8 during reprogramming as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nNote: In our system, the day that viral supernatants were removed was defined as day 0.\nAlternatives: Most confocal microscopes can image mPTP opening, such as Zeiss LSM 880 or Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope.\nSorting high and low mPTP opening cells\nCulture MEFs\nTiming: [2–3 days]\nAfter quickly thawing MEFs in a 37°C water bath, immediately transfer the thawed cell into a 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of fibroblast medium.\nCentrifuge the tube for 5 min at 200 g.\nDiscard the supernatant and transfer the cell to a 10 cm dish with 10 mL fibroblast medium and go to the next step at 2–3 days till the number of cells reach to 3–6 million (the confluence reaches to 60%–80%).\nStain MEFs\nTiming: [45–60 min]\nUse 1 mL DPBS to wash cells once and add 1 mL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 37°C for 2 min.\nAdd 1 mL fibroblast medium, suspend MEFs and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 g.",
    "Suspend MEFs with modified HBSS buffer (Negative control, NC) or labeling solution without hoechst (modified HBSS buffer with 1 μM calcein and 1 mM CoCl2) at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL and incubate for 15 min protected from light at 37°C. The negative control is used to set up the MoFlo Astrios instrument with appropriate photomultiplier tubes (PMT) voltages refer to the guidelines for the use of flow cytometry (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nAfter incubation, labeled cells were washed with 1 mL modified HBSS buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 g and washed for twice to remove residual dye and minimize fluorescent background.\nSort the high and low mPTP opening cells\nTiming: [2–4 h]\nResuspend MEFs to 2% BSA in DPBS buffer and sort the mPTP opening cells according to calcein fluorescence intensity. Before sorting, we need to prepare the tubes with medium to collect the sorted cells. We also need to prepare the gelatin-coated 12-well plate for cell attachment after the sorting.\nCritical: The 12-well plate must be coated with gelatin otherwise many cells will die.\nSet the sorting parameters of flow cytometry with 488 nm excitation. We first gate the appropriate cells with signal cells and without debris (gate R1 and R2) and go to G2. And then in G2 we gate the low (R3) and high (R4) calcein fluorescence intensity cells (mean fluorescence intensity of high is about 10 times more than that of low) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/692-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The sorting parameters of flow cytometry\nWe first gate the appropriate cells with signal cells and without debris (gate R1 and R2) and go to G2. And then in G2 we gate the low (R3) and high (R4) calcein fluorescence intensity cells.",
    "Sort the cells with low and high calcein fluorescence intensity indicating high and low mPTP opening, respectively.\nPerform the reprogramming\nTiming: [18 days]\nPlate high and low mPTP opening cells to 12-well plate and incubate for 12 h for cell attachment.\nInfect the cells with SKOM retroviruses as described previous (In Prepare Viruses section and Prepare Cells section of Reprogramming cells)\nCount the efficiency of reprogramming at day 15. The reprogramming efficiency was determined by counting GFP-positive iPSC colonies."
