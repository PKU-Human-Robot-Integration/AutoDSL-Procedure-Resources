    "1. C. elegans husbandry\nNOTE: See C. elegans maintenance protocol16 and Elgin et al.32 for more detail. C. elegans strains can be easily acquired from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (https://cgc.umn.edu) and are shipped through regular mail to any location in the US. Each strain costs $10, and each lab/user pays an annual fee of $30.\nUsing sterile technique, prepare 6 cm nematode growth medium agar plates (NGM agar plates).\n\tNOTE: Poured plates can be stored upside down in their original plastic sleeves or airtight containers at 4 °C for several months.\n\t\nTo make NGM agar plates, add 3 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of Bacto peptone, 20 g of NGM agar, and ddH2O to 1 L (~975 mL). Autoclave the media using a liquid cycle that holds at 121 °C for 20 min. Let cool to 55 °C, and using sterile technique, add 1 mL of cholesterol, 0.5 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4, and 25 mL of 1 M Potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6).\n\t\tNOTE: To make 1 M Potassium phosphate buffer, mix 108.3 g of KH2PO4 (monobasic) and 35.6 g of K2HPO4 (dibasic); if needed, adjust pH to 6 using KOH. Add ddH2O up to 1 L (usually ~900 mL) and autoclave for 40 min at 121 °C. 1 L of NGM makes about 100 plates containing 10 mL each. \nUsing a serological or transfer pipet, spot the plates with three drops of E.coli OP50 bacterial cultures (~150 µL). Try to spot in the center of the plate and avoid placing spots too close to the plate edges; this will discourage the animals from crawling up the sides of the plates and desiccating.",
    "Once the bacterial lawn dries, store the spotted plates upside down at room temperature (RT) for up to 2 weeks. Spotting plates at least 1-2 days before using will allow the bacterial lawns to grow thicker and support a higher density of animals.\n\tNOTE: To prepare OP50 bacterial cultures, OP50 can be ordered from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. OP50 bacteria is streaked from a glycerol stock onto an LB plate to ensure single colonies and kept at 4 °C for 4-6 weeks. OP50 bacterial cultures are grown in LB overnight at 37 °C from a single colony – no shaking is needed. To prepare LB media, add 10 g of Tryptone, 10 g of NaCl, 5 g of yeast extract, 950 mL of ddH2O, adjust the pH to 7 with 10 N NaOH and adjust the final volume to 1 L with ddH2O. Aliquot into 100-mL amounts and autoclave for 20 min at 121 °C.\nTo create a working stock for each strain, pick three L4-stage hermaphrodites onto a spotted NGM plate. Store the plates at 15-25 °C. The standard culturing condition is 20 °C. If access to temperature-controlled incubators is not available, maintain the cultures on the bench top at RT.\n\tNOTE: L4-stage hermaphrodites can be easily staged both by size (smaller than adults) and the presence of a distinct half circle halfway through their bodies (the developing vulva). At 20 °C, animals will reach the L4 stage 34-46 h after hatching (which is about 40-52 h after embryos are laid). See Corsi et al.14 for more details about the timing of developmental stages.",
    "Shift the cultures to various temperatures to control the rate of development. Animals will grow faster at higher temperatures and slower at lower temperatures. They will start to become sterile at temperatures higher than 25 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: Some mutant genotypes are temperature-sensitive and will display different phenotypes depending on the culturing temperature.\nMaintain the working stocks by picking three L4-stage hermaphrodites to a new spotted NGM plate every 4 days. Doing so will ensure a constant, well-fed population with a wide range of developmental stages.\n2. Gonad dissection\nCollecting age-matched adults: 12-24 hours before dissection, pick L4-stage hermaphrodites to a new spotted NGM plate – these grow into young adults the following day, which is ideal for dissection. The number of L4-stage hermaphrodites will depend on the cytological analysis being performed; usually, 10-20 hermaphrodites are dissected per slide, with two to four slides generated per condition.\n\tNOTE: Gonads are most efficiently extruded in well-fed animals. Be sure to pick L4 hermaphrodites from working stocks that are not starved (i.e., still have a visible bacterial lawn present on the plate). Starved animals tend to undergo incomplete gonad extrusions, making them difficult to visualize.\n\t\nIf assessing later stages of meiosis, like diakinesis, dissect older adults (48 h post-L4) because they accumulate more diakinesis-stage nuclei, simplifying analysis. However, researchers should note the possibility that some effects may be caused by advanced maternal age.\nPrepare for dissection.\n\t\nPrepare M9: Add 3 g of KH2PO4 (monobasic), 6 g of Na2HPO4 (dibasic), 5 g of NaCl, and add ddH2O to 100 mL. Autoclave the solution for 20 min at 121 °C, let it cool, and then add 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4 using sterile technique.",
    "Prepare dissecting buffer: Mix 1 µL of 10% Tween 20, 12 µL of 100 mM levamisole, 10 µL of 10x M9, and 77 µL of ddH2O.\n\t\tNOTE: Tween 20 is included in the dissecting buffer to reduce surface tension and further permeabilize tissue membranes.\nPrepare fix solution (2% PFA [100 µL]): Mix 12.5 µL of 16% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 10 µL of 10x M9, and 77.5 µL of ddH2O; be sure to use a fresh ampule of PFA (opened for no longer than 2 weeks).\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is a hazardous chemical, and fix solution should be prepared in the fume hood.\nSet up the freezing method-liquid nitrogen is easier to manage, but if necessary, an aluminum block can be used atop dry ice.\n\t\t\nLiquid nitrogen method: Set a plastic beaker or a plastic Coplin jar in a polystyrene box. Fill the beaker with liquid nitrogen (overflow into the polystyrene container is fine). Set the tweezers nearby. Ideally, the beaker should be narrow enough to prevent microscope slides from falling completely horizontal-slides should lie at a tilt and be easy to grab with tweezers.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is important to use plastic containers when working with liquid nitrogen rather than glass to avoid shattering due to rapid cooling.\nDry ice method:\n\t\t\t\nPlace a flat aluminum block on dry ice in a polystyrene container or rectangular ice bucket. It is easier to freeze the slides if the top of the block sits above the top of the container.\nWearing gloves, press down gently on the aluminum block to ensure good contact with dry ice and hasten the cooling process (it may release a screech as the metal cools rapidly). Set a razor blade nearby.",
    "Leave the aluminum block on dry ice for at least 30 min prior to freeze-crack stop to allow full cool-down, which is necessary for a quick freeze.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Ideally, solid blocks of dry ice should be used, which helps the surface remain level. If necessary, aluminum block can be placed on dry ice pellets, but care should be taken to ensure that the surface remains level.\nThe surface of the aluminum block will collect frost, which can prevent close contact between the slides and the block. Use the razor blade to scrape frost off the surface, clearing an area for each slide. Covering the polystyrene container with a lid will help to prevent excessive frost accumulation.\nFill a Coplin jar with ~40 mL of 95% ethanol.\nFill three Coplin jars with ~40 mL of PBS-T.\n\t\tNOTE: To make PBS-T, mix 100 mL of 10x PBS, 5 mL of Triton X-100, and 2 mL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8). Add 873 mL of ddH2O. Shake vigorously to dissolve Triton X-100. To make 10x PBS, mix 25.6 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O, 80 g of NaCl, 2 g of KCl, and 2 g of KH2PO4. Add ddH2O to bring the volume up to 1 L. Autoclave for 40 min at 121°C. The detergent Triton X-100 is included in the wash buffer PBS-T to reduce surface tension and enhance retention of whole-mounted animals on the slide.\nDissect the animals on an 18 mm x 18 mm glass coverslip. This step is time-sensitive due to the evaporation of the dissecting buffer. It should take less than 5 min to finish dissections.",
    "NOTE: Levamisole is used to immobilize animals to make them easier to dissect, but leaving them in levamisole for too long will result in poor gonad extrusion. It is easiest to reduce the number of animals dissected per slide in order to fit within the 5 min time frame.\n\t\nPlace a holding slide on the stage of a dissecting microscope-the holding slide is used to move the coverslip around more easily, and can be reused indefinitely (Figure 2A, left photo).\nPlace the coverslip on top of the holding slide and pipet 4 µL of the dissecting solution into the center of the coverslip. Move the holding slide to one side of the stage to free up the view.\nPick 10-20 hermaphrodites into the drop of dissecting solution. Choose enough animals to image ~10 per slide, but not so many that they cannot be dissected within 5 min.\nDissect the animals using two syringe needles, one for each hand (Figure 2A).\n\t\t\nCross the points of the needles to make an X-shape and use the bottom of the X to pin an adult down to the surface of the coverslip.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It can take practice to discover the best way to hold each needle in terms of angle and rotation. Start by holding the needles with their bevels (slanted edge) facing down. See the discussion for suggestions on first learning to dissect in a larger volume (Figure 2D).\nPosition the X-shape immediately behind the pharynx, about 1/5 of the body length of a young adult, or just below the clear part of the head (Figure 2A, right diagram).",
    "Decapitate the animal with one scissoring motion (like slicing food with a knife and fork). A good extrusion will result in one arm of the gonad (or sometimes both arms) releasing fully from the body cavity, along with one or both halves of the gut (Figure 2B, left image). The gut will appear darker and of uniform width, while the gonad will appear clear with a distal tapered tip.\n\t\t\t\nEach animal should only be cut once; if the gonad does not extrude after making the cut, just move onto the next animal. The first cut significantly reduces the hydrostatic pressure in the body, which makes any further cuts unlikely to result in a better extrusion. Incomplete or poor extrusions are readily visible while imaging and can be ignored (Figure 2B, right image).\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Do not attempt to separate the gonad from the carcass-doing so will usually tear the tissue and limit the number of meiotic stages that can be analyzed.\nRepeat the dissection for the remaining animals on the cover slip.\nFix the sample with formaldehyde.\n\t\nWorking gently, pipet 4 µL of the fix solution on the coverslip very close to the drop with animals. Ideally, the drops are close enough to merge; avoid pipetting directly into the dissection drop and displacing the dissected carcasses.\nPin the coverslip to the holding slide using one finger. With the other hand, gently flick the coverslip a few times to mix the drops. The final fix concentration is 0.8% PFA.\nHolding a positively charged slide front-side down, use it to pick up the coverslip in the center of the slide. Gently touch the sample drop, and surface tension of the drop will pick up the coverslip.",
    "NOTE: Positively charged slides have an electrostatic coating that helps tissues adhere to the surface to prevent sample loss.\n\t\t\nIf desired, position the coverslip diagonally, such that one corner hangs off the top or bottom edge of the slide by 1 mm. Leaving an overhang will make it easier to crack the coverslip off after freezing (Figure 2C).\nSet the slide on the bench and fix for exactly 5 min at RT. During this time, label the slide with a pencil.\n\t\tNOTE: It is common to over-fix the samples, which can be detected by an exclusion of antibody from nuclei or even all tissues. Additionally, some antibodies are particularly sensitive to formaldehyde. In these cases, reduce the fixation time, or decrease the final concentration of formaldehyde used.\nFreeze-crack\n\t\nImmediately after the fix, freeze the slides.\n\t\t\nIf using liquid nitrogen: Hold the labeled edge of the slide with tweezers and gently lower it into liquid nitrogen. Release the slide such that it leans against the side of the beaker, coverslip-side up. Slides are frozen within 10 s (once the liquid stops boiling).\nIf using dry ice: scrape the frost off the surface of the aluminum block with a razor. Firmly hold the labeled edge of the slide and set it on the cleared surface, applying some pressure downward to ensure full contact with the block. The coverslip should be completely on the block surface. Freezing occurs within 10 s and can be visually confirmed as the sample under the coverslip turns to ice.\nFor both methods, leave the slides for at least 5 min to fully freeze.",
    "NOTE: Once frozen, the slides can be left in liquid nitrogen or on the block for 15-20 min, as long as they remain frozen. This allows multiple slides to be collected at this stage before proceeding to the cracking step.\nWorking quickly, crack the coverslip off the sample. This step is time-sensitive. Remove the coverslip and immerse the slide in ethanol before the sample starts to thaw.\n\t\t\nRemove the frozen slide (using tweezers for liquid nitrogen).\nFirmly grip the slide's labeled short edge and brace one long edge against the bench.\nWith the other hand, firmly grip a razor, and slide the razor's edge down the slide to flick the coverslip off and away from the sample. This step is slightly easier if the coverslip is positioned with a corner overhang (Figure 2C).\nImmediately place the slide in a Coplin jar containing 95% ethanol at RT. Leave the slides in ethanol for at least 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Slides can be left in ethanol for a while-this allows multiple slides to be collected at this step before proceeding onto washes. Slides can also be stored at this step for several days. If storing, move the Coplin jar of slides in ethanol to -20 °C.\nWash the slides in PBS-T three times for 5 min each at RT. Use fresh PBS-T for each wash.\nIf staining with antibodies, proceed to step 3 (antibody staining). If only staining with DAPI to visualize chromosomes, proceed to step 4 (mounting and imaging).\n3. Antibody staining\nPrimary antibody incubation",
    "NOTE: When working out appropriate conditions for new antibodies, it is important to include the following negative controls to verify the specificity of the fluorescent signal: 1) A slide that lacks a primary antibody and has a secondary antibody only; 2) a slide with a primary antibody only that lacks a secondary antibody. Each of these negative controls should produce a complete lack of signal. If fluorescence is identified on the secondary antibody-only slide, the secondary antibody dilution should be increased or a different secondary should be used. If fluorescence is identified on the primary antibody-only slide, it is likely due to autofluorescence or other potential contaminants.\n\t\nDilute the primary antibody in antibody dilution buffer (50 mg of BSA + 50 µL of 10% sodium azide + 10 mL of PBS-T ) - prepare enough antibody dilution to use 20-30 µL per slide.\nPrepare a humid chamber: Line the bottom of a plastic container with an airtight lid with damp paper towels. Lay a single layer of glass Pasteur pipets on top of the paper towels. These pipets create a surface that allows the slides to stay level and keeps them elevated off the paper towels.\n\t\tNOTE: For humid chambers, it is best to use plastic food storage containers with snap lids, which makes it easier to open and close the container without disrupting the slides within. Look for one that is long enough for the Pasteur pipets but also has a relatively flat bottom without indentations to allow the slides to rest fully horizontal.\nRemove the slide from the final PBS-T wash. Work quickly from this step forward to keep the sample wet at all times and avoid evaporation. If the sample dries out, antibody staining will be negatively affected.",
    "Dry the entire surface of the slide using a wiping tissue folded into a compact rectangle. Wipe down the front and back of the slide, but leave plenty of space around the sample. Take special care when drying the surface near the sample-avoid getting too close to the sample, which leaves an area about the size of the coverslip undried. However, ensure that the perimeter of the sample is dry for the next step.\nDraw a circle around the sample using a hydrophobic PAP pen. Use care to enclose the entire sample area, but avoid disrupting animal carcasses visible on the surface of the slide. Wait for ~5 s to allow the barrier to dry completely.\n\t\tNOTE: A hydrophobic barrier is necessary to contain the primary antibody solution because the surface of the slide has been coated in PBS-T, which contains a detergent. The PAP pen works best on a dry slide surface, so it is important to create a dry perimeter around the sample. Leaving the area closest to the sample undried protects the sample during this step\nWorking quickly, use the corner or edge of the folded wiping tissue to wick liquid away from the sample within the hydrophobic barrier. Take care to avoid disrupting animal carcasses.\nImmediately pipet 20 µL of the primary antibody solution into the ring created by the hydrophobic barrier. Take care to pipet gently and at an angle to prevent disrupting carcasses. Avoid pipetting directly upon any carcass.\nTilt the slide gently to ensure that the entire surface within the hydrophobic barrier is covered by the solution.",
    "NOTE: It is best if the hydrophobic barriers have an interior circumference of 1-1.5 cm, which is fully covered by 20 µL of the antibody solution. The circumference width will depend upon how the carcasses are distributed during the freeze-crack step. Wider barriers may require a higher volume of antibody solution. If desired, small squares of parafilm (cut to the size of the 18 mm x 18 mm coverslip) can be gently placed on top of the sample. The parafilm squares will ensure that the antibody solution covers the entire sample and will also help to prevent evaporation.\nRepeat steps 3.1.3-3.1.8 for the remainder of the slides.\nCarefully transfer the slides to the humid chamber, ensuring that the solution remains contained within the hydrophobic barrier and that slides are resting completely level.\nIncubate the slides overnight at RT. Depending on the antibody, this step could be shortened to 6 h or performed overnight at 4 °C by keeping the humid chamber in a cold room or a refrigerator.\n\t\tNOTE: Using a humid chamber and hydrophobic barriers is usually sufficient to prevent evaporation of the antibody solution, even for long overnight incubations. However, if evaporation proves to be a problem, small squares of parafilm can be placed gently upon each sample, which will help prevent evaporation. These can be removed in the first wash step: immerse each slide in a Coplin jar filled with PBS-T (containing no other slides), and allow the parafilm to float away from the sample. Remove the parafilm from the Coplin jar before using the same jar to remove the parafilm from the next slide.\nWash the slides in Coplin jars containing ~40 mL of PBS-T three times for 5 min each at RT. Use fresh PBS-T for each wash.",
    "During these washes, dilute the secondary antibody in antibody dilution buffer. Prepare enough antibody dilution to use 20-30 µL per slide. It is common to use Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies diluted at 1:200.\nSecondary antibody incubation\n\t\nRemove the slide from the final PBS-T wash. Work quickly from this step forward to keep the sample wet at all times and avoid evaporation.\nDry the slide using a folded wiping tissue. Avoid drying the area contained by the hydrophobic barrier.\nWorking quickly, use the corner or edge of the folded wiping tissue to wick liquid away from the sample within the hydrophobic barrier. Take care to avoid disrupting the animal carcasses.\nImmediately pipet 20 µL of the secondary antibody solution into the ring created by the hydrophobic barrier. Take care to pipet gently and at an angle to prevent disrupting the carcasses.\nAvoid pipetting directly upon any carcass. Ensure that the entire surface within the hydrophobic barrier is covered by the solution. Wider barrier circumferences may require a higher volume of antibody solution. If desired, cover the sample with a small square of parafilm (see the note below step 3.1.8).\nCarefully transfer the slide to the humid chamber, ensuring that the solution remains contained within the hydrophobic barrier and that the slide is resting completely level. Replace the lid on the humid chamber to keep the slide in the dark.\nRepeat steps 3.3.1-3.3.6 for the remainder of the slides.\nIncubate in the dark for 4 h at RT.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the antibody, this step can be shortened to 2 h or extended to 6 h. If the humid chamber is not dark, place it in a drawer or cover it with a cardboard box. Alternatively, the humid chamber can be wrapped in aluminum foil to keep the slides in the dark.\nWash the slides in Coplin jars containing ~40 mL of PBS-T three times for 5 min each at RT. Use fresh PBS-T for each wash.\n4. Mounting and imaging\nPrepare for mounting the sample by having mounting medium + DAPI (2 µg/mL), 18 mm x 18 mm glass coverslips, and nail polish within reach.\nRemove the slide from the final wash and dry using a folded wiping tissue. Avoid drying the area contained by the hydrophobic barrier.\nUsing the corner of the folded wiping tissue, carefully wick away liquid from the sample inside the barrier. Remove most liquid at this step, but without letting the carcasses dry out completely.\nWorking quickly, add 8 µL of the mounting medium to the sample. Pipet gently and at an angle to prevent disrupting the carcasses. Avoid pipetting directly upon the carcasses.\nStill working quickly, carefully lower a glass coverslip onto the sample.\n\t\nAir bubbles can disrupt imaging and lead to sample degradation. To minimize air bubbles, rest one edge of the coverslip on the slide next to the sample, so it is held at diagonal over the sample. It can help to rest the higher edge of the coverslip on a pencil or tweezers. Then slowly lower the higher edge of the coverslip down-this movement allows the mounting medium to create a liquid seal progressing from one edge to the opposite edge.\nRepeat steps 4.2-4.5 for the remainder of the slides.",
    "Seal the coverslips with nail polish. Take care to avoid pressing down upon the coverslip (which will crush the sample) or dislodging the coverslip horizontally (which will smear the sample).\n\t\nAdd a small dot of nail polish to each corner of a coverslip (~1 mm wide). These will help hold the coverslip in place. Allow the dots to dry completely.\nWhen the corners are completely dry, seal the edges with nail polish. Ensure that the polish completely fills the gap between the coverslip and slide, but avoid covering the coverslip the sample too much. It is best to maintain a 1 mm overlap onto the coverslip. Only use as much nail polish as is needed. Avoid using too much or having excess polish, which can take a long time to dry and runs the risk of damaging the microscope objective.\n\t\tNOTE: It is preferable to use colored nail polish instead of clear, which makes it easier to see the boundary of the seal and helps prevent imaging animals that lie under the nail polish boundary.\nAllow the nail polish to dry completely before imaging. This step is important, as wet nail polish can severely damage microscope objectives.\n\t\tNOTE: Slides should be kept in the dark as much as possible from here on out. Use a flat cardboard box to cover them as they dry on the bench.\nStore the slides in the dark at 4 °C for 1-2 weeks before imaging. If needed, store the slides at -20 °C for a longer duration.\nImage using standard fluorescence compound light microscopy.",
    "For each slide, first, examine the entire sample at 10x in the DAPI channel to identify well-extruded gonads and note their placement. For most applications, avoid imaging any gonads that are severed, incomplete, or partially covered by another part of the animal. For most animals, only one gonad arm will be fully extruded and visible.\n\t\tNOTE: It can be helpful to take a lower-magnification image at 10x of the entire gonad in the DAPI channel to use for later orientation or identify the location of specific nuclei.\nDepending on the application, images can be taken at 40x, 63x, or 100x. If the entire gonad is to be captured, create a montage with overlapping boundaries. While imaging, remember that the gonad is a hollow tube, with nuclei most dense at the top and bottom."
