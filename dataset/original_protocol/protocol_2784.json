The average dose rate\n        was calculated to be 282 cGy/min using an ionization chamber.\n      \nDeliver right and left lateral fields.\nAlternatives: Other image-guided\n      small animal irradiation platforms can be used if an X-Rad 225cx is not\n      available.\n    \nNote: Image-guided setups that use focal\n      beams, rather than beams that cover the entire head, are likely needed to\n      achieve high doses such as 10 Gy × 3 without causing significant toxicity\n      to the salivary glands. We have found that a parallel opposed beam\n      configuration optimizes brainstem coverage while sparing the salivary\n      glands.\n    \nNote: Radiation treatment dosimetry should\n      be confirmed using metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor\n      (MOSFET) in collaboration with institutional Radiation Safety officers.",
    "Optional step: Derivation of cell lines from primary mouse brainstem\n      gliomas\n    \nTiming: Approximately 4 h\n    \n      This section describes the procedure for deriving cell lines from mouse\n      brainstem gliomas generated as described above. Such cell lines can be\n      used to confirm floxed allele recombination in neoplastic cells from the\n      primary tumor. Additionally, such cell lines can be used to examine the\n      biology of mouse in primary brainstem gliomas using in vitro assays\n      such as clonogenic survival assays to examine the effects of specific\n      genotypes or perturbagens on primary mouse brainstem glioma cells.\n    \n        Remove tumor, place in PBS, cut up into small pieces, and transfer to a\n        15 mL tube.\n      \n        Sterile filter papain solution.\n        \n            Before filtering, vortex the solution, incubate at 37°C for a few\n            minutes, then vortex again.\n          \n            Use a 0.2 μm filter for sterile filter, then incubate at RT for\n            30 min to activate (active for 1 h).\n          \n        Aspirate PBS off of tumor tissue, then resuspend in 5 mL papain + 30 μL\n        DNase.\n      \nTriturate 30× with a 5 mL pipet.\n        Incubate for 15 min at 37°C.\n        \n            During this incubation time, prepare and sterile filter the\n            ovomucoid solution.\n          \nUse a 0.2 μm filter for sterile filter.\nTriturate tissue 30× with a 5 mL pipet.\nAdd 2 mL of ovo solution, then invert.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 162 × g.\nAspirate supernatant.\nAdd 500 μL of ovo to pellet, then triturate with P1000 30×.\nAdd 5 mL Neurocult (basal).\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 48 × g.\nCollect supernatant, if desired, into a 50 mL conical tube.\nRepeat steps 50–53, two more times (not necessary).\n        Resuspend pellet in Neurocult complete media and strain through a cell\n        strainer to remove clumps of cells and tissue that did not dissociate.\n      \n        Combine with supernatant collected from the three spins if desired (will",

Many cell lines will not\n      result in established cultures that are capable of indefinite\n      self-renewal. Growth rates of cell lines can be variable. Early passage\n      cell lines likely contain non-neoplastic brain parenchymal cells, which\n      disappear from the culture over time.\n    \nNote: Mouse brainstem glioma cell lines\n      can also be cultured as neurospheres, which may more faithfully model\n      certain aspects of tumor biology. To do so, cells should be cultured in\n      Neurosphere Media and routinely passaged by dissociating the cells.\n      Neurosphere Media contains Neurocult with the following additives: 10%\n      Proliferation Supplements, 20 ng/mL EGF, 10 ng/mL bFGF, 2 μg/mL Heparin.\n    \nNote: If using the cells for FACS, do not\n      combine with the supernatant; if using for cell culture, you can combine\n      with the supernatant, but change media out soon after to get rid of all\n      the dead cells/debris in your culture.\n    \nNote: For continuous culture as adherent\n      cells, brainstem glioma cell lines can be passaged using Adherent Cell\n      Media, which is identical to DF1 cell media (DMEM 10% FBS 1% Pen/Strep 1%\n      L-Glutamine) using the same techniques to continuously grow, trypsinize,\n      and passage the cells.\n    \nOptional step: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nTiming: Approximately 6 h\n    \n      This section describes the procedure for conducting a polymerase chain\n      reaction and gel electrophoresis on genomic DNA isolated from mouse tails\n      or from cell lines derived from the mouse tumors.
