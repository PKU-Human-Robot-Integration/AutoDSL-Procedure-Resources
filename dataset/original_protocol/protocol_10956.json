    "All experimental procedures described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Meiji University (IACUC 14-0002(1)). Animals used in the representative results were prepared as follows: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from a laboratory animal company and housed in groups of 4 animals per standard rat cage (W200 × D410 × H250 mm) for at least one week before the start of the behavioral experiment. The animal housing room was maintained at standard ambient conditions for light (12:12 light/dark schedule with lights on at 10:00 h), room temperature (25.0 ± 0.5 °C), humidity (55 ± 10%), and ventilation (10 times/h), and animals had ad libitum access to food (Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and water. The animals were kept in a standard rat cage (W410 x D250 x H200 mm, Toyoriko Co., Ltd., Aichi, Japan) with paper bedding (alpha-dri, LSG Corporatin, Tokyo, Japan).\n1. Elevated Plus Maze Test\nSet up the elevated plus maze apparatus in a customized container (W1,500 × D1,500 × H2,000 mm) (Figure 1A) with a plus-shaped metal framework 500 mm above the floor to support the run way arms (Figure 1B), lighting in the container ceiling to illuminate the surface of the maze to the required light intensity (Figure 1C), and a digital video camera in the center ceiling to enable live video monitoring of the behavioral tests (Figure 1C).\nFix the arms (L500 x W100 mm) on the plus-shaped framework, and then fix the square central platform (W100 x D100 mm) at the center of the four arms (Figure 1D - F).",
    "NOTE: In our laboratory, we have two types of open arms (L500 x W100 mm) and two types of closed arms (L500 x W100 x H450 mm) (Figure 1D). The closed arms have either transparent or opaque walls (Figure 1D), and the open arms are designed with or without a short ledge (H5 mm, Figure 1E). The square central platform (W100 × D100 mm) is placed at center of the four arms (Figure 1D - F). Thus, the following four combinations of arms can be prepared according to experimental purpose: open arms with ledges + closed arms with transparent walls (Ledges/Transparent), open arms with ledges + closed arms with opaque walls (Ledges/Opaque), open arms without ledges + closed arms with transparent walls (No-Ledges/Transparent), and open arms without ledges + closed arms with opaque walls (No-Ledges/Opaque). The surface of the arm runway is black, to enable better animal tracing by the automated behavior analysis software, as described in Section 2, Behavioral Analysis.\nAdjust lighting intensity on the surface of the distal end part of each arm and central platform to approximately 100 Lux.\nBefore each test, clean the entire apparatus with 70% ethanol solution and wipe with distilled water.\nClick the \"record button\" on the hard disk recorder to start the digital video camera that will record the rat's behavior for the video imaging analysis described in Section 2, Behavioral Analysis.\nPlace an animal on the central platform facing an open arm and allow free exploration on the apparatus for 5 min.\nClick the \"stop button\" on the hard disk recorder to finish the recording.\nCount the number of feces and urinations after returning the tested animal to the animal housing room.\nRepeat from step 1.4 until the end of the experiment.",
    "NOTE: A dry test run is always carried out before starting each experiment to check that all the experimental settings are correctly set up before any experimental animals are exposed to the experimental conditions. Otherwise, some animals, especially the first animal may experience different environmental conditions (e.g., noises possibly induced by the experimenter during manipulation and/or animal cues possibly left by the previously tested animal).\n\tNOTE: The experimenters are near the container when an animal is being tested. Thus, even though the experimenters are not visible the rat may still be able to sense them via smell and/or sound.\n2. Behavioral Analysis\nNote: Behavioral analysis is performed by manual observation and automated analysis software.\nManual observation\nAfter the animal is placed on the ledge, observe the following: number of entries (an entry onto an arm is defined as any instance when all 4 paws are on the arm), time spent on each arm, and number of stretched-attending postures facing an open arm, while backing off the central platform towards a closed arm.\nMeasure duration and frequency of the behaviors defined above by stopwatch and count for 5 min, starting from when the doors of the container are closed.\nAutomated analysis\nUsing the available software program, record the following: distance traveled, time spent in different positions on open arms (proximal, middle, and distal segments from the central platform), and a minute-by-minute analysis of the time spent on open and closed arms.\nClick the \"start button\" of the automated analysis software at the same time as the manual observation begins (the recording will stop automatically if recording duration is set).",
    "NOTE: The behavioral analysis software used in this study tracks the animal via its contrast with the background field; the animal, which is assigned a fixed size, is identified as the brighter object and the locomotion of its center point can thus be used for animal tracking.\nSubscription Required.
