    "The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Jichi Medical University and performed in accordance with the Jichi Medical University Guide for Laboratory Animals and its guidelines concerning the use and care of experimental animals. This protocol uses four 50-week-old SAMR1 male mice and SAMP1 male mice (40-45 g).\n1. Serum sample collection\nPrepare the following for each mouse: 30 G needles with a 1.0 mL syringe, a 1.0 mL spitz centrifugation tube with heparin, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, isoflurane anesthetic, a cork sheet, 70% ethanol, two cotton swabs moistened with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), a Petri dish with PBS, tweezers, and surgical scissors.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 1.5% isoflurane and maintain at 1.5%. Administer an analgesic (Meloxicam 5 mg/kg) subcutaneously, then inject 1.0 mL of 70% ethanol into its abdomen and place it in the supine position on the cork sheet.\nConfirm the depth of anesthesia by the disappearance of the pedal withdrawal reflex. With the tweezers and surgical scissors, incise the skin of the abdomen. Cut the muscles and the peritoneal membrane from the bladder to the lower-left edge of the ribs.\nUse the tweezers to lift the peritoneal membrane, and make a lateral incision in the upper edge of the peritoneal membrane with the surgical scissors. Continue the incision along the lowest edge of the ribs.\nIdentify the inferior vena cava by using the two PBS-moistened cotton swabs. Insert one of the 30 G needles with the 1.0 mL syringe into the inferior vena cava and then pull the syringe. Pull the needle out of the inferior vena cava slowly to avoid hemolysis. Transfer the blood to the 1.0 mL spitz tube with heparin and then mix it by inverting the tube several times. \n\tNOTE: The mouse is euthanized by cervical dislocation.",
    "Spin the spitz tube at room temperature (RT), 3,000 × g for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant slowly, make sure that it does not contain sediment, and then transfer it to an unused 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nStore the tube at −80 °C before use.\n\t​NOTE: If proceeding to Step 3 immediately, the tube does not need to be stored at −80 °C.\n2. Kidney sample collection\nPrepare the following for each mouse: 2.0 mL cryotubes, isoflurane anesthetic, a cork sheet, 70% ethanol, a Petri dish with PBS, tweezers, and surgical scissors.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 1.5% isoflurane and maintain at 1.5%. Administer an analgesic (Meloxicam 5 mg/kg) subcutaneously, then inject 1.0 mL of 70% ethanol into its abdomen, and place it in the supine position on the cork sheet.\nConfirm the depth of anesthesia by the disappearance of the pedal withdrawal reflex. Use the tweezers and the surgical scissors to make an incision in the abdominal skin. Cut the muscles and peritoneal membrane from the bladder to the lower-left edge of the ribs.\nUse the tweezers to lift the peritoneal membrane and make a lateral incision in the peritoneal membrane's upper edge with the surgical scissors. Continue the incision along the lowest edge of the ribs.\nIdentify the left kidney. Reflux it with PBS to flush the blood from the vessels until the kidney turns a yellowish-white color. Excise the entire kidney first using surgical scissors to sever the left renal artery and vein. Place the kidney in a Petri dish and wash it carefully with PBS. \n\tNOTE: The mouse is euthanized by cervical dislocation.",
    "Use the tweezers and the surgical scissors to cut the kidney into 10 mg samples (10 mg is a suitable sample size for the next step). Place each sample of the kidney in its own 2.0 mL cryotube. Close the tube's cap.\nFor long-term storage, transfer each cryotube to liquid nitrogen and store it at −80 °C.\n3. Total RNA extraction from a serum sample\nPrepare the following items first: a vortex mixer, phenol/guanidine-based lysis reagent, 80% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 100% chloroform, biopolymer spin columns (in 2.0 mL collection tubes11), membrane-anchored spin columns (in 2.0 mL collection tubes11), wash buffer #1 (i.e., wash buffer containing guanidine and 100% ethanol in a ratio of 1:2), wash buffer #2 (i.e., wash buffer containing guanidine and 100% ethanol in a ratio of 1:4), RNase-free water, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, and 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nFirst, take a 200 µL serum sample in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and then add 1,000 µL of the phenol/guanidine-based lysis reagent. Vortex the mixture for 5 s.\nIncubate the sample at RT for 5 min.\nAdd 200 µL of chloroform to the serum sample in the tube and close the tube cap tightly. Invert the tube 15x to mix the chloroform and the serum sample.\nEach sample is incubated at RT for 3 min. Next, spin the sample at 4 °C for 15 min at 12,000 x g.\nTransfer the 300 µL of supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the pellet. Add 450 µL of 100% ethanol, and vortex the tube for 5 s.\n\tNOTE: In all the following steps, place the membrane-anchored spin column for the separation of RNA and DNA in a 2.0 mL collection tube to centrifuge it.",
    "Then, remove 700 µL of the sample, load it onto a membrane-anchored spin column, and close the cap. Spin the column at RT for 15 s at 8,000 × g, and leave the supernatant in the column. Discard the pellet remaining in the collection tube.\nAdd 700 µL of wash buffer #1 which is part of the serum/plasma kit (see the Table of Materials) to the membrane-anchored spin column to clean the sample thoroughly.

Discard the pellet in the collection tube.\nSpin the membrane-anchored spin column again at RT for 5 min at 15,000 × g.\nAfter transferring the membrane-anchored spin column to a new 1.5 mL collection tube, add 14 µL of RNase-free water to the column to dissolve the total RNA. After closing the column cap, wait 5 min with the tube left at RT. Spin the column again for 1 min at 15,000 × g at RT.\nStore the tubes with samples at −80 °C before use.\n4. Extraction of total RNA from a kidney sample",
    "Prepare the following items first: a silicon homogenizer, ice, a vortex mixer, 100% ethanol, 100% chloroform, biopolymer spin columns (in 2.0 mL collection tubes11), membrane-anchored spin columns (in 2.0 mL collection tubes11), phenol/guanidine-based lysis reagent, wash buffer #1 (the same buffer as Step 3.1.), wash buffer #2 (the same buffer as Step 3.1.), RNase-free water, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, and 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nPlace a 10 mg kidney sample in the silicon homogenizer, and add 700 µL of the phenol/guanidine-based lysis reagent.\nSet up the homogenizer. Gently press and twist the homogenizer's pestle against the kidney sample to homogenize the sample. Continue to press and twist the pestle until the kidney sample is completely homogenized in the phenol/guanidine-based lysis reagent.\nFor further homogenization, take the homogenized lysate (in a 2.0 mL collection tube) and transfer it to a biopolymer spin column.\nCentrifuge the homogenized lysate at RT for 3 min at 14,000 × g and then transfer the entire precipitated pellet to an unused 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to invert the precipitated pellet\nMix the pellet with 140 µL of chloroform in the tube; then, close the tube cap tightly. Invert the tube 15x to mix the lysate and chloroform.\n\tNOTE: The chloroform can be used safely without a hood.\nIncubate the sample at RT for 2-3 min. Centrifuge the sample at 4 °C for 15 min at 12,000 × g.\nTransfer the supernatant (which is usually ~300 µL) to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, without disturbing the precipitate. Add 1.5 times its volume (which is usually ~450 µL) of 100% ethanol. Vortex the mixture for 5 s.\n\tNOTE: In all the following steps, place the membrane-anchored spin column for separating RNA and DNA in a 2.0 mL collection tube to centrifuge it.",

After closing the column's cap, wait for 5 min with the tube at RT, and then centrifuge the column for 1 min at 15,000 × g.\nTransfer the total volume of the sample containing total RNA to a new microcentrifuge tube. Place the tube on ice, and measure the total RNA concentration by spectrophotometry. Make sure that the total RNA concentration is ~300-1,500 ng/µL.\nStore tubes containing samples at −80 °C before use.\n5. Synthesis of cDNA with the reverse transcription of total RNA in serum",
    "NOTE: The minimum information for the publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments (MIQE) guidelines recommend using better experimental practices to obtain reliable, unequivocal results17. In this protocol, cDNA is synthesized from the total RNA purified in a two-step procedure using reverse transcriptase, poly(A) polymerase, and oligo-dT primers.\nPrepare the following first: a vortex mixer, a thermal cycler, eight-well strip tubes, the cap of each eight-strip tube, distilled water, ice, the reverse transcriptase kit (see the Table of Materials)13,14 in the melted state, and 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nStart the thermal cycler.\nPrepare the master mix solution; to obtain a total of 8.0 µL of master mix per eight-well strip tube, add 2.0 µL of reverse transcriptase mix (included in the kit) and 2.0 µL of 10x nucleic acid mix to 4.0 µL of reverse-transcription buffer in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPlace 8.0 µL of the master mix solution in each tube of an eight-well strip tube.\nPlace a 12 µL aliquot of total RNA in each tube of the eight-well strip tube, and close the tube's cap. Centrifuge the tube for 15 s at RT and 2,000 × g.\nPlace the tube in the thermal cycler and incubate for 60 min at 37 °C. Incubate the sample for an additional 5 min at 95 °C min to synthesize the cDNA.\nFollowing the incubation, transfer the cDNA to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Dilute the cDNA tenfold (1:10) with distilled water. Vortex and centrifuge the tube for 5 s at RT and 2,000 × g.\nStore the diluted cDNA temporarily on ice. Store the diluted samples at −80 °C before use.\n6. Synthesis of cDNA with the reverse transcription of total RNA in kidney",
    "NOTE: The MIQE guidelines encourage better experimental practices to ensure reliable and unequivocal results17. This protocol uses reverse transcriptase, poly(A) polymerase, and oligo dT primers to synthesize cDNA from 1.0 µg of purified total RNA in a two-step procedure.\nFirst, prepare the following: a vortex mixer, a thermal cycler, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, eight-well strip tubes, the cap of each eight-strip tube, distilled water, ice, and a reverse transcriptase kit (see the Table of Materials)13,14 in the melted state.\nStart the thermal cycler.\nPrepare the master mix solution; to obtain a total of 8.0 µL of master mix solution per tube, add 2.0 µL of the reverse transcriptase mix that is included in the kit and 2.0 µL of 10x nucleic acid mix to 4.0 µL of the reverse-transcription buffer.\nAdd 8.0 µL of the master mix solution to each tube of an eight-well strip tube.\nAdjust the total RNA density as follows. For the separation of 1.0 µg of total RNA from a kidney sample with 12 µL of RNase-free water, take a suitable amount of total RNA and transfer it to distilled water by using the concentration measured as described above (in Step 4.15.).\n\t​NOTE: In the presence of DNA contamination, the contaminated DNA is co-amplified by qRT-PCR.\nPerform the same process as that described above in Steps 5.5.-5.8.\n7. The qRT-PCR of miRNA\nNOTE: An intercalator method is used for the qRT-PCR of the miRNAs. Primers are used for RNA: U6 small nuclear 2 (RNU6-2), miRNA-223-3p, miRNA-423-5p, miRNA-7218-5p, and miRNA-7219-5p.",
    "Prepare the following: a vortex mixer, a real-time PCR system, a 96-well reaction plate for qRT-PCR, adhesive film for the 96-well reaction plate, adhesive film applicator, a 96-well centrifuge rotor, miRNA-specific primers, a green dye-based PCR kit containing 2x PCR master mix and 10x universal primer (see the Table of Materials)13,14, and a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nVortex the following after mixing them in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube: 6.25 µL of distilled water, 1.25 µL each of 5 µM miRNA primer dissolved in nuclease-free water, 12.5 µL of 2x PCR master mix, and 2.5 µL of 10x universal primer.\nPrepare and melt the cDNA synthesized as described in Step 5 (serum) or Step 6 (kidney). Vortex and centrifuge the cDNA for 5 s.\nTake 22.5 µL aliquots of the reagent (as described in Step 7.2. above) and place them separately in each well of the 96-well plate.\nAdd a 2.5 µL aliquot of cDNA to each well of the plate.\nTo secure the adhesive film to the plate, use the adhesive film applicator. Centrifuge the plate for 30 s at 1,000 x g in the 96-well centrifuge rotor. Stabilize the reaction at the bottom of each well.\n8. Using the real-time PCR system and software to run the PCR cycling program\nBegin the real-time PCR system. Place the plate created as described in Step 7.6. in the real-time PCR system. Modify the settings; provide a name for the experiment, and then select 96-well (0.2 mL) as the system's experiment type, Comparative CT (ΔΔCT) as the quantitation method, standard as the system run mode, and SYBR Green Reagents as the reagents for detecting the target sequence.",
    "Provide names for the sample and the target miRNAs, and name the sample and target miRNA in each well. Assign duplicate samples to obtain data suitable for confirming the results, and choose a reference sample and the endogenous control. For the dye to use as the passive reference, select none. To eliminate reagent cross-contamination, set up negative reverse transcriptase and a non-template control for miRNA expression.\nNext, make sure that the reaction volume is set to 20 µL and the PCR cycling conditions are set as follows: 95 °C for 15 min, then 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and lastly extension at 70 °C for 30 s.\nClick on analyze in the system's software program to analyze the qRT-PCR data after the process is complete. Confirm that the threshold line automatically selected by the program is appropriate for each well.\nCheck the threshold cycle (CT) value of the endogenous control and target miRNAs analyzed in each sample. Determine the CT values by the intersection of the amplification curve and threshold line.\n\tNOTE: In the present study, RNU6-2 and miRNA-423-5p were used as the endogenous controls for target miRNA expression levels, and the ΔΔCT method was used to determine the relative expression levels of each target miRNA18."
