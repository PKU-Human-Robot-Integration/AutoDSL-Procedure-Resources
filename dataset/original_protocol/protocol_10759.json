    "1. SU8 Master Fabrication\nDesign the microfluidic structures using Clewin software and print it using 65,024 DPI laser plotter with minimum feature size of 8 μm on circuit board film.    \nClean 2 cm X 2 cm silicon wafers with native oxide in 20% KOH for 1 min and rinse in deionized water; one wafer each for the flow layer and its corresponding control layer. \nBlow dry the pieces with nitrogen gas and dehydrate on a hot plate at 120 °C for 4 hr. Allow the pieces to cool down to room temperature before proceeding to the next step.\nPlace silicon pieces one at a time on the spinner chuck and turn on the vacuum. Cover the silicon surfaces with ~20 μl hexamethyl-disilazane (HMDS) and coat them using a SPIN150 spinner at 500 rpm for 5 sec followed by 3,000 rpm for 30 sec.\nCover silicon wafers completely with ~1.5 ml of SU8-2025 (http://www.microchem.com/Prod-SU82000.htm[href=http://www.microchem.com/Prod-SU82000.htm]) and coat wafers using SPIN150 spinner at 500 rpm for 5 sec followed by 2,000 rpm for 30 sec. This spinning protocol produces a photoresist thickness of ~40 μm that is suitable for the control and flow layers for early larval stages of C. elegans.\nSpin ~1.5 ml SU8-2050 using SPIN150 spinner at 500 rpm for 5 sec followed by 2,000 rpm for 30 sec to obtain a photoresist thickness of ~80 μm that is suitable for flow layer fabrication for late larval stages of C. elegans, basal flow layer for Drosophila/zebrafish larvae and their corresponding control layers.\nPlace the silicon pieces on hot plate with the SU8 coated layer on top. Soft bake the coated silicon pieces at 65 °C for 1 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min. Allow the pieces to cool down to room temperature before proceeding to the next step.",
    "Place the soft-baked silicon pieces on the exposure stage with SU8-2025 coated surface on the top facing the UV lamp. Use the photo mask with design I (L1, Figure 1B) and design II (L2, Figure 1B) for the flow layer and control layer pattern respectively for early larval stages of C. elegans. Place the photo mask on top of the SU8 layer and ensure the mask is flat against the coated layer. Open the shutter of the UV lamp and expose the soft-baked SU8 wafers to 200 Watt UV lamp through the photo mask for 15 sec.\nUse the photo mask with design I (L1, Figure 1B) and design II (L2, Figure 1B) on SU8-2050 coated pieces (prepared in step 1.6) to fabricate the flow layer and control layer for late larval stages of C. elegans. Use the photo mask with the design I (L1, Figure 1C) and design II (L2, Figure 1C) for the basal flow layer and control layer respectively for Drosophila/zebrafish larvae on wafers coated with SU8-2050 (prepared in step 1.6). Expose the SU8 surfaces through the photo mask to the 200 Watt UV lamp for 15 sec.\nPlace the exposed silicon pieces on a hot plate with the coated layer on top. Post bake the wafers at 65 °C for 1 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min. Allow the pieces to cool down before proceeding to the next step. \nDevelop the pieces using the SU8 developer solution for 20 min. Rinse the pieces in Iso-Propyl Alcohol (IPA) and blow dry using nitrogen gas.\nPlace the silicon pieces in a desiccator with the SU8 pattern on top. Coat the pieces with 50 μl of tricholoro (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane vapor in a desiccator for 2 hr.",
    "Precautions: Take safety precautions for chemical handling during KOH treatment, photoresist coating and developing. Silane vapor coating should be performed inside a desiccator in a ventilated area. Protect SU8 resist from over exposure to light. Use protective eyewear with an UV light source.\n2. PDMS Mold Fabrication\nPrepare 10:1 PDMS by combining 50 g of Sylgard 184 base with 5 g of curing agent in a plastic cup. Mix the content manually for ~3 min. Degas the mixture inside a desiccator to remove all air bubbles formed during mixing.\nPour a 5 mm thick PDMS mixture over the silicon wafers with SU8 pattern of design II, for control layer, gently to avoid formation of air bubbles. In case bubbles are formed during pouring, degas the PDMS on the SU8 pattern in low vacuum to remove all the bubbles.\nPlace the silicon wafers with SU8-2025 pattern of design I, for the flow layer, on spinner chuck and turn on the vacuum to hold them. Cover the wafers with ~1 ml of PDMS mix and coat the wafers using SPIN150 spinner at 500 rpm for 5 sec followed by 1,500 rpm for 30 sec.\nCoat ~1 ml PDMS mix on silicon wafers with the 80 μm SU8-2050 pattern of design I (L1, Figure 1B), for the flow layer for late larval stages of C. elegans using the SPIN150 spinner at 500 rpm for 5 sec followed by 1,000 rpm for 30 sec. Coat a thick layer of PDMS mix on the silicon pieces with SU8-2050 pattern of flow layer design I (L1, Figure 1C) for Drosophila/zebrafish larvae, using SPIN150 spinner at 500 rpm for 35 sec.",
    "Bake PDMS coated silicon pieces of design I and wafers with corresponding design II for control layer containing PDMS for C. elegans and/or Drosophila/zebrafish larvae in a hot air convection oven at 50 °C for 6 hr.\nCut out the PDMS piece from the silicon substrate containing the SU8 pattern II for C. elegans and/or Drosophila/zebrafish larvae using a sharp blade. Punch a small hole of ~1 mm diameter on top of the reservoir connecting the main trap in the PDMS mold using a Harris puncher.\nPlace the punched PDMS block (containing the 40 μm thick mold for control layer L2) on a plastic tray, with the molded side of the control layer facing up. Place the PDMS coated silicon wafer containing the 40 μm thick SU8 design I on the same tray, with the PDMS coated surface facing up. Insert the tray inside the chamber of plasma cleaner and turn on the vacuum for 2 min. Subsequently, turn on the plasma power and lower the chamber pressure until the chamber turns light pink in color. Expose both surfaces to 18 Watt air plasma under low vacuum for 2 min.\nPlace the punched PDMS block removed from the 80 μm thick SU8 master containing pattern II for late larval stages of C. elegans or Drosophila/zebrafish larvae on a plastic tray, with the molded side of the control layer facing up. Place the corresponding baked PDMS layer spin coated on the silicon wafer containing 80 μm thick design I for later C. elegans stages or Drosophila/zebrafish larvae simultaneously on the same tray with the flat PDMS coated surface facing up. Use the same protocol mentioned above to expose them to air plasma.",
    "Place the two plasma treated surfaces for C. elegans and/or Drosophila/zebrafish larvae together with gentle pressure and bake them in hot air convection oven at 50 °C for 2 hr.\nCut out the bonded devices from the silicon substrate with SU8 design I for C. elegans and/or Drosophila/zebrafish larvae. Punch access holes at the inlet and outlet reservoirs of the flow channel.\nPlace the bonded PDMS mold on a plastic tray for C. elegans, with the molded side of the flow layer design facing up. Clean glass cover slip (22 X 22 mm, No. 1 thickness) and place it on the same plastic tray. Insert the tray containing PDMS mold and glass cover slip inside the plasma chamber. Expose the bottom PDMS surface of the device and glass cover slip to 18 Watt air plasma at low pressure for 2 min. Place the two plasma treated surfaces with gentle pressure and bake them in hot air convection oven at 50 °C for 2 hr.\nStore the device in a clean environment for future use. \n3. Additional Steps for Drosophila/Zebrafish Device\nExpose clean glass surface of size 2 cm X 2 cm with 50 μl of tricholoro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane  vapor in a desiccator for 2 hr.\nSpin ~1 ml of 10:1 PDMS mix prepared in step 2.1 on the silanized glass surface using SPIN150 spinner at 500 rpm for 35 sec. Bake the PDMS coated glass substrates in a hot air oven at 50 °C for 6 hr with the coated surface facing up. Allow the PDMS layer to cool down to room temperature before proceeding to the next step.",
    "Punch the coated layer using a custom built sharp metal puncher at the middle of the PDMS, to form the PDMS spacer layer. The shape of the metal puncher is designed similar to the flow design for Drosophila/zebrafish (L1, Figure 1C).\nExpose the PDMS spacer layer and the single-bonded block (flow layer and control layer, made in step 2.9 for Drosophila/zebrafish larvae) to 18 Watt air plasma using plasma cleaner at low vacuum. Place the two plasma treated surfaces together and bake them in a hot air oven at 50 °C for 2 hr. \nCut the bonded device from the glass, punch access holes at the inlet and outlet reservoirs and bond it to a glass cover slip (22 X 22 mm, No. 1 thickness) using a plasma cleaner as mentioned in step 2.11. This would produce an immobilization device for first instar Drosophila larvae with a channel height of ~500 μm. For zebrafish larvae, duplicate the PDMS spacer layer fabrication process with an additional bonding step.  The dual layer of PDMS-S produces a channel height of 900 μm for 30 hfp zebrafish larvae.     \nPrecautions: Avoid dust particles during device fabrication. Two plasma cleaned surfaces need to be completely dust free for proper bonding. Store the devices in a desiccator in situations where a special clean room is not available in order to minimize accumulation of dust particles in devices.\n4. Using PDMS Membrane\nConnect one end of a micro-flex tube (inner diameter ~1.6 mm, outer diameter ~4.8 mm) to a pressurized nitrogen gas supply regulator and the other end to the main trap reservoir through an 18 gauge needle (outer diameter ~1.25 mm) glued to the tube. A 3-way stopcock used in the middle of the tube connection allows application or release of pressure on the membrane.",
    "Fill the tube connected to the PDMS device with a 10 cm column of distilled water before connecting it to the reservoir of the main trap of a C. elegans and/or Drosophila/zebrafish larvae device. \nTurn the valve of the nitrogen supply to read 14 psi and monitor the membrane of the main trap deflecting towards the flow channel at low magnification of an inverted microscope. Length of the water column in the micro-flex tube is compressed whenever the 3-way stopcock is open. Edges of the deflected membrane are visible in transmitted light (Figure 1I and 1J). Membrane deflection causes displacement of dust particles/bubbles under the PDMS membrane and pushes them to the channel boundaries.\nWait till the liquid front fills the microchannel completely without any trapped air. \nRelease the pressure by using the 3-way stopcock to relax the membrane to its resting position. \n5. Inserting C. elegans, Drosophila and Zebrafish Larvae into the Device and Immobilizing Them Under the Flexible PDMS Membrane \nFill the flow channel with M9 buffer [3 g KH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 5 g NaCl, 1 ml 1 M MgSO4, H2O to 1 L, sterilize by autoclaving] for C. elegans 18 or 1X PBS [8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g Na2HPO4, 0.24 g KH2PO4, H2O to 1 L, sterilize by autoclaving] for Drosophila/zebrafish larvae 19 for 10 min before an experiment.\nLocate a single C. elegans of required stage on a NGM plate 18 (or first instar Drosophila larvae from agar egg plate or manually dechorionated 30 hpf zebrafish larvae in liquid medium 20) using a low magnification stereo microscope. Pick a single animal using a small volume of buffer solution into a micro tip. Use a micro tip with its end cut to accommodate the larger Drosophila or zebrafish larvae in buffer.",
    "Push the single organism through the flow channel inlet.  Adjust the pipetting pressure to position the individual animal under the main trap. \nIncrease the pressure of the PDMS membrane slowly to position the animal against the channel boundary and immobilize it with 14 psi pressure for C. elegans, 7 psi for Drosophila and 3 psi for zebrafish larvae.\nPosition the immobilized animal at the center of the microscopic field of view. Use an inverted microscope at desired settings for high resolution bright field or fluorescence imaging. Acquire single or time-lapse fluorescence images at predefined frame rate.\nRelease the trap pressure and monitor the locomotion of the animal for 5-10 min at low magnification. \nFlush the animal and insert a fresh animal to repeat the above steps.    \nWash all the animals from the waste reservoir using distilled water applied using a syringe. Dry the channel by pushing air using a syringe for future reuse. \nPrecautions: Animals requiring higher pipetting pressure to flow inside the main channel tend to show poor locomotion/health after release from the trap and should be avoided for imaging. Clean the flow channel for any trace of buffer to prevent clogging of channel by crystals. If oil is used for high resolution imaging, clean the glass cover slip to be able to maintain good signal to noise ratio for subsequent experiments.Subscription Required.
