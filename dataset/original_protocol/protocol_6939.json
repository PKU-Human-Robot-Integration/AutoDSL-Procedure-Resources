    "Generation of Tek-targeted mouse models for vein analysis in skin and mesentery at the embryonic stage. This protocol is based on the paper by Chu et al. (2016).Prepare mouse embryos. Place one male mouse (Tek+/-; UBC-CreERT2, ≥ 2 months old) and two female mice (TekFlox/Flox, ≥ 2 months old) into a cage for mating in the late afternoon around 18:00. Check females for vaginal plugs in the early morning of the following day (around 8:00). If the female mouse is pregnant, the embryonic stages are estimated considering midday of the day on which the vaginal plug is present as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).Induce gene deletion. Use sunflower seed oil (COFCO Fortune) as the diluent for the preparation of tamoxifen (tamoxifen free base, 10 mg/ml). Perform intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen solution (100 μl, 10 mg/ml) from E12.5 to E14.5 (Figure 1A).Euthanize the pregnant female by cervical dislocation at E17.5 (embryonic day 17.5) and place the mouse on its back on a dissecting board. Use pins to attach the feet of the mouse to the board, and adequately soak the fur with 75% ethanol.Make a cut in the skin and the abdominal wall with scissors to expose the abdominal cavity and dissect the uterus with scissors.Separate embryos in ice-cold PBS by removing the uterine muscle layers, pulling the extra-embryonic membranes off with fine forceps, and removing the placenta under a dissecting microscope.Cut the tip off the tail of the embryos for genotyping.Peel back the skin with ophthalmic scissors and fix the skin tissues to the 6-well plate containing silicone rubber using fine needles (Figure 1B).Open the abdomen of the embryo. Cut a fragment of the small intestine long enough to form a ring to keep the mesentery intact for vascular visualization.",
    "Fix the intestine to the 6-well plate containing silicone rubber with fine needles (Figure 2A).Fix the tissues with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C or on ice for 2 h. Wash 3 times with PBS solution for 5 min each.Block the tissues with PBS-TX solution containing 3% skimmed milk powder at 4°C for 6-8 h with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker.Remove the blocking solution and incubate the tissues with primary antibodies (PECAM-1, αSMA, TIE2; dilution according to the manufacturer’s recommendation) in blocking solution (total volume: 1 ml) with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker overnight at 4°C.Wash the tissues 5 times with PBS-TX for 20 min each.Incubate the tissues with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies) in PBS-TX solution (dilution 1:500) with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker overnight at 4°C.Cut off the excess tissues. Transfer the trimmed skin onto a glass slide, add a drop of 50% glycerol, place a coverslip and seal with nail polish at the edges. For the analysis of intestines, transfer the trimmed intestine directly onto a coverslip and keep the mesentery fully stretched under a dissecting microscope. Avoid drying of tissues by adding drops of 50% glycerol.Analyze blood vessels under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FluoView) and acquire and process images with the FV-ASW Viewer 3.0 /4.2a software (Figures 1C and Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4117/bioprotoc-11-15-4117-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Note that Tek deletion was confirmed by immunostaining analysis in TekiUCKO mice.",

Arrowheads indicate arteries, and arrows indicate veins. Scale bar: 100 μm in B.Generation of a Tek-targeted mouse model for retinal vein analysis at the neonatal stageNote: Dissection of the retina was performed according to the protocol described by Pitulescu et al. (2010). Administration of 30-50 μl tamoxifen solution (tamoxifen free base, 2 mg/ml in seed oil) by intragastric injection (Insulin syringe, BD Ultra-Fine®) to neonatal mice daily from postnatal day 1 to 4 (P1-4) (Figure 3A).Euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation at P21.Dissect the eyeballs from the mice into a 2-ml tube, and fix eyeballs in 4% PFA on ice for 2 h.Prepare the retina by removing the cornea, sclera, choroid, pigment layer, and lens from the eye in cold PBS under a dissecting microscope.Make four radial incisions to divide the retina into four quadrants after detaching the hyaloid vessels (Figure 3B).Transfer the retina into a 1.5-ml tube and wash 3 times with PBS for 15 min each.Remove PBS completely and block the retina with 3% skimmed milk powder in PBS-TX solution with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker at 4°C overnight.Remove the blocking solution and incubate the retina with primary (PECAM-1, EphB4) and secondary antibodies at the appropriate concentrations for 12-16 h at 4°C with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker.",
    "Note: There is a wash step between the primary and secondary antibody incubation. Wash the retina 5 times with PBS-TX for 20 min each.Transfer the retina onto a glass slide with a few drops of 50% glycerol and cover with a coverslip.Analyze the retinal blood vessels under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FluoView) and acquire and process the images as described above (Figure 3C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4117/bioprotoc-11-15-4117-g003.jpgFigure 3.
