    "Euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation (or any approved form of euthanasia) but taking care to maintain the integrity of the trachea.Place mouse on its back and wet with 70% ethanol.Make a midline incision, pull back the skin and expose the trachea by carefully separating the muscle tissue above the trachea (Figure 3a). Make a small horizontal incision across the exposed trachea without going right through the trachea (Figure 3b and Figure 3c). Attach an 18 G Insyte catheter to a 1 ml syringe and fill with 1 ml PBS.Insert the catheter approximately 10 mm into the trachea and flush the contents of the syringe into the lungs (Figure 3d).Draw the fluid out (Figure 3e) and place contents of syringe into a 15 ml tube.The lavage fluid will be contaminated with blood due to the damage caused by the larvae entering the lung. To improve visualization of the larvae when lavage fluid is contaminated with blood, spin the BAL fluid down at 1,400 rpm for 2 min, remove the supernatant and lyse the red blood cells by the addition of 3ml of water to the pellet, then count larvae. Distinguishing features of the molt 4 larvae is the deposition of a dark-brown pigment that is clearly visible in the gut (Bouchery et al., 2015).Repeat twice more with fresh PBS for each lavage.Visualize the larvae by transferring the lavage into a 60 x 15 mm TC dish and inspecting the contents using a stereo microscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160219/20160219004151_0608.jpgFigure 3.
