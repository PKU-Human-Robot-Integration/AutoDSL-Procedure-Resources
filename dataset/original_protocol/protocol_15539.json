For a bleomycin-induced lung injury, given that it is a highly heterogeneous injury, it is recommended to cut several tissue pieces from different parts of the lung from each mouse. Alternatively, a larger piece of tissue can be homogenized in KHB buffer containing 100 µM DTPA at a 1:6 weight-to-volume ratio (mg/µL) as described below.\nFresh lung tissue preserved in sucrose buffer \nFlush the lavaged lungs with cold PBS to remove blood as done in step 3.1.2.\nHomogenize the fresh lung tissue in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose with a 1:6 lung/buffer (mg/µL) ratio using Dounce tissue grinder with a glass or PTFE pestle.\nAdd 50 µL of the lung homogenate to 450 µL of KHB containing 100 µM DTPA.\nIn a 1.5 mL tube (in a total volume of 100 µL), to 98 µL of lung homogenate in KHB, add 2 µL of CMH of 10 mM stock to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 mM.\nIncubate for 20 min 37 °C in a water bath.\nPlace the samples on ice and load them in a capillary tube.

Include a one-time matched blank sample with CMH KHB containing sucrose buffer. Alternatively, store aliquots of the remaining lung homogenates (step 3.1.2) at -80 °C for future measurements.\n\t\tNOTE: The total volume can be scaled as needed.\nEPR measurements on lung tissue from mice injected with spin probes in vivo (at RT using tissue cell)\nPrepare CPH stock solution by dissolving 4.9 mg of CPH in 1 mL of filtered and deoxygenated 50 mM phosphate buffer.\nAnesthetize mice with inhaled isoflurane (1.5-4%) for 20-30 seconds until unresponsive to toe pinch. Inject mice via retroorbital route with 100 µL of CPH spin probe for a 25 g mouse body weight (final dose = 20 mg/kg), and allow the probe to circulate for 1 h. Immediately after retroorbital injection, add one drop of 0.5% proparacaine HCl on the eye area to prevent eye pain and dryness. Monitor mice for 1 h and proceed to tissue harvesting.\nHarvest the lung tissue as described above and flash freeze the lungs.\nCut 20-30 mg of frozen tissue on dry ice and record the exact weight.\nGently wipe the tissue with cleaning wipes to absorb any surface water.",
    "Place the tissue within the window of the tissue cell (an accessory allows EPR measurements for tissue samples) and run EPR to determine total spins. The data can be expressed as total spins per mg of tissue.\n5. Data Analysis\nSimulate the EPR spectra using SpinFit module incorporated in the Xenon software of the bench-top EMXnano EPR spectrometer. Determine the nitroxide concentration by the SpinCount module. Alternatively, a calibration curve of a stable nitroxide such as 4-hydroxy-TEMPO or TEMPOL can be made, and the concentration can be obtained by comparing the intensity of the signal with the sample and standard.\nFor the data collected at 77 K, use double integration followed by SpinCount.\nSubscription Required.
