    "Wort production can be broken down into three essential steps − mashing, lautering, and boiling. Making a wort recipe from scratch allows complete control of this process. This can be important if the experiments in question require specific modifications to wort composition. Here we provide a basic wort recipe starting from whole grains that can easily be scaled or modified as needed.\nThe recipe is for a generic ale beer with 25 international bittering units (IBU) (see also Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0002]). It is not designed to mimic a specific beer style but rather produce a lightly hopped wort that can be used as a growth medium for fermentation assays. Individual styles are beyond the scope of this method but there are many resources and software available for developing recipes within individual beer style guidelines, see Internet Resources.\nThis protocol uses a single temperature infusion mash—a compromise between the different thermal optima of malt enzymes and overall efficiency. For yeast propagation and simple fermentation tests, wort prepared according to Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0006] can also be used.\nMaterials\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nPale ale malt\nWater\nBittering hops (such as magnum hops 15% alpha acids)\n200 ppm zinc stock solution (see recipe)\nRoller mill for grinding malt (optional if buying pre-ground malts)\n30-L stainless steel electric kettle with stainless steel tap for use as mash tun\nThermometer\nBrewers paddle or large spoon to stir the mash\n30-L stainless steel pot with tap and false bottom for use as a lauter tun\n500-ml beaker\n30-L stainless steel electric kettle with stainless steel tap for use as boil kettle\nCooling coil with hose tap attachments\nSterile 20-L canister\nCentrifuge\nFour sterile 5-L canisters\nAdditional reagents and equipment for performing an iodine start test (see Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0005])\nPrepare equipment",
    "1. Sanitize all equipment with 70% ethanol and allow the ethanol to evaporate completely before use.\nDo not use ethanol with additives such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), since this is not suitable for human consumption.\nMashing\n2. Grind 4.2 kg of pale ale malt using a roller mill set to 0.7 mm.\nSee Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0003] for grain bill calculation.\nProperly ground malt should have particles small enough to facilitate efficient hydration. It should also still include unshredded husks to create a stable grain bed during the lautering and prevent a stuck mash (see also Troubleshooting).\n3. Add 12 L of water to the mash tun and pre-heat to a strike temperature of 71°C\nSee Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0004] for the calculation of strike water temperature.\n4. Gently stir in the grist (ground malt produced in step) ensuring that any clumps of malt are broken up.\n5. Maintain the temperature of the mash at 65°C for 60 min. During this time, gently stir the mash every 10 min.\nThe mash temperature can be between 63°C and 72°C. Lower temperatures will result in a highly fermentable wort, whereas higher temperatures will increase the amount of non-fermentable sugars in the wort and can increase mouthfeel and apparent sweetness in the final beer.\n6. Perform an iodine starch test to ensure the mash has undergone complete saccharification.\nSee Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0005] for the iodine starch test.\n7. When the iodine starch test is negative (which means the starch is sufficiently digested), heat the mash up to 78°C.\nDuring this step, residual amylases will be deactivated. The wort's viscosity is also decreased at higher temperatures, which helps in the subsequent lautering. Make sure not to heat above 80°C as this would release undigested starch to the wort.\nLautering",
    "8. Place the false bottom in the lauter tun, transfer in the mash contents, and allow to settle for 20 min.\nMake sure to elevate the lauter tun, so that its contents can drain back into the cleaned electric kettle.\n9. While the mash is settling, heat up 16 L of water in the cleaned mash tun to 78°C for use in the sparge.\n10. Slowly drain the mash into a 500-ml beaker and gently pour this back into the lauter tun.\nThe first runnings will be cloudy and full of particulate matter.\n11. Repeat this process until the wort begins to run clear.\n12. Once the wort begins to run clear, it can be drained directly into the boil kettle.\nStart draining with a low flow rate, which can be increased as a stable grain bed settles on the false bottom of the mash tun (see also Troubleshooting). A low flow rate is needed to avoid collapse or creation of channels through the grain bed.\n13. As the mash drains, additional sparge water can be gently added on top of the mash and continually collected as the mash drains into the boil kettle. As the lautering progresses keep track of the wort gravity (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0007] or Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0008]).\n14. Continue to add sparge water and lauter until the gravity of the wort is 10% below the desired final gravity (FG) (i.e., 10.8°P for a FG of 12°P).\nNote that this percentage can be adapted to match the evaporation rate of your brewing setup in the subsequent boiling step.\nBoiling\n15. Turn on the kettle heating and bring the wort to a boil.\n16. Add 12 g of bittering hops (15% AA).",
    "See Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0002] for calculating how much hops need to be added to reach a specific IBU.\n17. Boil for 60 min.\nCooling\n18. Attach the sanitized cooling coil to a cold water outlet and place the coil into the brew kettle. Turn on the water and allow to run until the wort has cooled below 25°C.\n19. Remove the cooling coil and transfer the cooled wort into a 20-L canister and store overnight at 4°C.\n20. Decant the wort, leaving as much of the trub behind as possible.\n21. Ensure the wort is homogeneous and dilute the wort to 12°P with sterile water if required.\nIdeally, the final volume should be 20 L but this will depend on the efficiency of the mashing and lautering procedures, which can be influenced by a number of factors (see Troubleshooting).\n22. Add zinc to a final concentration of 500 ppb (2.5 ml stock solution per liter wort).\nIf needed, wort can be sterilized by autoclaving for 10 min at 105°C.\n23. Optional: Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,500-3,000 × g, 4°C, completely separate any remaining trub.\n24. Collect the clarified wort in sterile 5 L canisters.\n25. Store the wort at 4°C until use.\nFor long-term storage, the wort can be kept at −20°C (>6 months).",
    "Bitterness of beer is measured in international bittering units (IBU), which represent the amount of iso-alpha acids per liter (quantified as mg/L or ppm). Importantly, the IBU value of a beer may not match its perceived bitterness. The bitterness of a beer can be affected by, among others, the alcohol level, residual sugars or the use of roasted malts.\nEstimation of the expected bitterness of a beer can be calculated using the following formula:\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/1e8f8676-22bb-44e4-8f70-8140fddf091d/cpmc91-math-0001.png\nwhere:\n         \nAlpha acid% = alpha acid content of hops\nThis is provided by the hop producer. Alpha acid% greatly depends on hop variety, harvest year, and hop storage conditions.\nUtilization% = hop utilization rate\nThe hop utilization rate represents the percentage of hop alpha acids that are first solubilized in wort and later isomerized into iso-alpha acids. This isomerization reaction requires heat and is dependent on the time of hop addition to the boil and the gravity of the wort.

It is unique to each brewing setup and recipe and has to be determined empirically. However, a 60% brewhouse yield can be used as a reasonable estimate to calculate the first brew. For more details on brewhouse yield estimation, see Kunze (2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-bib-0017]).\nFor example, for 20 L of a 12°P wort with a brew house yield of 60%, we need the following amount of malt:\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/f6e9e99b-05b6-4eb9-a050-87ffce8b895a/cpmc91-math-0003.png\nimgsrc:/cms/asset/a0970323-87f2-46ce-978b-342599a877a0/cpmc91-math-0004.png",

    "This recipe is ideal for yeast propagation and simple tests (e.g., characterization of the basic fermentation properties of different yeasts). Dried malt extract (DME) wort offers a very reproducible recipe that can be easily prepared without the specialized equipment required for an all grain-derived wort (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0001]). DME, or spray malt, is available in a range of colors and comes in hopped and unhopped varieties. Here we use light unhopped DME, but the recipe can be readily adapted using other DME variants. This recipe can also be used as a concentrated stock if lower gravity wort is required (e.g., for yeast propagation).\nMaterials\nLight unhopped dry malt extract [DME: color: 8 European Brewery Convention (EBC)]\nDeionied water\nZinc chloride solution at 200 ppm (see recipe)\n5-L bottle\nAutoclave\nSterile 500-ml buckets/bottles to centrifuge wort\nCentrifuge\nDensity meter (e.g., Anton Paar DMA 35)\n1. In a 5-L bottle, prepare DME solution by dissolving 549.5 g of light (8 EBC) unhopped DME in water to a total volume of 2 L.\nDuring autoclaving, proteins precipitate and the wort needs to be clarified afterwards. Because of this, twice the volume is prepared to ensure there is sufficient clarified wort harvested in the end.\n2. Sterilize by autoclaving for 10 min at 105°C.\nDo not autoclave at 121°C as this temperature facilitates maillard reactions between carbohydrates and amino-compounds.\n3. Cool the wort down overnight to 4°C.\nThis will assist protein precipitation and improve the clarity of the final wort.\n4. Gently decant the wort into sterile 500-ml centrifuge buckets, leaving as much of the trub behind as possible.\n5. Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,500-3,000 × g, 4°C. Collect 1 L of the clarified wort.",
    "6. Measure gravity of the wort with the density meter and dilute to 12°P using sterile water if required (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0007] or Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0008]).\n7. Add zinc to a final concentration of 500 ppb (2.5 ml zinc solution per liter wort).\nZinc is required as a co-factor for a number of enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase (Kunze, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-bib-0017]), and is commonly added as supplement to wort.",
    "For brew house calculations, brewers mostly rely on measurements of the wort's or beer's density. Traditionally, wort density is measured using a hydrometer. A hydrometer is a floating body with a thicker bulb for a base, sometimes containing a thermometer, and a thinner upper stem holding a mass percentage (°P) or specific gravity (SG) scale, or both. The value can be determined as the point to which the stem sinks into the fluid. A hydrometer will sink deeper into a sample with lower density and vice versa.\nThe extract measured before fermentation is called original extract (OE) if measured in °P, or original gravity (OG) if measured as SG. Extract values measured after the fermentation is finished are called residual extract (RE) or FG, respectively.\nHere, we give a protocol to determine wort extract using a hydrometer.\nMaterials\nWort sample (see Basic Protocol or Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0006])\n250-ml glass bottle with screwcap\nCooling bath at 20°C\nThermometer\n200-ml glass cylinder\nHydrometer\n1. Collect a homogeneous sample (200 ml) of the wort in a 250-ml glass bottle and bring it to 20°C using a water bath.\nClose the bottle to avoid evaporation during the cooling process.\n2. Make sure the sample is thoroughly mixed and transfer to the glass cylinder.\nAvoid foam on top of the wort sample.\n3. Wet the dry hydrometer by immersing it into the wort sample. Pull it up again and then lower it gently until the expected value is almost reached.\nMake sure no gas bubbles adhere to the hydrometer.\n4. Read the gravity value of the wort as the point where the meniscus touches the stem of the hydrometer.",
    "Hydrometers for brewing are often calibrated to be read at the highest point of the meniscus which forms around the stem, whereas hydrometers for laboratory use are calibrated to be read at the lowest point of the meniscus. Please check the user manual.",
    "A faster and easier way of measuring the wort's extract is using a density meter. The working principle of a density meter is based on an oscillating U-tube made of glass. The U-tube gets excited to vibrate at its characteristic frequency. Depending on the density of the tested sample this characteristic frequency changes, which allows calculation of the actual density (DMA 35 Portable Density Meter, Instruction Manual, Anton Paar GmbH, Austria, 2009). This calculation is automatically done by density meter devices for beverage use (e.g., Anton Paar DMA 35).\nMaterials\nWort sample (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0001] or Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0006])\nWarm tap water (40°C)\nDemineralized water\n100-ml glass bottle with screwcap\nCooling bath at 20°C\nDensity meter (e.g., Anton Paar DMA 35)\nPlastic syringes\n1.

Rinse the density meter's U-tube with your sample before you take the actual measurement. To this end, aspire the liquid into the U-tube using the built-in sample tube and pump lever or inject the sample with a plastic syringe. Then dispose of the liquid by depressing the pump lever.\n3. Take the actual sample in the same way as for the rinsing step; the device will automatically show the density value or any other derived value by choice (e.g., °P or SG).\n4. Take additional two readings to ensure consistency.\n5. Rinse the U-tube with warm tap water followed by a final rinse with demineralized water.",
    "Because of the tremendous effect of yeast-produced aroma compounds on the quality and character of the final beer, selecting an appropriate yeast is an important and crucial step during brewing. Nowadays, different brewing yeasts are commercially available. These yeast strains are most often supplied as liquid yeast slurries or as active dried yeast powder. For use of these yeast starter cultures, we refer to the manufacturers protocol. Another option is to start from a yeast strain that is stored at −80°C (see Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-prot-0010]). The protocol below describes how to propagate yeast from such a cryo culture to sufficient cell densities to pitch it into 20 L of a 12°P wort. Using the protocol below, a cell density of ∼2 × 108 cells per ml with a viability >95% can usually be obtained.

Propagation cultures can be serially stepped up in size by a factor 10 until the desired number of viable cells is achieved by inoculating the entirety of the previous starter culture into the next step, e.g., 5 ml → 50 ml → 500 ml. Volumes larger than 5 ml should be grown in Erlenmeyer flasks in a shaking incubator.\nStarter wort gravity is advised to be between 7 and 10°P when brewing a beer with an OE of 10 to 14°P.\nNote that using medium containing only glucose as the carbon source is not recommended as the yeast will need time to adapt metabolism to utilize the maltose in wort.

    "Prior to pitching the starter culture, most brewers check cell count and cell viability. One of the most widely used methods in the brewing industry requires a microscope, hemacytometer, and staining with methylene blue or methylene violet (Smart, Chambers, Lambert, Jenkins, & Smart, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-bib-0023]). All yeast cells take up the dye, but only viable cells can reduce it to a colorless product.\nThis protocol describes how to determine the total number of cells in a liquid culture, as well as the number of viable cells, using a methylene violet staining protocol. Cell counts and viability measurements can also be automated, for example by using a TC20 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad).\nMaterials\nDeionized water\nYeast sample\n0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution or PBS\n0.1 M glycine buffer, pH 10.6 (adjusted with NaOH)\nMethylene violet solution (0.1% w/v), filter sterilized\nHemacytometer (Neubauer-improved type) with cover slips or, alternatively, Kova Glasstic slides (e.g., from FisherScientific)\nLint-free paper tissues (e.g., Kimwipes)\nPipettes\nBrightfield microscope (total magnification of 400×)\nPrepare the cell count\n1. Clean the hemacytometer with water before using it. Use a lint-free paper tissue to remove excess water.\nThis step is not required when using Kova Glasstic slides.\n2. Dilute yeast sample to an appropriate concentration for cell counting.\nTry to have around 100 cells or less per microscope field. Usually a 1:100 or a 1:1000 dilution of your original culture works well. Dilute your samples in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution or PBS.\nIf yeast cells are flocculent, make your dilution using EDTA (50 mM, pH 7.0). This will break up the clumps and will allow you to count the individual cells.\n3. Mix the sample well by pipetting up and down several times.\n4. Dilute methylene violet stock solution 1/10 using 0.1 M glycine buffer at pH 10.6.",
    "5. Add 1 ml of a methylene violet solution to 1 ml of (diluted) yeast culture.\n6. Mix the sample well by pipetting up and down several times.\nCount the yeast cells\n7. Gently apply 10 µl of the well-mixed sample between coverslip and hemacytometer. Avoid air bubbles under the coverslip.\nThe sample will almost immediately be pulled under the coverslip by capillary action.\nWhen using Kova Glasstic slides, simply pipette 6.6 µl (the maximum volume of each chamber) of the well-mixed sample onto the slides.\n8. Place the hemacytometer on the microscopy stage.\n9. Locate yeast cells and focus the microscope.\n10. Count the cells in squares in the hemacytometer.\nIf yeast cells are evenly distributed over sample, you can count within the five numbered squares (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-fig-0002]).\nBe consistent when counting and make sure to establish a counting protocol (e.g., always count cells on upper and right edge, and never on lower and left edge of the squares).\nFor the Kova Glasstic slides: Count 10 of the small grids.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e66ca1b0-9db1-45ba-9aa1-11a68e83a341/cpmc91-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nA hemacytometer is used to count the number of cells in a suspension. It basically comprises a chamber, created by a grid of perpendicular lines that are carved into glass (upper panel). The area bound by each line, as well as the volume of each chamber that is created in this way, is known. By counting cells in a specific area of the grid (e.g.,, in the five indicated areas in lower panel), it is possible to calculate the original overall cell concentration in the suspension that was pipetted in the chamber.\n11. Note down the total number of cells as well as the number of viable cells.",
    "Dead cells stain violet, viable (or at least metabolically active) cells do not have a color. In general, pale violet cells and budding yeast cells are considered as viable cells.\n12. Determine fraction of viable cells.\n13. Calculate cell concentration in original culture using Equation 4.\nThis equation is for a Neubauer-improved type of hemacytometer.\nThis calculation assumes you only counted 5 of the in total 25 squares of the counting chamber. Each counted square holds the precise volume of 4 nl. If you counted 5 squares, you have the cell count for a total volume of 20 nl. To determine cell count in 1 ml, multiply by 50,000 (5 × 104). Please note that volume of counting chamber is given for a Neubauer-improved hemocytometer. If you are using a different type, please check the manufacturer's instructions on how to determine total cell count. For example, for the Kova Glasstic slides, the volume of each small grid is 0.011 µl; so, if you counted 10 small grids, you have determined the total number of cells in 0.11 µl.\nWhen calculating the dilution factor, take into account that the addition of methylene blue also dilutes your cells twofold.\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/68f5e76e-8f91-4c31-a136-0258d50172fc/cpmc91-math-0006.png",

    "8. When the gravity no longer decreases, the fermentation can be considered complete.\nAlternatively, fermentation progress can be tracked by monitoring weight loss, using a balance. This process will take around 6 days for an ale and 10 days for a lager.\n9. Once the primary fermentation has finished, ale beer should be matured at a lower temperature (0°C-4°C) for 3 days and lager beers allowed to warm up to 16°C for 2 days followed by 10 days at 0°C-4°C.\nThe 16°C step during maturation of lager beer allows the yeast to reduce the off-flavor diacetyl (buttery, rancid aroma) to acetoin and, subsequently, 2,3-butanediol.\nDuring the cold temperature step (also referred to as  “cold crash”) yeast cells, as well as cold trub, settle to the bottom of the fermentation vessel, allowing them to be easily separated from the finished beer.\nBottling the beer\n10. Place the sanitized automatic siphon into the fermenter (15-L bottle), attach the bottling wand to the end of the siphon tubing, and pump a few times to prime the siphon.\nThe siphon should not be lowered completely to avoid disturbing the sediment layer at the bottom of the fermenter.\n11. Transfer 330 ml beer into each beer bottle. Lower the bottling wand to the bottom of the bottle and gently depress to slowly begin filling while being careful of avoid aeration of the beer.\nAvoid splashing or excessive air contact of the green beer during steps 10 and 11, as this will lead to oxidation of the final beer.\n12. Add priming sugar to each bottle.\nFor a standard pale ale beer, a carbonation level of 0.5 g CO2/100 g beer is often suggested. For fermentation at 20°C, add 2.37 g of pure glucose per bottle of 330 ml.",

    "During the mashing process, hydroxycinnamic acids such as ferulic acid are released into the wort by hydrolase activity. Decarboxylation of ferulic acid by yeast during fermentation leads to formation of 4-vinyl guaiacol (4-VG). 4-VG has a very distinctive smoky, clove-like aroma. In most beers, except for particular styles such as Belgian witbier and German hefeweizen, 4-VG is considered a yeast-derived off-flavor; often also referred to as a phenolic off-flavor (POF).\nThe protocol below tests the capacity of a yeast strain to convert ferulic acid to 4-VG (Mertens et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.91#cpmc91-bib-0020]).

Seal the plates with aluminum seal.\n3. Incubate for 5 days on a shaking platform (900 rpm) in an incubator at 30°C.\n4. Centrifuge the plates for 3 min at 1,500-3,000 × g, room temperature.",
    "5. Transfer 100 µl of the supernatant into a new 96-well plate.\n6. Measure absorbance at 325-nm using a plate reader.\nStrains are considered POF+ if the measured amount of ferulic acid is below the 90% confidence interval of the blank.",
    "Every sample taken during or after the fermentation process needs to be degassed prior further analysis due to the CO2 produced during fermentation. This is to avoid false results due to gas bubbles adhering to measuring devices (e.g., hydrometer) or emerging during an actual measurement (e.g., density meter). For all protocols handling fermenting wort or beer, this degassing protocol should be followed.\nMaterials\nSample to degass\n0.5-L Erlenmeyer flasks with stopper\nPlastic funnel\nFilter papers (e.g., MACHERY-NAGEL MN 713 ¼)\n1. Transfer 150-200 ml of the sample into a 0.5-L Erlenmeyer flask.\n2. Shake the flask gently with the stopper on until no more CO2 escapes from the liquid.\nAn overpressure might develop within the flask during this step. Release the pressure carefully by lifting the stopper from time to time.\n3. Pour the sample through the funnel containing a filter paper. Discard the first 20 ml of flow through and collect the rest into the second Erlenmeyer flask.\n4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the sample appears sufficiently degassed.",
    "This protocol can be used when smaller volumes (<5 ml) need to be degassed prior to analyses.\nMaterials\nSample to degass\n20-ml plastic syringe (sterile)\nStopper for plastic syringe\n1. Aspirate ∼5 ml of your fermenting wort or beer using a (sterile) plastic syringe.\n2. Close the syringe using a stopper\n3. Pull the lever of the syringe to create an under pressure within the syringe and wait until no more CO2 degasses from the liquid.\n4. Release the CO2 carefully from the syringe without losing any sample volume.\n5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the sample appears sufficiently degassed."
