    "1. Cell culture of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (TrkB and TrkB-NULL (parental) cell lines)\nNOTE: Cell lines (SH-SY5Y Cell Line (TrkB, BR6) and SH-SY5Y Parental Cell Line (TrkB NULL))49,50 were purchased from Kerafast. Cultured cells are used as a source of the transmembrane receptors to be immobilized for the preparation of CMAC columns. The following steps describe how to obtain cell membrane fragments and assemble functional CMAC columns.\nGrow the cells in a cell culture medium prepared by mixing 450 mL of RPMI media, 50 mL of FBS, 5 mL of penicillin/streptomycin solution, and 0.3 mg/mL of geneticin (G418) in a 150 mm cell culture dish at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2.\n2. Cell harvesting\nConfirm cell confluency (80%-90%) using a microscope, reached after 3-4 days after cell passaging.\nAspirate cell culture medium from above the cells and wash the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1x, pH 7.4). Remove PBS and add 2 mL of low concentrated trypsin (0.25%) to detach cells.\nGently swirl the plate to evenly cover all the cells with trypsin solution and incubate the cells for approximately 2 min at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2. Add 8 mL of cell culture medium to detaching cells and transfer detached cells to a 50 mL conical tube and place it on ice.\nUse a hemocytometer to estimate the number of cells (approximately 3 x 107 cells). Mix cell suspension by pipetting up and down to obtain even cell density in the mixture. Place 10 µL of cell suspension under the coverslip and count the cells under a microscope using a 40x objective.\n3. Cell homogenization",

Spin down the cells again at 4 °C for 5 min at 400 x g.\nDiscard the supernatant and replace it with 20 mL of homogenization buffer prepared in step 3.4. Place the conical tube on ice.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 40 mL Dounce homogenizer tissue grinder and place it on ice. Homogenize the suspension manually, on ice, using 40 up-and-down pestle strokes. Transfer homogenized cell suspension into a 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at 4 °C for 7 min at 400 x g. Discard the pellet and transfer the supernatant to a new conical tube and centrifuge it at 4 °C for 30 min at 47900 x g. Save the cell membrane pellet and discard the supernatant.\n4. Cell membrane solubilization\nPrepare solubilization buffer by mixing 8.7 mL of the buffer solution made in step 3.3 with 0.1 mL (0.1 mM) of PMSF stock solution, 0.15 mL (3 mM) of benzamidine stock solution, 0.1 mL of protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 µL (100 µM) of ATP stock solution, 1 mL (10%) of glycerol and 0.2 g (2%) of sodium cholate (Table 2).\nTransfer the solubilization buffer into the conical tube with cell membrane fragments obtained in step 3.8 and resuspend the pellet.

    "Keep the supernatant and discard the pellet. Add 100 mg of IAM.PC.DD2 particles, to the supernatant, vortex and rotate the resulting suspension mixture at 150 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h.\nTo facilitate the immobilization of cell membrane fragments on the IAM.PC.DD2 particles proceed to the dialysis step as outlined below.\n\t\nPrepare dialysis buffer in 4 L of ultrapure deionized water by adding 24 g of tris-HCl (50 mM), 23.4 g of NaCl (100 mM), 0.06 g of CaCl2 (0.1 mM), 5.85 g of EDTA (5 mM), and 0.07 g of PMSF (0.1 mM; Table 3).\n\t\t​NOTE: PMSF is not soluble in water, therefore dissolve it first in small volume of ethanol and then add slowly into the beaker with the buffer.\nAdjust pH to 7.4 with hydrochloric acid solution. Place the buffer at 4 °C for a minimum of 1 h before proceeding to the dialysis step.\nPrepare dialysis tube by cutting 10 cm of cellulose membrane dialysis tubing (10 K MWCO, 35 mm) and transfer the suspension containing IAM.PC.DD2 particles and cell membrane fragments into the dialysis tube.

CMAC column packing\nPrepare ammonium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) that will be used to wash the IAM.PC.DD2 particles and in column characterization experiments by dissolving 0.7708 g of ammonium acetate in 1 L of ultrapure deionized water. Adjust pH to 7.4 with hydrochloric acid solution.",
    "After 48 h of dialysis, remove the dialysis tube from the dialysis buffer and transfer the content of the dialysis tube into a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 4 °C for 5 min at 400 x g. Discard the supernatant and wash the remaining pellet three times with 10 mL of ammonium acetate buffer, centrifuging the mixture at 4 °C for 5 min at 400 x g, after each wash.\nAfter the third wash, resuspend the remaining pellet in 1 mL of ammonium acetate buffer. Mix it thoroughly and use the resulting slurry to pack the 5/20 glass column to yield CMAC chromatography column.\nTo pack the column, first place a bottom filter previously soaked with ammonium acetate buffer, into the filter holder. Fit the filter holder in the glass column and screw the column cap to secure the position of the holder. Place the column vertically in a finger clamp and secure it in the lab stand. Place a beaker below the column.\nUsing a single channel pipettor transfer a small volume of the slurry obtained in step 6.4 into the glass column. Pour the material slowly, holding the pipette tip against the glass column wall. Allow the packing material to settle before pouring another volume of slurry.\nTo speed up the packing process remove the buffer from above the stationary bed using a micropipette between each step. Repeat these steps until 1 mL of the slurry is packed.\nPlace a top filter and screw the adapter unit so that there is no remaining buffer above the stationary phase, as presented in Figure 1. Secure the position of the adapter unit with the adapter lock.",
    "Connect the column to a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump, set the flow rate to 0.2 mL/min, and wash the column overnight with ammonium acetate buffer. The column is now ready for the characterization step. Store the column at 4 °C until use.\n\tNOTE: For longer storage (column not used for longer than a week) run the column with 0.05% sodium azide solution in ammonium acetate buffer and store at 4 °C.\n\t​CAUTION: Sodium azide is highly toxic when ingested orally or absorbed through the skin; it should only be handled under the fume hood.
