    "1. Participant\nRecruit control participants older than 18 years, without a history of neurological dysfunction, significant eye injury, significant depression, major disability and/or electrical implants.\nRecruit Stroke participants older than 18 years, with a history of brain injury in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution, have the ability to complete the Fugl-Meyer Scale, maintain a full range of eye movements35,36, have the ability to perform pointing tasks, and without the history of additional neurological dysfunction, significant eye health comorbidity, significant depression, major disability and/or electrical implants.\nAsk participants to sign a consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board of New York University’s School of Medicine.\nParticipant Screening (for detailed exclusion criteria please see Rizzo et al37)\n\t\nTake history and perform clinical examinations as discussed below.\n\t\t\nAssess the cognitive state of participants with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)38.\nPerform neurological examination.\nExamine extraocular muscles and eye movements.\n\t\t\t\nAsk the participants to follow the researcher’s finger with their eyes while keeping their head in one position. Draw an imaginary H letter in front of them and make sure that your finger moves far enough out and up/down, assessing center, up, down, left, right, down/left, down/right, up/left, and up/right.\nAsk the participants to follow and maintain the gaze on an object moved slowly through their visual field to assess smooth pursuit. Cover a distance of approximately 24 inches and using a pencil as a target, sweep back and forth slowly in horizontal and vertical directions, repeating each three times.\nAsk participants to look as fast as possible between 2 targets that are placed 24 inches apart to assess saccades. Use a pencil and a pen as targets and direct gaze to the targets in a back and forth manner three times horizontally and vertically.",
    "Ask the participants to fixate on an object as it moves slowly towards to their eyes to assess convergence, centering the target, a pencil, on the bridge of their nose. Following this procedure, repeat the test by bringing the same target from the nose back out to the starting position (divergence).\nAsk the patient to cover one eye and look at the researcher’s nose. Move the hand out of the patient’s visual field and then bring it in, wag the finger slowly and ask the patient to let the researcher know when the hand comes back into view, repeat this for upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right quadrants.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: When the patient covers their right eye, cover the left eye, and vice versa.\nAssess the visual impairment by a visual-motor Integration test.\nAssess the visual acuity by Snellen chart39,40.\nAssess the visual field with confrontation and if in question, perform Goldman or Humphrey visual field testing41,42.\nAssess hemi-spatial neglect via line bisection test and the single letter cancellation test43.\nQuantify the extent of disability via 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and a 10-item supplement survey44.\n2. Preparation for the experiment and the physical configuration of equipment\nEquipment:\n\t\nChoose an eye tracker\n\t\t\nChoose an eye tracker that is capable of head-mounted use (to avoid interference with desk-based reach movements) high spatial resolution (≤0.1o) and high temporal resolution (≥250 Hz).\nRecord the binocular eye movement with the eye tracker at a sampling rate of 250 Hz (sampling eye position every 4 ms) tracking both pupil and corneal reflection.\nChoose of a limb tracker\n\t\t\nChoose a limb tracker that can map the movement in the x, y, z position, ³ 0.08 cm accuracy, Latency ³ of 3.5 ms.",
    "Choose a laptop capable of running a customized script that controls real-time integration of data acquired from two systems and co-registering the signals in real-time (Table of Materials).\nChoose a display monitor capable of integrating with the chosen laptop and that is large enough to support one-to-one correspondence between monitor and tabletop reach space\nDefine a rectangle identical in size to the display monitor on a table surface between the participant and the display monitor, to use as a functional reaching space for experimental work.\nSet up preparation:\n\t\nSet up a table with the height adjustable chair.\nPlace a display monitor 40 cm from the far edge of the table (Table of Materials).\nPlace a tabletop board (reaching surface) with the 1-1 ratio dimension with the display monitor.\nSet up the limb tracker by mounting the electromagnetic source under the table (Table of Materials).\nSet up the eye tracker, host PC (Table of Materials).\n\t\t\nAttach four infrared (IR) illuminators to four corners of the monitor using straps.\nSet the eye tracker configurations from eye tracker setup options screen.\n\t\t\t\nSelect 13-point calibration from the pre-set configuration of the eye tracker.\nSelect the high saccade sensitivity to detect small saccade.\nSelect Pupil-CR mode to record both pupils and cornea.\nSelect a sampling rate at 250 Hz.\nParticipant physical preparation\n\t\nSeat participants on a height-adjustable chair at the table with the computer display.\nPosition the participant 60 cm away from the display monitor (Table of Materials).\nFix the motion sensor (Table of Material) to the distal aspect of the index finger of the hand of the to be tested arm (dominant arms for controls, and both arms in participants with stroke)\nPlace the eye tracker on the participants’ headband and adjust the headband and cameras (Table of Materials).\n\t\t\nFitting the headband",
    "Adjust the tightness and position of the headband (using headband knobs) so that the front pad is in the center of the forehead and the side pads above the participant’s ears.\nMake sure that the headband camera is in the center of the forehead and over the bridge of the nose.\nAsk participants to raise their eyebrows, and if the headband moves, refit it higher or lower on the forehead.\nAdjust the camera and corneal illuminator position. Ask the participants to look at the display monitor.\n\t\t\t\nFrom the camera screen, select the head camera image, verify that it shows four large spots from the IR markers that are positioned in the center of the head camera image. If they are not in the center, adjust accordingly.\nFrom the camera setup screen, select one eye at the time. Adjust the two eye cameras by lowering and raising the eye camera handle till the pupil of the eye is in the center of the camera image\nFocus the eye camera by rotating the lens holder.\nSet the pupil threshold by pressing the Auto Threshold button on the camera setup screen.\nPerform the same adjustment for the other eye.\nCalibration\n\t\nCalibrate the limb tracker output to reaching surface using a 9-point calibration, ask the participant to place their sensor attached finger on reaching surface (tabletop) locations as displayed on the monitor screen.\nCalibrate the eye tracker, ask participants to look at the calibration target that appears as a blue dot and maintain fixation until the next dot appears on the screen\n\t\tNOTE: Calibration targets appear in 13 randomly selected positions on the screen\nCalibrate the eye tracker at least twice per session, first one at the start of the experiment and at its halfway point.\n3. Experiment",
    "Ask participants to move their finger onto the start position, covering the start circle on the screen with the finger-indicator dot (red dot), while fixating (eye) the start position on the screen.\n\tNOTE: The start position is a correspondent location of the fixation point (blue dot) displays on the center of the screen (Figure 1a). The position of the finger is represented as 4 mm radius red dot on the screen.\nRequire participants to maintain finger position on the start circle for 150 ms until the target appears.\nEnsure that participants fixate the start position until they hear a beep sound (“go beep”). (Figure 1)\n\tNOTE: The duration between target appearance and the go signal is randomized between 250 to 750 ms to prevent anticipation of the go signal.\nInstruct participants to move both their eyes and fingertip quickly and accurately to the designated target as they hear the beep sound (Figure 1)\n\t\nDesignated target appears 1 cm radius white circle\nInstruct participants to touch the tabletop location at the position of the virtual target as displayed on the screen by lifting the hand and finger and re-connecting the fingertip and tabletop\n\t\nMake sure participants make a pointing movement by lifting the hand and finger rather than dragging the hand and finger on the tabletop.\nDisplay the end location of the reach as a red dot, following reach completion.\nDetermine reach completion by a combination of low-velocity (<5% peak) and 3 mm z-plane threshold.\nAsk participants to perform a series of familiarization trials before starting data acquisition.\nStart data acquisition after participants touched 5 of the last 10 targets successfully.\nAsk participants to perform a series of look and reach trials as they were instructed during familiarization trials.\n\t\nHave participants perform a total of 76 trials.",
    "Have control participants perform the experiment with their dominant hand.\nWhenever it is possible, have participants with stroke perform the experiment with both the hands, more-affected and less-affected.\nParticipants complete the entire experiment with at least one hand.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58885/58885fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic view of setup and experiment. (a) Schematic representation of display monitor and reaching surface during a trial. (b) Sequencing of actions within visually-guided reach. First Fixation (F) appears. The target (T) appears after a randomized length of time. The ‘go’ signal occurs as auditory beep sound (signified by the light-grey vertical bar) after an unpredictable time interval (concurrent offset of F) following by target appearance. Hand (H) and Eye (E) movements follow the go-signal.
