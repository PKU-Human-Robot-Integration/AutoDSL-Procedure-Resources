Mapping the expression pattern of enhancer-trap FLPx2 lines  (* critical steps)\nCollect virgins females from the yw, actinP>CD2>Gal4; UAS-GFP line and cross to males of individual ET-FLPx2 lines.  The former serves as a GFP reporter for tissue expression of ET-FLP.\n*Dissect wandering 3rd instar F1 larvae, retain the CNS (i.e., the brain and the ventral nerve cord, VNC) and the body wall, fix for 1 hour in 4% PFA on ice, wash 3X with ice-cold PBS followed by 3X washes with PBT.\nDissection\nRemove wandering 3rd instar F1 larvae and place them into a clean Sylgard dish (35 mm x 10 mm petri dish filled with 2 grams of Sylgard - mixed according to manufacture instructions).\nRemove food debris with paintbrush\nFill the dish with ice-cold 1XPBS and place on ice to anesthetize the larvae\nHold the mouth hooks of a larva with a pair of forceps and grab the cuticle near the extending anterior spiracle with another pair of forceps and peel the cuticle towards the posterior end. The CNS will be attached to the mouth hooks along with the salivary glands, gut, and imaginal discs.\nRemove the excess tissue and imaginal discs surrounding the CNS.\nTransfer the CNS into a PBS-filled 3 well pyrex dish.\nA siliconized P200 pipette tip can be used to avoid drying the tissue.\nFix for 1 hour in 200 μl of 4% PFA on ice.\nEnsure that the CNS is fully submerged in the PFA.\nIf the CNS floats, this typically suggests that the CNS is not properly cleaned from the surrounding tissue.",

    "Next remove the abdomen from the thorax.  While using a pair of forceps to hold the thorax at the second leg base, use another pair of forceps to grab the abdomen near the 1st abdominal sternite and pull the abdomen off.\nTo remove the VNC from the surrounding thoracic tissue. Hold the humeral area with a pair of forceps and with another pair of forceps gentle tear away the majority of the thoracic carcass.\nAt this point there should be a ring of connective tissue surrounding the cervical connective (neck). Using two forceps tear the ring apart.\nRemove any excess thoracic tissue surrounding the VNC\nTransfer the brain and VNC to 9-well Pyrex dish containing 1X PBS on ice\nA siliconized P200 pipette tip can be used to avoid drying the tissue\n*Fix the adult CNS for 1 hour in 4% PFA on ice and wash 3X with ice-cold PBS and 3X with PBT.\nIncubate the adult CNS preparation or the larval CNS and body wall at 4°C overnight with antibodies to either neurons (anti-Elav, 1:10) or glia (anti-Repo. 1:10).

To preserve the natural shape of the CNS, use an O-shaped plastic ring (Clear Reinforcement Label, Avery Dennison, Office Products, Brea, CA) on the slide as a mini-bridge to suspend the cover slip.\nExamine the preparation for GFP and Elav (or Repo) expression patterns under a fluorescent microscope.\n4.

    "Collect males from the GMR-Gal4, UAS-polyQ; tubP>Gal80> line.  Note that the compound eyes are normal in these flies.\nMate with ey-FLP virgins.\nCollect the F1 flies and examine the eye phenotype.\nFlipping Gal80 in via tubP>stop>Gal80 (Figure 5B).\nCollect GMR-Gal4, UAS-polyQ; tubP>stop>Gal80 male flies and examine the eye phenotype.  Note the degenerate and depigmented eyes in these flies compared to wild type strains (Canton-S)\nMate with ey-FLP virgins;\nCollect the F1 flies and examine the eye phenotype.\nSelect ET-FLPx2 lines with expression in photoreceptor cells\n\t\nSteps 4.1 and 4.2 can be repeated using ET-FLPx2 lines that express FLP in a subset of photoreceptor cells.  Alternatively, either the GMR-Gal4, UAS-polyQ; tubP>stop>Gal80 flies or the GMR-Gal4, UAS-polyQ; tubP>Gal80> flies can be crossed to individual ET-FLPx2 lines to screen for lines that express FLP in photoreceptor cells.  Valuable ET-FLPx2 lines are those that only express FLP in a subset or single photoreceptor cells (Figure 6).\n5. Representative results\nThe expression pattern of a specific ET-FLPx2 line can be readily examined and documented in the F1 larvae or adult flies derived from the cross between yw, actinP>CD2>Gal4; UAS-GFP virgins and ET-FLPx2 males (Figure 1).  Typically, three to five replicates of the F1 animals are dissected and examined to determine the reproducibility of the FLP expression pattern (Bohm et al., 2010).  Figure 2 shows the expression pattern of FLP in ET-FLPx2 line 173A in the larval and adult CNS. The FLP pattern can be further analyzed using a neuronal or glial marker (Figure 3 & 4).",
    "The results shown in Figure 7 illustrate the effectiveness of Gal80 flip-in and flip-out systems in intersectional repression of Gal4 following FLP-mediated recombination.  The tubP>stop>Gal80 construct does not appear to have any leaky expression of Gal80 (based on the uniform degeneration and depigmentation of photoreceptors), and yet it is 100% effective in flipping Gal80 in with the help of eyFLP to repress GMR-Gal4 and restore the eye to normal appearances (Fig. 7A).  On the contrary, tubP>Gal80> fully represses GMR-Gal4 prior to the introduction of eyFLP.  Following Gal80 flip-out, GMR-Gal4 drives UAS-polyQ expression, leading to degenerate and depigmented eyes (Fig. 7B).  In this example, we used a pan-photorecetor FLP to map the photoreceptor 'circuits' but did not examine the behavioral consequences.  Using similar approaches with behaviorally relevant Gal4 lines, we mapped part of the CCAP-Gal4 circuit regulating wing expansion in adult flies (Bohm et al., 2010).  We believe that the FINGR method will be valuable in aiding our understanding of the neuronal basis of behavior.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2649/2649fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Examining the expression pattern of an ET-FLPx2 line. The FLP expression pattern (blue ovals) from an ET-FLPx2 line can be determined by crossing an ET-FLPx2 male (top left) with an actinP>CD2>Gal4; UAS-GFP virgin (top right). Ubiquitous ActinP>Gal4 expression in the parental female is hindered by the insertion of the FRT (grey triangles) flanked CD2 sequence.  In the F1 progeny, FLP will excise the CD2 sequence, permitting ActinP>Gal4 to drive UAS-GFP expression.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2649/2649fig2.jpg",

These images depict the CNS (brain and ventral nerve cord, VNC) dissected from the offspring produced from mating yw, actinP>CD2>Gal4; UAS-GFP parents to the ET-FLPx2 173A line.  By recombining out the >CD2> cassette, FLP activates actinP>GAL4 expression (the consequent expression of UAS-GFP).  Hence, the GFP pattern reports FLP-expressing cells.  Panel A shows the larval FLP expression pattern whereas panel B shows the adult expression pattern in line 173A.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2649/2649fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Figure 5. Illustration of Gal80 Flip-in and Flip-out Strategies. A. In the flip-out strategy, tubulin promoter-driven Gal80 (TubP>Gal80>) is constitutively active, resulting in the repression of GMR-Gal4 and a wild-type eye phenotype (red eye).  This repression is removed by the introduction of FLP (purple), which will flip Gal80 out (middle, red) and allow GMR-Gal4 to drive UAS-polyQ expression.  This results in photoreceptor cell degeneration (illustrated by white dots in the eye). B.   In the reciprocal of the previous strategy, tubulin promoter-driven Gal80 expression is interrupted by FRT (grey triangle) flanked \"stop\" codon.  In the absence of Gal80, GMR-Gal4 binds to UAS-polyQ causing neuronal degeneration in photoreceptors (illustrated by white dots in the eye).  By crossing the GMR-Gal4, UAS-polyQ; tubP>stop>GAL80 males with virgin females which express FLP in the photoreceptor cells, FLP (purple) will catalyze recombination at the FRT sites, excising the \"stop\" codon (middle, red), thus allowing for Gal80 expression and repression of GMR-Gal4. This reserves the neurodegeneration in photoreceptor cells (illustrated by the lack of white dots in the eye).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2649/2649fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

The lack of pigment in the middle of the eye ommatidia represents FLP expression in line #688A. In this area Gal80 suppression of GMR-Gal4 was relieved allowing the Gal4 to drive UAS-polyQ.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2649/2649fig7.jpg",
    "Figure 7. The application of the FINGR method in flipping Gal80 in or out to intersect Gal4 in photoreceptors. A. The tubP>stop>Gal80 flip-in system restricts GAL4 expression in an FLP-dependent manner.   In GMR-Gal4, UAS-polyQ; tubP>stop>GAL80 flies, photoreceptor cells are degenerate and depigmented (left fly).  Following the introduction of eyFLP, Gal80 is expressed in photoreceptor cells, resulting in full repression of GMR-Gal4, which in turn turns off the expression polyQ and produces flies with normal eyes (right fly). B. The tubP>Gal80> flip-out system works in the opposite fashion as the tubP>stop>Gal80 flip-in system.  TubP>Gal80> constitutively represses GAL4 and suppresses the expression of polyQ (left fly, with normal eyes).  Following the introduction of eyFLP, Gal80 is flipped out from photoreceptor cells, relieving the suppression of GMR-Gal4 and turning on the expression polyQ.  This leads to flies with degenerate and depigmented eyes (right fly)."
