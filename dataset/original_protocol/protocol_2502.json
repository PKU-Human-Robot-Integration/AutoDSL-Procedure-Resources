The creation of this complex is required to ensure that targets and their respective foundations colocalize on the sequencing chip. In this protocol, the total concentration of foundations is 120 pM. Concentrations should be optimized according to the number of targets included (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] for more details).\nThaw cololinker stock solution, foundation, and Spot-tag peptide oligonucleotide conjugate on ice.\nPrepare buffers detailed in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section and the PhiX solution according to manufacturer instructions.\nNote: Buffers may be prepared in bulk for subsequent runs, except for the chip blocking solution.\nIn a 96-well plate, combine the Hybridization Buffer, cololinker stock solution, and foundations in the order listed below. Add the target last, immediately prior to hybridization.\nFor positive controls, we used DNA targets (DNA Target 4.O1 and 6.O1), where binding occurs through complementary regions on the target and binder. For null control targets, we used a version of the peptide oligonucleotide tail without 5′ phosphorylation (CLR.Null.Block) and another without the peptide attached (5′Phos.01).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_7.csv\n∗The C-terminal of the peptide targets is directly conjugated to the 3′ end of one DNA tail via a cysteine. ∗∗Binding sequences and DNA tails of DNA targets are continuous oligos rather than conjugated through another chemical conjugation method.\nNote: The final molecular ratios for individual components are 5:1 foundation to forward cololinker, 3:1 forward cololinker to reverse cololinker, and 10:1 Target to reverse cololinker.\nThermocycle under the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_8.csv\nNote: While hybridizing target-foundation complexes on the thermocycler, begin preparing binders via hybridization to the universal bridge (see step 16).\nDisplaying target-foundation complexes on the NGS chip",
    "Timing: 45–60 min\nIn this section, the target-foundation complex is ligated onto the chip, and the chip is blocked to decrease non-specific binding to the chip surface and ligated sequences (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCreate the Foundation Mix.\nMix gently by pipetting up and down.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_9.csv\nCritical: The overall concentration in solution should not exceed 120 pM for optimal clustering during sequencing runs.\nDilute each target mixture to 0.5 nM.\nCarefully remove the chip from its original cylindrical container. Blot dry to remove salts left from the chip storage buffer.\nNote: Retain the original storage buffer in the cylindrical container and store at 4°C until sequencing has been performed. This buffer can be used to temporarily store the chip if the user needs to pause the experiment. See Pause Point after step 43.\nWash the sequencing chip twice.\nTo wash, inject 100 μL of the Hybridization Buffer into either port on the sequencing chip (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2136-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. NGS chip manual fluid manipulation\nFluid is pipetted into the chip through either of the ports, and exits through the other port. The last 5 μL of fluid remains inside the channel.\nWash the sequencing chip with 30 μL of Foundation Mix twice.\nNote: Blocking components should be added in greater than or equal to 2 times in excess of the component the user intends to block.\nNote: The BSA in blocking solution is intended to block off-target binding to the glass surface of the sequencing chip.\nIncubate the sequencing chip at 28°C for 15 min on a hotplate.\nWash the sequencing chip once with 100 μL of 100% formamide to remove unligated elements.\nCritical: All steps involving formamide should be performed in an appropriate certified chemical fume hood.\nHeat the sequencing chip at 40°C for 90 s on a hotplate.",
    "Wash the sequencing chip with 500 μL of Blocking Buffer.\nWash the sequencing chip with 30 μL of Chip Blocking solution twice.\nIncubate the sequencing chip at 37°C for 15 min on a hot plate.\nPreparing binders via hybridization to universal bridge\nTiming: 75–90 min\nIn this section, binder tails are hybridized to the universal bridge. The universal bridge is required to form a double-stranded nick between the binder tail and the foundation so the binder barcode can be ligated to the foundation. Positive control binders DNA Binder 4.2 and DNA Binder 6 bind to DNA Target DNA Target 4.O1 and 6.O1, respectively. The negative control DNA Binder 9 contains a binding region consisting of a scrambled DNA sequence that should bind to none of the targets present, serving as a control for noise.\nHybridize the positive and negative control binders to the universal bridge. This may be performed in a single reaction.\nIn one Eppendorf tube, combine:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_10.csv\n∗Each /i5NitInd/ is a 5-Nitroindole, a universal base analogue that exhibits high duplex stability and hybridizes indiscriminately with each of the four natural bases (Loakes and Brown, 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nHeat the mixture of DNA binders to 95°C for 5 min.\nCool to 25°C for 1 h.\nWhile waiting for the controls to hybridize to the universal bridge, hybridize the anti-Spot-Tag nanobody to the universal bridge.\nCombine the anti-Spot-Tag nanobody with 5 times excess universal bridge.\nNote: A 1:1 ratio of binder to universal bridge may also be used here. We used a 1:5 ratio of nanobody to universal bridge because the method used to conjugate the nanobody to the oligonucleotide tail made it possible for multiple oligonucleotide tails to attach to each POC and because excess oligonucleotide tail used during conjugation was not purified away.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_11.csv",
    "Heat the anti-Spot-Tag nanobody solution to 37°C for 30 min.\nCool the anti-Spot-Tag nanobody solution to 25°C for 30 min.\nAfter cooling, combine the solutions to generate the Binder Incubation Solution as below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_12.csv\nPerforming binding and barcode capture\nTiming: 90 min\nIn this section, binders are incubated with targets on the NGS chip, binder barcodes are ligated to foundations to “record” the binding event, and restriction enzyme digestion is performed to remove binders from the platform.\nWash the sequencing chip with 100 μL of Hybridization Buffer for 60 s twice.\nWash the sequencing chip with 100 μL of Incubation Buffer for 60 s.\nGently mix the prepared binder library by pipetting it up and down.\nSlowly load 30 μL of the Binder Incubation Solution onto the sequencing chip twice.\nIncubate the sequencing chip on a hotplate at 25°C for 30 min.\nWash the sequencing chip with 100 μL of Incubation Buffer for 90 s three times.\nDilute 7 μL of 2× Blunt/TA MM Ligase solution in 63 μL of Hybridization buffer and mix gently.\nLoad 30 μL of the diluted ligase solution onto the sequencing chip twice.\nIncubate the chip for 5 min in a hotplate at 28°C.\nTerminate the ligation reaction by washing the sequencing chip with 100 μL of 1× CutSmart solution for 60 s three times.\nPrepare the restriction enzyme mix by combining reagents in the order below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_13.csv\nGently mix after combining.\nLoad 30 μL of the restriction enzyme mix onto the sequencing chip twice.\nIncubate the sequencing chip at 40°C on a hotplate for 30 min.\nNote: Begin preparing reagents required for DNA sequencing of binder barcodes (see step 39).\nTerminate the restriction digestion reaction by loading the sequencing chip with 100 μL of 100% formamide.",
    "Critical: All steps involving formamide should be performed in a certified chemical fume hood.\nIncubate the sequencing chip at 40°C on a hotplate for 90 s.\nWash the sequencing chip with 500 μL of Hybridization Buffer.\nOptional: Additional cycles of binding and barcode capture (steps 16–38) may be repeated for a multi-cycle experiment.\nDNA sequencing of binder barcodes\nTiming: 4–5 h\nIn this section, a universal NGS adapter is ligated to the binder barcode with the assistance of a universal NGS adapter bridge (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], steps 5–7). The NGS adapter facilitates direct amplification and sequencing of the foundation with binder barcode.\nThaw the sequencing cartridge at 25°C.\nPrepare the NGS ligation mix by combining the reagents below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2136_14.csv\nLoad 30 μL of the NGS ligation mix onto the sequencing chip twice.\nIncubate the sequencing chip on a hotplate at 40°C for 2 min and 24 s.\nWash the sequencing chip twice with 500 μL of NF H2O.\nWait 90 s in between washes.\nPause point: If users are unable to start the sequencing run after finishing NGS ligation, wash the chip with the buffer that the sequencing chip was originally stored in, return the chip to the cylindrical container, and keep at 4°C for no more than 24 h. When ready to sequence, wash the chip twice with 500 μL of NF H2O prior to continuing on to step 44.\nDilute 20 μL of 20 pM PhiX in 580 μL of HT1 Buffer (supplied with MiSeq cartridges).\nLoad the PhiX solution into the sample well of the sequencing cartridge.",
    "Note: This protocol conducts a 45–600 cycle read using a V2 nano chip. If the pre-run check produces a flow error, exchange the plastic hinged piece that contains the gasket on the flow cell with the same piece from an old flow cell after thorough rinsing with 70% Ethanol and NF H2O.\nLoad the sequencing chip, the cartridge, and the running buffer into the MiSeq according to the onscreen MiSeq sequencing run instructions.\nStart the sequencing run."
