    "Generation of mice expressing GCaMP6f in exocrine acinar cells To generate Mist1+/–;GCaMP6f+/– transgenic mice, cross 2–7 months old female homozygous GCaMP6fflox mice (Jackson Laboratory; 028865) with 2–9 months old male heterozygous Mist1CreERT2 (Jackson Laboratory; 029228). Genotyping was carried out according to protocols supplied by the Jackson Laboratory (Genotyping protocols 27076 and 20626, respectively).To induce GCaMP expression in acinar cells, treat Mist1+/–;GCaMP6f+/– mice at least 6 weeks old with tamoxifen. Prepare 60 mg/mL tamoxifen in corn oil, and administer 0.25 mg/g body weight by oral gavage once a day for three consecutive days, using a plastic feeding tube attached to a 1 mL syringe. Imaging is carried out 1–4 weeks after the last tamoxifen administration.Animal preparation Anesthetize the animal with Ketamine [80 mg/kg body weight, intraperitonially (i.p.)] and Xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.). Place the animal on a custom-made mouse-restrainer with the ventral side up (Figure 1C–E ). Place a heat pad (HotHands, Kobayashi) under the restrainer and wrap the animal’s body with a cotton sheet, to prevent hypothermia. Perform a toe-pinch intermittently, at least every 10–20 min, to evaluate the depth of anesthesia. Additional anesthetic of 20–40 mg/kg ketamine, is given when necessary.To remove hair at the surgical region, apply hair remover cream to the animal’s neck, then wipe with 70% ethanol. With a pair of scissors, make an incision at the neck just anterior to the clavicles, through the end of the masseter muscle (Figure 1D). Lift the incised skin to expose the submandibular/sublingual glands. Carefully tease away connective tissues surrounding the gland using two pairs of forceps, until the gland is detached from the body, except by a bundle composed of blood vessels, nerve, and the secretory duct, at the anterior side of the gland (Figures 1C–E ).",
    "Lift the gland and insert a pair of tungsten wires to the bundle, one at the base near the body, and the other at where the bundle is connected to the gland. Connect the other ends of the wires to the stimulator.Place the gland on a 11 × 17 mm custom build small holder situated directly above the neck, so that the position of the gland is not influenced by movement as a result of breathing (Figure 1C, 1E). Apply Hanks salt solution in the holder, apply petroleum jelly or silicone gel at the edge of the holder, then place a cover glass onto the gland, so that the surface of the gland is flattened, but the gland is not overtly squeezed by pressure.In vivo imaging  Attach an objective heater to the 25× water immersion lens prior to the imaging session, to equilibrate the lens temperature to 37°C. Tune the excitation laser connected to an upright microscope at 950 nm. Set the emission filter at 495–540 nm.Place the animal on the microscope stage. Apply Hank’s solution between the objective lens and the cover glass holding the gland. Turn on a gooseneck light source and adjust the focus in bright field view through eyepieces. Find a flat clean region of the submandibular gland for imaging. Connect the stimulator to the pulse generator. Turn off the light source and keep the microscope stage dark, by covering the microscope with a black curtain and keeping the room dark. Set the resonance scanner of the FV31s-SW laser-scanning system to 30 frames per second, and collect an average of 3 frames as a single frame, to achieve a 10 fps image collection rate.",
    "The image resolution is 512 × 512 pixels, and the magnification is adjusted by zooming with scanner control, typically from 2× to 4× zoom.Adjust the laser power so that the baseline fluorescence is faintly visible, about 20% of saturation (Figure 2A). PMT settings are fixed at 600 V, 1× gain, and 3% black level. Find the surface of that gland by moving focus, and set the registered depth as 0 µm. We typically image at depths between 10 and 55 µm from the surface of the gland. Adjust the laser power as depth changes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4380/bioprotoc-12-07-4380-g002.jpgFigure 2. Image analyses of in vivo salivary gland imaging.  A. Images of acinar cells in submandibular gland before, and during low (3 Hz), or high (10 Hz) stimulations. B. Post-processing for spatio-temporal patterns of Ca2+ by nerve input. The image was subdivided into 8 × 8 grids, and average fluorescence intensity was obtained for each grid. C–D. Grid-analyses of an imaging field responding to 1–10 Hz stimulation. Grid images showing peak intensities (C) and time-course plots. Stimulation at the indicated frequency was applied between 10–22 s (D).A test time-course set of images is taken for 30 s without external stimulation. Acinar cell fluorescence should be stable without spontaneous flickering, and the imaging field should not drift in XY or Z directions.Start the image collection set from 30 s to 5 min. During the image collection, deliver a train of electrical stimulation using a stimulus isolator set at 5 mA for 200 µs, controlled by a pulse generator set to 1–10 Hz, for 12 s up to 5 min (Figure 2A). After a series of images are captured, allow 1–5 min of resting time before the next image capture, to let the tissue fully recover from the stimulation applied.",
    "For line scan imaging, find an acinar cell cluster that is orientated in the image plane, such that apical and basal sides of the acinar cell are clearly identified, and the imaging plane depth crosses near the center of the cell (Figure 3A). After the capture of a single image of a chosen field, a line is drawn in the image from the apical end, passing through the nucleus, to the basal aspect of an acinar cell. The scanning speed of the line varies according to the length of the line, and is typically 1–1.6 ms per line (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4380/bioprotoc-12-07-4380-g003.jpgFigure 3. Image analyses of line-scan salivary gland imaging. A. An image of a lobule showing radial arrangement of acinar cells, with the apical side at the center and the basal side at the circumference (dotted line). A line was defined in a cell from the apical end through the nucleus until the basal end (solid line). B. Line scan images across an acinar cell during 3 or 10 Hz stimulation, showing localization of Ca2+ at the apical side of the cell without intracellular Ca2+ spread toward the basal side. C. Time-course plots from regions of interest (ROI’s) representing the apical (red), cytoplasmic (blue), and basal (green) regions, responding to 3 Hz (left panel), 5 Hz (middle panel), and 10 Hz (right panel) stimulations.Continue to perform a toe-pinch intermittently, at every 10–20 min, to evaluate the depth of anesthesia. Additional anesthetics of 20–40 mg/kg ketamine is given when necessary. Otherwise, administer 0.1 mL of saline solution every 30 min, to prevent dehydration. After the imaging, the animals are euthanized under anesthesia, according to a procedure approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources."
