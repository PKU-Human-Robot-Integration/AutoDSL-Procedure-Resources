    "1. Spinotrapezius Feed Artery Ligation Surgery\nAnesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection. In a 0.5 ml syringe, formulate:\n    0.06 ml of 100 mg/ml Ketamine\n    0.03 ml of 20.0 mg/ml Xylazine\n    0.01 ml of 0.4 mg/ml Atropine \n    0.30 ml of 0.9% Saline.\n    Dose: 0.01 ml* per gram body weight, i.p.\n  \n*Dose variable upon mouse strain and stock, adjust accordingly so mouse recovery is within an hour from induction.\nApply standard ophthalmic ointment to prevent corneal desiccation.  \nRemove hair from the back using trimming clippers, followed by brief application of depilatory cream.\nDisinfect the surgical field with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine. Alternate povidone-iodine with ethanol three times, ending with povidone-iodine.\nTransfer the mouse to the previously prepared surgical work surface, with heating pad and sterile drape in place.\nCreate a linear incision (3-5 mm) through the dorsal skin approximately 5 mm caudal to the bony prominence of the shoulder blade using iris scissors and standard pattern forceps (e.g. FST, 11271-30) by tenting the tissue and cutting parallel to the spine. The target incision site may be identified by transdermal visualization of the dorsal fat pad if skin pigmentation permits; cut at the caudal border of the fat pad. Expand the incision as needed, and extend through secondary skin layers using spring scissors.\n    \nAnatomical note - The spinotrapezius muscle lies dorsally and extends from T4 to L3 along either side of the spine. The anterior border extends laterally to approximately the shoulder blade. The muscle tapers in the caudal direction so that the most posterior border lies medial to the anterior border, and may lay flush with the spine. Two fat pads are also important to note, laying directly dorsal and ventral to the spinotrapezius muscle towards the cranial half.",
    "Inflammation due to the incision has been shown to have no effect on the vascular remodeling response, as sham ligation surgery showed no change in remodeling of the spinotrapezius vasculature. Two spatial factors contribute to this outcome. First the incision is removed by 5 mm in the cranial direction from the region of interest where the vascular response in the muscle is typically examined. Additionally, the incision site on the dorsal skin is separated from the vessel ligation site by a ventral fat pad that lies on top of the cranial third of the spinotrapezius muscle. \nIrrigate the incision with warmed Ringer's solution to prevent muscle desiccation. Application of vasodilators such as papaverine will assist in visualizing the target artery for ligation.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, use forceps to blunt dissect and separate (but not remove) the dorsal white-fat pad from the underlying muscular tissue in order to visualize the vasculature as it enters and leaves the spinotrapezius on its lateral edge.",
    "Locate the target artery, which along with one or two paired veins, passes through the fat pad that is ventral to the spinotrapezius on its way in to the lateral edge of the muscle. This artery feeds a substantial portion of the caudal half of the muscle, which can be confirmed by reflecting and replacing the muscle to observe the path of the artery within the muscle. The target location for ligation is the segment of the artery exiting the ventral fat pad and entering the muscle, and is quite accessible in this region. The artery-vein pair may need to be gently separated from the ventral fat pad in this region.  Note that the spinotrapezius is fed by multiple artery-vein pairs, including vessels that transverse either the dorsal and ventral fat pads. Take care not to disrupt these vessels.\n    \nMultiple indicators may be used to distinguish artery from vein. One of the best methods is to gently obstruct blood flow with the microprobe and move upstream away from the muscle; flow will not resume in the artery until the obstruction is released. Color can also be used, as vein walls contain a whitish sheath of connective tissue that arteries lack. Further, one may consider the diameter before application of vasodilator as veins are typically larger in size. \nThe artery is typically in close proximity to its paired vein; use blunt dissection with a microprobe and #5 forceps to isolate an approximately 5 mm segment, by passing the microprobe behind the artery, and using the tip to make a wider gap in the natural cleft between the artery and vein. This is the gap through which the suture will be threaded.",
    "Using 10-0 single-thread suture and needle holder place a ligation around the feed artery  (~70 μm diameter) towards the proximal end of the dissected segment using a surgeon's knot. Place an additional ligation towards the distal end of the dissected artery segment, with sufficient separation between ligatures to allow for transection of the artery.\n    \nThe small scale associated with the spinotrapezius feed artery leads to increased surgical difficulty, compared to ligation of a larger vessel such as the femoral artery. Inexperienced surgeons particularly will have high rates of avulsion, inadvertent hemorrhaging, and other surgical complications. Of particular concern is the difficulty of identifying and cutting the colorless artery after flow has been impeded just before cutting. For these reasons, placing 2 ligatures is recommended for those unaccustomed to the procedure, as the surgeon has a visual guide in locating where to transect the artery as well as a confirmation of the cut with the readily observable separation of the 2 ligatures. However, a more experienced surgeon may find a single ligature sufficient, as long as they are able to clearly identify and cut the artery downstream of the ligature. While this technique reduces the risk of unintentionally nicking a nearby vessel with the sharp ligation suture, it is not without drawbacks, including increased difficulty in confirming the artery was transected.\nVerify ligation by observing diminution of blood flow (obstructed RBC column) downstream of the ligation site (i.e. towards the muscle). \nUsing dissecting scissors transect the ligated artery, between the two ligatures. If only one ligature was placed (11a), cut with extreme care in the downstream direction. \nDrug loaded plain-film (1 mm) may be placed downstream (caudally) as part of experimental procedure. \nReposition the displaced fascia and adipose tissue to their original orientation.",
    "Close the skin incision using 8-0 non-resorbable sutures. Then place the mouse in a prepared heated recovery cage under observation and administer an appropriate analgesic such as bupivacaine, 0.02-0.05 ml 0.25% local infiltration. \n2. Spinotrapezius Intravital Microscopy, in situ\nAnesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber with 3-4% isoflurane vaporized in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 3-4 L·min-1.\n    \nThe use of inhalant anesthesia is preferable for functional measurements because there is less cardiovascular depression than with injectable anesthetics. If inhalant anesthesia in not available, long-acting injectable anesthetics, such as sodium pentobarbital are preferred to avoid repeat injections once the animal has been positioned.\nOnce anesthetized, continually deliver isoflurane through an anesthesia mask (aka nose cone) at maintenance concentrations (generally ~ 2%) and flow rate of 0.5-1 L·min-1.\n    \nMice predominately ventilate through their nasal passages, so it is only necessary to cover their nose with the anesthesia mask diaphragm. \nIf necessary, remove hair from the back using trimming clippers and depilatory cream. \nTransport the animal to the heat pad.\n    \nIt is important to maintain mice in a euthermic state to prevent cold-induced vasoconstriction; this can be accomplished through lamps, water circulating heat pads, microwavable heats pads, etc.\nInsert the rectal temperature probe and set thermo-controller to 35 °C.\nMake a skin incision at the caudal end of the spinotrapezius using iris scissors and standard pattern forceps.\nExtend the incision cranially to the fat pad, creating a horse shoe incision, and cover the skin flap with plastic wrap to prevent desiccation.    \nBlunt dissect the subcutaneous connective tissue with forceps and spring scissors to maximize visibility. \nPlace stimulating electrodes as close together as possible, to minimize the size of the current field, and position them at the caudal end of the exposed muscle just lateral to the spine.",
    "Perform a test stimulation to confirm electrode placement using an electrode data acquisition system, electrode stimulus isolator, and computer controller, with square waves of a 200 μsec duration, 2 mA amplitude, delivered at 1 Hz. \nPlace plastic wrap over the exposed muscle to prevent desiccation.    \nBegin timing a 30 min period during which vessel diameters will equilibrate. \nPosition the intravital microscope over the spinotrapezius muscle to view the vascular architecture.\n    \nIf using an immersion lens, place a drop of PBS between the objective and the plastic wrap. \nStarting above the main arteriole (the largest vessel visible), manipulate the stage in the X-Y plane to locate the vessel of interest.\n    \nVisualizing small arterioles with reflected-light microscopy requires greater contrast than provided by the red-cell column. We primarily use a side-stream dark-field imaging microscope to enhance microvascular contrast, but contrast can also be improved with a reflected-light fluorescent microscope after the intravenous injection of a high-molecular weight fluorescent dextran. \nAfter the 30-min equilibration, capture an image/video of the vessel of interest. \nStimulate the muscle with square waves of 200 μsec duration, 2 mA amplitude, delivered at 8 Hz, for 90 sec, as described above. \nCapture another image/video immediately post stimulation and continue to capture every minute until vessel has returned to the resting diameter, ~10 min. \nRepeat steps 6-18 using the contralateral muscle.    \nData analysis can be performed in real time with video calipers or off-line with image analysis software.    \nEuthanize the mouse following IACUC protocol. \n3. Spinotrapezius Tissue Harvest and Fixation\nAnesthetize mice by intraperitoneal injection; formulation as in Spinotrapezius Feed Artery Ligation step 1.    \nMake an incision several millimeters cranial to the bony prominence of the mouse's shoulder blade using iris scissors and standard pattern forceps. Expand the incision laterally and then caudally on both sides.",
    "Release the skin from dorsal torso by gently reflecting the skin and cutting the superficial fascia.\nUse blunt dissection to remove dorsal adipose tissue using standard forceps, and then reflect the muscle and similarly dissect ventral adipose tissue. \nRemove fascia overlying the muscle using forceps and spring scissors. This step can be difficult and time consuming, but is important to improve immunofluorescent staining and imaging. Keeping the tissue hydrated can ease removal of the fascia. \nLocate the lateral border of the muscle, and use blunt dissection to separate the spinotrapezius muscle from the fat pad that lies ventral to it. \nContinue the blunt dissection in a cranial to caudal direction. Note that several blood vessels enter and leave this ventral surface of the muscle; if perfusion is required, it should be performed before transecting these vessels. Note also that in the caudal half of the muscle, its lateral border inserts into the muscle lying ventral to it. Some cutting may be required along this border to completely define and free the edge. \nExcise the spinotrapezius muscle. To do this:\n    \nFree the lateral edge of the muscle as described above.        \nCut transversely across the muscle's most cranial extent.        \nCut along the medial border (along the spine), in the sagittal plane. \nRepeat procedure steps 4-9 on the contralateral muscle, and then euthanize the mouse by an IACUC approved method. \nFix the tissues on gelatin-coated glass slides by immersion in chilled methanol (4 °C) or in a 4% paraformaldehyde/deionized water solution at RT for 20 min.",
    "Alternatively, perfusion fixation may be employed. Prior to step 2, perform a thoracotomy, make an incision in the right atrium, and perfuse vasculature with 5 ml of 1×Tris-buffered saline with  0.1 mM CaCl2 and 2% heparin via the left ventricle, followed by 5 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde for vessel fixation, and finally 5 ml of 1×Tris-buffered saline with 0.1 mM CaCl2 7. \nImmediately following fixation, wash specimen four times for 20 min each using 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% saponin."
