    "The protocol described here was approved by the Ethical Committee of Peking University First Hospital (PKUFH 2018-223). The procedures adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects. The study format was described, and informed consent was obtained from the parents of the participants.\n1. Preparation of the apparatus\nNOTE: The AACP components were set up in a mildly illuminated test room. Drapes were pulled in the room to avoid interference from sunlight. A display system, a recording system, and an analysis system were the three components of the AACP (Figure 1).\nSet up a display system, a 28 inch liquid-crystal display monitor (62.208 cm x 34.992 cm screen, 3840 pixels x 2160 pixels, 0.162 mm/pixel, 30 Hz frame rate). Place the display monitor on a table that can be raised. Linearize the screen luminance by an 8-bit look-up table. Set the luminance at 1 cd/m2, 200 cd/m2, and 400 cd/m2 for black, mid-gray, and white, respectively.\nPlace two side panels on either side of the screen to reduce distractions for the children being tested.\nSet up a recording system, a high-definition pro webcam with a resolution of 1080 pixels/30 fps.\n\tNOTE: The webcam records image sequences of testers' behaviors, each cropped at 1280 pixels x 720 pixels. During automated acuity testing, one time-stamped webcam image is obtained every 200 ms for synchronization.\nConnect the display monitor and webcam to a computer, the analysis system. Ensure that the webcam is located in the center, directly below the screen, and is able to be adjusted as needed.\n\tNOTE: The monitor and webcam are either integrated with the computer (a laptop or desktop PC) or are separate devices that are then attached to a computer.",
    "Install the AACP procedure software on the computer for the presentation of stimuli and the analysis of eye movements. The AACP procedure software (China National Invention Patents, No. 201910865074.4 and No. 201510919621.4) comprises a stimulus displaying module, a vision testing module, and a testing result processing module.\nSet the visual stimuli as a 12 cm x 12 cm square-wave grating with different period/degree (cpd) spatial frequencies and a contrast ratio of 1.00. Ensure that the stimulus is displayed randomly in the center of the left or right portion of the screen, and that the rest of the screen shows a luminance-matched gray area similar to the TACII.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: At the detection distance of 55 cm (which is consistent with that of TACII), the stimuli were approximately the same (due to pixel size limitations) as those on printed TACII cards (16 cards, 1/2 octave).\n2. Eye-tracking calibration\nObtain informed consent from the parents, and describe the study format to them.\nPosition the child at a distance of 55 cm from the display monitor. Let the child sit alone on a chair or, preferably, on the parent's lap. If the child sits alone, let the parent sit alongside the child.\nAdjust the position of the lifting table and place it with the monitor. Arrange the screen perpendicular to the child's eyes.\nAdjust the position of the webcam to ensure that the child's face is visible in the recording system and to avoid capturing faces other than the child's.\nPrior to starting the procedure, inform the child that they will be watching the screen. Instruct the parent to prompt the child to look at the screen when the child is not paying attention. No specific instructions are necessary during the test.",
    "Open the AACP procedure software. Type the child's information into the software (name, sex, age).\nClick on the Start button. The software starts the calibration procedure. A graphics interchange format (GIF) image (2.0736 cm x 2.0736 cm, 128 x 128 pixels) appears against the white background in the center of the screen (Figure 2). The image and background music appears simultaneously. This stimulus is presented for at least 3 s. The analysis system simultaneously determines whether the child's line of sight is fixated on the image. If no gaze data are available within 1 min during this presentation, the screen presents another cartoon GIF image. When gaze coordinates are detected within this region, the test procedure starts without the actions of the tester and runs automatically.\n3. Testing procedure\nPresent the initial grating. The spatial frequencies of the gratings range from 0.33-30.0 cpd in 1/2 octave steps. Determine the initial grating by the child's age, as in the TACII test.\nPresent the initial grating for 1,000 ms, which is the length of a trial. Then, present a blank screen for 200 ms. Present the same stimulus again, followed by a blank screen again. Present the grating of the same spatial frequency set three times.\nDuring execution of the procedure, let the webcam record the child's facial pictures. The software uses these pictures to analyze their watching behavior. The vision testing program checks the eye movement responses with the criteria stated in Table 1 to determine whether the stimulus has been seen (Figure 3).\nLet the testing result processing program present the subsequent stimulus, according to the protocol shown in Figure 411.",
    "After every three trials, present a GIF image (with background music) as a visual reward to maintain the child's interest. If no gaze data are usable (e.g., if the child turned around or had their eyes closed) within 1 min of the GIF image presentation, stop the test. This test outputs no result.\nAfter performing steps 3.4 and 3.5, analyze the grating acuity results for the child outputted by the software programs.\nSubscription Required.
