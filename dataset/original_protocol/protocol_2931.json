    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocols below detail the component steps for stereotactic intracranial injections of AAV. Variations in the steps are noted when injecting cells to generate GEM-derived allografts (see generation of GEM-derived allografts[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]).\nAnesthetizing the mouse\nTiming: 10–30 min\nThe following steps detail the procedures for administering injectable ketamine/xylazine anesthetic and for assessing depth of anesthesia.\nPrepare the ketamine/xylazine anesthetic solution\nMake the ketamine/xylazine solution as described in the materials and equipment section of this protocol.\nFilter sterilize solution by passing the solution through a 0.22 μm filter with a syringe.\nWeigh mouse to be anesthetized. Record weight (in grams) and return mouse to cage.\nUse a 1 mL syringe to slowly draw up volume of ketamine/xylazine mixture at 5 μL per gram of body weight, achieving a final dose of 140 mg/kg ketamine and 12 mg/kg xylazine.\nTurn the syringe needle up and plunge the syringe to expel any air bubbles in the syringe.\nSet syringe down on a clean surface. Use caution with the exposed needle tip.\nAdminister the ketamine/xylazine solution\nHold and stabilize the mouse in one hand with a controlled and firm grip.\nUse an alcohol pad to sterilize the intraperitoneal injection site.\nAnesthetize the mouse by injecting it with the pre-filled 1 mL syringe intraperitoneally.\nPlace mouse in separate clean cage to allow for anesthesia to take effect.\nAssess depth of anesthesia\nThe mouse should exhibit slowed movements within 1–2 min of injection.\nBegin checking for depth of anesthesia approximately 5–10 min following injection. Perform toe pinch test and assess for presence of reflexive movements after a firm pinch to one of the hind feet of the mouse. Adequate depth of anesthesia may take 15 min or longer following injection.",
    "Once mouse is fully anesthetized, apply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], right) and use clippers to shave the fur above the skull. Duration of anesthesia is approximately 1–2 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2676-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Application of local anesthetic and ophthalmic ointment\nLeft: Administration of meloxicam local anesthetic. Right: Administration of ophthalmic ointment.\nCritical: Ensure that the mouse is fully anesthetized and does not move in response to the toe pinch test. It is important to anesthetize the mouse fully prior to performing intracranial injections. The skull is well-innervated, and this procedure can cause pain if the mouse is not fully anesthetized. Intracranial surgeries performed without sufficient anesthesia can cause movement during skull drilling and undue pain and suffering to the mouse.\nNote: We utilize ketamine/xylazine, extended-release buprenorphine, and meloxicam for anesthesia/analgesia for these surgeries, although alternative anesthetics may be used (e.g., isoflurane).\nAdminister local anesthetic\nUsing previously recorded weight of mouse, draw up appropriate volume of 0.5 mg/mL meloxicam in 1 mL syringe to achieve 0.5 mg/kg dose.\nTurn syringe needle up and expel any bubbles in syringe.\nAdminister meloxicam subcutaneously to the scruff between the ears (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], left).\nIntracranial injection\nTiming: 5–15 min\nThese steps include positioning of the mouse into the stereotactic frame and intracranial injection of AAV.\nPosition anesthetized mouse into stereotactic frame.\nPlace anesthetized mouse onto the stage.\nLoosen screw on the nose positioning piece (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) and hook front teeth of mouse into the designated bite hook. Tighten screw on nose piece.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2676-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Positioning in stereotactic frame\nAnesthetized mouse positioned in stereotactic frame with ear pins and nose stabilizer in place. (A) Nose piece; (B) ear pins.\nPosition ear pins into the mouse. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].",
    "The mouse’s head should be securely immobilized in the stereotactic frame. Test this by applying gentle but firm downward pressure onto the mouse’s head. The mouse’s head should remain in place when firm pressure is applied.\nCritical: Mouse positioning should be very stable prior to proceeding to next step. If the mouse is not securely positioned into the stereotactic frame, the mouse may move during skull drilling, leading to inaccurate burr hole creation.\nUse an alcohol pad to disinfect the skin surface overlaying the skull.\nMake a 1–1.5 cm incision in the craniocaudal direction to expose the skull (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2676-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Anatomical landmarks\nAnesthetized mouse positioned in stereotactic frame. Guide needle is positioned on the bregma with coordinates zeroed. (A) outer membrane, removed from exposed skull surface; (B) Lambda: (C) Bregma.\nUse a cotton-tipped applicator and gentle pressure to rub the outer membrane away from the exposed skull (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], top left).\nNote: The membrane is clear and will feel slick. The underlying skull will feel noticeably less slick and rougher when rubbed with the cotton-tipped applicator.\nPosition the guide needle (3 mL syringe with a 25 G needle attached) into the syringe holder on the stereotactic frame (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], top right).\nNote: The guide needle is used to zero the coordinates on the stereotactic frame. The coordinates from this positioning will be used to determine the site of virus injection.\nPosition the needle directly centered on the bregma (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], top right).\nNote: A detailed image of the exposed skull anatomy is included in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] (top middle) to guide visualization of the anatomical landmarks. The guide needle tip may gently touch the skull to confirm accurate positioning, but do not pierce the skull with the guide needle.",
    "Zero the anterior/posterior and medial/lateral coordinates on the stereotactic frame (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], bottom).\nCritical: Ensure that the guide needle is positioned precisely at the location of the bregma. Inaccurate zeroing of the coordinates at the bregma may lead to inaccurate viral injection site.\nWith the guide needle still in place, use the stereotactic frame adjustments to move the guide needle 1 mm posterior and 1 mm lateral to the bregma.\nDrill a burr hole into the skull at this coordinate position.\nPosition the tip of the guide needle 0.5–1 cm above the surface of the skull to indicate injection site.\nUse the handheld drill to carefully drill a small burr hole at this location on the skull (1 mm poster and 1 mm lateral to the bregma) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], left, middle). See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2676-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Intracranial injection\nLeft: handheld drill with guide needle positioned 1 mm lateral and 1 mm posterior to the bregma; middle: burr hole formed following drilling into skull; right: 5 μL syringe used to intracranially inject 1 μL virus.\nApply gentle pressure and retract drill bit as soon as pressure abates, indicating successful passage of the drill bit through the skull.\nUsing a 5 μL syringe with affixed 1.5 in, 32 G needle, carefully draw up 1 μL AAV virus. Carefully inspect the syringe to confirm absence of bubbles.\nCritical: Ensure that there are no bubbles present in the syringe before proceeding to next step (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: Different injection coordinates are used when establishing GEM-derived allografts (3 mm anterior and 2 mm lateral to the lambda, 2.5 mm depth). See generation of GEM-derived allografts[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]. A different volume of cells may be used to inject a total of 1 × 105 cells, though this volume should not exceed 3 μL.",
    "Remove the guide needle from the stereotactic frame and replace it with the 5 μL syringe/needle filled with 1 μL virus.\nPosition the syringe such that the needle is directly overlaying the hole drilled into the skull (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], right).\nLower the syringe/needle using the adjustments on the stereotactic frame such that the needle tip abuts the surface of the brain. Zero the dorsal/ventral coordinates on the stereotactic frame.\nLower the needle to a depth of 2.1 mm below the brain surface.\nSlowly inject the virus into the brain (1 μL of virus over 3 min). Wait 1 additional minute after fully dispensing AAV particles to allow liquid to disperse in tissue before retracting needle.\nCritical: Injecting the virus slowly is important for minimizing the volume of AAV that leaks out of the brain. Excess leakage may contribute to formation of needle-track skull-based tumors.\nSlowly remove the needle from the brain by manually using the dorsal/ventral controls of the stereotactic frame over a duration of approximately 60 s. Once the needle tip is visible outside of the brain and skull, the needle and syringe can be removed from the frame.\nClose the incision site with a wound stapler (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], left). Use forceps to bring together the skin surface in order to approximate the skin prior to applying staples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2676-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Surgical recovery\nMouse with staple at injection site and in recovery cage on slide warmer.\nNote: Do not apply saline or other lubricants to the skull surface, as this may cause diffusion and leakage of the injected virus throughout the skull surface.\nPlace the mouse in the recovery cage on slide warmer (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], right).",
    "As the mouse begins to wake from anesthesia and spontaneously move, draw up appropriate volume of buprenorphine in a 1 mL syringe to inject the mouse with 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously.\nNote: If using Ethiqa™ (extended release buprenorphine), it is recommended to use a 20 G or 23 G needle, as the suspension is viscous.\nSterilize buprenorphine injection site with an alcohol pad and inject buprenorphine subcutaneously.\nPlace mouse in clean cage with an antibiotic-containing water (ex. enrofloxacin). Post-surgical mice should be given antibiotic-containing drinking water for 7 days postoperatively for infection prophylaxis. Staples should be removed 7–14 days after intracranial surgery.\nCleaning surgical instruments and inactivating leftover AAV particles\nTiming: 5 min\nThese steps outline the best practices for disinfecting surgical tools between each mouse operation, as well as long-term maintenance of the 5 μL syringe to prevent clogs.\nSurgical instruments\nRinse all surgical tools (scissors, forceps, drill bit) with iodopovidone disinfectant, followed by sterile PBS.\nUse sterile gauze to dry them.\nIntracranial injection syringe\nDip the needle tip of the 5 μL syringe into an aliquot of povidone-iodine disinfectant, followed by sterile PBS.\nDry needle tip thoroughly with sterile gauze. Use caution to not bend the needle tip.\nDraw up and expel sterile PBS 3–5 times to flush contents of syringe.\nNote: If syringe does not draw up or draws up with bubbles, remove the plunger, back fill syringe with sterile PBS, and replace plunger.\nNote: To optimally preserve use of the 5 μL syringe, use cleaning concentrate solution (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) per package instructions after concluding intracranial injections.\nInactivate AAV particles\nExpose all solutions containing AAV particles and all solutions that have come in contact with AAV particles to 10% bleach for >15 min to inactivate virus. After inactivation, solutions can be discarded via sink disposal.",
    "Post-surgical MRI surveillance\nTiming: 8–10 months\nThis section describes steps necessary for MRI surveillance of mouse brains, which is used to assess for intracranial tumor growth.\nMonitor AAV-injected mice for tumor formation via serial (monthly) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We detail below the MRI equipment and protocols used in our study, though alternative parameters and sequences may also be effective.\nPerform MRIs using a Bruker BioSpec 7T/30 cm USR horizontal bore Superconducting Magnet System (maximum gradient amplitude of 440 mT/m and slew rate of 3,440 T/m/s and uses a 23 mm ID birdcage volume radiofrequency (RF) coil for both RF excitation and receiving).\nObtain T2 weighted images of the brain using a fast spin echo (RARE) sequences with fat suppression.\nUse the fofllowing parameters for image acquisition:\nRepetition time (TR) = 6,000 ms.\nEcho time (TE) = 36 ms.\nField of view (FOV) = 19.2 × 19.2 mm2.\nMatrix size = 192 × 192.\nSpatial resolution = 100 × 100 μm2.\nSlice thickness = 0.5 mm.\nNumber of slices = 36.\nRare factor = 16.\nNumber of averages = 8.\nTotal acquisition time 7:30 min.\nNote: Bruker Paravision 6.0.1 software is used for MRI data acquisition.\nIdentify tumors by visually identifying tumor mass on MRI scans at the general site of injection and observing growth of this mass over serial MRI scans.\nNote: Presence of tumor is confirmed on pathological analysis. No specific thresholds or computational analyses are performed on MRI scans to distinguish tumor from normal tissue.\nGeneration of GEM-derived allografts (optional)\nTiming: 8–10 months",
    "These steps outline the procedures for generating IDH-mutant GEM-derived allograft mouse models.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Allograft models are generated by intracranially injecting glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) harvested from tumor-bearing PIC mice into recipient mice. GSCs derived from autochthonous tumors in PIC mice grow as neurospheres in vitro and form orthotopic allograft gliomas readily upon intracranial implantation. Use of allograft models circumvents the formation of needle-track osteosarcomas and protracted tumor latency associated with the GEM model.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] The procedures for anesthesia and intracranial injection to produce orthotopic allografts are largely identical to the above outlined steps to generate the GEM. The critical points of difference are highlighted in the above protocol steps and emphasized below.\nPIC tumor-derived GSC line creation\nAfter brain tumor formation on MRI is observed, euthanize the mouse.\nImmediately harvest the brain and isolate tumor-containing tissue by gross inspection.\nDissociate tumor tissue into a single cell suspension using the Miltenyi Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nCulture cells in 5% CO2 and 5% O2 on ultra-low adherence plates to select for neurosphere-forming GSCs.\nCritical: GEM-derived neurospheres must be cultured at 5% O2. Attempts to establish murine neurosphere cell lines from this GEM model under ambient oxygen conditions were unsuccessful.\nIntracranial injection\nInject 1 × 105 cells (prepared in phosphate-buffered saline) into female ICR SCID mice. Note that the preparation of cells should be at a concentration of at least 3.3 × 104 cells/μL so as not to exceed 3 μL injection volume.\nCritical: Use of injection volume ≥3 μL and/or excessively rapid injections may result in leakage of cell suspension out of the brain and affect glioma latency and promote the development of ectopic tumors (see problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nInject cells at 3 mm anterior, 2 mm lateral to the lambda (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) and 2.5 mm below the brain surface.",
