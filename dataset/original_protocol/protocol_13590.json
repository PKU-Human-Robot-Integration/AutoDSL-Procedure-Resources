    "1. Preparatory work\n3D printing\n\tNOTE: The following steps require the download of the \"Standard Triangle Language\" (STL) files provided as Supplemental File 1, Supplemental File 2, Supplemental File 3, Supplemental File 4, and Supplemental File 5 with this manuscript. Collector parts are provided as STL-files. The connecting flange is provided as \"STandard for the Exchange of Product model data\" (STEP) file to allow adjustment of the collector to fit individual setups. Furthermore, a technical drawing for the central metal rods is provided for conventional manufacturing as Supplemental File 6.\n\t\nOpen the slicing software (see the Table of Materials) and configure the active printhead for nonconductive polylactic acid (PLA) and a 0.4 mm nozzle.\n\t\tNOTE: Slicing software, filament, and nozzle diameter might vary depending on the available 3D-printer.\nUpload the STL-files Specimen_mount_A (Supplemental File 3) and Speciment_mount_B (Supplemental File 4) into the slicing software.\nRotate the models, so the triangular surfaces are placed on the build plate.\nMark all parts, right-click, and select Multiply Selected Models. Enter 1 in the prompt Number of Copies and click OK. Place a total of four models on the build plate.\nSet slice thickness to 0.1 mm, wall thickness to 1 mm, infill density to 40%, and uncheck the Generate Support box.\nClick the Slice button | Save to Removable to save the printing file to a USB drive.\nLoad nonconductive PLA into the printer and start the print file.\nAfter the print is completed, remove the models from the build plate and check for warping at the bottom corners.\nIn the slicing software, keep the material parameters and replace the models with Collector_Flange (Supplemental File 1 and Supplemental File 5) and Leaflet_Template (Supplemental File 2).",
    "Rotate the flange, so the flat circular surface is against the build plate. Additionally, rotate the leaflet template, so the square surface is placed directly on the build plate.\nMark the flange and multiply the model as in step 1.1.4. Type 1 to receive 1 copy and 1 original of the flange model on the build plate.\nMark the leaflet model and multiply by 8 to receive a total of nine leaflet models, following the steps described in 1.1.4.\nSet slice thickness to 0.1 mm, wall thickness to 1 mm, infill density to 80%, and uncheck the Generate Support box.\nClick the Slice button | Save to Removable to save the new printing file to a USB drive.\nLoad conductive PLA into the printer and start the printing process.\nAfter completion of the print, remove the models from the build plate. Remove individual filament fibers at the bottom of the leaflet negative carefully with a wire cutter if these are present in the leaflet models (as no support structures were used).\nSpinning solution\n\tCAUTION: Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylformamide (DMF) are harmful solvents that should not be inhaled or contact the skin. It is strongly recommended to wear solvent-resistant gloves and protective goggles while handling them. When handling them, work under an exhaust hood as they are extremely volatile.\n\t\nPlace a scale under the exhaust hood and position a 200 mL screw-cap glass bottle on it. Tare the scale.\nPour 50 mL of DMF and 50 mL of THF into the glass bottle. Note the weight of the solvents.\nPlace a magnetic bar inside the bottle, place the bottle on a magnetic stirrer, and switch it on.",
    "Multiply the noted weight by 0.15 (= 15% w/v) and transfer the corresponding amount of polyurethane (PU) slowly into the glass bottle containing the solvent mixture (DIN 1310).\nClose the bottle and stir for at least 12 h at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution.\n2. Electrospinning setup\nAssembly\n\tNOTE: As the leaflet scaffolds created with the presented collector are relatively small, the optional use of a large diameter drum mandrel (D: 110 mm) is recommended. This allows the creation of larger, multilayered scaffolds, which will be beneficial for microscopic, biocompatibility, and biomechanical assessment.\n\t\nAssemble the collector using the 3D printed parts and six M3 x 15 screws.\nUse three screws to secure the metal rods to one of the flanges.\nSlide one Specimen_mount_B between the metal bars. Make sure the spaces for templates point in the opposite direction of the flange.\nFill the three slots of the Specimen_mount_B with heart valve leaflet templates.\nPlace Specimen_mount_A on top and fill the spaces with templates.\nSlide another Specimen_mount_A in and fill the spaces with templates.\nFixate the templates by putting the second Specimen_mount_B on top.\nPut the second flange on top and use the M3 screws to secure it.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the leaflet templates are all oriented in the same direction (straight edge of the leaflet parallel to the metal rods).\nPlace the assembled leaflet collector in the electrospinning setup and tightly secure the flanges to the motor axis (i.e., M6 screws and wing nuts) (Figure 1).\n\t\tCAUTION: As conductive PLA is more brittle than regular PLA, use a torque wrench at 1.4 Nm when fastening bolts that put pressure on the material to avoid snapping.\nPlace a needle holder 30 cm from the collector.",
    "Fix a 14 gauge (G) needle with a flat tip in the needle holder and fixate it at the height of the collector's axis.\nConnect a flexible, solvent-resistant (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) tube to the Luer-lock port of the needle.\n\t\tNOTE: DMF and THF dissolve many plastics. It is necessary to use solvent-resistant materials when working with these solvents, e.g., metal and glass tools. When plastic tools are required (i.e., syringe or tubing), make sure to use solvent-resistant materials.\nGuide the tube to the syringe pump for later connection of the polymer-filled syringe.\nConnection of power supply unit (PSU)\n\tCAUTION: During the setup, ensure that the power supply is disconnected from the main power source.\n\t\nConnect two shielded, high-voltage cables to the power supply's anode and cathode.\nUsing a crocodile clip, connect the cable connected to the cathode (- pole) to the 14 G needle. Check the connection between clip and needle. Next, guide the high-voltage cable, so it runs outside the spinning area to avoid interference.\nConnect the collector to the anode (+ pole) using a crocodile clip and the second high voltage cable. Use a slip ring or a sliding contact using a stripped cable to create contact at the collector's flange.\nPreparation of the syringe\n\t​NOTE: This step should be performed immediately before the spinning process starts.\n\t\nFill a 20 mL Luer-lock syringe with the spinning solution prepared in step 1.2.\nConnect the syringe to the solvent-resistant tube and manually push the solution into the tubing system until a droplet is visible at the tip of the needle.\nPlace the syringe in the syringe pump. After turning the pump on, enter the following parameters: diameter: 19.129 mm; volume: 5 mL; speed 3 mL/h.\n3. Electrospinning process\nMotor test run",
    "NOTE: Manufacturing the collector using 3D-printing might lead to off-center motion of the collector. Therefore, a test run with lower revolution speeds but without high voltage is highly recommended.\n\t\nOpen the motor control software by double-clicking the icon on the computer.\nConnect to the motor control by clicking the Connect button.\nAfter connecting, select the Profile velocity operation mode and click on the Operation tab located in the upper left corner of the screen.\nSelect the Profile velocity tab below the Quick stop button framed by a red line. Type in the following settings: Target velocity: 200 rpm; profile acceleration: 100; profile deceleration: 200; quick stop: 5000.\n\t\tNOTE: The direction of rotation should be upwards on the needle side, which can be adjusted by changing the sign in the \"target velocity\" field from \"+\" to \"-.\"\nStart the test run and check the collector for any unbalance. If the collector runs smoothly, proceed with the protocol. Otherwise, stop the motor and readjust the collector as described in step 2.1.9.\nStop the motor by clicking the Switch on enabled button and change Target velocity to 2,000 rpm.\nManufacturing process\n\tNOTE: Electrospinning is a process with a high dependency on environmental parameters. Optimal electrospinning results were obtained between 15-20% relative humidity at a temperature between 21 and 24 °C.\n\t\nFirst Layer\n\t\tNOTE: During the setup phase, a dried droplet of PU might have formed at the tip of the needle. Remove the droplet using a long, nonconductive tool, if necessary.\n\t\t\nIn the motor control software, click the Enable Operation button to switch on the motor.\nSwitch on the high-voltage power supply and adjust the voltage for both anode and cathode: minus pole (needle): 18 kV; plus pole (collector): 1.5 kV.\nStart the syringe pump at a flow rate of 3 mL/h.",
    "Set a timer to 20 min.\nObserve the needle tip for the formation of a tailor cone. Depending on the shape of the cone at the needle tip, adjust the voltage at the cathode in increments of ±100 V until a stable tailor cone is established.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the drop is hanging, the voltage is too low. However, unsteady flow can indicate that voltage is set too high.\nWait for 20 min for the cusp templates to be covered adequately with fibers.\nTurn off the syringe pump.\nTurn off the PSU by flipping the power switch.\nStop the motor by clicking the Switch on enabled button in the motor control software.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: To prevent injury from moving parts in the system, wait until the collector has completely stopped to open the test chamber.\nSecond Layer\n\t\t\nIn the motor control software, alter the input field Target velocity to 10 rpm.\nRepeat steps 3.2.1.1-3.2.1.9.\nThird Layer\n\t\tNOTE: Before the scaffolds are fully dry, they are extremely sensitive to mechanical stress. Be very careful when performing steps 3.2.3.2-3.2.3.6. Avoid touching the scaffolds/fibers during these steps, as the scaffold might be rendered useless.\n\t\t\nCarefully open the screws connecting the collector flanges to the motor axis and remove the leaflet collector (Figure 2B) from the electrospinning device.\nUsing a scalpel, cut the electrospun fibers along the outer contour of each leaflet template (Figure 2C).\nRemove the flange on one side of the collector.\nPull out the 3D-printed inserts and separate the leaflet templates from the nonconductive triangular holders.\nRotate all leaflet templates by 90° and reassemble the collector.\nInsert the collector into the electrospinning setup and tightly secure it.\nAgain, check for any unbalance before continuing the spinning process.\nIn the motor control software, alter the input field Target velocity to 2,000 rpm.",
    "Repeat steps 3.2.1.1-3.2.1.9.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After finishing the electrospinning process, it is highly recommended to flush the tubing and needle with pure DMF to prevent clogging of the tubing.\nFluorescent dyed scaffolds (optional)\n\t\tNOTE: Fluorescent dyes are used to make the fibers visible under a conventional fluorescence microscope. This is only necessary while implementing the method and for quality control after new settings have been applied. The use of fluorescent dyes is not recommended when manufacturing scaffolds using established settings.\n\t\t\nDivide the spinning solution prepared in step 1.2 into three equal portions in separate bottles.\nUsing a scale, measure 1 mg of fluorescent dye for every gram (0.1 wt%) of polymer solution. Repeat for all three fluorescent dyes (i.e., Fluorescein, Texas Red, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI]).\nAdd the dye to the spinning solution, close the bottle lid, and stir for 2-3 h or until homogenization.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To prevent the fluorescent dyes from fading, protect the spinning solution from light as much as possible, i.e., by placing an opaque cover over the magnetic stirrer. The process for fluorescent dyed scaffolds is very similar to the standard process described in steps 3.2.1-3.2.3.\nIn step 3.2.1, replace the standard syringe with a syringe filled with the spinning solution containing the first fluorescent dye.\nIn step 3.2.2, replace the currently used tubing and needle with new or cleaned ones. Subsequently, place a syringe with the spinning solution containing the second fluorescent dye in the syringe pump.\nIn step 3.2.3 again, replace the tubing and needle with new or cleaned ones and replace the syringe with one that is filled with spinning solution containing the third fluorescent dye.",
    "​NOTE: To avoid delay during the manufacturing process, it is beneficial to use three sets of tubing and needles. Alternatively, the tube and needle can be flushed thoroughly with THF and DMF in-between the production of layers until no spinning solution containing fluorescent dye is left in the system.\n4. Postprocessing and sample acquisition\nPostprocessing scaffolds\n\t\nRemove the collector from the electrospinning device.\nUsing a scalpel, cut each template free at its base as described in step 3.2.3.2.\nOpen the collector, as described above, and place the templates, base down, on a tray.\nPlace the tray in a drying cabinet overnight at 40 °C.\nAfter the samples are completely dried, use a scalpel to carefully cut along the edges of the leaflet template to remove surplus fibers.\nAfterward, carefully peel the leaflet scaffold of the template and place it on a tray for further processing."
