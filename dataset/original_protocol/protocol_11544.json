  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described below were approved by the human research ethics review boards at the participating institutions.\n1. Preparation and Seating\nTo begin, seat the child in front of the computer and fit him with an adjustable headphone/microphone combination set. Use a headphone splitter to connect a set of headphones that the assistant will wear during the administration of the battery.\n\tNOTE: Throughout the administration of the protocol, an assistant sits beside the child to monitor the child's attention to the tasks; to enter response data, as described below; and to ensure the child's fidelity to the CABC-WM protocol (e.g., to ensure that the child uses his dominant hand to respond, attends to the computer screen, etc.).\n2. Initial Instructions to the Subject\nInstruct the child to use the touchscreen interface to select a pirate avatar that he will use throughout the game.\n\tNOTE: Within the game, the child will traverse a virtual ocean to complete 13 working memory tasks, distributed across four islands (each island is completed on a different day to prevent fatigue). See Figure 1. Individual tasks are represented by icons (e.g., different icons of toys on Toy Island). Tasks are randomized across children; thus, the computer randomly selects the order of task presentation for each child.\n3. Selection of the Avatar\nAfter selecting the pirate avatar, direct the child to select an island to complete. Instruct the child to select one of the picture icons on his selected island, which will start a task.",
    "NOTE: Each island has 3-5 tasks (see Figure 1), each of which are represented by picture icons. Tasks are randomly presented by the CABC-WM so a particular picture icon is not necessarily associated with a particular task. For each task, an introduction screen appears first, which signals to the assistant what materials are needed (e.g., removing the keyboard, placing labels on the keyboard, etc.) for that specific task.\n\t\nWhen the materials are arranged appropriately, ask the assistant to press the 9 key on the 10-key number pad to start the task. Once a child has completed a task (as described in the protocol below), the selected island reappears and the child selects the next task. The session continues until all tasks on the island have been completed.\n\t\tNOTE: All tasks within the CABC-WM are narrated by a pirate who provides standardized verbal instructions for each task. Each task is categorized below according to each working memory component, including: 1) central executive, 2) phonological working memory, 3) visuospatial working memory, and 4) binding. Comprehensive descriptions of each task were provided above in the introduction of the manuscript.\n4. Central Executive Tasks\nN-back Auditory\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard in front of the child, and place a green sticker on the C key and a red sticker on the M key. Press 9 on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child. Ensure that the child indicates his response by selecting the respective labeled key on the keyboard.",
    "NOTE: The red sticker represents different and the green sticker represents same; this is how the child indicates the same/difference response in this task. The CABC-WM narrator instructs the child to judge whether an auditory stimulus (i.e., atone) is the same or different from the preceding stimulus.\nN-back Visual\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard in front of the child, and place a green sticker on the C key and a red sticker on the M key. Press 9 on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child\n\t\tNOTE: The red sticker represents 'different' and the green sticker represents same; this is how the child indicates the same/difference response in this task. The CABC-WM narrator instructs the child to judge whether a visual stimulus (i.e., a 'game piece') is the same or different from the immediately preceding visual stimulus.\nEnsure that the child indicates his response by selecting the respective labeled key on the keyboard.\nNumber updating\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Direct the child to visually attend to two numbers presented on the computer screen and to the subsequent addition operations. Press 9 on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child.\n\t\tNOTE: The child is shown two numbers on the screen. The child is given, in sequence, a series of five addition operations that are applied to the numbers. After each operation, the child provides a verbal running total of the two numbers.",
    "After the child verbally provides the running total (e.g., 2, 3 or 2,4) for each trial, key the child's response on the 10-key number pad, which will automatically advance the task to the next trial.\n5. Phonological Working Memory Tasks\nDigit Span\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session.\n\t\tNOTE: The CABC-WM narrator instructs the child to listen to sequences of digits that increase in length and to repeat as many digits as he can recall.\nPlace the keyboard out of reach of the child (the assistant will key the child's responses). Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child. After each trial, enter the digits that the child repeats into the 10-key number pad, regardless of the correctness of his response, on the keyboard.\n\t\tNOTE: The CABC-WM scores the child's responses as correct if the repeated numbers are in the correct order. The assistant does not judge the accuracy of the child's response, but simply keys the child's response into the program for the computer to analyze and score.\nDigit Span - Running\n\tNOTE: The CABC-WM narrator instructs the child to listen to lists of numbers that range in spans from 7-10 digits in length, and then to repeat as many numbers (in forward order) at the end of the sequence.\n\t\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard out of reach of the child (the assistant will key the child's responses). Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child. After each trial, enter the digits that the child repeats into the 10-key number pad on the keyboard.",
    "NOTE: The CABC-WM scores the child's responses as correct if the repeated numbers are in the correct order. The assistant does not judge the accuracy of the child's response, but simply keys the child's response into the program for the computer to analyze and score.\nNonword Repetition\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session.\n\t\tNOTE: The CABC-WM narrator instructs the child to repeat a series of nonwords (e.g., genfad and yitvadgoom) as accurately as possible.\nPlace the keyboard out of reach of the child. Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child. After the child makes an attempt at repeating each nonword, press the 'C' key to indicate an attempt was made and advance to the next trial. If the child does not make a reasonable attempt (e.g., child says, 'I don't know' or does not respond), press the M key to indicate an attempt was not made and the next trial will begin.\n6. Visuospatial Working Memory Tasks\nNOTE: At the start of each task, the CABC-WM narrator provides instructions to the child.\nLocation Span\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard out of reach of the child. Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child. Monitor the child's attention to the task which requires him to recall a series of locations on the computer screen and while he responds by touching the screen to make his selections.\nLocation Span - Running",
    "Read the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard out of reach of the child. Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child.\nMonitor the child's attention to the task while he recalls, in forward order, as many locations presented from the end of a sequence of unpredictable length. After the child touches the screen to respond, ensure that the child selects the NEXT button, a circle in the lower-right corner of the screen that is labeled NEXT, to advance the CABC-WM to the next trial.\nVisual Span\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard out of reach of the child. Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child. Monitor the child's attention to the task while, when prompted, he uses the touchscreen to select the order of presented polygons in spans of 2-6 lengths.\nVisual Span - Running\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard out of reach of the child. Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child.\nMonitor the child's attention to the task while, when prompted, he uses the touchscreen to select the order of polygons that he can recall in forward order, as many polygons as possible from an unpredictable span length. After the child touches the screen to respond, ensure that the child selects the 'NEXT' button, a circle in the lower-right corner of the screen that is labeled 'NEXT', to advance the CABC-WM to the next trial.",
    "7. Binding Tasks\nPhonological Binding Span\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard out of reach of the child. Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child.\nListen for the child's verbal response when he is asked for the nonword that was paired with the non-speech sound. If the child makes a reasonable attempt, press the C key to indicate that an attempt was made and to advance the task to the next trial. If the child does not make a reasonable attempt (e.g., the child says 'I don't know' or does not respond), press the 'M' key to indicate that an attempt was not made and to allow the next trial to begin.\nVisual Binding Span\nRead the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard out of reach of the child. Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child.\nAfter the child is presented with polygons in their respective locations on the screen (increasing in span length from 1 to 6 polygons at a time for each trial), monitor the child while he uses the touchscreen to move the polygons into the grid locations he recalls. After the child finishes his selections, ensure that the child selects the 'NEXT' button, a circle in the lower-right corner of the screen that is labeled 'NEXT', to advance the CABC-WM to the next trial.\nCross-Modal Binding",
    "Read the instruction screen that appears after the child selects the task icon on the selected island of the session. Place the keyboard out of reach of the child. Press '9' on the 10-key number pad to start the task for the child.\nAs the child is presented with a polygon to label after learning the polygon-nonword pairings in spans of 1-6 pairings, monitor the child’s responses. If the child makes a reasonable attempt, press the 'C 'key to indicate that an attempt was made and to advance the task to the next trial. If the child does not make a reasonable attempt (e.g., the child says 'I don’t know' or does not respond), press the 'M' key to indicate that an attempt was not made and to allow the next trial to begin"
