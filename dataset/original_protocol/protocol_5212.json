    "Preparation of bacteria and media for worm growthBacteria preparation (C. elegans food)In 10 ml LB medium, add 10 µl ampicillin (stock 100 mg/ml).Inoculate a few colonies of E. coli HT115DE3 empty vector bacteria into the LB + ampicillin medium.Note: Alternative bacteria: E. coli OP50.Incubate for 6 h at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm.C. elegans growth media preparationMelt the solid NGM contained in a glass bottle (500 ml) using a microwave (power level 2 for 25 min).Keep the melted medium at 55 °C in a water bath for 15-20 min.Before usage, add:12.5 ml of 1 M KH2PO4 pH 6500 µl of 1 M MgSO4500 µl of 1 M CaCl2500 µl cholesterol (stock 5 mg/ml in 95% ethanol)500 µl of ampicillin (stock 100 mg/ml), if using knockdown bacteria strain HT115DE3 carrying the L4440 vector or the target gene.Gently invert the bottle a few times to mix all the ingredients and then pour 6 ml of the medium into each of 60 x 15 mm Petri dish.Let it dry at room temperature for around 1 h.Once dried, using a sterilized bacterial plating rod spread 70 µl of bacteria prepared in step A1 above to form a lawn. The optical density OD600 of the bacteria is approximately 1.0. Alternatively, the bacteria can be added as 3 drops distributed onto the plate. Incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C.Worm growthFrom a grown worm plate, cut 4 pieces of approximately 1 x 1 cm agar with a pointy spatula sterilized with 100% ethanol and flame.Transfer each agar piece by turning them over onto each of 4 plates prepared in step A2.Incubate these worm plates for 2 days at 20 °C.",
    "Worm synchronisationThe 4 plates are expected to be filled with adult worms, visualized through a stereomicroscope, and at which point the synchronization can be done. An alternative method to obtain a huge amount of worms is to grow them in liquid media (NGM medium without agar). Add 2 ml of alkaline hypochlorite solution (bleaching solution) to each plate and rapidly collect the worms by pipetting (about 10 sec per plate) in a sterile 15 ml conical tube. Date and label the tube with the name of the worm strain. Alternatively, harvest the worms with 1 ml of M9 buffer and collect them into 15 ml conical tubes. Centrifuge in the Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge, using swing bucket rotor (A-4-81) with adapters for 15 ml conical tubes at 1,740 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Discard the M9 buffer and add 2 ml of the bleaching solution. In this way the worms are washed once.Quickly start to vortex the worms for 7 min at setting 8 on the vortex and check under the stereomicroscope if the adult worms are lysed and only the eggs are present.Note: Steps B2 and B3 must be carried out with care as they are critical for the eggs to hatch. Without any delay, centrifuge in the Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge at 1,740 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant, but leave approximately 1 ml of the solution.Adding 5 ml of M9 buffer and repeat the centrifugation and aspiration as in steps B4 and B5.Repeat 4 more times step B6, in order to remove any trace of the bleaching solution.Incubate the eggs in the final 1 ml of M9 buffer overnight at 20 °C. During this time the eggs will hatch and produce L1 stage worms.",
    "Worm under treatmentBacteria preparationIn 3 different tubes, add 10 ml LB medium and 10 µl ampicillin (100 mg/ml).In the 1st tube, add a few colonies of E. coli HT115DE3/empty vector L4440.In the 2nd tube, add a few colonies of E. coli HT115DE3/pL4440-oct-1.In the 3rd tube, add a few colonies of E. coli HT115DE3/pL4440-oct-2.Incubate all the tubes for 5 h in a 37 °C orbital shaker.Drug plate preparationMelt a bottle of 500 ml of solid NGM as above (see C. elegans growth media preparation above). For normal drug plates-no knockdownTransfer 30 ml of melted NGM media kept at 55 °C into a small sterile bottle. This will make 3 Petri dishes (60 x 15 mm) each containing ~10 ml of NGM media for triplicate assays.Add the doxorubicin (stock 2 mg/ml) to the desired final concentrations for each 6 ml of NGM media and pour onto the 60 x 15 mm Petri dish. For doxorubicin use between 0.1 to 100 µM depending on the strains. Uptake was observed with as low as 0.5 µM of doxorubicin.IMPORTANT: Do not forget to prepare a plate without drug.Leave plates for at least 15 min at room temperature for the medium to solidify.Add 70 µl E. coli HT115DE3/pL4440-empty vector bacteria. Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.For knockdown drug platesTransfer 30 ml of melted NMG medium kept at 55 °C into a small sterile bottle.Add 30 µl of 1 M IPTG, needed to induce the production of dsRNA from the L4440 vector carrying a fragment of the target gene.Add to 6 ml of this media the desired concentrations of doxorubicin as above.IMPORTANT: Do not forget to prepare a plate without drug.Pour 6 ml of media with and without IPTG and with doxorubicin onto 60 x 15 mm Petri dishes.Dry the plates, as above.",
    "Add 70 µl E. coli HT115DE3/pL4440-oct-1 bacteria for 1st set of 5 plates.Add 70 µl E. coli HT115DE3/pL4440-oct-2 bacteria for 2nd set of 5 plates. Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.Now all the plates are ready to add 50 µl of the L1 synchronized worms.Verify if there are nearly 50 L1-staged worms on the plates under the stereomicroscope.Incubate the plates at 20 °C for 3 days.Microscope visualisationPreparation of slidesOn a frosted microscope slide add one drop (~50 µl) of 3% agarose and squeeze it with another slide to form a sandwich. After 10 sec, remove one of the slide to expose the agarose.Dry the slide with the agarose at 65 °C around 15-30 min using a Programmable Thermal Controller 96 Well.Mounting the wormsAdd 7 µl of 1 M levamisol onto the surface of the dried agar on the slide.To each slide, add 10-15 young adult worms from a single treatment condition by using a platinum wire to transfer the worms.Sterilize the platinum wire using a flame before transferring the next 10-15 worms from a different treatment condition onto a new slide.Add the coverslip and seal around the slide and coverslip with clear nail polish.Microscopy visualisationThe slide containing the worm is ready to be visualised.
