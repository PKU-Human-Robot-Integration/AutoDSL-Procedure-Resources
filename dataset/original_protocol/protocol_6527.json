    "Prepare donor MG cells (details are descripted in Sun et al., 2020)Sacrifice the donor female mice and remove the fourth inguinal MGs under clean and sterile condition.Digest the MGs into single cells. In brief, the mammary glands were minced, washed in DPBS, and digested in DMEM/F-12, which contained 300 units/ml collagenase III, 100 units/ml hyaluronidase, 5% FBS , 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml EGF, 20 ng/ml Cholera toxin, and 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, for about 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The resultant organoid suspension was sequentially re-suspended in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5 mg/ml dispase II and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I for 5 min at 37 °C, and then digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 2 min, and treated with RBC lysis buffer for 3 min to remove the red blood cells before filtration through a 40-μm cell strainer to obtain single-cell suspension.Enrich the epithelial cells using an EasySeq Mouse Epithelial Cell Enrichment kit according to the manufacturer and stain the MG cells with anti-mouse CD24-PE-Cy7 antibody (1:200), anti-mouse CD29-APC antibody (1:200), and DAPI (1 μg/ml) in FACS buffer in ice for 30 min.Sort out the DAPI-CD24MidCD29Hi (basal cells) and DAPI-CD24HiCD29Lo (luminal cells) cells separately as donor cells.Wash the cells with DPBS and re-suspend the cells at given concentrations (10 μl of cells/ fat pad) with implantation buffer (Recipe 1).Clear the fat pads of recipient female miceAnesthetize a 3-week-old female nude mouse with Avertin (Recipe 2) (administered i.p., at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight). Select mice those are < 12 g to ensure that mammary ductal growth has not been initiated.Firmly restrain the mouse with abdomen up by adhering its limbs into a foam surface using tapes (Figure 1A).Sterilize the abdomen with 70% alcohol.",
    "Grasp the skin with forceps a few millimeters above the pelvis and lift it up from the abdomen. Make a parallel incision (about 10 mm) along the mouse’s abdomen without puncturing the peritoneum with scissors and forceps.Then make a Y-type incision from the bottom of the midline incision to the hip region just above the legs. Pull the skin back from the peritoneum using forceps to expose the mammary gland (Figure 1B).Cut off the bridge between the fourth and fifth mammary glands to prevent the epithelium of the fifth gland from growing into the fourth cleared fat pads.Divide the fat pad of the fourth mammary gland by cutting across it with scissors just near ventral (the side towards nipple) of the node. Then remove the portion of fat pad with the lymph node and the nipple, and leave the other part as cleared fat pad for MG cells implantation later (Figures 1B-1D).Put the removed mammary piece on a microscope slide for fixing and staining with carmine-alum later to confirm that the entire rudimentary epithelial bud has been removed.Repeat the Steps B6-B8, if desired, on the contralateral mammary gland.Implant the donor MG cells into the cleared fat padsAfter clearing the mammary fat pad, directly inject the MG cells (10 μl) prepared from Procedure A into the remaining part of the fat pad by using 1 ml syringe with 27G x ½” needle (Figures 1E and 1F).Close the skin incisions with wound clips (Figure 1G).Place the mouse on a warming pad until it regains consciousness. And keep monitoring the mouse for up to 1 week for any sign of infection or other surgical complications.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200629/20200629212421_5146.jpgFigure 1.

    "The fourth mammary gland was exposed (the locations of lymph node and cutting line were indicated). C. A schematic diagram shows the locations of nipple, lymph node (labeled as “N”) and the cutting line. D. Divide the MG into two parts, the blue circled part was to be removed and the green circled part was the cleared fat pad. E. Injecte the donor cells into the cleared fat pad. F. Cleared fat pad was implanted with MG cells. G. Close the incisions with wound clips.Remove, fix and stain the MGAbout 8 to 10 weeks after implantation, sacrifice the recipient mouse, dissect out the fourth MG (similar operation as in Procedure B, just remove all the fat pad).Transfer the entire MG on a microscope slide, and use blunt end forceps to spread out the MG over the glass slide as much as possible without damaging the tissue.Keep the MG on the slide for 5 min at room temperature to allow the MG to stick to the glass surface.Submerge the slide in a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing Carnoy’s fix buffer (Recipe 3), and fix the tissue overnight at room temperature.Wash the slide with 70% ethanol for 30 min, then wash it with 50%, 30% ethanol and PBS for 10 min of each step.Stain the MG with carmine-alum staining solution (Recipe 4) at 4 °C overnight.Note: The staining can be continued for several days. Dehydrate the MG by washing the slide with a gradient ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%, 15 min for each concentration).Submerge the MG in xylene overnight at room temperature in the chemical hood, to remove the fat tissue.Mount the slide with Permout in the chemical hood for long-term storage.Assess the MG formation efficiencyTake pictures of the stained whole mounts by using a Leica-M165FC stereo microscope.",
    "Measure the size of the reconstructed epithelia and whole mounts by analyzing the picture with ImageJ.Calculate the ratio of epithelial tree size to whole mount size, to indicate the MG formation efficiency."
