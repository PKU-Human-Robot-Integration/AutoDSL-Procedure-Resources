    "Preparations prior to OMV isolationPreparation of 1 L of YEB (for starters, see Recipes).Preparation of 1 L of PSB (the main medium, see Recipes). Plating the bacteriaPlate Xcc 33913 (from glycerol stock) on Difco nutrient agar plates, by using a sterile single-use inoculating loop. Note: It is recommended to plate the bacteria 2-5 days before making the starters with Xcc. Making Xcc starters (2 sterile tubes with 3 ml of sterile YEB in each)To every tube, add 3 µl of cephalexin hydrate 10 mg/ml (final concentration will be 10 µg/ml of medium). Using a sterile 200-µl pipette tip, scrub 3-5 Xcc colonies from the plate, and add them to the medium in the tube. Must be done in a biological hood. Put the tubes in 28 °C shaker for overnight (the speed is 180-200 rpm). Inoculation of the main medium (PSB) To every 500 ml of PSB medium in each 2-L Erlenmeyer flask, add 500 µl of cephalexin hydrate 10 mg/ml (final concentration will be 10 µg/ml of medium). Then, from one of the Erlenmeyer flasks, transfer 1 ml of medium (+ cephalexin) into a clean, new cuvette (will serve as a blank for the spectrophotometer). Cover the cuvette with 2 layers of Parafilm, and keep the cuvette at 4 °C. Then, to each Erlenmeyer flask, add 300 µl from the same starter (has to be very cloudy). Put the Erlenmeyer flasks into 28 °C shaker, at the speed of 180-200 rpm, for overnight (Video 1).Notes:Must be done in a biological hood.The ‘cloudiness’ of the starter might affect the time needed for the inoculated PSB media, to reach the desired OD600 nm.Temperature above 30 °C might inhibit bacterial growth in the Erlenmeyer flasks.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.",
    "Culture incubation On the next day – object density measurementThe cuvette stored at 4 °C (with the PSB medium and cephalexin hydrate) serves as a blank. This cuvette should be kept at 4 °C between measurements.At the ‘normal range’ described in Table 1, the concentration of Xcc 33913 is approximately 108 cfu/ml, and the cells are at around the mid log phase of the growth curve. Just before cell harvest, a small sample of the culture is taken, serially diluted and plated to determine cell number and to assess the amount of purified vesicles per cell.Table 1. The object density rangesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170228/20170228090743_8011.jpgNotes: Must be done in a biological hood. Since different spectrophotometers may give different reads for the same sample, it is recommended that first a proper bacterial growth curve experiment will be conducted using OD measurements and cell counts on plates, to accurately define the different growth phases and their respective ODs with the instrument used.About the required OD600 nm: Ideally, cells should be harvested at mid-log phase. Harvesting at a later time point might result in cell death and cell debris, and/or release of other substances that could contaminate the preparation and/or clog the filtering membrane. The typical incubation time, that is required in order to get to the desired OD600 nm, is 17-21 h. The isolation processRemoval of bacteriaPour the cultures into 250-ml bottles, and centrifuge them at approx. 13,200 x g for 22 min, at the temperature of 4 °C to pellet bacterial cells. Rotors that can be used: GSA (Sorvall), JLA-16.250 (Beckman-Coulter) (Video 2). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Removal of bacteria Then, filter the supernatant through a 0.45-µM PES filter with Ø75-mM membrane diameter (operated by a vacuum pump).",
    "Optional: It is possible to filter the entire 1 L of the culture through such filter; thus, you can connect it to a 1-L bottle (if the filter fits). The filtered supernatant can be stored at 4 °C up to 1 day.Pelleting the vesiclesPour the filtered supernatant into 250-ml bottles, and centrifuge them at approx. 32,000 x g for 2 h, at 4 °C. The vesicles will be pelleted (Figure 1) in the outward direction from the center of the rotor. Rotors that can be used: SLA-1500 (Sorvall), JLA-16.250 (Beckman-Coulter) (Video 3). Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted vesicles, using 5-8 ml of sterile dH2O, by pipetting. Optional: Filter the resuspended vesicles through 0.45-µM (operated by a 10-ml syringe) into a sterile 15-ml Falcon tube, so you can keep them at 4 °C for a few days. Must be done in a biological hood.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170228/20170228070055_9317.jpgFigure 1.

Pelleting the vesicles UltracentrifugationPour the resuspended vesicles, from the previous step, into two 12-ml ultracentrifuge tubes, and use sterile dH2O to fill the remaining volume of the tubes. Ultracentrifuge the resuspended vesicles, at approx. 175,000 x g, for 1 h and 35 min, at 4 °C. Rotor that can be used: Sorvall TH-641. Ultracentrifuge that can be used: Sorvall Discovery 90SE. The vesicles will be pelleted in the bottom of the tubes (Figure 2, Video 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170228/20170228070211_6570.jpgFigure 2.

    "Ultracentrifugation Final resuspension and storageDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted vesicles with sterile dH2O or with PBS buffer by pipetting, using a volume that is 1/1,000 of original medium volume. For example: 1 ml of sterile dH2O for 1 L of PSB. Filter the resuspended vesicles through a 0.22-µM filter (operated by a syringe), into a sterile 1.5-ml tube. Must be done in a biological hood. The filtered OMV preparation can be stored at 4 °C as is or further purified by density gradient centrifugation.Density gradient centrifugation: In order to purify the OMV further, for analyses that require highly-purified samples (e.g., protein analysis in LC-MS/MS), a density gradient centrifugation step is required (Chutkan et al., 2013).For density gradient centrifugation, use OptiPrep density gradient medium 60% stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and make 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, and 20% OptiPrep solutions (using OptiPrep diluent buffer, see Recipes).Carefully layer 1 ml of each diluted OptiPrep solution on the top of the other, starting from 45% OptiPrep solution at the bottom. On the top of the 20% OptiPrep solution, carefully layer the OMV prep and sterile dH2O. Notes: If you have the entire OMV sample layered in one tube, you must have another, balancing tube, with the same diluted OptiPrep layers, but a sterile dH2O layered on them (instead of OMV).It’s recommended to use equally-weighted tubes, even when empty, to avoid imbalance, and to keep equal volumes of the top layer (OMV or dH2O) between the tubes. Spin the samples at approx. 246,000 x g for 6 h, at 4 °C. After the ultracentrifugation, a layer/s of the vesicles will be visible in the tube, due to Xanthomonas yellow pigment Xanthomonadin (Figure 3; Video 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170228/20170228070408_1868.jpgFigure 3.",

Purification by a density gradient With a 1-ml pipette tip laid against the side of tube, slowly and carefully collect each 1 ml fraction from top to bottom. Each 1 ml collected should be transferred into a separate 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. Change the pipette tip between the fractions.To each 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube containing a 1 ml fraction from the previous step (from the OptiPrep layers), add 11 ml of sterile dH2O to dilute the OptiPrep, and spin at approx. 170,000 x g for 2 h, at 4 °C (rotor that can be used: Sorvall TH-641; Ultracentrifuge: Sorvall Discovery 90SE).The vesicles will be pelletedThen, the pellet can be resuspended in 0.2-0.5 ml of sterile dH2O or PBS buffer and filtered (by a syringe-mounted 0.22-µM filter), or the pelleted OMV can be scrubbed from the bottom of the tubes by using two clean thin spatulas. This can be achieved by collecting (scrubbing) the pellet using one of the spatulas.Then, use the other spatula to remove the pellet from the first spatula and stick it, or smear it, on the sterile 1.5-ml tube’s wall. The 1.5-ml tube containing the pelleted OMVs can be then stored at -80 °C. Note: Must be done in a biological hood.Table 2. Isolation and purification process summaryimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171028/20171028025121_4589.jpgOMV preparation quality and quantity checksChecking if the preparation is sterile Pipette 10 µl of OMV preparation on a plate with Difco nutrient agar, and leave open until the 10 µl drop dries out. Must be done in a biological hood.",
    "Then, place the plate in a 28 °C incubator for 2-5 days, and check if colonies are formed where the drop was placed.Quantification of the OMVs‘Coomassie Plus – The Better Bradford Assay Kit’, can be used to quantify the protein cargo of the vesicles. A NanoSight device, can be used to test the size distribution of the vesicles and their quantity. Another way to estimate the vesicles’ concentration, provided that the OMVs are from Xanthomonas, is by measuring the object density of Xanthomonadin. Xanthomonadin maximum absorbance is at 445 nm. When measuring OD445 nm, use sterile dH2O as blank (Munhoz et al., 2011; Goel et al., 2001).Note: The OD445 nm of the OMV preparation differs between a filtered and a non-filtered preparation.The lipid dye FM4-64FX can be used to estimate the concentration of the vesicles, based on lipid amount.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM can be used to view OMV (Figure 4) and estimate size range and concentration as well as examine the purity of the preparation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170228/20170228071032_0177.jpgFigure 4. TEM image of an OMV preparation, diluted in sterile dH2O by a ratio of 1:20. OMV diameter may range from 20-250. A scale bar is at the bottom left.SDS-PAGE In order to get the profile of the proteinaceous cargo of OMV, run an OMV sample, which was denatured in a sample buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dithiothreitol (DTT)/β-mercaptoethanol, on a protein gel. If you are searching for a specific protein associated with OMV, you can also run a Western blot or a dot blot assays. SDS-PAGE is also a way to compare the proteinaceous profiles of OMV isolated from different bacteria."
