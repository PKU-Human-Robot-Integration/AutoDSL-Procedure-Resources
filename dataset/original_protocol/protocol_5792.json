  "procedures": [
    "Isolate murine bone marrow derived-macrophages (see protocol below).Grow macrophages for 1 week in BMC media (see recipe and protocol below) on bacteriological petri plates.Dislodge macrophages from bacteriological petri plates with cold DPBS (calcium and magnesium free). This is done by rinsing with cold DPBS, discarding the added DPBS, repeating the wash and then keeping the plates with PBS at 4 °C for 20 min and collecting adherent cells by rinsing monolayer with DPBS using a sterile transfer pipette or serological pipette (see detailed protocol below).Add macrophages at a concentration of 3 x 105 macrophages per ml in 250-300 μl of D10 medium to chambers at least 2 h before addition of parasites to allow macrophages to adhere. Place cover back on chamber slide and place in humidified chamber at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Add 1 x 104 Toxoplasma gondii parasites to macrophages. Parasites can be added directly to the 250-300 μl of media already in chambers. Replace slide cover and allow parasites to invade for 4 h in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at a temperature of 37 °C. Generally 1-10 μl of parasites adjusted to the appropriate concentration in D10 medium is added per chamber. If you need to adjust the concentration of parasites by centrifugation followed by resuspension in fresh D10 media before adding to chambers use polystyrene or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) centrifuge tubes as parasites stick to polypropylene; centrifugation 1,700 rpm [582 rcf, 10 min].Remove the media and rinse the chamber slides with fresh D10 medium to remove any remaining extracellular parasites. In the absence of stimuli, add 250-300 μl of fresh D10 media to chamber, replace cover and incubate in humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.",
    "Do not let the cells in the chamber slide become dry at any point in the protocol as it will kill the parasites and host cells.If applicable, activate cells by dilution of stimulating agent or inhibitors in fresh D10 medium (250-300 μl/chamber).To activate macrophages, add LPS (10 ng/ml) and/or recombinant murine IFN-γ (100 U/ml).To inhibit iNOS while activating macrophages, add LPS (10 ng/ml), recombinant murine IFN-γ (100 U/ml), and aminoguanidine (1 mM).To challenge with the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) add 100 μM of SNP.Macrophages can also be pre-activated up to 24 h prior to parasite invasion versus after parasite invasion although the effect on parasite replication is likely to be different as macrophages activated after parasite invasion are generally more permissive for parasite growth.Incubate for 24 h in a humidified incubator 37 °C and 5% CO2. If rate of parasite proliferation or doubling time needs to be determined kinetics can be performed instead of a single end point ie 6, 12, 24 and 36 h post parasite challenge.Following desired incubation; pour off media and fix macrophage monolayers with 250 μl per chamber with 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted to 4% with 1x PBS) for 20 min at 4 °C.Rinse chambers twice with 1x DPBS. Remove DPBS. Do not let chambers dry out during staining.Add 100 μl of blocking buffer with Triton X-100 detergent (see recipe) for 30 min to block and permeabilize the host cells and parasites so that they can be reached by antibodies.While waiting, dilute the unlabelled primary antibodies to the appropriate concentrations in blocking buffer:Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Toxoplasma gondii - 1:1,000 dilution. However, concentration of antibody needs to be optimized by the user. Other antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii or directly-conjugated fluorescence antibodies can be substituted.",
    "Pour off the blocking solution and add 100 μl of the primary antibody dilution to each well. Let stand for 1 h.While waiting, dilute the fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies to the appropriate concentrations in blocking buffer:Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) - 1:250 dilution. Optimal concentration of antibody may need to be optimized by user.Pour off the primary antibody and rinse each well three times with wash buffer (see Recipes) for 2 min per wash. Washes are performed by dumping out solution in slide and adding wash buffer 250-300 μl per chamber and letting solution sit for approximately 2 min.Add 100 μl of the secondary antibody dilution to each well and let stand for 1 h.Pour off the secondary antibodies and rinse each well four times with wash buffer for 2 min per wash.Wash each well two times with 1x DPBS for 2 min per wash.Mount the slides with Vectashield containing DAPI or other mounting media.Observe and analyze parasites in macrophages using a fluorescent microscope with a 100x phase or differential interference contrast (DIC) objective. The internal ultrastructure of the parasite is better with phase microscopy but DIC provides a more 3-dimensional perspective. We use a Zeiss inverted Axiovert 200 motorized microscope with a 100x objective, Zeiss filter sets 31, 34, 38, and 50, and Axiovision 4.3 software.To examine the replicative rate of the parasites, a time course analysis can be performed. To examine replication the number of parasites per each PV should counted. To examine whether parasites are killed by activation the number of parasites per macrophages at 1 h compared to later time points should be examined as well. If the number of parasites per macrophages is significantly reduced over time parasite cell death has occurred.",
    "Slides can also be co-stained with lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 using a species of antibody and flourochrome different from that used to detect parasites to evaluate the extent of phagosome-lysosome fusion (Mordue and Sibley, 1997).Examine at least 100 parasite-containing vacuoles per experiment and count the number of parasites per vacuole. We suggest counting two groups of 50 vacuoles or 100 vacuoles to obtain an average plus or minus standard deviation. Note the morphology of the parasites as some activation stimuli may result in parasite death and degradation or amorphous parasite-containing vacuoles.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140927/20140927005824_4083.jpgFigure 1. Toxoplasma gondii replication in naive versus murine bone marrow-derived macrophages activated with IFN-γ and LPS. Parasites are shown in green and the macrophage nucleus is in blue due to the DAPI in the Vectashield mounting media. The parasites in the vacuole in naive macrophages have greater than 8 parasites/vacuole while the parasites following activation of infected macrophages have only two parasites per vacuole. Other representative pictures are shown in References 1-3."
