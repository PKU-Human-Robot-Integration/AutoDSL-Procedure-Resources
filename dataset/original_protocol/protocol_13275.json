  "procedures": [
    "All methods involving animals described here were approved by the ethics committee of the Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (no. 82101048).\n1. Establishing inducible osteoblast lineage-specific Stat3 knockout mice\nNOTE: Stat3fl/fl mice were obtained commercially; the Col1α2CreERT2 strain was a gift (see the Table of Materials for all details). Standardized laboratory pellet food and water and standard laboratory environmental conditions (room temperature at 22 °C to 26 °C and humidity at 50%-55%) were provided for all the animals.\nPut one sexually mature male mouse with two female mice in the same cage. After 18 days, check for newborns every day. Remove any pregnant female mice to an empty cage and keep them alone if necessary. Put male mice into other different breeding cages if the female mice are not pregnant within 30 days.\nGenerate Stat3fl/+; Col1α2CreERT2 mice by hybridizing Stat3fl/ fl mice with Col1α2CreERT2 mice; maintain all these mice on the C57BL/6 background. Collect 2-5 mm tail tips for genotyping and keep the male Stat3fl/+; Col1α2CreERT2 mice until they are sexually mature (F1).\nHybridize 6-week-old male Stat3fl/ +; Col1α2CreERT2 mice with female Stat3fl/fl mice. Collect 2-5 mm tail tips when mice are 2 weeks old for genotyping, and keep the male Stat3fl/ fl; Col1α2CreERT2(Stat3Col1α2ERT2) mice until they are sexually mature (F2).\nHybridize 6-week-old male Stat3fl/ fl; Col1α2CreERT2 mice with female Stat3fl/fl mice (F3). Collect 2-5 mm tail tips when mice are 2 weeks old for genotyping, and use the younger mice of the same genotype to replace older breeding mice when appropriate (F3+N).",
    "NOTE: The reproductive capacity of mice decreases after age 8 months, so the mice in the breeding cages must be carefully monitored and replaced as needed. In addition, according to the experimental requirements, the number of breeding cages should be appropriately increased to avoid the extinction of the target gene mice.\n2. Inducible deletion of Stat3 in Col1α2-expressing osteoblasts by tamoxifen\nDissolve tamoxifen in corn oil to 20 mg/mL in a centrifuge tube, and protect from light by wrapping in foil. Put the foil-covered centrifuge tube on a rotary mixer and mix at room temperature until completely dissolved.\n\tNOTE: Tamoxifen was obtained commercially and stored in the dark at 4 °C.\nSelect ten 6-week-old male mice and divide them into Stat3fl/fl and Stat3Col1α2ERT2 groups with five mice in each group. Administer tamoxifen (100 mg·kg-1·bw) every 2 days for 1 week by intraperitoneal injection.\n3. Orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) model\nPrepare a sterilized plastic mouse dissection platform as an operating table to immobilize the mice.\n\tNOTE: The mouse dissection table was obtained commercially and consisted of four adjustable rubber posts and one metal rod for immobilizing the mice. Use sterile instruments and tools throughout the procedure.\nAttach an elastic band to each rubber post for limb fixation.\nTie one elastic band between the two upper rubber posts; tie a thread to the elastic band to hold the lower incisors; and tie another thread to the metal rod to hold the upper incisors.\nAnesthetize 7-week-old male mice with 0.1 mL solution of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (0.1 mg·kg-1·bw) and zoletil (tiletamine hydrochloride for 20 mg·kg-1·bw and zolazepam hydrochloride for 20 mg·kg-1·bw) dissolved in saline by intraperitoneal injection prior to surgery. Make sure that the mice are under proper anesthesia throughout the operation.",
    "NOTE: Pay attention to the effective use date of drugs, and do not use expired drugs. Zoletil exhibits potent analgesic and surgical anesthesia properties.\nConfirm that the mice are under proper anesthesia by squeezing the toes of the hind limbs with fingers.\n\tNOTE: If the mice do not respond to the test, it means they are unconscious and the anesthesia has reached the desired depth. At that time, the mice are in a state of limb muscle relaxation, with smooth breathing and heart rate, and the operation can be started.\nUse vet ointment on the eyes of the mice to prevent dryness and place the anesthetized mouse in the supine position on the operating table. Use four elastic bands on the rubber posts to fix the limbs, one thread attached to the metal rod to hold the upper incisors and another one attached to an elastic band between the two upper rubber posts to hook over the lower incisors to hold the lower jaw open.\nPrepare closed-coil springs (0.25 mm wire size, 0.76 mm diameter, 1 mm length) for orthodontic force appliance.\n\tNOTE: Cut eight threads of spring for each mouse. Four threads of 1 mm in length in the middle for force appliance and two threads on each end for ligaturing using steel ligature wire.\nLigate one end of the spring prepared to the maxillary left first molar. Ligate the other end to the central incisor with a 0.1 mm steel ligature wire reinforced by light-curing restorative resin after applying adhesive to the incisors with the Q-tip to generate a stable force of a magnitude of 10 g measured by using a dynamometer.",
    "After completing the operation, put the mice in a cage with others of the same strain in recovery, or put each mouse into an empty cage alone. Make sure the mice are not left unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness 2−4 h after the operation to maintain sternal recumbency. For the next few days, feed the mice a soft diet and observe them regularly to ensure that no complications occur and to ascertain the degree of postsurgical pain; administer analgesic drugs as needed.\n\t​NOTE: Mice that have undergone surgery should not be returned to the company of other mice until fully recovered. Do not put postsurgical mice in recovery with mice that are not anesthetized. Mice must be kept warm during recovery.\nCheck the orthodontic appliance every day and exclude any experimental mice with dislodgement.\n4. Specimen collection\nEuthanize the mice at three different time points via cervical dislocation: 4 days (d4), 7 days (d7), and 10 days (d10) after the start of OTM.\nUse ophthalmic scissors to cut off the skin vertically from the cervical region and then separate the head from the body with the entire skin of the head dissected.\nCut off the skin and buccinator muscles from the bilateral angulus oris to the posterior region of the mandible. Completely disconnect the buccal muscles and the tendons attached to the coracoids to remove the mandible and trim extra bones to obtain complete maxillae. Then, remove the bone behind the bilateral third molars and tear off the palatal mucosa. Finally, disconnect the orthodontic appliance and cut off the bone between the incisors along the median palatine suture to obtain the alveolar bone of the right and left sides.\n\t​NOTE: Ensure that the region from the incisors to the third molar is kept intact on both sides.",
    "5. Preparation for paraffin section\nFixation: Immerse the harvested alveolar bone in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h and trim with ophthalmic scissors in the fume hood for sections 6 and 7.\nDecalcification: Gently wash specimens with 1x PBS for 3 x 10 min. Decalcify the specimens in universal tissue fixative (pH 8.0), replaced with fresh solution every 2 days, for 5 weeks until the bones can be easily penetrated by a needle tip.\nDehydration: Wash specimens in 1x PBS for 3 x 10 min, and then sequentially immerse them in 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, and xylene, for 2 x 1 h each solution.\nImmerse specimens in a 1:1 mix of xylene and paraffin for 30 min and then in paraffin at 65 °C overnight.\nEmbedding: Select suitable embedding tanks. Place the alveolar bone uniformly with teeth up at the same level. Remove the specimens from the embedding tank and transfer them to a -20 °C freezer, then number them when the paraffin is fully cooled and solid.\nUsing a microtome, cut twenty to forty 4 µm-thick sections continuously in the transverse plane and float on 37 °C water. Adhere the sections to microscope slides and bake at 42 °C overnight.\n6. OTM distance measurement\nPhotograph specimens from three time points vertically from the occlusal plane by stereo microscopy.\nScan the alveolar bone with a Micro-CT scanner. Reconstruct 3D images of the maximum sagittal plane of the maxillary alveolar bone, in which three molars are completely visible, using the scanner's supporting software following the manufacturer's instructions.\nMeasure the OTM distance using ImageJ software:\n\t\nOpen ImageJ software and use the Straight line tool to create a line segment of known distance.",
    "Click Analyze and choose Set Scale to enter the value of the drawn line distance in Known distance and enter units in Unit of length.\nDraw a line between the midpoints of the mesial marginal ridge of M2 and the distal marginal ridge of M1 and click Measurement. The results shown in the Length column represent the OTM distance.\n7. Histological analysis\nRegion of Interest (ROI) selection: Define the alveolar bone of the first molar (M1) as the ROI, located exactly within three roots of M1 in the transverse section at the maxillary bone. This region not only reaches the cortical bone of the first molar in the buccal-lingual direction, but also extends to the middle of the long axis of the mesiobuccal root, including the half area between the distobuccal root and the palatal root.\nAnalysis of osteogenesis\n\t\nCalcein and alizarin red double labeling and analysis\n\t\t\nCalcein and alizarin red preparation: Dissolve calcein in 2% NaHCO3 solution to 1 mg/mL and alizarin red S in H2O to 2 mg/mL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In this study, calcein and alizarin red were obtained commercially.\nAdminister calcein (20 mg·kg-1·bw) on day 1 and alizarin red S (40 mg·kg-1·bw) on day 8 by intraperitoneal injection after the commencement of OTM. Euthanize the mice on day 10 and harvest the alveolar bone.\nPrepare specimens and embed them following steps 5.1 and 5.3-5.5. For more details, refer to Yang et al.30.\nUsing a rotary microtome, cut 5 µm-thick sections continuously in the transverse plane. Adhere the sections to microscope slides and mount with coverslips using neutral balsam.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The rest of the samples must be stored with desiccant at room temperature.",
    "Examine and photograph the sections under a fluorescence microscope and calculate the mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS) according to the method previously described30.\nImmunofluorescence\n\t\t\nSelect suitable paraffin sections and bake at 65 °C for 30 min.\nDewaxing: Immerse the sections in xylene for 5 min and repeat twice with fresh xylene each time.\nRehydration: Immerse the sections sequentially in 95% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and ddH2O, each for 5 min.\nGently wash the sections with 1 x PBS for 2 x 5 min.\nAntigen retrieval: Immerse the sections in a mixture of Tris-HCl (0.05 M, pH 8.0), EDTA (0.01 M, pH 8.0), and protease K (10 µg/mL) in ddH2O and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\nGently wash the sections with 1 x PBS for 3 x 5 min.\nBlock: Remove extra fluid from the sections and draw a circle around the target area using a hydrophobic marker. To block nonspecific binding, cover with a blocking buffer containing 10% bovine serum albumin and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to dry the sections for too long, so as not to affect the results.\nPrimary antibody incubation: Dilute the anti-osteopontin (OPN) antibody with antibody diluent to the recommended concentration, and add 30-50 µL to each sample; incubate at 4 °C overnight in a humidified chamber.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Be sure to leave some water in the chamber and cover it to prevent the antibody fluid from evaporating.\nGently wash the sections with 1 x PBS for 3 x 10 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Steps 7.2.2.10-7.2.2.12 should be performed in the dark.",
    "Fluorescent secondary antibody incubation: Select an appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody corresponding to the primary antibody and dilute it to the recommended concentration. Add 30-50 µL to each sample and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nGently wash the sections with 1 x PBS for 2 x 10 min.\nUse an antifade mounting medium with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to mount the specimens. Store the sections in the dark and photograph them as soon as possible.\nCarry out fluorescence microscopy incorporating a digital camera to examine and photograph the sections and count positive cells in the regions of interest (ROIs).\nAnalysis of osteoclastogenesis\n\t\nTartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining\n\t\t\nSelect suitable paraffin sections.
