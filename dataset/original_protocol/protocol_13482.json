    "The present protocol was part of a study approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Central Florida. Informed consent was received from all human participants for the present study. To be included in the study, participants had to be between 18 years and 75 years of age, play golf at least once per month for the past year or once per week for the past 2 months, have played golf for at least 2 years, and have had at least two episodes of low back pain in the past 12 months. The exclusion criteria were balance disorders, current pregnancy, surgery to the low back or lower extremities in the past year, or an open wound in the abdominal area where the transducer must be placed.\n1. Ultrasound setup and data collection\nOpen and turn on the ultrasound device (see Table of Materials) using the On/Off button.\nPress the Patient button on the keyboard to add a new patient and select New Patient on the left side of the screen.\n\t\nEnter the desired patient ID number, ensure MSK is selected as the exam type, and click on Register. Exit to begin the exam and enter B-mode.",
    "NOTE: Ultrasound settings in MSK Abdominal Preset, B-mode: B color = Tint Map D, Write Zoom Height = 4, Write Zoom Width = 4, Thermal Index = Tls, ATO Level = Low, Focus Number = 2, Focus Number CrossXBeam = 2, Focus Depth = 50, Depth (cm) = 3, Compression = 1, Focus Width = 1, Focus Width CrossXBeam = 1, Line Density = 3, Line Density CrossXBeam = 3, Suppression = 0, Frame Average = 4, From Average CrossXBeam = 2, CrossXBeam 2, CrossXBeam # = Low, CrossXBeam Type = Mean, Edge Enhance = 3, B Steer = 0, Gray Scale Map = Gray Map C, Gain = 34, Dynamic Range = 69, Rejection = 0, Frequency (MHz) = 12.\nPosition the linear array transducer in the elastic belt by placing the head of the linear transducer through a horizontal slit in the middle of the belt (see Table of Materials). Next, apply one to two foam blocks to secure the transducer in its place.\n\t\nApply ultrasound gel (see Table of Materials) to the linear transducer. Position the transducer on the lateral abdominal wall, approximately 10 cm lateral to the umbilicus8.\nSecure the belt to the participant using the hook and loop fasteners. Ensure the belt is tight enough so that the transducer is secured perpendicular to the lateral abdominal wall8.\nAdjust the depth and gain (brightness) of the ultrasound if necessary to obtain a clear image of the fascial borders and muscle thickness of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominis. Ensure that the fascial border of the transverse abdominis is visible on the edge of the screen in this longitudinal view (Figure 1)8.",
    "NOTE: The depth will depend on the size of the individual being measured, but ensure that the deep fascial border of the transverse abdominis is visible and the image is clear.\nOnce the image is clear, position the patient in a manner that mirrors the task they will complete. For example, if they perform a golf swing, have them stand in their setup position. Press Freeze, then Store to capture a static image, save it to the patient's exam, and measure in real time or access it later to measure the resting muscle thickness.\n\t\tNOTE: See Figure 1 for an example of a clear image of the lateral abdominal wall using B-mode ultrasound.\nSelect Freeze again to return to live imaging. Press Store to begin recording in B-mode video. On the bottom-right corner of the screen, check that a timer begins and is highlighted in bright green, indicating that a video is being captured. Instruct the participant to take a full golf swing once the recording has begun.\n\t\nPress Store again to end the video and save it to their exam.\n\t\tNOTE: Saved images and videos will appear below the active image, with up to five visible per row. Select the cursor to scroll through or select previous images.\nRepeat step 1.4 as many times as necessary for the study. Adjust the positioning of the ultrasound probe within the foam block as needed if the image becomes blurry.\n\tNOTE: Typical protocols comparing biofeedback and non-biofeedback conditions use between 3 and 10 repetitions per condition11,17.\n\t\nAfter each trial, review the video for image clarity. If the image becomes anechoic (entirely black) at any point, it indicates that the ultrasound probe moved during the swing. In such a case, exclude the trial and re-measure.",
    "Following each swing, have the patient positioned where they can view the ultrasound screen. Open the most recent trial.\n\t\nProvide a brief overview and description of the muscles of interest (for a rotational task, this will include the external and internal obliques). Describe how the muscles should get thicker during the movement and show them their trial, providing education based on each attempt.\nFor example, if the obliques stay relatively the same size throughout the task, instruct them to focus during the next attempt to contract their core muscles forcefully throughout the movement instead of passively rotating the trunk.\n\t\t​NOTE: Emphasis on trunk rotation as a power source during a golf swing is a common trait of higher-skilled golfers18. During rotational movements, it is generally not feasible to provide biofeedback during the task. Therefore, providing feedback following each trial is thought to be acceptable19.\nRepeat the biofeedback trials for as many attempts as desired. Provide the ultrasound images as well as verbal cueing or instruction following each attempt, adjusting the cueing as needed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64333/64333fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Image of the right lateral abdominal wall during quiet standing.

Using the cursor, hover over the desired image from the library below the active image and click on Enter.\n\t\nClick on Measure once to open the measurement tool. Click on Enter when the cursor is over the superior fascial border of the muscle of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: For the present study, the external and internal obliques were measured as they are the muscles of interest, but one can also measure the transverse abdominis in this view.",
    "Click on Enter again once the cursor is over the inferior fascial border.\n\t\tNOTE: The length of the measured segment will appear on the bottom-left portion of the screen, measured in centimeters. Record this length in a spreadsheet organized to include the participant or patient name/number and resting muscle thickness.\nRepeat steps 2.1.1-2.1.2 for all the images needed to measure for both the external and internal obliques.\n3. B-Mode video processing\nOnce the desired number of videos have been captured, open the first video to be processed. Using the cursor, hover over the desired image from the library below the active image and click on the Enter button.\nAdjust the viewing frame within the B-mode video until the first frame is reached. Determine the desired sampling rate.\n\tNOTE: Previous literature has used 10% intervals of the total frames from 0%-100% for analysis, but one may wish to use more or less depending on the aims20.\nOnce there is the desired frame open, use the Measure tool. Click the button once to open the tool, place the cursor on the superior fascial border of the muscle of interest, and click on Enter to place the first end of the measurement.\nDrag the measurement line to the inferior fascial border of the muscle of interest and click on Enter again to complete the measurement.\n\tNOTE: The distance measured will appear on the bottom-left portion of the screen.\nPress Store to save the measured image.\nRecord the measurement in a spreadsheet organized to include participant or patient name/number, frame number, and thickness measurements. Return to the original B-mode video frame (step 3.2).",
    "Scroll to the next frame to be analyzed. For example, if one is sampling 11 time points (10% intervals from 0%-100%) of a swing that captured 100 frames, one will now use frame 10 (i.e., 10/100 corresponds to frame 10 out of 100 total frames).\n\t\nRepeat steps 3.3-3.4 to measure the next frame.\nRepeat step 3.7 until all the desired frames are measured.\nMove to the next video and repeat steps 3.1-3.8 until all the videos are measured.\n\t​NOTE: See Figure 2 for a compilation of the processed frames throughout phases of a golf swing.\n4. Activation ratio calculation\nNOTE: An activation ratio is commonly used to determine the degree of muscle thickness change8,9,11. The formula for the activation ratio is contracted thickness (cm)/resting thickness (cm).\nTo determine the activation ratio at a specific time point, measure the thickness by following step 3. Divide this value by the resting image thickness obtained from step 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64333/64333fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Frame-by-frame analysis of a B-mode video on the trail side (right) lateral abdominal wall of a right-handed golfer.
