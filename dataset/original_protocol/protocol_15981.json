    "Day 1, 2/3—Immunomagnetic purification of T cells or T cell subsets from PBMC using Miltenyi MicroBeads, MACS columns and separators\nThe isolation of the desired cell population is performed according manufacturer's instruction. Keep cells and buffers at 4°C during the procedure whenever possible.\nFollowing is an example for the positive selection of human CD8+ T cells (use CD8 MicroBeads cat. no. 130-045-201) with LS Columns (cat. no. 130-042-401):\n10.

Remove the column from the separator and place it on a 15-ml conical tube.\n24. Pipette appropriate amount of MACS buffer onto the column. Immediately flush out magnetically labeled cells by firmly pushing the plunger (provided with the LS/MS columns) into the column.",
    "As quality control, the purity of enriched T cells should be analyzed by flow cytometry. Stain for single cells (FSC-A vs. FSC-H), live/dead (7-AAD-/7-AAD+), and for subset markers for which the T cells were sorted (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8). Sample data shown in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.93#cpim93-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d654c83f-7fc8-43d9-b333-0e34e65e7aca/cpim93-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nIsolation of CD8+ from healthy donor PBMC. PBMCs were isolated from LRC using Ficoll density gradient (Day 1, 1/3) and CD8-positive T cells were isolated by magnetic separation (Day 1, 2/3). PBMCs (A) and T cells after isolation (B) were stained with CD4-PE/Cy7 and CD8-VioBlue and subjected to analysis on a Miltenyi MACSQuant flow cytometer. Gates were set on lymphocytes (FSC/SSC).\nDay 1, 3/3—Activation of T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads\n25. Count isolated T cells and prepare an appropriate amount of T cell medium.\n26. Take off the amount of cells required for transduction. We use 5 × 105 cells per transduction condition and save some cells to use as an untransduced control.\n27. Centrifuge for 10 min at 300 × g, 4°C.\n28. Aspirate the supernatant completely.\n29. Resuspend the cells in T cell medium at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per ml.\n30. Distribute 0.5 ml per well of a 48-well plate.\n31. Vortex the Dynabeads and take the appropriate amount—basically use 5 × 105 beads per transduction condition (1:1 cell-to-bead ratio)\n32. Wash the Dynabeads once as described in manufacturer's instruction.\nAdd an equal amount, or at least 1 ml, of MACS buffer to the Dynabeads and incubate them for 1 min on a magnet, before discarding supernatant.\n33. Resuspend Dynabeads in T cell medium at a concentration of 1 × 106 beads per transduction condition.\n34. Distribute Dynabeads to the T cells by adding 0.5 ml of the resuspended Dynabeads per well.",
    "35. Add 50 IU/ml IL-2 to the T cells\n36. Incubate in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37°C.\nDay 2—Transduction of activated T cells\n37. Thaw the lentivirus at room temperature and mix it briefly.\n38. Gently remove 667 µl from each well of the 48-well plate, without touching the T cells.\n333 µl medium remain on the T cells. Assume 5 × 105 T cells per well.\n39. Add 5 µg/ml polybrene per well.\nPredilution of polybrene (c = 10 mg/ml) 1:10 in T cell medium may facilitate pipetting.\n40. Add lentivirus at a MOI of 3.\nFor 5 × 105 T cells, you need 1.5 × 106 TU (transforming units) lentivirus.\n41. Centrifuge the plate f0r 45 min at 800 × g, 32°C, slow acceleration, no break for deceleration.\n42. Incubate the cells for 4 hr in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37°C.\n43. After 4 hr, add 667 µl fresh T cell medium per well.\n44. Add 50 IU/ml IL-2 to each well.\nDay 3 and after—Expansion of transduced T cells\nExpand T cells for up to 2 weeks. Examine cultures daily, noting cell size and shape.\n45. Exchange half of the medium every two days, each time also adding IL-2 to a final concentration of 50 IU/ml the T cells.\n46. Count the T cells twice weekly after thorough resuspension. When the cell density exceeds 2 × 106 cells/ml, transfer the cells into a bigger vessel, diluting them to 5 × 105 cells/ml.\nDay 6—Removal of Dynabeads\n47. Harvest the T cells and transfer them into a 15-ml conical tube.\n48. Gently resuspend the T cells in their medium within the tube to remove cells sticking to the Dynabeads.\n49. Place the tube in a magnetic stand.",
    "50. After 1 min, remove T cells suspension without touching the Dynabeads and transfer them to the culture vessel and scale up as needed.\nAs quality control, the transduction efficiency of T cells should be analyzed by flow cytometry. Therefore, stain for live/dead, the relevant T cell subset, and the CAR-specific transduction marker that was used (e.g., Myc-tag or EGFR). Sample data shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.93#cpim93-fig-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f62d230-46f2-4a10-8b57-72c3cbe32e65/cpim93-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nEfficacy of lentiviral gene transfer. CD8-positive T cells were activated (Day 1, 3/3) and lentivirally transduced (Day 2) with a transgene encoding for CAR and truncated EGFR as transduction marker. 6 days after transduction, cells were stained with CD8-VioBlue and EGFR-specific antibody to detect the CAR+ cells. Cells were subjected to analysis on a Miltenyi MACSQuant flow cytometer. Gates were set on Lymphocytes (FSC/SSC) and CD8+ T cells.\nOptional steps\nIf the expression cassette of the CAR contains a tag (e.g., Myc-tag, FLAG-tag or truncated EGFR), CAR-expressing T cells can be enriched on day 10 or after. Therefore, transduced T cells can be labeled and sorted with a suitable tag-target reaction. The cells are first stained with a tag-specific biotinylated antibody and afterward with anti-Biotin magnetic beads. CAR T cells can be enriched by positive magnetic sorting as denoted at Day 1, 2/3.\nAnother optional step is the expansion of CAR T cells with feeder cells at day 10 or after. Therefore, T cells are stimulated with an irradiated, antigen-expressing target cell line for at least 10 days or longer. As an example, the CD19+ Jeko-1 cell line can be used to expand CD19-CAR T cells. Irradiation of the feeder cells is mandatory to stop prevent them from overgrowing the T cells.\nExpansion of 5 × 105 CAR T cells in a 25-cm2 flask",
    "51. Resuspend CAR T cells by pipetting up and down and count them.\n52. Take 5 × 105 CAR T cells and centrifuge for 10 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\n53. Resuspend the CAR T cells in 10 ml T cell medium and put them in a 25-cm2 flask.\n54. Harvest feeder cells and count them.\n55. Take 1 × 107 feeder cells and centrifuge for 10 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\n56. Resuspend feeder cells in T cell medium.\n57. Irradiate feeder cell line to 80 Gy.\n58. Resuspend the feeder cells by pipetting up and down and count them.\n59. Take 3.5 × 106 feeder cells and centrifuge for 10 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\n60. Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml T cell medium and add them to CAR T cells.\nIL-2 is not added on the first day of expansion!\nExpand T cells for up to 10 days. Examine cultures daily, noting cell size and shape. Exchange half of the medium every 2 days, each time also adding 50 IU/ml IL-2 to the T cells. After 5 days, feeder cells should be gone from the culture. CAR T cell phenotype should be analyzed by flow cytometry and T cells can be used for functional analysis."
