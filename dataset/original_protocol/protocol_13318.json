  "procedures": [
    "The animal experiments were approved by the Medical Standards and Ethics Committee of Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which conforms to the China legislation on the use and care of laboratory animals. In the present study, 6 week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 150-180 g were used. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see the Table of Materials).\n1. Establishment of a full-thickness cartilage defects model in rats\nAfter 1 week of acclimatization to the new environment, randomly and equally divide the rats into two groups (n = 8 rats/group). The rats in the sham group will have the sham surgery, while the rats in the model group will have the experimental surgery involving drilling holes in the femoral trochlear groove.\n\tNOTE: Each cage must be covered with sterile corncob paddings (see the Table of Materials) to protect the rats' toes.\nAnesthetize the rats by an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg). Then, gently press the toes of the rats to confirm adequate anesthesia. Use a vet ointment on the rats' eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: The animal surgery needs to be performed in a dedicated operating room using autoclaved surgical instruments. The operators must wear clean laboratory coats, facemasks, head covers, and sterile gloves during the surgery. Place sterile pads over the surgical area and sterilize all equipment before use. Provide thermal support throughout the procedure.\nPlace the rat on the operating table in a supine position, shave the left and right hind limbs, and clean the knee joint area with surgical soap, followed by alternating antiseptic povidone-iodine solution and alcohol three times under sterile conditions. Place a sterile drape over the rat, and expose the disinfected knee joint only.",
    "Make a 1 cm incision with a scalpel blade (number 11) in the middle of the rat knee joint from top to bottom, and cut the joint capsule and quadriceps femoris tendon along the medial edge of the patella after the superficial dissection.\n\tNOTE: The quadriceps femoris tendon is attached to the patella and to the femoral condyle during the flexion of the knee joint13. The groove seen in the joint capsule is the femoral trochlear groove, and the distal femoral condyle forms the medial and lateral condyles.\nTurn the patella to the outside, and flex the tibia and fibula at a 90° angle to fully expose the trochlea of the femoral condyle. Use a 1.6 mm diameter circular drill bit (see the Table of Materials) vertical to the cartilage surface at 4,000 rpm for 10 s to make one full-thickness cartilage defect in the femoral trochlear groove with a depth of 0.1 mm.\n\tNOTE: Use saline intermittently to minimize thermal trauma to the surrounding bone tissue during the drilling procedure.\nWipe the surgical site with cotton balls soaked in a 0.9% saline solution, replace the patella, keep the knee in an extension position, and suture the incision layer by layer with nonabsorbable 4-0 sutures (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nPlace the animals on heating pads with sternal recumbency, monitor them until they wake up, and then return them to their cages. Inject buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 8 h three times after the operation for pain relief.\nTest the pain-related behavior of all the rats at 3 days, 10 days, and 17 days after the surgery, as described in section 2.\n2. Mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT)\nNOTE: The MWT of the bilateral posterior plantar of rats was measured by the classical von Frey filament pain measurement method14.",
    "Place the rat in a single plastic chamber (17 cm x 11 cm x 13 cm) on a wire mesh platform (see the Table of Materials), and place the wire mesh base 50 cm above a table. Measure the MWT after 30 min of adaptation.\nPress the von Frey filament (see the Table of Materials) perpendicularly on the plantar surface of each rat's hind paw, and bend the brush for about 2 s, avoiding the thickest part of the center of the hind paw.\nGradually increase the stimulus weight from the lowest 4 g until a positive response (paw withdrawal or paw licking) occurs.\n\tNOTE: The interval between each stimulation should be more than 1 min. The MWT is defined as three positive responses in five stimulations; record the stimulus weight in grams.\nCalculate the mean values for the sham and model groups according to the recorded minimal stimulus weight in grams.\n3. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis\nAt 17 and 56 days after surgery, anesthetize the rats with a 40 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium (i.p.), and sacrifice all the rats by withdrawing blood from the heart. Isolate the knees by cutting the bone at the mid-femur and mid-tibia, and dissect the surrounding muscle tissue. Remove the knee joints for histological analysis.\nFix the knee joints in 20 mL of 10% paraformaldehyde solution for 48 h at room temperature, and then decalcify them with 20 mL of 10% EDTA solution in an orbital shaker for 8 weeks at 4 °C. Change the EDTA solution every day.\nTrim the knee joint to fit the size of the embedding box. Embed the dehydrated knee joints in 100% paraffin15.",
