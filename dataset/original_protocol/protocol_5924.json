    "Antigen-specific T cell proliferation and degranulation   Wash PBMC containing low percentages of antigen-specific T cells with 14 ml PBS.   Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 500 x g at room temperature (RT).   Resuspend the cells in PBS to a concentration of 20 x 106 cells/ml, and add 2.5 μM CFSE at a 1:1 ratio (so in case of 500 μl cell suspension, add 500 μl 2.5 μM CFSE). The end concentration of CFSE will be 1.25 μM.   Incubate the cells for 10 min at RT.   Then, add pure FCS at a 1:1 ratio (so in case of 1 ml CFSE-cell suspension, add 1 ml FCS).   After 2 min, wash the PBMC twice with 14 ml of IMDM/10% HS (centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 500 x g at RT), and count the cell number.   Resuspend the PBMC to a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/ml in IMDM/ 10% HS.   Plate 500 μl PBMC suspension per well of a 24-wells plate.   Use mature monocyte-derived DC expressing the correct HLA-molecule for stimulation.   Wash the DC with 14 ml PBS.   Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 500 x g at RT.   Resuspend the DC subsequently in 500 μl IMDM containing 10 μM antigen-specific peptide.   Incubate the DC for 30 min at 37 °C in the incubator.   Add 14 ml PBS to the DC.   Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 500 x g at RT.   Resuspend the DC in IMDM/10% HS to a concentration of 0.2 x 106 cells/ml.   Add 500 μl DC suspension to each well containing CFSE-labeled PBMC.   Culture the cells in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.",
    "After 5 days, remove from each well 500 μl supernatant and add 500 μl IMDM/10% HS containing 100 U/ml IL-2 and 10 ng/ml IL-15, so the end concentration in the wells will be 50 U/ml IL-2 and 5 ng/ml IL-15. Supernatants can be used for cytokine analysis.      Overnight restimulation   At day 7 of culture, 500 μl supernatant was removed.   Add to each well 500 μl IMDM/10% HS containing 10 μM antigen-specific peptide, so the end concentration is 5 μM Antigen-specific peptide.   In addition, add 6.5 μl CD107a-PE antibody to each well.   Culture the cells overnight in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.   The following day, harvest the cultured cells and count the cell numbers.   Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 500 x g at room temperature.   Resuspend the cells in 100 μl IMDM/10% HS and add 1 μl APC-conjugated antigen-specific tetramer.   Incubate the cells for 20 min in the dark, at RT.   Then (without prior washing!), add 2.5 μl CD3 PE-Cy7 and 1 μl CD8 Alexa-Fluor-700.   Incubate the cells for 30 min at ice, in the dark.   Subsequently, wash cells with 1 ml FACS buffer.   Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 500 x g at RT.   Resuspend the cells in 300 μl FACS buffer containing 0.1% Sytox blue solution.   Analyze the samples on the Navios flow cytometer.
