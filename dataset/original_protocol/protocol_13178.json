    "This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All adult donors provided written informed consent to allow further use of the collected tissue samples. The protocol follows the guidelines of our institution's human research ethics committee.\n1. Harvest of adipose tissue\nHarvest the adipose tissue by performing a standard liposuction in a conventional fat-harvesting technique described in previous publications26,27. Ensure to use a tumescent solution that consists of regular ringer's lactate and epinephrine in a ratio of 1: 200,000.\nPerform the liposuction with a 4 mm aspiration cannula, under negative pressure and vibration, into a sterile bag. Transfer the harvested fat to the laboratory immediately.\n2. mSVF-Isolation\nPerform the following steps (sections 2 and 3) in a cell culture hood to provide an aseptic work area. Wear a regular lab coat and gloves to ensure biological safety level 2.\nPrepare the culture medium: Supplement 500 mL of high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagles's Medium (DMEM) with 50 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 mL of penicillin-streptomycin.\nTransfer the lipoaspirate into a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nTransfer the lipoaspirate into a sterile 20 mL Luer-lock syringe and attach a 1.4 mm connector. Ensure that no air is inside the syringe.\nAttach a second 20 mL Luer-lock syringe to the contralateral side of the 1.4 mm connector.\nPush the adipose tissue from one syringe to the other for a total of 30 times.\nTransfer the emulsified fat into a fresh 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifugate the emulsified fat at 500 x g for 10 min.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the oily top layer. Then, collect the central purified mSV-layer. Transfer it into a fresh 50 mL centrifuge tube and discard the aqueous phase.\nFill the centrifuge tube with culture medium (from step 2.2) up to the 40 mL mark.",
    "Place the centrifuge tube into the centrifuge and once again centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.\nCollect the resulting mSVF-layer and transfer it into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube.\n3. Manufacturing of mSVF-fibrin hydrogel\nCombine 100 µL of mSVF with 10 µL of thrombin (100 U/mL), 10 µL of CaCl2 (80 mM), and 70 µL of tranexamic acid (100 mg/mL) in a sterile 1.5 mL tube.\nUse a fresh pipette tip to add 10 µL of fibrinogen (100 mg/mL) as the last component, shortly before application. Beware that hydrogel-polymerization is observed within approximately 10-30 s.\nFor clinical application, perform this last step shortly before topical administration, preferably at the bedside. For analytical purposes, transfer into a 12-well plate by pipetting.\n4. Viability assay and histology\nPipette 200 µL of the mSVF-hydrogel mixture from step 3.3 into one well of a 12-well plate.\nPipette 100 µL of the mSVF-collection (step 2.12.) into one well as a positive control.\nPipette 200 µL of fibrin hydrogel only into one well as a negative control.\nPlace the 12-well plate into a regular incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nAfter this time, add 1 mL of resazurin (alamar blue, 10% concentration, diluted in culture medium) to each well.\nAfter the addition, incubate the 12 well-plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, measure the first fluorescence intensity using a cell imaging multimode microplate reader using an excitation wavelength of 555 nm and an emission wavelength of 596 nm.\nPerform consecutive fluorescence intensity measurements on days 3 and 7.",
    "If histologic assessment is necessary, stop the experiment on days 1, 3, and 7 and fix the fibrin hydrogel in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 24 h. After fixation, add 1% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and store it at 4 °C.\nEmbed the hydrogels in an optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and section frozen blocks at 10 µm thickness with a cryostat. Stain the sections with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) solution according to standard protocols28.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
