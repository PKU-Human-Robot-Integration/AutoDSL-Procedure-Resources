    "We describe the methodology developed for an ex vivo mouse model for physiologic characterization of their properties. Procedures and all experiments presented were undertaken in adult (8+ weeks) C57Bl/6 mice, but the approach has been used in mice as young as postnatal day 7. Thoracic chain ganglia in continuity with communicating rami, spinal nerves, and ventral roots are not dissected from surrounding tissue. Rather, they are left adherent to the ribcage to prevent nerve injury. Access to communicating rami in mice is difficult, so recruitment of preganglionic axons is instead achieved by stimulating ventral roots. Specialty fabrication of tight-fitting glass suction electrodes enables stable extracellular recordings of compound action potentials.  The anatomical organization of preganglionic projections to tSPNs is shown and described in Figure 2. To access the sympathetic ganglia and connections to the ventral root for recording, the following series of procedures are important: (1) the peritoneum must be removed; (2) to facilitate recordings, the chain should be carefully separated from embedded brown adipose tissue, and care is required as separation can easily sever the interganglionic nerve or rami; (3) as the ganglia themselves are shrouded in a collagen sheath, with individual tSPNs further encased in a glial covering, preparations that desire access to individual neurons for whole-cell recordings require both preincubation in collagenase and mechanical disruption of the glial casing using patch electrode shaped capillary tubes attached to a micromanipulator or glass probes.  Preparation for experimental studies first involves dissecting the vertebral column by making lateral incisions through the ribcage. Using a combination of iridectomy microdissection scissors, forceps, and fine-tipped glass probes, the peritoneum is peeled away. While collagenase is required for whole-cell recordings, we have undertaken population studies without it (Blum et al., 2020).",
    "Nonetheless, seal quality and signal resolution of population suction electrode recordings are superior following collagenase treatment. If collagenase is used, the vertebral column is allowed to incubate in a heated chamber filled with continuously oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and collagenase solution (Blum et al., 2020). The chain is cleaned of remaining fat and connective tissue. A ventral vertebrectomy exposes the spinal cord and ventral roots.  An ex vivo approach offers the ability to superfuse pharmacological agents to assess actions at known doses without concern for drug access (Blackman and Purves, 1969;      Lichtman et al., 1980; Thorne and Horn, 1997;      Ireland et al., 1998). This is shown in Figure 3 with blocked recruitment of tSPNs following application of hexamethonium, a ganglionic nicotinic receptor antagonist (Li and Horn, 2006;      Wehrwein et al., 2016). For studies on recruitment of segmental preganglionic axons, the spinal cord and dorsal roots are removed, leaving behind only intact ventral root connections.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4189/bioprotoc-11-20-4189-g002.jpgFigure 2. Anatomical organization of preganglionic projections to tSPNs. (A) Ex vivo dissection and identification of chain ganglia. Transparent chain ganglia are shown in the right panel (arrows). (B-C) Overview of anatomical organization of connectivity between sympathetic preganglionic and postganglionic neurons. Preganglionic axons exit the ventral root and enter the sympathetic chain via the white ramus. Those innervating paravertebral postganglionic neurons (tSPNs) do so within several chain ganglia via rostrocaudally projecting collaterals in the interganglionic nerve. Other preganglionics axons do not innervate tSPNs within chain ganglia but may travel along the interganglionic nerve before exiting to innervate prevertebral ganglia (not shown).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4189/bioprotoc-11-20-4189-g003.jpgFigure 3. Ex vivo dissection enables the study of multisegmental preganglionic actions.  (A) Experimental configuration. Trumpet-shaped glass electrodes placed on the ventral root (green arrow) and IGN (red arrow) enable stable extracellular recordings (left). Ganglia between sites of stimulation and recording are indicated by black arrows.",

Examples of electrical (left) and optogenetic (blue laser light; right) intensity-dependent recruitment of preganglionic axons from the the T10 ventral root in ChAT::CHR2 transgenic mice. Here, the recording suction electrode captured direct and synaptically-evoked population responses from the cut interganglionic nerve immediately caudal to the T12 chain ganglion. Stimulation intensity differences in recruitment are shown with duration kept constant (200 ms for electrical; 5 ms for optical). Blue vertical line and bar represent respective stimulus timing. Waveforms are averages of three episodes at labeled intensities. Shown is preferential intensity-dependent recruitment of the fastest conducting axons with electrical (early) and slowest conducting (late) axons with optogenetic stimulation, respectively. Recruitment profiles were undertaken in collagenase-treated tissue from a ChAT::ChR2 mouse. (C) Use of ganglionic blockers to discriminate preganglionic from postganglionic activity. Block of synaptically-recruited postganglionic (tSPN) activity following application of the nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium (100 µM) is shown in the lower panel. The shaded area in both panels highlights this loss.See Video 1 for instructions on tissue preparation.

Maintain with urethane (intraperitoneal injection, at 2 g/kg for in vitro electrophysiology). Confirm anesthetic depth via lack of pinch-evoked foot withdrawal reflex and eye blink reflex.",
    "Use 25 G needles to pin animal down with dorsal side facing up in a dissection dish.Pinch the skin near the tail and use scissors to cut up midline to remove dorsal skin and expose underlying dorsal surface of the vertebral column. The visible dorsal surface includes muscle overlying the vertebral column and dorsal spinal processes. Use forceps to remove excess or loose hair (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 0:00-1:18).To remove thoracic vertebral column and attached chain, begin lateral incisions 5 mm away from the midline near the L3 vertebrae. Cut through muscle and ribcage rostrally to the T1 vertebrae ensuring the scissors run parallel to the midline. Repeat incision on the opposite side. Pinch the column and make a transverse cut below T3. Lift vertebral column to separate and cut viscera. Make a transverse cut above T1 to remove thoracic vertebral column (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 1:20-2:40).Quickly rinse isolated tissue in oxygenated high-Mg2+ (6.5 mM)/low-Ca2+ (1.2 mM) aCSF (see Recipe 1) to remove excess blood and fat.Perform collagenase treatment (if desired). Place tissue in a 1.5 ml tube or dish filled with a continuously oxygenated solution of 20 mg-Type III Collagenase per 1-ml aCSF (see Recipe 2), maintained at 36°C for 1 h. If necessary, trim tissue to fit collagenase treatment tube (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 3:13-3:24).A2. Tissue Stabilization and Electrode Placement for Compound Action Potential Recordings If collagenase treatment was used, remove tissue from 1.5 ml tube and quickly rinse in oxygenated aCSF (see Recipe 2) to remove digested tissue.Pin vertebral column dorsal up in perfusion dissection dish filled with oxygenated high magnesium low calcium microdissection fluid at room temperature. Using scissors, remove excess fat and muscle to expose midline (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 3:26-3:46).",
    "Using scissors, cut the vertebral column along midline from rostral to caudal end (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 4:08-5:08).Flip tissue and pin such that dorsal side is facing down. Using microdissecting spring scissors, cut vertebral column along midline to expose the spinal cord (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 5:09-7:30).Carefully separate two halves of the tissue to expose spinal roots. Using Vannas microscissors, cut ventral roots close to the spinal cord. Cut dorsal roots close to the vertebral column. Once all roots have been cut, remove spinal cord with attached dorsal roots and discard (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 7:59-11:23).Before electrode placement, ensure the tissue is securely pinned. Using glass probes or forceps, carefully peel away any remaining peritoneum and allow the tissue to rest for 30 min. The time required to set up and position electrodes is the ideal time to allow the tissue to rest (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 11:24-12:12).At this point, individual ganglia of the paravertebral chain should be visible. Glass suction electrodes can be placed on ventral roots and ganglia of interest. To place electrodes, move the electrode manipulator close to the recording dish. Use the manipulator’s dials to move the electrode close to the intended nerve or ventral root such that the tip of the electrode is touching the cut end of the nerve or ventral root. Apply mild suction to stabilize initially. Once all electrodes are similarly placed, apply more suction to stabilize.The sample can provide stable recordings for at least 12 h if the bath is continuously oxygenated and the bath temperature is maintained at 22°C. Viability at elevated temperatures has not been explored systematically.The electrophysiology rig and perfusion system are detailed in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4189/bioprotoc-11-20-4189-g004.jpgFigure 4.

The bath perfusion system is shown in blue.Ex vivo mouse dissection for whole-cell patch clamp recordings or calcium imagingB1. Tissue Preparation and Collagenase Treatment Anesthetize mice as described in Procedure A1.1.Pin animal down with dorsal-side facing up in a dissection dish.Use scissors to remove dorsal skin and expose underlying vertebral column.To remove thoracic vertebral column and attached chain, begin lateral incisions 5 mm away from the midline near the L3 vertebrae. Cut through muscle and ribcage rostrally to the T1 vertebrae ensuring the scissors run parallel to the midline. Repeat incision on the opposite side. Make transverse cuts above T1 and L3 to remove thoracic vertebral column.Halve the spinal column by cutting along midline of vertebral column on dorsal and ventral sides. Remove the spinal cord and reserve both halves of the vertebral column for the next step.Quickly rinse isolated vertebral columns in oxygenated high magnesium low calcium microdissection fluid (see Recipe 1) to remove excess blood and fat.Place tissue in a 1.5 ml tube or dish filled with a continuously oxygenated solution of 20 mg-Type III Collagenase per 1-ml aCSF (see Recipe 2) maintained at 36°C for 1 h.B2. Preparation for Whole-Cell Patch Clamp Recordings or Calcium Imaging Remove tissue from 1.5 ml tube and quickly rinse in oxygenated aCSF (see Recipe 2) to remove digested tissue and residual collagenase.Pin vertebral column ventral up in perfusion dissection dish filled with oxygenated high magnesium low calcium microdissection solution (see Recipe 1) at room temperature.Using glass probes or forceps, carefully peel away any remaining peritoneum.Remove the chain by using microscissors to sever rami (Video 1. Sympathetic Chain Dissection 12:36-15:20).",
    "Using forceps and insect pins, pin the chain down onto a clear Sylgaard recording dish through which recirculating, oxygenated aCSF (see Recipe 2) is continuously perfused. If the tissue is being used for calcium imaging place, the chain in a recording chamber fitted with a glass cover slip on the bottom. Take some high vacuum grease on a cotton swab and apply it to the bottom surface of the recording chamber. Press the glass cover slip onto the grease to secure the glass to the recording chamber and create a waterproof seal.Before any electrode placement, allow the tissue to rest for 30 min. The time required to set up and position electrodes is the ideal time to allow the tissue to rest.For calcium imaging, cells are imaged from below using an inverted Olympus scope. For whole-cell patch clamp, cells can be identified using an upright microscope affixed with a low-light camera. Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy can be used to visualize tSPNs, while appropriate epifluorescent illumination can be used to identify fluorescently labeled tSPNs (e.g., Cre-dependent reporter mice). See Figure 5 for representative examples of the field of view for whole-cell patch clamp (Figure 5B) and calcium imaging (Figure 5C) experiments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4189/bioprotoc-11-20-4189-g005.jpgFigure 5. Genetic approaches enable the study of molecularly distinct tSPN subpopulations.

Whole-cell recording from a fluorescently-identified NPY+ tSPN in a NYP::tdTomato mouse shows neuronal response properties to a series of depolarizing voltage or current steps. (C) Ca2+ signals in NPY::GCaMP6f tSPNs in T7-T8 whole thoracic ganglia evoked by stimulation of the interganglionic nerve. Shown are changes in activity following electrical stimulation with a 10Hz, 5-pulse train.",
    "After identifying a tSPN, gently clean the membrane by using an electrode filled with aCSF flushing the area lightly. Then replace the electrode with one filled with intracellular solution and gradually approach the tSPN with 0.2cc positive pressure, subsequently reduced to 0.05-0.1cc when the electrode is close to contacting the cell membrane.Once the electrode contacts the membrane, release the positive pressure and apply a 0.1cc negative pressure and hold the electrode at -80mV. This allows the membrane to form a GOhM seal around the electrode tip. After the resistance is stable at GOhm range with ~-10 nA injected current, quickly apply 1cc syringe suction or a mouth suction pulse to break through the membrane.The sample can provide stable recordings for at least 12 h if the bath is continuously oxygenated and temperature is maintained at 22°C.Manufacture of Trumpet-Shaped Tips of Glass Suction Electrodes and Patch Electrodes (Figure 6)Position glass capillary tubes on a vertical puller (Narishige, PP-83). Heat center and allow for two ends of capillary tube to be drawn apart 1-2 mm without breaking.Allow the stretched capillary tube to come to room temperature. Without adjusting heating coil, heat capillary tube until two halves separate. Keep half with the bulbous tip.Score electrode underneath the bulbous tip using the edge of a glass slide. Tap electrode tip against glass slide to remove section above the score mark.Place electrode in a microforge (e.g., Narishige MF-9 Microforge) fitted with a curved filament. The electrode should be placed such that the neck of the electrode tip is equidistant from the curved edges of the filament.Heat filament using the medium heat setting to trumpet the neck of the electrode. The trumpet shape promotes tight-fitting, stable recordings.",
    "The large-diameter mouth of the electrode allows the whole nerve (and sometimes ganglion) to enter the electrode, while the small-diameter neck locks the nerve in place.Pull patch electrodes from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5-mm outer diameter, 1.2-mm inside diameter, filamented, borosilicate glass capillaries on the vertical puller) for a target resistance of 4-7 MΩ. Fill electrodes with patch electrode solution (see Recipe 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4189/bioprotoc-11-20-4189-g006.jpgFigure 6.

(I-J) View of electrode in the Microforge before and after heating.Manufacture of Sylgard-coated dissecting dishTake the bottom half of a 100mm plastic Petri dish and set it on a flat surface.Follow instructions found in the SYLGARDTM 170 Silicone Elastomer Kit to mix 40 ml of encapsulant in a disposable plastic weighing dish.Slowly pour encapsulant into Petri dish until the dish is filled halfway up (roughly 35 ml of encapsulate). Quickly pouring creates bubbles and an uneven surface for dissection.Gently tap Petri dish on a benchtop to release bubbles trapped in the encapsulant.Set the dish aside in an undisturbed location to allow the encapsulant to cure for 24 h at room temperature.Manufacture of suction electrodes (Figure 1)Cut a section of insulated shielded two-wire cable to the desired length. The length will vary depending on how far the amplifier is from the recording dish.",
    "Extra length will help the electrode cable to be slack and prevent tugging issues during recording.Use the wire stripper to strip 1.5 inches of the outer PVC jacket at each cut end to reveal the braided shielding.Cut away the braided shielding at one end to reveal the insulated copper cables (typically black and red). At the other end, unbraid the shield wire material from the pair of copper cables and re-twist into a point. Set cable aside.Cut to free 5 inches of insulated copper wire. Use the wire stripper to strip 0.5 inches of insulation on both ends.Splice together one end of the copper wire from Step E4 with the pointed shielding in step 3. Secure and insulate the spliced region with electrical tape.Secure the other end of the copper to the single banana plug using a precision screwdriver to loosen the screw clamp in the plug to enable the copper wire to enter, then tighten to secure the wire.Staying on the same side of the communication cable, use the wire stripper to strip 0.5 inches of insulation from the red and black wires. Secure the red and black wires to the double banana plug using the same procedure in Step E6.Return to the side of the communication cable where the braided shielding was cut. Now use the wire stripper to strip 0.5 inches of insulation from the red and black wires. Using the D-sub crimping tool, crimp one D-Sub pin to each wire. The input cable is now complete and can be set aside.To build the electrode holder, start by cutting a 1.5 inch piece from the plastic shaft of a cotton swab. Using a 25 G needle, gently poke a hole into the middle of the shaft, taking care not to poke through the opposite end.",
    "Cut 4 inches of coated silver wire, thread it through the hole in the plastic shaft from the outside, and feed 3 inches through. Use epoxy to seal the hole and secure the wire tightly. Take care not to fill the shaft with epoxy as this will prevent you from applying suction to the electrode.After the epoxy is set, cut 1 inch of silicone tubing and connect it to the end of the plastic shaft where the silver wire is protruding. The glass electrode will be placed on this end of the electrode holder.Next, cut 1 foot of silicone tubing and connect it to the other end of the plastic shaft. Connect a blunted 25 G needle to the end of the silicone tubing and seal any gaps with epoxy. Connect a three-way stopcock to the 25 G needle. Connect a 5ml disposable syringe to the end of the stopcock.Cut 4 inches of coated silver wire. Using a lighter, burn off 0.5 inches of the plastic coating on either end. Do the same for the epoxied silver wire in step 10. Coated wires that are bare at the top provide more stable recordings if DC-like events are acquired. For example, artifacts caused by minor changes in bath volume can be minimized.Use the crimping tool to crimp a connector socket to one end of the cut coated silver wire from Step E13 and coated silver wire from Step E10.Chemically chloride the uncrimped ends of the silver wires by dipping the ends into Clorox bleach for 24 h."
