    "L1 stage synchronization by sodium hypochlorite treatmentNote: Synchronization via egg lay is an alternative method that can be used (Gidalevitz et al., 2009).Prepare NGM plates (Recipe 7).Seed NGM plates with 200-300 μl of overnight grown E. coli OP50 under sterile conditions. Allow the plates to dry at room temperature for approximately 48 h. Store at 4 °C until use. Warm plates at room temperature before use.Using a worm picker, pick the desired number of L4 stage CA1202 worms, or any AID-tagged strain of interest, onto NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50. Allow the worms to grow until adulthood. Depending on the rate of usage, grow between 15-25 °C (Stiernagle, 2006).Recover gravid adults in a 15 ml centrifuge tube by washing plates with ddH2O.Add ddH2O to a total volume of 8 ml.Add 600 μl of 5 M KOH.Add 1,200 μl of 6.0% sodium hypochlorite solution.Place worms on a low speed tube rocker for 7-9 min.Pellet released eggs by centrifuging for 1 min at 400 x g at room temperature using a benchtop centrifuge. Quickly but carefully decant the supernatant.Note: Use a balancer containing 9.8 ml of ddH2O, if needed. Add 10 ml of ddH2O to the pellet. Gently mix the tube by inverting 3-4 times.Pellet released eggs by centrifuging for 2 min at 400 x g at room temperature using a benchtop centrifuge. Quickly but carefully decant the supernatant.Note: Use a balancer containing 10 ml of ddH2O, if needed. Add 10 ml of 1x M9 buffer to the pellet. Gently mix the tube by inverting 3-4 times.Repeat Step A11.Add 1x M9 buffer to the pellet to a final volume of 3 ml and incubate eggs at 20 °C on a low speed tube rocker.",
    "After an incubation time of 16 h, add the desired concentration of L1 worms to 2-3 NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50.Allow worms to grow to the desired developmental stage using standard growth conditions (Stiernagle, 2006).Auxin treatment on solid mediaPrepare NGM plates containing 1 mM or 4 mM K-NAA (Recipe 8).Seed NGM plates containing K-NAA with 200-300 μl of overnight grown E. coli OP50 under sterile conditions. Allow the plates to dry at room temperature for approximately 48 h. Store at 4 °C until use. Warm plates at room temperature before use.Once at the desired developmental stage, recover synchronized worms in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes by washing plates with 500 μl of 1x M9 buffer.Gently pellet worms by centrifuging for 2 min at 200 x g at room temperature using a microcentrifuge.Carefully remove as much of the supernatant as possible with a micropipette and discard it.Mix the remaining contents (i.e., worms and residual bacterial food) by gently tapping the bottom of the tube.Evenly dispense the contents onto 2-3 NGM plates containing K-NAA seeded with E. coli OP50 (100-200 worms per plate).Wait as little as 30 min to observe auxin-induced degradation of AID-tagged C. elegans proteins under a spinning disk confocal microscope (Figure 1). At this time, review the preparation of an agarose pad containing NaN3 (Recipe 14 and Procedure D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413133642_7346.jpgFigure 1.

Scale bar, 5 μm.Auxin treatment in liquid mediaPrepare 1 mM or 4 mM K-NAA in 1x M9 buffer (Recipe 10). Store at 4 °C until use. Warm the solution at room temperature before use.Prepare an in-house humidity incubation box (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413134003_1718.jpgFigure 2.

    "Wet paper towels are placed along the four bottom edges of an empty pipette box and dry paper towel is attached to the inner surface of the lid. The wet paper towels should create a pocket for a spot plate to fit in.Once at the desired developmental stage, recover synchronized worms (100-200 worms per well) on a spot plate by washing plates with 500 μl of K-NAA in 1x M9 buffer.Note: Directly washing worms off plates transfers the bacterial food source, preventing short-term starvation (~2 h). Additional bacterial food can be re-suspended as needed. We recommend allowing the worms to thrash freely on a spot plate and not in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube as it decreases degradation efficiency in our hands. Place the spot plate in the in-house humidity incubation box (Figure 2). Close the lid on the box.Wait as little as 30 min to observe auxin-induced degradation of AID-tagged C. elegans proteins under a spinning disk confocal microscope (Figure 1). At this time, review the preparation of an agarose pad containing NaN3 (Recipe 14 and Procedure D).Worm mounting and anesthetizationAfter 30 min, gently break apart the two microscope slides interfacing with the agarose pad containing NaN3. Use the microscope slide with the agarose pad containing anesthetic.Note: We recommend using the agarose pad within 5 min to prevent desiccation. For auxin treatment on solid media, add 1.2 μl of 1x M9 buffer to the center of the pad. Pick 30-50 worms and gently dab them on the M9. Use a dissecting microscope to ensure the worms have fully transferred off the worm picker.For auxin treatment in liquid media, remove 1.2-2 μl with a micropipette from the center of the spot plate well and drop the worms onto the center of the pad.",
    "Gently place a microscope cover slip over the agar pad.Note: To avoid air bubbles underneath the cover slip, place the cover slip at a 45-degree angle and gently drop the cover slip over the agar pad. The cover slip should be applied gently to avoid vulval expulsion. We do not recommend pressing down on the cover slip once it has been released.Worm imagingPlace the microscope slide on the stage and secure it with the stage clips.Move the 10x objective lens into position.Focus on the worm using the coarse focus knob.Finish focusing on the worm using the fine focus knob.Place a small drop of oil on the cover slip.Move the 100x objective lens into position.Slowly focus on the tissue or cell of interest using the fine focus knob.Collect 16-bit z-stack images using an EM-CCD camera attached to a spinning disk confocal microscope.Imaging parameters (e.g., exposure settings and laser power) should be documented and kept consistent."
