    "1. Prepare medium as follows\nCulture Medium: RPMI medium.\nAdd 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).\nAdd 100 U/ml penicillin G, and 100 g/ml streptomycin.\n2. Storage of fresh plaque cylinder until use\nThe carotid endarterectomy operation of patients with or without ischemic symptoms (stroke, transitory ischemic attack) with a significant carotid artery stenosis will be done by vascular surgeons and coronary artery endarterectomy during coronary artery bypass grafting by heart surgeons. Carotid / coronary plaques need to be removed en bloc to preserve the plaque structure as described previously5.\nAfter plaque extirpation place the specimen in a medium filled tube and store it on ice (plaque needs to be completely covered with medium) until use.\n3. Plaque processing\nUse an adequate cell culture dish (e.g. 60 mm) and add 5 ml RPMI medium.\nPlace the plaque tissue into the culture dish (plaque should be completely covered with medium).\nHold the plaque tissue carefully at the edges of the tissue by using sterile forceps.\nCut off the edges of the plaque sample by using a sterile scalpel.\nDivide plaque tissue in half.\nAssess the lesion morphology macroscopically (calcified, lipid rich, ruptured, thrombus, fibrosis).\nAnalyze the exact plaque morphology after the ex vivo experiment by immunohistochemistry. Use the AHA classification 10.\nDiscard plaques with severe calcification or fibrosis.\nCut the plaque tissue into homologous small pieces (3 x 3 x 3 mm).\nShock freeze two plaque pieces and store them in liquid nitrogen for basic values of the lesion until use.\nPrepare a 48-well plate.\nAdd 500 µl RPMI medium to each well used for the experiment.\nPlease use at least two plaque pieces for each group.\nAdd the substance of interest (e.g. specific cytokines and chemokines).\nUse unstimulated plaque pieces as controls.",
    "Randomly plant the appropriated number of plaque pieces into the wells.\nCulture the plaque pieces for indicated time points.\nFor the plaque tissue stimulation experiment with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\n\t\nUse the following time points: 3 hr, 8 hr and 24 hr.\nUse 2 plaque pieces for the LPS and two for the unstimulated group for each time point respectively.\nAdd 1 µg/ml of Lipopolysaccharide.\nDuring the incubation, maintain the 48-well plate at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2.\n4. After indicated time harvest plaque tissue pieces\nShock freeze the plaque pieces for mRNA isolation and cDNA synthesis (for detailed information-see protocol section 5).\nCollect the supernatant and stored it at -20 °C for ELISA analysis.\nFor western blotting, smash and lyse plaque tissue. Filter the lysate through a 0.65 µm and 0.1 µm centrifugal filter device.\nEmbed plaque tissue in tissue-tec or paraffin for immunohistochemistry stainings.\n5. RNA extraction from cultured plaque pieces\nUse a TissueLyser for homogenization.\nIsolate the RNA by using the kit (see materials table) according to manufacturer's instructions.\nDetermine the RNA quantity and quality of the samples with spectrophotometer.\nUse the Boehringer cDNA kit for reverse transcription according to manufacturer's instructions.\nFor quantitative PCR, use for instance the Roche real-time PCR kit with SYBR Green.\nSubscription Required.
