Schematic Diagram of Protocol for Generation of Neutrophils from hiPSCS in Defined Serum Free and Feeder-Free Conditions\nRetrieve a Matrigel solution containing 6-well plate from 4°C storage and incubate at 37°C for minimum 30 min to 1–2 h before thawing the iPSCs.\nNote: Store Matrigel solution containing plates in 4°C refrigerator for overnight. These plates can be stored in refrigerator for 1 month.\nAspirate the Matrigel from each well and put 1 mL of prewarmed TeSRTM-E8 TM complete media in each well.\nAdd 5 mL of TeSRTM -E8TM complete media to a 15 mL conical tube.\nThaw cryovial of hiPSC from liquid nitrogen storage in a 37°C water bath.\nCritical: Proceed to step 5 immediately after complete thaw. Avoid keeping cryovial in water bath for extended period time, which will compromise cell viability.\nAdd 1 mL of TeSRTM -E8TM complete media into the cryovial, gently mix and collect the total 6 ml cell suspension in the 15 mL tube from step 3.\nCritical: Mix cells very gently. Avoid vigorous mixing.\nCentrifuge at 150×g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet with TeSR TM-E8TM complete media with 10 μM Rock inhibitor Y-27632 Dihydrochloride.\nGently rock the plate back-and-forth to coat the cells evenly over the wells, and place in 37°C, 5% CO2, incubator.\nChange the media with fresh TeSR TM-E8TM complete media one day after seeding to remove Rock inhibitor.\nReplenish the media every 48 h with TeSRTM-E8TM complete media.\nPassage of hiPSCs\nTiming: ∼30 min\nhiPSCs are passaged when cells achieve 60%–80% confluency (typically every 5–6 days).",
    "Retrieve a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate from 4°C storage and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO 2, for at least 30 min before passaging iPSCs.\nAspirate the Matrigel and put 1 mL prewarmed TeSRTM-E8TM complete media into each well.\nWhen iPSCs are 60%–80% in confluency (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), aspirate the media and add 1 mL prewarmed dissociation solution (0.5 mM EDTA/1× PBS).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/118-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative Phase Contrast Images Showing Difference in Morphology during the Hematoendothelial Development and Neutrophil Differentiation following Transduction of IISH2i-BM9 hiPSCs with ETV2 mmRNA\nCritical: The cells should be passaged every 5–6 days . Do not allow hiPSC cultures to become more than 80% confluent.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2, for 3 min and slowly aspirate the dissociation solution.\nAdd 2 mL of prewarmed TeSRTM-E8TM complete media into each well of a 6-well plate and break the colonies into small aggregates by gentle pipetting.\nCritical: Do not use excessive mechanic force while pipetting.\nCollect the cells into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 350×g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nNote: Centrifugation speed is higher than that of the speed during thawing of hiPSCs. During thawing procedure cells are in very labile condition in DMSO containing freezing media. So, centrifugation speed is low for not to harm the cells.\nResuspend the cells in 6 mL of TeSR TM-E8TM complete media.\nPlate 1 mL of cell suspension in each well of a 6-well plate containing 1 mL of TeSR TM -E8TM. complete media.\nNote: Split the cells from one well of 6-well plate into 6 wells of a 6-well plate with TeSRTM -E8TM complete media without Rock inhibitor.\nGently rock the plate side-to-side to coat the cells evenly over the wells and place in 37°C, 5% CO2, incubator.",
    "Replenish the media every 48 h with TeSRTM-E8TM complete media.\nNote: The undifferentiated hiPSC colonies must be composed of tightly packed cells with prominent nucleoli. They should have well-defined sharp edges ( Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Then they are ready to use for differentiation. Passage no lower than 30 is recommended to use for differentiation. If cells are not having well-defined sharp edges, then these cells are considered as bad hiPSCs. These cells do not show good mmRNA transfection efficiency.\nCryopreservation of hiPSCs\nTiming: ∼30 min\nCryopreservation of hiPSCs is performed in hiPSC freezing media to maintain the batch of hiPSCs for future differentiation.\nWhen hiPSCs cell density reaches 60%–80%, aspirate the media and add 1 mL prewarmed dissociation solution (0.5 mM EDTA/1× PBS).\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2, for 3 min and slowly aspirate the dissociation solution.\nAdd 2 mL of prewarmed TeSRTM-E8TM complete media into each well of a 6-well plate and break the colonies into small aggregates by gentle pipetting.\nCollect the cells into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 350×g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 6 mL of hiPSC freezing media and distribute 1 ml of cell solution in each cryovials.\nNote: Each cryovial must contain minimum 1×10 6 cells.\nStore cryovials are in isopropanol containing coolant in −80°C for overnight.\nNote: Do not keep cryovials at −80°C not more than a week.\nTransfer the cryovials into liquid nitrogen tank for long term storage.\nTransfection of ETV2 Modified mRNA (mmRNA) into hiPSCs and Induction of Hemogenic Endothelial Lineage\nTiming: ∼2 h\nTo induce hemogenic endothelium, hiPSCs are transfected with ETV2 mmRNA in TeSR TM-E8TM complete media using TransIT reagent and mRNA boost.",
    "On day 0, retrieve collagen IV-coated 6-well plate from 4°C storage and keep at 37°C for at least 30 min before starting the differentiation of iPSCs.\nAspirate the collagen and put 2 mL prewarmed TeSRTM-E8TM complete media supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 Dihydrochloride into each well.\nWhen iPSCs are 60% in confluency after 3 days of culture (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), aspirate the media and add 1 mL prewarmed HyQTase for single cell suspension of the iPSCs (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/118-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Preparation of Cell Culture Hood Set up for Single Cell Suspension and Transfection Procedure\n(A) Suggested cell culture hood set up for the single cell suspension of hiPSCs.\n(B) Recommended cell culture hood set up for the transfection of the ETV2 mmRNA transfection.\n(C) Addition of the ETV2 mmRNA master mix in to the respective wells of hiPSCs.\nNote: Single cell suspension requires HyQTase instead of EDTA/PBS solution. EDTA/PBS does not make cells into single cell suspension. It only maintains the cells as clumps which is required for passaging of hiPSCs. But for differentiation, it needs single cell suspension.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2, incubator for 3 min.\nCritical: Incubation should not exceed more than 3 min and should be optimized for each type of cell line. After 3 min of incubation you can observe single cells in the plate under the microscope. HyClone™ HyQTase™ solution has since been discontinued by GE Healthcare Life Sciences, therefore, we recommend to use Accutase® (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc., Cat. #AT-104) instead.\nAdd 1 mL of prewarmed TeSRTM-E8TM complete media into each well.\nCollect the cells into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 350×g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nCritical: Do not aspirate the HyClone™ HyQTase™ solution from the plate.",
    "Optional: HyClone™ HyQTase™ has since been discontinued by GE Healthcare Life Sciences. We therefore recommend to use Accutase® (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc., Cat. #AT-104) instead.\nTo remove residual HyQTase™, resuspend the cells in 2 mL of TeSRTM-E8TM complete media.\nCentrifuge at 350×g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of TeSR TM-E8TM complete media.\nDetermine cell viability by trypan blue staining and a hemocytometer.\nPlate 2×105 cells into each well of a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of TeSRTM-E8TM complete media with 10 μM Rock inhibitor and gently rock the plate side-to-side and back-and-forth to spread the cells evenly across the well.\nCritical: Cell number should be highly accurate as transfection efficiency is highly dependent on cell density and viability.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C, 5% CO 2, for 30 min to adhere the cells.\nPlace the TransIT reagent and mRNA boost (TransIT®-mRNA Kit, Mirus) and ETV2 mmRNA aliquot on ice (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nPrepare ETV2 mmRNA transfection master mix in a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nMix the components by gentle pipetting and add the ∼100 μL transfection mixture to each well of the 6-well plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: Add the transfection master mix drop by drop into each well evenly. Rock the plate after addition to properly distribute.\nPlace in 37°C, 5% CO2, incubator for 24 h.\nCritical: We recommend not to use an iPSC cell line beyond passage 30, after which, hematopoietic differentiation capacity reduces.\nExpansion of Hemogenic Endothelial Cells\nTiming: ∼2 days\nAfter ETV2 mmRNA transfection, cells are cultured in hemogenic endothelium medium (StemLine II with FGF2) to support formation and expansion of hemogenic endothelial cells.",
    "On day 1, after 24 h of transfection, observe cell morphology under phase contrast microscopy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and then aspirate the media and add 2 mL of prewarmed hemogenic endothelium media.\nNote: Transfected cells shows a star shaped morphology- thin protrusions on the periphery. Cells other than this morphology are not transfected cells.\nPlace in 37°C, 5% CO2, for 24 h.\nOn day 2, aspirate media and add 2 mL of prewarmed hemogenic endothelium medium again.\nOptional: We recommend to use enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) mmRNA as a positive control to assess the transfection efficiency.\nOptional: We also advise to check the endothelial marker CD144 expression on day 1. ETV2 mmRNA transfected cells show more than 90% CD144 expression.\nGeneration of Myeloid Progenitors\nTiming: ∼7 days\nCulture of ETV2-induced hemogenic endothelium in hematopoietic differentiation medium (StemLineII with FGF2, GM-CSF, and UM171) promotes endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition and formation of CD34 +CD33+ myeloid progenitor cells enriched in granulocytic progenitors.\nOn day 3, prepare hematopoietic differentiation media and observe cell morphology under phase contrast microscopy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nAspirate the supernatant and add 2 mL of prewarmed hematopoietic differentiation media. Place at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nAdd 1 mL hematopoietic differentiation media on the top of the existing media without removing the media every 48 h up to day 8.\nOn day 9, observe the morphology of the cells under phase contrast microscopy ( Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCollect floating myeloid progenitors on day 9 into a 15 ml conical tube and transfer to neutrophil differentiation conditions.\nNote: After the first collection of floating cells on day 9, adherent cells continue to produce myeloid progenitors. Adding of 2 mL hematopoietic differentiation media every 2 days to the remaining adherent cells allows for additional two rounds of myeloid progenitor collection between days 16 and 23.",
    "Note: Adherent cells are hemogenic endothelial cells, which give rise to floating myeloid progenitors. UM171 is one of the important small molecules in hematopoietic differentiation media. It does not increase the number myeloid cells. However, it does significantly improve neutrophil output.\nNeutrophil Differentiation\nTiming: ∼8 days\nMyeloid progenitors are differentiated into fully functional neutrophils in a neutrophil differentiation medium (StemSpan H3000 with G-CSF and retinoic acid receptor α agonist Am580).\nCentrifuge collected floating myeloid progenitor cells at 350×g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 2 mL of neutrophil differentiation media to remove any residual hematopoietic differentiation media.\nCentrifuge at 350×g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of neutrophil differentiation media.\nDetermine the cell viability by using trypan blue and a hemocytometer.\nTo induce neutrophil differentiation, plate 5×105 cells in one well of a 6-well plate containing 4 mL neutrophil differentiation media and gently rock the plate side-to-side, back-and-forth to spread the cells evenly across the wells.\nAfter 4 days, add fresh 2 mL of fresh neutrophil differentiation media on the top of the existing culture.\nAfter 8 days of differentiation in neutrophil differentiation media observe the morphology of the cells under phase contrast microscopy on day 17 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nHarvest the neutrophils from the supernatant, leaving adherent progenitors and macrophages.\nNote: Neutrophils have to be generated and used for functional analysis fresh. Although neutrophils do not survive freezing in standard freezing media, myeloid progenitors generated in step 51 can be cryopreserved in standard conditions and used for neutrophil generation after thawing.\nColony-Forming Cell Assay of (CFC) Myeloid Progenitors\nTiming: ∼13 days\nColony-Forming Cell (CFC) assay is used to determine formation of myeloid progenitors in cultures on day 9 of differentiation.",
    "Thaw 3 ml aliquots of CFC assay media (MethoCult™ H4435 Enriched).\nSuspend 3×103 floating myeloid progenitor cells to a 3 ml aliquot of MethocultTM H4435.\nVortex vigorously. Let the tube stand still for 15 min at 37°C water bath.\nAttach a 16-gauge blunt-end needle to a 3 ml syringe and draw up 2.2 ml. Do not draw up large bubbles; expel them at the beginning by pushing out a couple of times. Push out 1.1 ml each into two 30 mm non-treated dish and spread out the mixture evenly by rotating.\nPlace duplicate plates in a 100 mm plate together with a water dish containing 3 ml sterile water. Culture for 13 days.\nCharacterize and score the colonies according to their morphology with a bright field microscope in a culture dish marked with a scoring grid.\nFlow Cytometric Analysis of Myeloid Progenitors and Neutrophils\nTiming: ∼60 min\nFlow cytometric analysis is used to identify the population of interest among a mixture of different populations.\nCell suspension to a concentration of 1×106 cells/mL in flow cytometry buffer. Cells are usually stained in polystyrene round bottom falcon tubes.\nAdd 0.1–10 μg/mL conjugated primary antibody.\nNote: Dilutions should be made in flow cytometry buffer (Ghost dyeTM Violet 540 can also be added at this point for dead cell exclusion).\nIncubate for at least 30 min in dark at 4°C.\nWash the cells by centrifugation at 350×g for 5 min and resuspend them in 500 μL of flow cytometry buffer.\nAnalyze the cells on the flow cytometer."
