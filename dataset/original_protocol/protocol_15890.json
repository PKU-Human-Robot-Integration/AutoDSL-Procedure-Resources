    "Over the past few years, manufacturers have modified and optimized hybridization probes and probe kits (including a variety of preparation buffers and solutions) in order to shorten the turnaround preparation time for HER2 diagnostics from 1.5 days to ∼0.5 days. Two prominent, systematically validated, and commercially distributed product lines are the HER2 IQFISH pharmDx (Dako Agilent Technologies) and the FlexISH (ZytoVision) probe kits. Both kits enable the user to run the respective hybridization assay significantly faster than the traditional FISH assays. Qualitative and quantitative FISH results derived from “fast” and “traditional” preparations have been shown to excellently concord, which holds true for both the IQFISH (Franchet et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.942#cpz1942-bib-0013]; Viale et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.942#cpz1942-bib-0062]) and the FlexISH (Brockhoff et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.942#cpz1942-bib-0008]) systems. An additional benefit of the IQFISH hybridization system is that it avoids the use of toxic formamide, which is commonly used for blocking against repetitive DNA sequences and to prevent nonspecific hybridization. By comparison, a significant advantage of the FlexISH product is the possibility of varying or adapting the preparation procedure and turnaround time based on the lab requirements. In other words, the FlexISH protocol allows application of both conventional and expedited preparation procedures, which might contribute to optimizing the flow of the daily workload in a diagnostic lab.\nMaterials\n100% ethanol (or reagent alcohol)\nDeionized or distilled water\nPretreatment solution (PS), containing 0.01 M sodium citrate, pH 6.0 (e.g., ZytoVision, cat. no.

For instance, if the analysis addresses the HER2 gene copy number of cells within a not-yet-evaluated tissue, processing a tissue with a known (e.g., increased) HER2 gene copy number in parallel might be helpful to validate the preparation. Alternatively, FFPE cell lines with a well-defined cytogenetic score can be used as control specimens. Normal, i.e., non-malignant, tissues (or cells) are appropriate in most cases because they enable generation of hybridization specimens without any gene copy number alterations or chromosomal rearrangements. Control samples can be used for comparative purposes and help to identify genomic alterations in tissues/cells of interest.\nFirst day\nSolution preparation\n1. Using glass cuvettes, prepare two ethanol series (70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol solutions) using 100% ethanol diluted with deionized or distilled water (volume of ≥50 ml).\n2.

    "Instead of using FFPE tissues (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.942#cpz1942-prot-0001]), (m)FISH can, for diagnostic or research purposes, also be applied to cytological slide specimens derived from cell suspensions or bodily fluids (e.g., ascites, urine samples). For this purpose, a sufficient number of cells needs to be spun and immobilized on coated and positively charged slides. After fixation, cytospin slides can be stored at –20°C until further processing.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.942#cpz1942-prot-0001])\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\nPreviously washed (with PBS) cell suspension\n1× SSC buffer\n1% and 4% (v/v) formalin solutions\nEthanol series (prepared according to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.942#cpz1942-prot-0001], step 1)\n           \nCytospin funnels (Thermo Scientific)\nPositively charged microscope slides (e.g., Menzel Superfrost, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.
