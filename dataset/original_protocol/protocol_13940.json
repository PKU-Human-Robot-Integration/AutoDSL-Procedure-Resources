    "All steps were completed in accordance and compliance with all relevant regulatory and institutional animal care guidelines.\n1. Plating of Organoids\nIsolate organoids as described previously3. The procedure is briefly described below.\nCollect the small intestines from mice.\nOpen the small intestines longitudinally and remove villi tips by scraping the inner intestinal tissue with a coverslip.\nCut the intestinal tissue in small pieces using scissors.\nWash pieces 5x in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by pipetting the pieces 10x up and down with a 25 mL pipette.\nIncubate the tissue pieces in cold 2 mM EDTA solution on ice for 30 min on a horizontal shaking platform. Allow the tissue pieces to sediment.\nReplace the EDTA solution with PBS buffer once the tissue pieces settle at the bottom. Discard the supernatant and add 20 mL of PBS.\nRelease the intestinal crypts from the tissue by vigorously pipetting 10x up and down with a 10 mL pipette.\nCollect the supernatant in centrifugation tubes and inspect it by phase contrast microscopy. To do this, add a drop of the supernatant to a 96 well cell culture plate. Keep centrifugation tubes on ice.\nRepeat steps 1.1.6–1.1.8 until the number of intestinal crypts in the collected supernatant decreases.\nPass the fractions containing the most crypts through a 70 µm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the crypt suspension at 300 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in cold PBS in order to wash the crypts. Then repeat the centrifugation step as described in 1.1.11.\nResuspend the pellet in a total of 25 µL per well of a 1:1 mixture of cell matrix solution and murine organoid culture medium and plate the organoids in a 48 well cell culture plates.",
    "Incubate the organoids at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for 20 min to allow the cell matrix solution to solidify.\nCover the organoids with 300 µL of murine organoid medium per well.\nCulture the organoids at 37 °C, 5% CO2, changing the medium every 2–3 days.\nUse the organoids for experiments after 7 days of culture.\nPrepare the organoids for the barrier integrity measurement.\nPrecoat all the centrifugation tubes that will be used for storing the organoids during the plating process with bovine serum albumin (BSA) by adding enough of a 0.1% BSA solution in PBS to cover all plastic surfaces. Then remove the BSA solution again and store the centrifugation tubes on ice.\nThaw the cell matrix solution and organoid culture medium on ice.\nTo separate the organoids, carefully remove the culture medium and resuspend the organoids from one well of a 48 well plate in 1 mL of cold PBS. Dissolve the cell matrix by vigorous pipetting. Always keep the organoid suspension in centrifugation tubes precoated with BSA and always keep on ice.\nNOTE: The density, size, and position of the organoids within the chambered coverslip slide are influenced by the split ratio, cell matrix solution concentration, and handling of the organoid-cell matrix suspension. It is recommended to practice the handling of the cell matrix solution in advance. Usually eight well chambered glass coverslips are suitable for the assay. Organoids derived from one well of a confluent 48 well plate can be split into two wells of an eight well chambered coverslip (40 μL of the organoid-cell matrix pellet per well).\nCentrifuge the organoid suspension at 300 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.\nCarefully discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of cold PBS.",
    "Centrifuge the organoid suspension at 300 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant completely and resuspend the organoids derived from one well from a 48 well plate in 40 µL of cold medium. Fragment large organoid structures by pipetting the organoid suspension 5x through a 10 µL pipette tip to collect structures with a size of 40–60 µm for seeding.\nNOTE: Use the 10 µL tip on a 100 µL pipette tip for the fragmentation of the organoid structures, and practice step 1.7 in advance to ensure consistent results. Control the size of the organoids by phase contrast microscopy within the centrifugation tube. Ensure that there are no more multibranched organoids present and that the organoid fragments are roughly 40–60 µm long.\nOnce the organoids have obtained the desired size, mix them with 40 µL of the cell matrix solution (medium:cell matrix solution = 1:1).\nNOTE: The medium to cell matrix solution ratio must be kept constant to achieve consistent results. The dilution of the cell matrix solution reduces the stiffness of the organoid blob and impacts its diffusion properties. Use precooled pipet tips (-20 °C) for all suspensions containing cell matrix solution.\nPlace 40 µL of the organoid-cell matrix solution suspension in the center of each well of an 8 well chambered coverslip.\nKeep the slide on an ice pack for 5 min. This preserves the cell matrix organoid suspension liquid and increases the organoid concentration at the coverslip surface by gravity.\nIncubate for 20 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to enable polymerization of the organoid-cell matrix blob.\nAdd 150 µL of organoid culture medium per well and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 prior to proceeding with the experimental treatment.",
    "Use this period to treat the organoids and modulate their barrier integrity according to the corresponding scientific hypothesis. For the positive control, treat the organoids for 48 h with IFN-γ in order to investigate IFN-γ associated tight junction degradation and permeability increase. Stimulate the positive control with 10 U/mL (10 ng/mL) recombinant murine IFN-γ. Leave the organoids of one well untreated.\nCulture organoids at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for up to 48 h.\n2. OrganoidPermeability Assay\nBring the incubation chamber of the microscope to 37 °C at least 2 h before starting the experiment to reduce thermal drift while imaging the organoids.\nPrepare a 100 mM solution of LY in PBS. Store on ice protected from light.\nPrepare a 200 mM solution of EGTA in PBS. Store it on ice.\nTransfer the chambered coverslip including the organoids into the incubation chamber of an inverted confocal microscope and turn on the CO2 incubation (5%). Make sure the chambered coverslip is tightly locked within the stage of the microscope.\nUsing the organoids in one well as a reference, adjust the imaging settings of the microscope. Add LY (3 µL of 100 mM LY in 150 µL of medium) to obtain a final volume of 1 mM LY in 300 µL of medium. Incubate on the microscope for 1 h and adjust the focus for the imaging of the organoids’ lumen. Define the required laser energy for LY excitation (488 nm) and respective detection sensitivity of the instrument and try to image the LY fluorescence at 30–40% of the available dynamic range of the instrument being used.",
    "NOTE: Adjust the laser excitation energy and detection efficiency on untreated organoids 70 min after the addition of LY. Ensure that the excitation energy is high enough to get a well exposed image. To avoid saturation of LY fluorescence within the microscopic images, it is recommended to adjust these settings after the LY diffusion reaches a steady state.\nDefine the position of the organoids by differential interference contrast (DIC) live imaging. Try to image organoids with comparable diameters (80 ± 30 μm) and focus on the central slice of the organoids to image their lumen. Define roughly 10 organoids per well and try to image only organoids close to the coverslip surface with a spherical structure.\nNOTE: The number of organoids that can be imaged per run depends on the speed of the microscope. It is recommended to image the organoids within a 5 min interval. On a regular laser scanning microscope, 40 positions in total are a reasonable starting point.\nRecord the DIC and the LY fluorescence of every position to document the organoid's shape and autofluorescence before adding the LY to the wells, used for the barrier integrity assay.\nDo not image organoids that display high autofluorescence. This is due to the accumulation of dead cells within the organoid's lumen, and the results of autofluorescent organoids are hard to analyze afterwards.\nDilute 3 µL of the prepared LY solution (100 mM LY in 150 µL of medium) and add this carefully to each well without touching the chambered coverslip. The recommended concentration of LY per well is 1 mM. The final volume per well should be 300 µL.\nQuickly check the focus of the defined positions and correct if needed.",
    "NOTE: LY diffuses quickly through the cell matrix. Therefore, the confocal imaging must be started within 3 min after the addition of the fluorophore.\nStart a time-lapse imaging on the microscope. Take a fluorescence image of every position every 5 min for a total of 70 min.\nNOTE: The organoids were imaged in 5 min intervals to visualize the LY uptake over time. To measure the intestinal barrier breakdown, it is sufficient to record the fluorescence before and 60 min after LY addition and once again 10 min after the addition of EGTA.\nAdd 3 µL of the prepared EGTA solution per well without touching the chambered coverslip. The recommended concentration within the chambered coverslip of EGTA is 2 mM. The total volume per well should be 300 µL.\nStart a second time-lapse. Record the fluorescence of the defined organoids again with an interval of 5 min for a total of 30 min.\nDiscard everything according to local safety regulations.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n3. Data Analysis\nOnly analyze the results of the organoids that took up LY after EGTA addition.\nResults can be quantified with Fiji ImageJ.\nOpen dataset in ImageJ by clicking File |Open and select image data. In the following BIO-Formats Import options dialog select View stack with: Hyperstack.\nOpen the region of interest (ROI) manager by clicking Analyze | Tools | ROI Manager.\nDraw an oval ROI by clicking on the Oval selection button in the ImageJ menu bar. Draw a selection containing the inner lumen of the organoid. Then press Add in the ROI Manager.\nRepeat the steps for three representative areas outside of the organoid.\nClick on Analyze in the menu bar and select Set Measurements. Enable only Mean Gray Value and disable any other measurement. Then click OK.",
    "Make sure that all ROIs are selected in the ROI Manager. In the ROI Manager, click More | Multi measure. In the option dialog select Measure all […] slices and One row per slice. Then click OK.\nSelect all the values in the Results window and copy them into a spreadsheet application for further analysis.\nNOTE: If the position of the organoid moved during the time-lapse imaging, the ROI must be adjusted accordingly. To do so, select the correct ROI in the ROI manager and move it to the new position. Then click Update in the ROI manager. Perform the measurement for each timepoint individually by clicking Measure in the ROI manager, then switch to the next timepoint in the image window using the bar on the bottom. Collect all measurements in a spreadsheet. The individual shape and the movement of organoids during the imaging period requires the analysis of the data in a manual manner.\nCalculate the mean intensity value of the three ROIs outside of the organoid for each timepoint.\nDivide the intensity of the ROI inside the organoid’s lumen by the mean intensity of the ROI outside and the mean intensity inside the organoid.\nIn order to calculate the relative increase of luminal organoid fluorescence, divide the relative fluorescence (see step 3.11) at each timepoint imaged by the minimal relative fluorescence.\nNOTE: Use the minimal relative fluorescence, because sometimes the diffusion of the fluorophore can be slow at the beginning of the experiment."
