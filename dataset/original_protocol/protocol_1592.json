    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample preparation\nTiming: 3 days, Day 1–3 for step 1\nThis section describes the protocol from the dissection of the mouse eye sample to tissue processing. The ‘Window Technique’ (making notches into the eye to allow optimal penetration of fluids and to balance the pressure) is essential for morphology preservation.\nDissect eyeballs from the euthanized mice, as previously described by Sondereker, K.B. et al. (Sondereker et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9])\nTry to avoid scratching and hard extrusion on the eyeball tissue.\nNote: Tissue marking dyes can be used to mark the eye sample for orientation purposes.\nImmerse the eye sample in a 20 mL disposable scintillation vial of Hartman’s fixative (commercially available).\nNote: A minimum of 20:1 ratio of fixative volume to sample volume is recommended. In our observation, the size of an aqueous droplet of 0.5ml fixative was bigger than the size of an eyeball. Therefore, we dropped 2 eyeballs into 20ml fixative solution for tissue fixation.\nPlace the vial with sample in fixative on a shaker with gentle agitation. Fix the eyeball at ambient temperature (20°C–25°C) for 20 h.\nRemove the Hartman’s fixative and fill the 20 mL sample vial with 4% PFA.\nFix the eyeball sample in 4% PFA for another 20 h at ambient temperature.\nRemove the 4% PFA and rinse the eye sample with RNAse-free 1× PBS for 4 × 15min.",
    "Make windows on the eyeball wall as illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A. Individual eyeball is submerged in RNAse-free PBS and gently secured with non-serrated forceps. Use a 26-gauge syringe needle to penetrate and create a slight incision at one side (for this paper, yellow Thermo Scientific™ Shandon Tissue Marking Dye marked side) of the anterior chamber. Carefully insert a Vannas scissors into the incision to snip the tissue from (away from the central cornea) the incision, which expands the incision into a small window. Remove any air bubbles inside the sample by gently rolling the eye back and forth while submerged in the RNAse- free PBS.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1157-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Window technique\n(A) An illustration demonstrating how windows are created on the eye wall (A). This operation applies to all three windows although the sample illustration is made on the anterior wall.\n(B) is eye sample before applying the window technique. White arrow points to the region for the 2 windows.\n(C) is the eye sample after making windows on an eyeball. Dashed white polygons highlight the 2 windows. The third window is not shown. Scale bar: 1000 μm.\nCritical: We recommend that the windows are created at the spots that will be trimmed away at the sectioning step. Do not allow the needle to penetrate too deeply into the eye because that may damage other parts of the eyeball tissue. Keep the eyeball in RNAse-free PBS during this step.\nContinue to make a window on the posterior part of the eyeball wall which is in line with the window developed at step 7. Create another window at the opposite side of the posterior eyeball wall and remove any air bubbles from the inside of eyeballs as needed.",
    "Critical: Steps 7 and 8 are defined as ‘window technique’ in this protocol. Window technique is essential for eye samples from mice older than 3 days to maintain the overall morphology, the size of the anterior chamber, and the vitreous during further processing.\nCritical: Windows at the anterior and posterior chamber are expected to facilitate reagent exchange and balance the pressure inside and outside the eye chambers during the paraffin processing steps.\nRinse the eye sample with 1× PBS for 2 × 10 min.\nDehydrate the eye sample with 20 mL 30% ethanol for 1 h.\nReplace the 30% ethanol with 50% ethanol and dehydrate samples for 1 h.\nReplace the 50% ethanol with 70% ethanol and further dehydrate samples for 1 h.\nPause point: Up to this point, eyeball samples can be stored in 70% ethanol in 4°C for up to 2 weeks.\nMicrowave-based paraffin processing\nTiming: 1 day, Day 4 for step 13\nThis section describes the protocol of paraffin infiltration and embedding. With the aid of a microwave-based automatic tissue processor, samples are dehydrated, cleared, and then infiltrated with paraffin.\nCarefully wrap eyeball sample in a piece of lens cleaning tissue.\nPut each sample into an individually pre-labeled tissue cassette.\nNote: Immerse all cassettes with samples in 70% ethanol until loading onto the tissue processor.\nLoad cassettes onto the tissue processor and select the appropriate program.",
    "Critical: The different development stages of mouse eyeball may require different tissue processing procedures. Program 1 is for eye samples from embryo or mouse at or younger than 3 days old. Program 2 is for eye samples from mouse older than 3 days. To reduce the shrinking artifact that results in larger eyes, heat and pressure have been eliminated or reduced in program 2 and thus longer incubation times are needed to counteract this change. Processing times are approximate since some added time is needed to heat the fluids. In the table, mBar = millibar.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1157_15.csv\nWhen processing is complete, embed each eye into a separate mold.\nNote: To get sections of transverse plane, orient the eyeball to ensure that the central part of the cornea and the optic nerve are on the same focal plane before embedding.\nPause point: The paraffin blocks can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 year.\nSections cutting\nTiming: 1 day, Day 5\nThis section describes the protocol from a paraffin block with an eye sample in it until it is trimmed and cut into transverse cross sections, which can be stored or processed with histological staining.\nSet thickness setting for the microtome and water bath temperature setting as desired.\nNote: For this paper, section thickness is set at 5 μm and temperature of water bath is set at 42°C.\nAttach paraffin block containing eye sample to microtome.\nSlowly trim into the block until the sample is located.\nSwitch from a trimming mode to a sectioning mode and begin to create paraffin ribbons to float on the water bath. A single paraffin section is created by one full turn of the microtome wheel and continual revolutions of the wheel create a paraffin ribbon.",
    "Note: Wheel speed should not be very fast when sectioning eyes. A slow and steady revolution will lessen the chances of a shattered lens appearance. A shattered lens appearance can also be caused by dryness of the lens. Soaking the lens in an icy slurry (created by allowing a tray of ice to partially melt) before making sections or adding moisture to the paraffin block by dabbing with a moist tissue soaked with ice-cold water between each section helps to eliminate this shattered artifact.\nLift the paraffin ribbon from the microtome plate using forceps or a small brush. Carefully lay the ribbon onto the water bath and allow to rest for 15–30 s.\nGuide the floating paraffin ribbons onto a test slide.\nCheck the sections microscopically for quality and proper location within the eyeball.\nOptional: To get transverse sections near the central plane, trim further into the block to the point where both the iris and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) begin to break open.\nNote: This can be checked under a stereoscope using the brightfield setting, as the dark line of the pigmented iris and RPE will show up against the white background. If the eye is oriented correctly, a break in the anterior dark line (the iris) will appear first, which locates the pupil. Further sections will reveal a break in the posterior dark line, the RPE, opposite the pupil. This opening will be the optic nerve head. Once both openings are observed, begin saving these ribbons or sections onto slides for further testing. Both the anterior opening (the pupil) and the posterior opening (the optic nerve head) should be visible in the same section for the central plane of the eye.",
    "Once the slide is complete, stand it upright to drain while continuing to make the next slide.\nAllow the collection of slides to dry overnight while still in a vertical position.\nNote: Slides should have no visible water on them before they are ready for further staining.\nPause point: Slides can be stored at this point for up to 1 year at ambient temperature (20°C–25°C) or used for a staining procedure (Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E), In situ hybridization (ISH), Immunofluorescence (IF) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC).\nDeparaffinization\nTiming: 2 h, Day 6\nThis section describes the protocol from a paraffin preserved eye sample section until the paraffin is removed and the tissue is exposed to solutions and ready for the staining procedure (H&E, ISH, IF, and/or IHC).\nHeat the slides in a 60°C oven for 1 h to melt away the paraffin.\nImmerse the slides in xylene at ambient temperature 3 times, 5 min each time.\nImmerse the slides in 100% ethanol at ambient temperature 3 times, 3 min each time.\nAir dry the slides at ambient temperature for 15 min. The sections are then ready for H&E staining (steps 30–43) for morphology check. The sections are also ready for tissue pre-treatment (steps 44–54) with single molecule mRNA Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (smFISH) staining (steps 55–79) and/or Immuno-Fluorescence (IF) staining (steps 80–93) as follows.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining\nTiming: 20 min, Day 6\nThis section describes the protocol from a de-paraffinized and untreated eye section until the eye section is stained by Hematoxylin (H) for nuclei and Eosin (E) for cytoplasm. The H&E-stained sections are typical for morphology observation of the tissue at a histological level.",
    "Following step 29, load the slides on the Leica Autostainer XL and run the pre-set eye staining program which utilizes reagents and dyes from the St Infinity H&E kit, supplied by Leica Biosystems. The following steps, steps 31–42, are done automatically and times are as follows:\nRinse the sections in tap water for 1 min.\nIncubate the sections in Hemalast for 30 s.\nIncubate the sections in Hematoxylin for 45 s.\nRinse the sections in tap water for 2 min.\nIncubate the sections in Differentiator for 45 s.\nRinse the sections in tap water for 1 min.\nIncubate the sections in Bluing for 1 min.\nRinse the sections in tap water for 1 min.\nRinse the sections in 80% ethanol for 1 min.\nIncubate the sections in Eosin for 2 min.\nNote: Eosin solution can be diluted by 100% ethanol if the sections are overstained. In this protocol, we purposefully did a lighter eosin stain (1% vol/vol) to give an enhanced contrast for the nuclei hematoxylin stain.\nRinse the sections in 100% ethanol 2 times, 1 min each time.\nRinse the sections in xylene 4 times, 1 min each time.\nMount the slides with Surgipath Micromount Mounting Media.\nPause point: Slides can be stored at this point for up to 1 year, microscopically observed, or digitally imaged. For this paper, H&E-stained slides are imaged by Olympus Slide Scanner Automated Widefield Microscope.\nTissue pre-treatment\nTiming: 3 h, Day 6\nThis section describes the protocol from a de-paraffinized and untreated eye section until the eye section is pre-treated and ready for further molecular assays such as single molecule mRNA FISH and immunofluorescence multiplexing, which provide spatial information on both the transcription level of mRNA targets and expression level of protein targets.",
    "Heat the citrate buffer for 10 min using a BioGenex EZ-Retriever microwave (set a temperature at 95°C).\nCritical: This step can remove most of the dissolved air in the solution and thus decrease the number of air bubbles generated at the tissue, which can cause tissue lifting during step 45.\nImmerse the deparaffinized slides (following step 29) into the heated citrate buffer for 10 min. Make sure the temperature is maintained between 95°C to 100°C.\nNote: If you don’t need immunofluorescence, but need only mRNA FISH, lower temperature (70°C for 30min) works better to avoid lifting of sections. For immunofluorescence, 95°C is required depending on targeted proteins.\nRemove the slides from the hot citrate buffer and immediately rinse them in RNAse free ddH2O at ambient for 1 min.\nImmerse the slides in 100% ethanol for 2 × 2 min each time. Then air dry the slides for 15 min.\nDraw a hydrophobic barrier using an ImmEdge Pen on the glass slide to surround tissue sections and air dry.\nNote: It might take 30–60 min for the hydrophobic barrier to dry out.\nBleach the pigment of eyeball tissue by applying bleaching solution to sections and illuminate by direct cool light for 20 min (see our previously published method (Jordan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])).\nNote: If the pigment bleaching is not required, apply 3% H2O2 for 15 min to inactivate the endogenous peroxidase enzyme activity (the direct light illumination is unnecessary).\nRinse the sections in RNAse free ddH2O for 2 × 1 min each time.\nPrepare protease QF working solution by diluting protease QF in RNAse free PBS at 1:500 as indicated in materials and equipment. Apply 200 μL protease QF working solution to the sections and incubate for 2 min at room temperature.",
    "Note: This step requires optimization to fit the fixation and tissue type used in the experiment. If tissue is lifting or missing during optimization, the concentration of protease QF or the treatment time can be decreased. If the detected number of mRNA particles is lower than expected or the signal to noise ratio is too low, then the concentration of protease QF or the treatment time needs to be increased. Such a pre-treatment step is unnecessary for immunofluorescence assay. If FISH experiment is not required, this step for the immunostaining experiment can be skipped. Also, this step becomes optional if bleaching solution is applied on the sections at step 49, and the protein targets can be better preserved without protease treatment. Solution volume needs to be adjusted depending on the size of hydrophobic barrier. 200 μL of Protease QF working solution is recommended for 2 cm × 1.5 cm area.\nWash the slides with RNAse free ddH2O for 3 × 3 min each time.\nApply PBSTx to the section and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nWash the slides with 1X PBS for 2 × 10 min each time. Sections are then ready for single molecule mRNA FISH and/or Immunofluorescence assay.\nSingle molecule mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\nTiming: 21 h, Day 6–7\nThis section describes the protocol from a pre-treated eye section until the eye section is processed with the ViewRNA kit. A HybEZ™ II oven, HybEZ Humidity control Tray and ACD HybEZ slide Rack are used for FISH assay. The following steps (steps 55–79) are developed based on the manuals and protocols of ViewRNA™ Cell Plus Assay Kit:\nhttps://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/88-19000-99#/88-19000-99[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/88-19000-99]",
    "Note: Any incubator or oven is acceptable provided the temperature can be kept at 40°C. Also, any slide rack, chamber or container is acceptable for incubation of slides if is maintained inside the container to avoid drying out of slides.\nSwitch on HybEZ™ II oven and prewarm probe set diluent at 40°C for 10 min.\nApply 200 μL of 1X PBS to the slide to cover the section. Put the slides in humidity control tray with humidified tissue paper and incubate for 20 min at 40°C.\nNote: Volume of 1X PBS needs to be adjusted to cover the sections depending on the size of hydrophobic barrier.\nPrepare probe mix working solution by diluting the ViewRNA Probe in pre-warmed probe set diluent at 1:100 as indicated in materials and equipment.\nNote: Volume of probe mix working solution need to be adjusted depending on the size of hydrophobic barrier. 100 μL of probe mix working solution is recommended for 2cm × 1.5 cm area.\nRemove PBS and apply 100 μL of probe mix working solution to the sections. Incubate in humidity control tray overnight (approximately 16 h) at 40°C.\nNote: Volume of probe mix working solution needs to be adjusted depending on the size of hydrophobic barrier. 100 μL of probe mix working solution is recommended for 2cm × 1.5 cm area. Overnight incubation is not essential, but over 5 h incubation time is recommended for the best result.\nPrewarm Amplifier diluent at 40°C for 10 min.\nPrepare 10 mL of ViewRNA wash buffer and 100 μL of PreAmplifier working solution as indicated in materials and equipment.",
