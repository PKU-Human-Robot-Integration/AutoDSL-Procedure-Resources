    "1. Design and Fabrication of the MDF Chip\nDraw an individual acrylic layer pattern using commercial software, such as AutoCAD, and save the pattern.\n\t\nReview the design of the four-layer acrylic sheet pattern in Figure 1A and confirm the inter-layer connections.\nFabricate all the acrylic sheets and the double-sided tape by laser ablation using a CO2 laser scriber (Figures 1B, 2A, and 2B).16\nTurn on the laser scriber and connect the machine to the controlling laptop.\nRun the commercial software and open the pattern designed in step 1.1 by clicking \"designed pattern file.\"\nPlace a piece of blank acrylic sheet or double-sided tape on the X-Y-Z stage of the laser scriber.\nSet the focus of the laser beam on the surface of the acrylic sheet or double-sided tape with an auto-alignment stick provided by the manufacturer of the laser scriber.\nSend the designed pattern to the laser scriber for direct machining of the acrylic sheet or double-sided tape.\nRemove the protective paper from the acrylic sheets using forceps and blow the surface clean with nitrogen gas.\nStack the acrylic sheets and bond them together under a pressure of 2 kg/cm2 in a thermal bonder for 45 min at 110 °C to form the flow/electrical stimulation channel assembly.\nPrepare the microscope cover glass as the cell culture substrate in the chip.\n\t\nPut the cover glass into a staining jar and fill the jar with a ten-fold dilution of the detergent listed in the material list.\nPut the cover glass and staining jar in an ultrasonic steri-cleaner and clean the cover glass for 15 min.\nPour the diluted detergent out of the staining jar, refill the jar with distilled water, and repeat step 1.5.2 3 times.",
    "Dry the cleaned cover glass by blowing it with nitrogen gas before adhering it to the double-sided tape.\nAdhere the cleaned cover glass to the flow/electrical stimulation channel assembly with the double-sided tape patterned in step 1.2.\nAdhere 13 pieces of acrylic adaptors to the individual openings in Layer 1 of the MDF chip assembly with super glue. The MDF chip assembly is then complete (Figure 2D).\nSterilize the complete MDF chip assembly with 30 min of UV irradiation prior to use.\n2. Setup of the Salt Bridge Network of the MDF Chip\nPrior to use, sterilize all the plastic tubes, finger-tight nuts, and microcentrifuge tubes shown in Figure 3B by setting a holding time of 15 min at 121 °C in the autoclave.\nConnect the fluoroplastic tubes (Figure 3B-i) to the MDF chip assembly via the medium inlet and outlet adaptors shown in Figure 1A.\nConnect the Luer taper of the medium inlet and outlet plastic tubes in Figure 3B-i to the 3-way stopcocks.\nTake 2.5 ml of CO2-equilibrated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a 3 ml syringe and connect the syringe to the 3-way stopcock of the inlet plastic tube. Connect an empty 3 ml syringe to the 3-way stopcock of the outlet plastic tube. The two syringes are thus interconnected through the MDF chip.\n\tNOTE: Incubate the PBS in the 37 °C 5%-CO2 cell culture incubator O/N to obtain CO2-equilibrated PBS.\nSeal the openings of the blue and the green adaptors (Figure 1A) on the Layer 1 PMMA sheet with white solid finger-tight nuts (Figure 3B-iii).\nFill the salt bridge channels and culture chambers with the CO2-equilibrated PBS in the syringe described in setup step 2.4. Avoid the formation of bubbles.",
    "Next, put the CO2-equilibrated PBS-containing MDF chip in the 37 °C 5%-CO2 cell culture incubator for O/N incubation. This allows the dissolved air in the double-sided tape to form bubbles in the chambers.\nFlush away the bubbles in the channels by a rapid PBS flow in the channel using the two syringes. Pump the PBS back and forth if necessary.\nDrain the PBS in the channels via the 3-way stopcock connected to the medium outlet tube.\nUsing a new 3-ml syringe, take 2.5 ml of CO2-equilibrated Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (see step 3.5), and replace the syringe connected to the inlet with the new one. Refill the channels with the medium.\nPreparation of the salt bridge network.\n\t\nTemporally remove the solid nuts (Figure 3B-iii) on the green adaptors (Figure 1A) and inject 3% hot (>70 °C) agarose into the salt bridge channel through the opening in the green adaptors (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Preparation of hot agarose: Dissolve 1.5 g of agarose powder in 50 ml of PBS. Sterilize by setting a holding time of 20 min at 121 °C in the autoclave.\nStop injecting the agarose when the liquid fills three-quarters of the length of the salt bridge channel.\nSeal the pores on the green adaptors (Figure 1A) by screwing the solid nuts (Figure 3B-iii) after the agarose injection.\nReplace the solid nuts on the blue adaptors (Figure 1A) with the translucent tubular finger-tight nuts (Figure 3B).\nLoad the 3% pre-heated agarose into the tubular nuts (Figure 3B-iv).\nEmbed the Ag/AgCl electrodes (Figure 3B-v) into the tubular nuts (Figure 3B-iv) before the solidification of the agarose.\nAfter completing the setup of the salt bridge network, inject the CL1-5 lung cancer cells into the culture chambers, one chamber at a time.",
    "3. Preparation of Cancer Cells and Set Up for Electrotactic Experiment\nRegular culture of lung cancer cell line CL1-5.\n\t\nCulture the CL1-5 lung cancer cells, obtained from Prof. Pan-Chyr Yang,17 in the complete medium in a 75T cell culture flask at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The complete medium is composed of DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Sub-culture the cells every 3 to 4 days. The cells used for performing electrotaxis experiments are less than 25 passages from the original source.\nAdd 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin buffer to the exponentially growing CL1-5 cells and incubate for 2 min in the 37 °C 5%-CO2 cell culture incubator for cell detachment.\nTerminate the detachment process with 6 ml of 10% FBS DMEM and centrifuge the cells at 300 g for 5 min at RT. Then discard the medium and suspend the cell pellet with 5 ml of PBS.\nCount the number of cells in the PBS. Then take 1 x 106 cells and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the PBS. Suspend the cells with pre-warmed CO2-equilibrated DMEM and adjust the cell density to be 1 × 106 cells/ml.\n\tNOTE: Incubate the complete medium in the 37 °C 5%-CO2 cell culture incubator O/N to obtain the CO2-equilibrated DMEM.\n4. Set Up for Electrotactic Experiment\nFrom the outlet of the MDF chip, inject 0.3 ml, 1 × 106/ml, of the cells into the chip.\nIncubate the cell-seeded MDF chip in the cell culture incubator (set at 37 °C and 5% CO2) for 2-4 hr.\nSetup of MDF microfluidic system.",
    "Install the MDF microfluidic system onto a transparent indium tin oxide glass (ITO) heater. Measure the temperature of the MDF chip with a K-type thermocouple clipped between the MDF chip and the ITO glass. Control the ITO heater with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Set the MDF microfluidic system incubation temperature to 37 °C with the PID controller.\n\t\tNOTE: The fabrication of the ITO heater and the setup of the cell culture heating system are described in previous reports.18,19\nMount the temperature-controlled MDF chip assembly on the computer-controlled X-Y-Z motorized stage on an inverted microscope. The usage of the motorized stage is described in step 5.1. Pump the complete medium into the culture chambers through the inlets with a four-channel syringe pump.\nPump the complete medium into the MDF chip at a flow rate of 20 μl/hr. The culture waste from the outlets is collected in the microcentrifuge tubes (shown as \"waste\" in Figure 3A).\nIncubate the cells for another 16-18 hr at 37 °C in the MDF chip.\nTo replace the medium, pump the medium containing 50, 25, 5, and 0 µM kinase inhibitor, respectively, into each culture chamber at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Prepare a 10 mM stock solution of the Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y27632 by adding 3 ml of sterile water to the 10.6 mg kinase inhibitor. Dilute the 10 mM stock solution to 50, 25, and 5 µM, respectively, using 10% FBS DMEM medium.\nIncubate the cells in the kinase inhibitor for another 60 min at 37 °C. Set the medium flow rate to 20 μl/hr. Use the same culture temperature and flow rate described above in later steps.\nUse electrical wires to connect a DC power supply to the MDF chip via the Ag/AgCl electrodes on the chip.",
    "Serially connect an ammeter in the electric circuit. Use the ammeter to monitor the electric current in the MDF chip.\nTurn on the DC power supply and set the ammeter current to 86.94 μA by adjusting the power supply voltage to between 15 and 19 V.\n\tNOTE: Considering Ohm's law, E = I/(σAeff), where I is the electric current flowing through the bulk material, i.e., the culture medium in the electrotactic chamber, σ (= 1.38 Ω−1m−1) is the conductivity of the culture medium, Aeff (= 0.21 mm2 for a 3 mm width × 0.07 mm height) is the effective cross-sectional area of the electrotactic chamber, and the electric current (I) required to generate a 300 mV/mm EF in the MDF chip is 86.94 μA.\n5. Acquisition and Analysis of Cell Images\nControl the motorized stage using a MATLAB GUI program. With the MDF microfluidic system mounted on the microscope, move the chip to the observation regions using the motorized stage.\nRecord cell images using a digital single-lens reflex (SLR) camera mounted on the microscope.\nTake microscopic images using a 4X objective lens at intervals of 15 min for 2 hr.\nCell migration analysis.\n\t\nRun NIH ImageJ 1.47 V.\nAnalyze the distance from the initial to the final positions of the cell's centroid.\nGo to \"File\"→\"Import\"→\"Image Sequence,\" and import nine images for cell migration analysis. The first image is the result of zero time, and the last image is the result of 120 min.\nGo to \"Analyze\"→\"Set Measurements\" and check the box next to \"Centroid\"\nClick on the \"Freehand Selections\" icon.\nDepict the edge of the selected cells in the first image.\nGo to \"Edit\"→\"Selection\"→\"Add to Manager\"",
    "Go to the ninth image and depict the edge of the same cells selected on the first image. The cell positions can be traced using the second to eighth images.\nGo to \"Edit\"→\"Selection\"→\"Add to Manager\"\nRepeat steps 5.4.5 to 5.4.9 to collect data from 90 to 100 cells.\nGo to \"Analyze\"→\"Measure\" to obtain the result of the initial and final positions of the selected cells.\n\t\tNOTE: The migration speed is defined as the average cell movement length per hr. The directedness is defined as cosine, where is the angle between the vector of the dcEF (from anode to cathode) and the vector from the starting point of a cell to its final position. The directedness is −1 for cells migrating toward the anode and +1 for cells migrating toward the cathode. For a group of randomly migrating cells, the directedness is 0.2\nSubscription Required.
