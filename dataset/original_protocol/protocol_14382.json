    "The experiments described here were carried out in compliance with the relevant institutional and French animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policies. They have been approved by the French ethics committee (Comité Institutionnel d'Ethique Pour l'Animal de Laboratoire; number NCE/2012-106).\n1. Echocardiography\nDetermine the body weight of the mouse using a standard laboratory balance while holding it lightly by the tail to ensure proper positioning.\nAnesthetize the animal by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital25,26.\n\tNOTE: Any other kind of anesthesia can be used if the same protocol is used throughout the study. Advantages and disadvantages will be discussed below.\nPut the mouse back in its own cage and wait until it is unresponsive, it shows steady breathing, and rear foot reflexes are absent. To test this, squeeze a foot slightly and observe whether the leg still retracts.\nShave the left side of the thorax and the left armpit using a commercial rodent shaver.\n\tNOTE: The use of a dedicated rodent shaver allows for the complete removal of fine mouse hair to avoid interference in the echocardiographic measurement. Commercial hair removal creams or solutions should be avoided, as they are usually perfumed, which will disturb the animal after it awakens. Avoid excessive shaving, as it increases heat loss.\nPut the sleeping animal on a warm pad set to 40 - 42 °C in a shallow left-sided position, with the head at 12 o'clock and the tail at 6 o'clock. Fix the left arm, left leg, and tail with tape.\nApply pre-warmed echocardiography gel onto the shaved chest and the head of the transducer.",
    "Place the transducer parasternal-left, directing it to the right side of the neck to obtain a two-dimensional (2D) parasternal long-axis view on the level of the papillary muscle. Turn the transducer 90° clockwise to obtain a short-axis view at papilary muscle level. Use a minimal depth setting and a zoom to maximize image quality and frame rate. Set the sweep speed to the maximum.\nTo obtain these settings, different zoom and depth setting options may be used, depending on the machine and software. Record 2D-guided M-mode images in short-axis view27. Refer to Figure 1A and B27.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to avoid applying excessive pressure to the chest, as this may cause bradycardia.\nRecord at least 3 series of 3 heart beat cine loops for each animal.\n\tNOTE: For the echocardiograph software used in this study, press the \"Acquire/Save\" button only once. This methodology is specific to the echocardiograph with this particular software. Other software packages may be used with different machines.\nAfter successful recordings, wipe off the echocardiography gel from the mouse thorax, heating pad, and transducer. Remove the tape from the limbs and tail.\nLeave the mouse under observation on the heating pad, covered with tissue to avoid unnecessary light exposure and heat loss, until it wakes up.\nPut the animal back in its cage.\nAnalyze recorded M-mode images from parasternal short-axis view to determine left ventricular (LV) dimensions and function. Measure the thickness of the LV anterior wall in systole and diastole (LVAWs and LVAWd), the LV internal end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters (LVIDs and LVIDd), and the LV posterior wall thickness (LVPW) in systole and diastole (LVPWs and LVPWd) using the identification of the tissue-blood interface on the stored images.",
    "Measure the diastolic dimensions at the time of the apparent maximal LV diastolic dimensions and LV end-systolic dimensions at the time of the most anterior systolic excursion of the LV posterior wall. Tap the touchscreen on the \"Analyze\" icon and then on the \"LVAWd\" icon. Position the electronic caliper on the interface between the right ventricular cavity and the LV anterior wall in diastole.\nPosition the electronic caliper on the interface between the LV anterior wall and the LV cavity to obtain the LV diastolic anterior wall thickness; the software will directly switch to the LV internal end-diastolic measurement.\nPosition the caliper on the interface between the LV cavity and the LV posterior wall to obtain the LV internal end-diastolic diameter; the software will switch to the LV posterior wall thickness measurement.\nPosition the caliper on the interface between the LV posterior wall and the pericardium to obtain the LV diastolic posterior wall thickness. For LV systolic dimensions, tap the touch screen on the \"LVAWs\" icon and position the electronic caliper on the interface between the right ventricular cavity and the LV anterior wall in systole.\nPosition the electronic caliper on the interface between the LV anterior wall and the LV cavity to obtain the LV systolic anterior wall thickness. Repeat the process as described above for the LV internal end-systolic diameter and the LV systolic posterior wall thickness. Use the leading-edge convention adopted by the American Society of Echocardiography to trace the endocardial and epicardial borders13,27.",
    "NOTE: LV contractile function parameters will be automatically calculated using the previous measurements. The LV fractional shortening (FS) is defined as FS (%) = [(LVIDd - LVIDs)/LVIDd] x 100. The LV ejection fraction (EF) is calculated with the modified Teicholz formula, where EF (%) = [(LVIDd3 - LVIDs3)/LVIDd3] x 10012. Refer to Figure 1A and B.\nStore the data on compact discs or USB memory sticks and make backup copies.\nImport, analyze, and export the data using the appropriate software.\n\tNOTE: After these baseline measurements, the experiment can be paused. If performing a direct comparison between knockout animals and wild-type littermates, proceed with the histological analyses6. For Cre-ERT2; lox/lox mouse lines, continue the following day with tamoxifen induction by i.p. injection, as described5,24. If inducing experimental myocardial infarction by the ligation of the left coronary artery5,28, the surgery could be performed directly after the echocardiographic measurements, when the mice are under anesthesia. Otherwise, a minimum delay of one week between two rounds of anesthesia should be maintained to limit the rate of post-operative lethality.\n2. Preparation of Heart Samples for Histological Evaluation\nSacrifice the animals by cervical dislocation. Measure their body weights. Disinfect the chest and abdomen using a 70% alcohol swab.\nMake a transverse incision in the skin 1 cm distal to the sternum. Using blunt forceps, remove the skin from the thorax, moving in the direction of the head. Hold the sternum lightly with fine forceps and open the diaphragm by inserting the blunt end of fine scissors.\nCut the rib cage on both sides parallel to the sternum. Move the sternum in the direction of the head. Locate the heart in the thorax. Hold the vascular trunk of the heart with the fine forceps and cut below using fine scissors.",
    "Open the chest and excise the entire heart out of the thorax, measure the heart weight, and establish a heart-to-body weight ratio4,5,6,23,29,30.\nFix the heart in 2 mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin solution in 15-mL tubes overnight at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: Danger! Work with formalin solutions must be done in a chemical fume hood; wear gloves and safety glasses.\n\tNOTE: As the buffer composition for formalin solutions varies with different suppliers, use the same supplier throughout the study.\nThe next day, cut the hearts in the transverse plane, in the middle, and transfer them into cassettes for paraffin embedding, which is performed in the pathology laboratory using an automated embedding apparatus.\nPerform sectioning.\nSection paraffin blocks at a thickness of 3 µm using a microtome and float them in a 40 °C water bath containing distilled water.\nTransfer the sections onto slides. Allow the slides to dry overnight in a 37 °C incubator and store them at 4 °C until ready for use.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here until the user is ready for staining (step 3).\nDeparaffinize and rehydrate the tissue slides.\nPlace the slides in staining jars with glass inserts in a 55 °C oven for 10 min to melt the paraffin.\nDeparaffinize the slides in two changes of 200 mL of xylene or xylene substitute for 5 min each.\n\t\tCAUTION: Highly flammable and toxic! Work in a chemical fume hood; wear gloves and safety glasses.\nTransfer the slides to 200 mL of 100% alcohol. Make two changes for 3 min each and transfer once through 200 mL of 95% alcohol for 3 min.\n\t\tCAUTION: Highly flammable! Keep away from sources of ignition; no smoking.",
    "Rinse twice in 200 mL of phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) for 5 min each and continue with step 3, 4, or 5.\n3. Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining\nRinse the slides with their sections in distilled water.\nStain the nuclei with hematoxylin solution for 8 min.\nRinse in running tap water for 10 min.\nStain with eosin solution for 2 min.\nDehydrate three times for 2 min in 100% ethanol (EtOH). Clear three times for 2 min in xylene or xylene substitute. Mount in a xylene-based mounting medium.\nPhotograph the slides and measure the cardiomyocyte diameter at the level of the nucleus in longitudinal sections of the interventricular septum. Measure at least 100 cells per section and three sections per heart.\n4. WGA Staining\nIncubate the slides obtained from step 2.7 with tetramethylrhodamine (or other fluorescent dyes)-conjugated WGA (1:100 in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature in a humid chamber.\nWash three times with PBS for 5 min each.\nMount with fluorescence mounting media containing DAPI. Store at 4 °C in the dark before analysis.\n\tCAUTION: Wear eye protection and compatible chemical-resistant gloves.\nPhotograph the slides.\nUse a microscope equipped with fluorescence epi-illumination and filter sets for DAPI and tetramethylrhodamine (refer to the Table of Materials). Set the aperture to the maximum and the brightness to auto-exposure.\nAcquire separate images at 400x magnification for the blue and the red channels. Open the images in ImageJ. Adjust the brightness and contrast if necessary (Image > Adjust > Brightness/contrast).\nSet each image to 8-bit (Image > Type > 8-bit). Overlay the DAPI and WGA images. Use the blue channel for DAPI and the red channel for WGA; set the green and gray channels to none (Image > Color > Merge channels)31.",
    "Determine the cardiomyocyte diameters at the level of the nucleus in transverse sections of the interventricular septum.\nDefine the scale of the images in ImageJ. For this purpose, photograph an object of known size (e.g., a hemocytometer chamber at the same magnification as the heart sections; step 4.4).\nUse the straight-line tool to draw a line from beginning to end of the known structure (Analyze > Set scale).\n\t\tNOTE: The distance in pixels will be displayed automatically; the known distance and unit of length will have to be entered. Proceed with cardiomyocyte measurements at the level of the nucleus.\nDraw a straight line from the WGA-positive membrane through the DAPI-positive nucleus to the opposite site of the WGA-positive cell membrane (Analyze > Measure). In the results window, make sure that the length values have a meaningful number of decimal places (Analyze > Set measurements > Decimal places).\nMeasure at least 100 cells per section and three sections per heart. Export the results to Excel (Click on Results > File > Save as > .csv)6,31.\n5. Pecam-1 Immunostaining\nPerform antigen unmasking.\nAdd 1,600 mL of sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) to a pressure cooker. Place the pressure cooker on the hotplate and turn it on full power. Do not secure the lid of the pressure cooker at this point; simply rest it on top.\n\t\tCAUTION: Hot!",
    "Once the sodium citrate buffer is boiling, transfer the slides from step 2.5 to the pressure cooker. Secure the pressure cooker lid. As soon as the cooker has reached full pressure, wait for 7 min. When 7 min have elapsed, turn off the hotplate and place the pressure cooker in an empty sink. Activate the pressure release valve and run cold water over the cooker. Once it has de-pressurized, open the lid and run cold water into the cooker for 5 min. Place the slides in 200 mL of PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, microwave antigen unmasking could be used, although the risk of overheating is increased.\nUse 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity for 5 min. Rinse the slides for three times for 2 min each in 200 mL of PBS.\n\tCAUTION: Flammable and toxic!\nIncubate the slides for 15 min in diluted normal blocking serum (5% normal goat serum in PBS) that also contains an avidin block (4 drops in 1 mL).\nCarefully tap the liquid from the sections and incubate them with Pecam-1 antibody from rabbit, diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 2.5% normal goat serum and 4 drops of biotin block per mL. Incubate the slides overnight in a humid chamber at 4 °C.\nWash the slides three times for 5 min each in 200 mL of PBS. Incubate the sections with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2.5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Wash the slides three times for 5 min each in 200 mL of PBS.\nIncubate the sections with an avidin/biotin-based peroxidase system for 20 min (reagent A and reagent B need to be combined 30 mins prior to use). Wash the slides three times for 5 min each in 200 mL of PBS.",
    "Dissolve 1 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 1 urea hydrogen peroxide tablet in 5 mL of double-distilled water. Incubate the sections with DAB solution for approximately 3 min, carefully monitoring color development. Stop the color reaction by gently washing the slides in 200 mL of PBS.\n\tCAUTION: Carcinogenic; wear chemical-resistant gloves!\nCounterstain the nuclei for 6 min with hematoxylin. Rinse in running tap water for 2 min. Dehydrate three times for 2 min each in 200 mL of 100% alcohol. Clear three times for 2 min each in 200 mL of xylene or a xylene substitute. Mount in a xylene-based mounting medium.\nPhotograph the slides (at least ten fields at 40x magnification from the interventricular septum of each heart) and measure the Pecam-1 area density using the freely available ImageJ software31. Use the color deconvolution32 plugin for DAB and hematoxylin and adjust the image contrast to the same level.\n\tNOTE: In case the brown and purple/blue color have significant spectral overlap, which might cause difficulties with color deconvolution, one could try different brands of hematoxylin solution to obtain clear, light-blue nuclear staining. Alternatively, immunofluorescence or manual counting of the capillaries could be performed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
