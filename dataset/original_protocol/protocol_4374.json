    "Preparation (Day 1)   Overnight cultures (ONC) of test strains in LB medium (1 ml) are grown at 37 °C/180 rpm in an incubator shaker for 16 h.   Autoclave bladder models, media bottle, filter cartridge, tubings and connectors prepared for the number of models you want to run (either in beakers or in aluminium foil).   Depending on the time frame of the experiment, artificial urine (~700 ml/day/bladder model) is prepared according to Stickler et al. (1999) and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter cartridge (Sartobran P) into an autoclaved bottle (Figure 2).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150119/20150119181911_4463.jpg Figure 2. Assembly of filter sterilization for large volumes of artificial urine. The same procedure is applicable for pooled human urine. Relevant visible parts are marked according to equipment list.      Inoculation (Day 2)   Prepare a culture of test strains: 0.5 ml ONC in 20 ml sterile artificial urine incubated for 2-4 h at 37 °C/180 rpm.    Install the heating water cycle (37 °C) and connect the urine supply tubings. Insert the tubing in the peristaltic pump (Figure 3 and Figure 4; Figure 5 for schematic representation).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150119/20150119182150_5822.jpg Figure 3. Connection of water cycle and urine supply. Water bath is directly connected to the bladder models (not shown), the urine is pumped from the reservoir using a peristaltic pump (use a channel for each model). Relevant visible parts are marked according to equipment list.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150119/20150119182209_1619.jpg Figure 4.

Schematic representation of the closed system necessary for setup of a catheterized bladder model. For simplicity, one bladder without mounting equipment or water bath are shown. Relevant parts are marked according to equipment list.",
    "Insert a sterile Foley-catheter in each bladder and inflate the retention balloon with 10 ml H2O. Connect each catheter with the drainage bag.   Fill the urine supply system and the bladders using the peristaltic pump to a level just underneath the eye hole of the catheter (Figure 6; Note: Check that the catheters are tight so that the bladders are not leaking!) Stop the urine flow and clamp of the tubings after the pump.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150119/20150119182259_5967.jpg Figure 6. Close up of artificial bladder model after catheter insertion and filling A and after cultivation B. Relevant parts are indicated.    Measure OD600 of the cultures. Inoculate each model with an appropriate amount of cells for your experiment (depending on the infection phase you are interested the inoculum can range e.g. from 1 x 106 to 1 x 109 cfu). To do so remove the corresponding volume of urine from the models and replace it with the same volume of culture.    Remove the clamp and start the urine flow 30-60 min after inoculation (~30 ml/h, corresponds to 1.7 rpm using Watson-Marlow 205U using 5 mm silicone tubings).      Quantification of colonization   Stop the urine flow, mix or sample the bladder content and carefully remove it to completion (transfer the bladder content to a 50 ml tube). You can estimate the volume by using a balance (1 g ~ 1 ml).   After disconnection of the drainage tubing from the catheter, slowly deflate the retention ball. Carefully remove the catheter from the bladder and transfer it to a sterile surface. Cut away the tip of the catheter (including the eyehole) and transfer it to a microcentrifuge tube. Rinse the internal surface of the remaining catheter to remove unattached cells from bladder content with 2 ml of 0.9 % NaCl solution or sterile urine.",
    "Cut and transfer 1 cm catheter segments to 1,000 µl 0.9% NaCl solution.   Sonicate the bladder contents and the saline solutions with the catheter pieces for 5 min (room temperature, 35 kHz, one round), then vortex for additional 2 min.   Dilute suspensions in 0.9% NaCl solution (bladder to 10-6, catheter suspensions to 10-5).   Plate 50-100 µl of dilutions on LB agar plates (with or without selection).   Following incubation calculate the colony counts to receive cfu/ml bladder content and cfu/cm catheter. In competition experiments, determine the competitive index (the ratio of harvested CFU of e.g. the mutant strain relative to e.g. the parental strain, divided by their ratio in the inoculum)."
