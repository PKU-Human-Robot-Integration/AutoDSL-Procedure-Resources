    "In this protocol, target regions of parasite DNA are amplified in two reactions, followed by a library preparation where indexes are added and subsequently libraries are amplified and cleaned, quantified, pooled, and sequenced on a MiSeq system (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4621/bioprotoc-13-05-4621-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic flowchart of library preparation procedures P. falciparum–infected human blood sample preparation This section quantifies and prepares the DNA extracted from dried blood spots (DBS) for library preparation.Isolate DNA from DBS according to standardized protocols (e.g., DNA extractions using the Qiagen 96 DNA blood kit or E.Z.N.A. DNA mini kit).Note: DNA extracted from whole blood or white blood cell–depleted blood can also be used as input material. However, take note of the DNA concentrations as described in step A3. Quantify 3–10 µL of DNA of (a subset of) samples using the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay kits, according to manufacturer’s protocol.Set up the required number of 0.5 mL tubes for standards and samples. The Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay requires two standards.Prepare the Qubit® working solution by diluting the Qubit® dsDNA HS reagent 1:200 in Qubit® dsDNA HS buffer. Use a clean plastic tube each time you prepare Qubit® working solution. For 96 samples, prepare 20 mL working solution by mixing:i) 19.9 mL Qubit® dsDNA HS buffer.ii) 100 µL Qubit® dsDNA HS reagent.Prepare the standard tubes:i) Add 190 μL of Qubit working solution to each of the two tubes used for standards.ii) Add 10 μL of each Qubit® standard to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing 2–3 s. Be careful not to create bubbles.Prepare the sample tubes:i) Add 200 μL minus the sample volume (see next step) of Qubit working solution to each of the tubes used for the libraries.ii) Add 3–10 μL of each DNA sample to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing 2–3 s.",
    "Be careful not to create bubbles.Note: If you suspect the sample concentration is too low, you can use a higher volume (10 μL) of sample in the Qubit reaction. Allow all tubes to incubate at room temperature (RT) for 2 min.On the home screen of the Qubit® 2.0 fluorometer, press DNA, then select dsDNA High Sensitivity as the assay type. The Standards screen is displayed.On the Standards screen, press Yes to read the standards.Insert the tube containing standard #1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press Read. When the reading is complete (~3 s), remove standard #1.Insert the tube containing standard #2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press Read. When the reading is complete, remove standard #2. When the calibration is complete, the instrument displays the Sample screen.Insert a sample tube into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press Read. When the reading is complete (~3 s), remove the sample tube.The instrument displays the results on the Sample screen. The value displayed corresponds to the concentration after your sample was diluted into the assay tube. To find the concentration of your original sample, you can record this value and perform the calculation later in the Excel template. To calculate the concentration of your sample, use the following equation:Concentration = measured value (concentration of diluted sample) × (200/V), where V is the volume of sample that you started the reaction in step A2 d.ii.Repeat steps j-k until all samples have been read.Recommended input concentration from the library preparation kit is 10 ng of high-quality DNA per reaction with one of the two primer pools. (The kit supports 1–100 ng DNA input. Please note, however, that due to the nature of our samples, we have a mixture of human and parasite DNA.",
    ")Dilute samples with too high DNA concentration (>100 ng) in low TE (supplied with AmpliSeq Library PLUS kit) to an input concentration of ~1–10 ng/μL.Note: In our procedures, mean DNA concentration after DNA extraction from DBS was 6.1 ± 0.3 ng/μL and we used 7.5 μL of undiluted sample (~23 ng total input per reaction) in the library preparation reactions. It is important not to exceed the 100 ng DNA input as this will negatively affect the quality of the sequencing result. For DBS samples, in our experience, the DNA concentration was always below the upper limit. After testing the DNA concentration of a few samples with varying parasite densities at the start of a study, we do not routinely check the concentration every time we do a plate to save time and costs. It is important to consider that for P. falciparum DBS samples, we have a mixture of human and parasite DNA. To ensure you have sufficient high-quality parasite DNA, it is important to quantify your parasite DNA in advance with a qPCR. From our validation procedure (see notes at the end of the document) we recommend including samples with P. falciparum densities ≥60 parasites/µl as determined by Mangold PCR (Mangold et al., 2005). This limit depends also on the amount of blood spotted on filter paper and the amount of filter paper (e.g., two pieces of ~0.5 cm2 as in our case), which can impact the amount of template DNA in your sample. Prepare a 96-well layout with the sample IDs (see Excel template “Template_AmpliSeq.xlsx[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20230219/Template%20Ampliseq%20v1.0%20041021.xlsx]”).Note: We usually do the library preparation for 96 samples at once, so we use one 96 sample AmpliSeq Library PLUS kit per time.",
    "You could increase or decrease the number of samples and kits used for one run on a MiSeq, but this will impact the depth per sample. Add 7.5 µL of (diluted) DNA for each sample in the corresponding well of your layout.SAFE STOPPING POINT:  Store the 96-well plate with prepared samples at 4 °C overnight or at -20 °C for longer periods if not immediately commencing with the library preparation procedures.Amplify DNA targets This section uses PCR to amplify the (overlapping) target regions of the DNA samples in two reactions with two different primer pools from the AmpliSeq Custom DNA panel. As a first step, the DNA is mixed with the AmpliSeq HiFi Mix (including a buffering solution and enzyme for amplification) and subsequently split over two new PCR plates. To the wells in each of the plates, one of the two pre-mixed pools of primers is added for amplification on a thermal cycler. There are two pools of primers (and not just one amplifying all targets), to allow for the overlap between amplicons spanning large genes (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4621/bioprotoc-13-05-4621-g002.jpgFigure 2. Overlapping amplicon design and primer pools. In order to allow for amplification of large genes, the custom DNA panel includes short overlapping amplicons. By using two pools of primers alternating the overlapping amplicons, we prevent amplification of the wrong primer combination in the overlapping region. After the initial two PCR reactions with the two primer pools, you add both products together and continue with a single library preparation in the next step.Thaw the following reagents:96-well plate with 7.5 µL of DNA prepared in previous section: thaw on ice if frozen.5× AmpliSeq HiFi Mix (red cap; AmpliSeq Library PLUS kit): thaw on ice and invert to mix.",

This will result in a total volume per sample of 20 µL.Aliquot 30 µL of FuPa reagent in each well of a clean 8-well PCR strip. From here, using a multichannel pipette, transfer 2 µL of FuPa reagent to each well of the combined pool 1 + 2 product and mix.

The indexes are premixed in a single-use plate to ensure unique combinations. Each library must have a unique index combination for dual-index sequencing. When more than 96 samples are being included in the same sequencing run, make sure to use different index sets (four sets are available from Illumina with different combinations: Set A, Set B, set C, and/or Set D, allowing multiplexing of maximum 384 libraries).

    "There are two options for quantifying your libraries: using a KAPA qPCR kit or, alternatively, using the Qubit high-sensitivity reagents and fluorometer, depending on the availability of equipment in your laboratory.OPTION 1: KAPA library quantification Follow the manufacturer’s procedures of the Library Quantification kit for Illumina Platforms (KAPA Biosystems), which is a qPCR-based method for quantification of Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flowcell oligo sequences.Dilute the libraries to be tested 1:1,000,000 in DNA dilution buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0–8.5 (25 °C) + 0.05% Tween® 20]. For accurate dilution and for keeping the volume manageable, serially dilute three times 100×. So, start with mixing 3 µL of DNA + 297 µL of dilution buffer and briefly vortex, for a first 100× dilution. Then, mix 10 µL of 100× diluted DNA + 900 µL of dilution buffer, for a second dilution to 10,000× dilution, and briefly vortex. Then, mix 10 µL of 10,000× diluted DNA + 900 µL of dilution buffer for a final dilution to 1,000,000× dilution, and briefly vortex.Ensure that all components of the KAPA Library Quantification kit are completely thawed and thoroughly mixed.If the kit is used for the first time, add the primer premix (10×) (1 mL) to the bottle of KAPA SYBR® FAST qPCR Master mix (2×) (5 mL). Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer.Prepare the required internal control dilutions (e.g., PhiX library dilution) in the same way as the samples.Each library, including the controls, is measured in triplicate (so, for 96 libraries, multiple plates with KAPA Library quantification need to be performed). Prepare PCR plate layouts and include six standards and internal control (DNA standard 0 of the standards), which are all provided by the KAPA kit, as per the instructions of the manufacturer, and non-template controls (NTC, e.g.",
    ", nuclease-free water or buffer).Dispense 6 µL of the master mix [KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master mix (2×) + primer premix (10×)] into each well of a 96-well qPCR plate.Add 4 μL of nuclease-free water to all NTC wells.Dispense 4 μL of each DNA standard into the appropriate well/tube(s), working from the most dilute (standard 6) to the most concentrated (standard 1).Dispense 4 μL of each dilution of libraries and internal controls to be assayed.Seal the PCR plate and transfer to the qPCR instrument (Roche LightCycler® 480).Perform qPCR with the cycling protocol of Table 7, selecting the Absolute Quantification option in the instrument software.

    "OPTION 2: Qubit DNA concentration measurement Use the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay kits to determine the concentration of double-stranded DNA in the libraries, following the manufacturers’ procedures.Set up the required number of 0.5 mL tubes for standards and samples. The Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay requires two standards.Prepare the Qubit® working solution by diluting the Qubit® dsDNA HS reagent 1:200 in Qubit® dsDNA HS buffer. Use a clean plastic tube each time you prepare Qubit® working solution. For 96 samples, prepare 20 mL working solution by mixing:19.9 mL Qubit® dsDNA HS buffer.100 µL Qubit® dsDNA HS reagent.Add 190 μL of Qubit working solution to each of the two tubes used for standards.Add 10 μL of each Qubit® standard to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing 2–3 s. Be careful not to create bubbles.Add 197 μL of Qubit working solution to each of the tubes used for the libraries.Add 3 μL of each sample library to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing 2–3 s. Be careful not to create bubbles.Note: If you suspect the library concentration is too low, you can use a higher volume (5–20 μL) of library in the Qubit reaction. If this is the case, also adjust the volume of Qubit working solution in step H5 to make sure the final volume after adding the library is 200 μL. Take care not to use too much library as you will need sufficient volume (up to 6 µL) to make the pool in the next section. If the library concentration is too high (i.e., beyond the linear range of the Qubit kit) after the first measurement, dilute the library (e.g., 1:2 or 1:4) and measure again to get an accurate concentration. Allow all tubes to incubate at RT for 2 minutes.",
    "Note: You can add the libraries to the working solution in batches of 16–24, then incubate and measure. In the meantime, keep the unused tubes in the dark, for example by covering with aluminum foil. On the Home screen of the Qubit® 2.0 fluorometer, press DNA, then select dsDNA High Sensitivity as the assay type. The Standards screen is displayed.On the Standards screen, press Yes to read the standards.Insert the tube containing standard #1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press Read. When the reading is complete (~3 s), remove standard #1.Insert the tube containing standard #2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press Read. When the reading is complete, remove standard #2. When the calibration is complete, the instrument displays the Sample screen.Insert a sample tube into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press Read. When the reading is complete (~3 s), remove the sample tube.The instrument displays the results on the Sample screen. The value displayed corresponds to the concentration after your sample was diluted into the assay tube. To find the concentration of your original sample, you can record this value and perform the calculation later in the Excel template. To calculate the concentration of your sample, use the following equation:Concentration = measured value (concentration of diluted sample) × (200/V), where V is the volume of library that you added, in this case 3 µL.Repeat steps 12-13 until all samples have been read.Dilute and pool libraries Libraries of each sample and control will be diluted with low TE to the same concentration (2 nM) individually and then pooled at equimolar ratios for a balanced sequencing output for all samples. Library quantity will vary depending on template input amount (e.g., differing parasite densities).",
    "Thaw frozen low TE buffer (AmpliSeq library prep kit) at RT.Using the library concentrations determined with the KAPA or Qubit kit (previous section), determine the molarity of the library.For measurements with the KAPA kit, use the template provided by the company and standard curve included in the PCR plate to determine the size-adjusted molarity.Note: With KAPA kit, a library prep from a dried blood spot sample with parasite density ≥5 p/µL usually has a size-adjusted molarity within the range of 10–1000 nM. For Qubit measurements, we use the following formula: (c * 106) / (660 * library size), where c is the concentration (ng/µL) as measured with the Qubit.Note: You can determine the mean size of your library with, for example, the Tapestation (Agilent) or alternatively using 350 bp as the default for AmpliSeq. (With Qubit, a library preparation from a DBS sample with parasite density ≥5 p/µL usually has a size-adjusted molarity within the range of 1–100 nM.) Calculate the dilution you need to make to reach a concentration of 2 nM for each library.Dilute each library to 2 nM using low TE in a 96-well plate as indicated in the template. If the concentration (molarity) of the library (undiluted) is below 2 nM, then add 6 µL of the undiluted library to the final 2 nM plate.Note: Take care not to start with a too low volume of library (at least 3 µL) for the dilution, as this will increase the inaccuracy of the final concentration. Also, take care to keep the final volume of your dilution below 200 µL; otherwise, the well of your dilution plate will overflow. If needed, dilute in a separate Eppendorf tube for larger volumes, then transfer 50 µL of the diluted library to the appropriate well in the dilution plate.",
    "Make a pool with equal volumes of all 2 nM libraries:Use a multichannel pipette to combine 5 µL from each well from the rows of the 96-well plate into one 8-well strip (i.e., make a pool from each row). Mix by pipetting 10 times.Combine the entire volume of the row pools from the 8-well strip into one 1.5 mL LoBind® tube.Note: This example for the pooling is for 96 samples. When sequencing more than 96 samples in one run, pool all 2 nM libraries of all samples to be included in the run into one final pool at equal volumes. When running more than 96 samples, take care to combine libraries prepared with different index sets; otherwise, you will not be able to demultiplex the sequences from the different plates. Preferably, proceed to sequencing the diluted library pool soon after the dilution. If not possible, store diluted library at -20 °C up to one week.Preparing files for sequencing on MiSeq This section describes the steps and settings needed to prepare the sample sheet that is required to set up the sequencing reaction on the MiSeq.Using the Illumina Experiment Manager software, create a sample plate:From the main screen, select Create Sample Plate.Select AmpliSeq CD Indexes plate A (or B, C, or D, depending on the index kit that you used during the library prep), and then select Next.In the Unique Plate Name field, enter a unique name for the sample plate. (Do not use special characters and spaces in sample IDs and plate names.) Select 2 (Dual) for the Index Reads, which should be the default setting. Select Next.Select the Table or Plate tab, depending on your preferred view.Enter a unique Sample ID for each well (for example by copy pasting from an Excel layout).",
    "Setting the indexes (in the Table tab).When using the default layout from the 96-well index plates, you can auto populate the indexes: select the Apply Default Index Layout button at the bottom left.When you are using a different layout than the standard index plate layout:i) Select a well in the Index Well field.ii) In the Index1 and Index2 fields, select the index adapter being used for each Index Read.Check your layout; valid entries for all samples will have turned white instead of brown/grey. If everything is valid, select Finish, and then save the sample plate file in a desired location.Using the Illumina Experiment Manager software, create a sample sheet:From the main screen, select Create Sample Sheet.Select MiSeq and then Next.Select the appropriate application (Other -> FASTQ Only, to only generate fastq files for subsequent analysis) and then select Next. (Alternatively, variants can be analyzed directly using the DNA Amplicon application and the manifest file in the basespace cloud system or local run manager.)In the Reagent Kit Barcode field, enter the reagent kit ID from the label of box 1 or box 2 of the SBS kit that starts with RGT, followed by eight digits located underneath the barcode. (If unknown at this stage, you can correct this later.)Select the appropriate Library Prep Workflow (AmpliSeq Library PLUS for Illumina).Select the appropriate Index Adapter (AmpliSeq CD Indexes plate A, B, C, or D, or 384 when combining more than 96 samples).Index Reads should be 2 (Dual) by default.Enter the Experiment Name, Investigator Name, Description, and Date.Enter the expected date of sequencing.Select the Paired End Read Type.In the Cycles Read fields, enter one more than the number of cycles (301 for the MiSeq v3 600 cycle reagent kit) for both read 1 and for read 2.",
    "In the workflow specific settings, select Use Adapter Trimming (default).Select Next to continue to Select Samples for a MiSeq Sample Sheet.Select samples by selecting Select Plate and then navigate to the sample plate prepared in step J1.Choose wells to include in the sequencing run (Select all).Select Add Selected Samples.Note: Make sure that all the libraries included in the pool are in the sample sheet with corresponding indexes. So, if you are running more than 96 samples in a run, add all plates to the one sample sheet. Select Finish, and then save the sample sheet file (*.csv) in the desired location. Review the sample sheet in Excel (there should be no spaces or special characters in the sample IDs).Final preparation for sequencing In this section, the pooled library is denatured and diluted before loading on the MiSeq cartridge for sequencing. A control library (PhiX) is added to the pool at the same concentration and will act as a control for the sequencing reaction on the MiSeq. In addition, by adding PhiX, you will increase the nucleotide diversity during the sequencing run, which will increase the sequencing quality, as the P. falciparum genome, and hence also the targeted regions in this assay, are high in A and T nucleotides.Prepare a fresh dilution of 0.2 N NaOH:Combine the reagents in an Eppendorf tube:i) 800 µL nuclease-free water.ii) 200 µL 1.0 N NaOH.Mix the tube by inverting several times.Use within 12 h.Prepare HT1:Thaw the HT1 buffer (Miseq reagent kit v3, Illumina) at RT.Store the HT1 buffer at 2–8 °C until needed, if not used immediately when thawed.Denature libraries:Combine 5 µL of library pool with 5 µL of 0.2 N NaOH.Vortex briefly, then centrifuge briefly.Incubate at RT for 5 min.Add 5 µL of 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0.",
    "Add 985 µL of pre-chilled HT1 buffer to the tube of denatured pool. The result is a 10 pM denatured library. Vortex and centrifuge briefly.Place the 10 pM libraries on ice until you are ready to proceed to final dilution.Dilute library pool to final loading concentration.Dilute with pre-chilled HT1 buffer until the final loading concentration at a final volume of 600 μL:18 pM for KAPA quantified libraries7 pM for Qubit quantified librariesIf you are stopping, seal the tube and store at 25°C to 15°C.Spike library pool with 1%–5% PhiX spike-in to include quality controls (5% is recommended for PF AmpliSeq libraries as GC content, and therefore library diversity, is lower).Dilute stock of PhiX spike-in to a concentration similar to the final library (7 or 18 pM).i) Take 570 µL of 7 pM libraryii) Add 30 µL of PhiXYou obtained a 7 pM library pool with 5% PhiX spike-in for loading onto the reagent cartridge and the MiSeq according to the directions of the manufacturer and Reagent kit. Keep on ice until loading.Preparation of the MiSeq and loading the library pool Perform a pre-run wash of the MiSeq as per the instructions on MiSeq control software after selecting Wash.Thaw the reagent cartridge from the MiSeq V3 Reagent kit in a water bath (or sink filled with a layer of water) at RT. Do not submerge the entire cartridge, only the base. There is a maximum water level indicator line on the cartridge that you should not surpass. It will take 1–2 h before the entire cartridge is thawed.Invert the reagent cartridge 10 times to mix the reagents. Inspect that all reagents are thawed, fully mixed, and free of precipitates.Gently tap the cartridge on the bench to reduce air bubbles in the reagents.",
    "Set the reagent cartridge aside if not using immediately, store on ice or at 2–8 °C for up to six hours. For best results, proceed directly to loading the sample and setting up the run.Locate the seal that is covering the reservoir labelled Load Samples and clean the foil with a tissue/Kimwipe and pierce it with a clean 1 mL pipette tip.Add 600 µL of prepared denatured 7 pM library pool with 5% PhiX spike-in into the reservoir marked Load Samples; avoid touching the seal.Set up the run on the MiSeq System:Select Sequence using the MiSeq control software.Select Set up a run with the Local Run Manager and follow the steps until the Local Run Manager is opened.Select Create Run and the appropriate analysis module:i) Select the module GenerateFASTQ to sequence and generate fastq files that can be analyzed with the Linux pipeline described in the data analysis option.ii) Select the module DNA Amplicon to use the manifest file to perform the variant calling on the MiSeq system.Note: You will need to have this module installed on your MiSeq system in order to use it. You will also need to copy the manifest file to the MiSeq system, as well as the reference genome following the instructions of the Local Run Manager Amplicon Analysis Module Workflow Guide (https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/software_documentation/local-run-manager/local-run-manager-dna-amplicon-workflow-guide-1000000048047-03.pdf[href=https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/software_documentation/local-run-manager/local-run-manager-dna-amplicon-workflow-guide-1000000048047-03.pdf]).Select Import sample sheet to import the sample sheet prepared in section J.Check the settings, samples, and indexes and add a name for the run and a description (optional).Select Save Run.
