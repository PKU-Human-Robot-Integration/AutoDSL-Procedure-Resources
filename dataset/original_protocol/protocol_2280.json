Induction of the brain tumor injection model\nTiming: 30 min",
    "This section explains how to induce the orthotopic syngeneic murine brain tumor model by injecting GL261 cells.\nNote: The injection site could be critical, so the mouse head should be fixed during the experiments.\nNote: Drilling the skull and injecting cells can cause bleeding, which could affect the immune response and tumor formation. It is important to avoid blood vessels during the experiments. Even though the injection speed could vary depending on preferences, the injection should be performed as slow as possible to avoid tissue damage.\nNote: Cell type and number can vary depending on preferences and purpose, and thus should be optimized by users.
