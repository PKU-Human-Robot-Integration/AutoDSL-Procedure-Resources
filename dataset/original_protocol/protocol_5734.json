    "LabellingCells were plated in complete media at 350,000 per 100 mm plate 48 h before harvesting (this will be cell type dependent, aim for 70% confluence at day of harvest).Aspirate media and wash the cells gently with room temperature (RT) PBS (10 ml per 100 mm plate).Remove PBS and replace with warmed (37 °C) starvation media (6 ml per 100 mm plate).Return cells to the incubator for 1 h.Add 200 μCi of Express 35S protein labelling mix (18 μl per dish) directly into the media and swirl.Return to the incubator for 30 min.Either:Harvest (0 h)OR remove the media and wash the plate twice with 5 ml of warmed complete media.Add complete media and return plates to the incubator for the designated period of time (15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min) before harvest.Harvest (Keep samples cold at all times)Place plates on ice and remove the media.Wash plates gently twice with 5 ml of ice cold PBS, then drain the plate on its side and remove any residual PBS.Add 500 μl of lysis buffer with 0.5% NP-40 and scrapped with a cell lifter.Pippette lysate into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Sonicate lysate for 5 min with a cycle of 30 sec on then 30 sec off at 4 °C using the Bioruptor.Spin sample at 11,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer supernatant to a new tube keeping them on ice.Determine the protein concentration of sample using the DC Bio-Rad assay as per manufactures instructions with BSA as a control. Samples were assayed in triplicate.p53 ImmunopreciptiationEquivalent amounts of protein were added to each tube and made up to a final volume of 400 μl with lysis buffer.To each sample add 40 μl of washed protein A sepharose to preclear the sample.",
    "Note: Beads are in a 50% slurry so the final bed volume is 20 μl; use a tip which has the last 20% cut off the end to generate a larger bore size, pipette up and down at least 5 times to insure the beads are not stuck in the tip.Rotate sample for 1 h at 4 °C on wheel.Spin sample at 800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Transfer supernatant to fresh tube and:Remove 20 μl to keep as \"input\" for loading control purposes.Add 40 μl of a 50% slurry of washed protein A sepharose with 0.3 μg of p53 or control antibody.Tumble overnight at 4 °C.Spin at 800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant and wash beads with 600 μl of lysis buffer with 0.1% NP-40 three times (flick tube to resuspend beads don’t pipette them).Spin sample at 800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant and wash beads with 1 ml of Lysis buffer with no NP-40 two more times.Spin sample at 800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Remove all supernatant and add 40 μl of 2.5x SLB buffer.Boil beads at 95 °C for 10 min in a heatblock.Cool on ice for 5 min.Boil for a further 5 min in a heat block.Pulse spin at max speed for 30 sec.Transfer supernatant to new tube (~50 μl/sample).Load input, immunoprecipitation and markers on a 10% PAG with 4% stacker, 1.5 mm thick, 10 well comb, then run the gel at 100 V for about 2 h (stop when dye is almost at the bottom of the gel).Remove gel from the plates and wash gel twice with ddH2O.Stain the gel in Bio-Rad safe stain solution for 1 h while gently rotating on an orbital shaker.",
    "Replace the stain and incubate for a further 20 min while gently rotating on an orbital shaker.Remove gel from stain and put in a fresh container then add water to destain, refresh the water 2-4 times over 1 h.Carefully place the gel on two layers of 3 mm paper, cover with glad wrap and dry using a Bio-Rad gel drier at 80 °C for ~2 h (till no longer sticky).Place gel by the phosphoimager screen overnight then analyze with the Typhoon Trio.Quantitate the bands using the Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics)."
