    "The reaction mixture contains 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM fructose, 1 mM ATP, 100 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 0.5 mM freshly prepared NADH, 0.2 µl Pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (PK/LDH) enzymes (stored at -20 °C before use), and 1 to 10 µg of purified recombinant enzyme, in a volume of 100 µl. Blank corresponds to reaction mixture where substrate is substituted by MilliQ water (Table 1).Table 1.

    "The continuous assay reaction is started by adding the substrate, and activity is assayed by following changes in absorbance at 340 nm which corresponds to the conversion of NADH to NAD+, in a Safire2 UV spectrophotometer microplate reader. The assay is performed at 25 °C for up to 20 min. Only the early linear part of the curves is used to calculate activity (Figure 2).Calculate the consumption of NADH using the formula:[(ΔA340nm test-ΔA340nm blank)/(t*6220*0.3*0.0001)] WhereΔA340nm= variation of absorbance during the duration of incubation t=duration of incubation (min)6220= extinction coefficient for NADH (L mol-1 cm-1)0.3= optical path (cm)0.0001= assay volume (L)The rate of decrease of NADH is directly proportional to the rate of formation of lactate and thus to the FK activity. One unit (U) of FK activity corresponds to 1 µmol of NADH oxidized per min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151030/20151030215445_8429.jpgFigure 2. Early linear parts of curves representing changes in absorbance (340 nm) monitored as a function of time (sec) in presence of fructose. The curves represent two series of triplicates at 0 and 5 mM of fructose, respectively.To calculate specific activities, divide the value obtained in the equation above by the quantity of ZgFK proteins present in the sample. Perform three replicates for each assay and determine the average ± S.E. (cf. Notes) of these three replicates. This applies also to the experiments described below. As an example, typical value for specific activity of ZgFK was 0.49 U/mg in presence of 5 mM fructose.To determine substrate specificity, assess ZgFK activity in presence of each of the substrates listed in the “Materials and Reagents” section, using concentration ranging from 1 mM to at least 100 mM.To determine the optimal pH, replace the 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer used in step 1 of the procedure by other buffers prepared at different pHs.",
    "As an indication, it is possible to use:100 mM MES for pH 5.5, 6, 6.5100 mM Bis-Tris propane for pH 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5100 mM Tris-HCl for pH 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9To determine the optimal temperature, incubate the reaction mixtures described in step 1 at temperatures ranging, for instance, from 10 °C to 50 °C, with incremental of 5 or 10 °C.To examine the influence of NaCl, add in the reaction mixture described in step 1 sodium chloride to obtain final concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 M.To estimate the kinetic parameters of the enzyme for a selected substrate S, run individual enzyme reactions in presence of at least five different concentrations of this substrate and a fixed concentration of ATP. Determine the initial reaction rate for each reaction and plot 1/V versus 1/[S] to obtain a Lineweaver-Burk plot, from which Km and Vm for S can be calculated.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151030/20151030215514_5626.jpgFigure 3. Lineweaver-Burk plot used to determine the Km (10 mM) and Vm (2.55 U/mg) of ZgFK for fructose. [S] is the fructose concentration (in mM) and V is the reaction rate (in µmol/min/mg of protein)."
