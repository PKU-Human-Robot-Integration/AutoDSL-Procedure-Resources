  "procedures": [
    "The current protocol followed the Guide for United States Public Health Service's Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Fourth Military Medical University approved the protocol.\n1. Animals\nDivide 24 Sprague-Dawley rats (4-8 weeks old) into two groups. Produce complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model by intraplantar injection of 100 μL of CFA in one group of 14 rats and another group of 10 rats by treatment with saline.\n\tNOTE: All of the animals were acquired from the Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University. Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g) were used for all procedures, and rats were randomly assigned to cages. Two rats were housed per cage under a 12-/12-hour light/dark cycle at a constant temperature (25 ± 1 °C) with free access to food and water.\n2. In Vivo Single-fiber Recording\nPrepare and disinfect all surgical instruments (scalpel, tweezers, ophthalmic scissors, shearing scissors, glass separating needle, suture needle, bone rongeur) prior to surgery. Prepare 1 L or 2 L of normal Ringer’s extracellular solution (in mM: NaCl 124, KCl 3, MgSO4 1.3, CaCl2 2, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1.25, glucose 15; pH 7.4 and 305 mOsm). Store at 4 °C until use.\nAnesthetize rats. On days 3 to 7 after CFA injection, use intraperitoneal injection of a mixed solution (1% chloralose and 17% urethane, 5 mL/kg body weight) to keep the animals in a stable aesthetic condition during the experiment. Apply supplementary injection of anesthetics, if necessary, after checking pupils and the response to pain stimulation. Monitor and maintain a body temperature near 37 °C.\nExposure of sciatic nerve trunk for recording",
    "Cut open the skin and muscle on the dorsal part of the thigh. Perform a blunt dissection along femoral biceps. Carefully isolate the sciatic nerve trunk using ophthalmic scissors and a glass separation needle. Keep the tissue wet using Ringer's solution.\nFix the animal on a homemade metal hoop (3 cm long, 2 mm wide metal hoop with an iron wire 1 mm in diameter) via sewing the skin into the slot around it. Pull the skin up slightly so as to establish a fluid bath.\nExpose 1 cm of sciatic nerve trunk at the proximal side. Place a small brown platform under the nerve trunk to enhance the contrast and observe the fine nerve trunk clearly. Heat liquid paraffin in a water bath to 37 °C and drop it on the top of the nerve trunk to prevent drying of the surface of the fiber. Remove the pia mater spinalis and dura mater around the sciatic nerve.\nRecording session\nSelect a platinum filament (29 μm in diameter) as the recording electrode. Heat over for easier molding, and create a small hook at the very end. Attach the electrode to a micromanipulator to move the electrode as required.\nIn the bath, place a reference electrode in adjacent subcutaneous tissue. Split the spinal dura and the pia mater. Separate the sciatic nerve into a single fiber (15-20 μm in diameter) in the recording pool. Then, pick up a fine fascicle of axon and suspend the proximal end of the axon on the hook of the recording electrode under a stereoscope at 25x magnification.\nNOTE: The just-dissected filaments tend to be thicker and require further separation until a single unit may be recorded.",
    "Identify the receptive field of a single nociceptive C-fiber using a mechanical stimulus (Von Frey hairs) and thermal stimulus (small cotton ball with 50-55 °C water). Briefly, if the firing of nerve fiber respond to the mechanical stimuli and hot water, then consider it as a polymodal nociceptive C-fiber4. Next, insert two needle stimulus electrodes (2 mm interval) into the skin of the identified field for the delivery of electrical stimuli.\nDisplay the waveform of an action potential on oscilloscope and employ a computer A/D board with a signal sampling rate of 20 kHz to amplify and record the spikes.\nCollect data using data acquisition software (Table of Materials). Save data on a computer and analyze later with professional software (Table of Materials).\n3. Measurement of Conduction Failure\nDeliver the repetitive electrical stimuli (0.8 ms duration, 1.5x threshold intensity) in different frequencies (2 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz) to a C-fiber for 60 s4,8,9. Allow a 10 min interval for fiber to relax between stimuli. Calculate the ratio of the number of failures to the number of delivered repetitive stimulus pulses and multiply by 100% to obtain the degree of conduction failure.\n4. Preparation of Iintact DRG Attached with Sciatic Nerve\nPrepare surgical tools and Ringer's extracellular solution as described in step 2.1.\nSeparate the DRG with the attached sciatic nerve.\nAnesthetize the rats as described in step 2.2 (On days 3 to 7 after CFA injection). Cut the hair on back and leg with shearing scissors, and sterilize the skin with tincture of iodine.",
    "For DRG exposure, first cut open the skin from the midline of the back at the L4 to L5 segment level. Remove muscles, the process of spine, vertebra board, and transverse process using a bone rongeur to expose the spinal cord and DRG body. Cover the exposed spinal cord and DRG with cottons infiltrated by normal Ringer's extracellular solution to maintain neural activity. Stop the bleeding and clear the blood in time.\nExpose the sciatic nerve from two directions: remove the L4 to S1 bone structure above the vertebral foramen using ophthalmic scissors to expose the spinal nerve connected to DRG which is at the proximal end of sciatic nerve. Cut open the skin to expose the sciatic nerve at the middle thigh. Separate and disconnect the sciatic nerve from the distal end of the nerve where it goes inside the muscle, and ligate the nerve trunk with surgical line at the end of the nerve prior to cutting.\nSeparate the sciatic nerve from the underlying connective tissue using ophthalmic scissors via lifting of the nerve ligation point. Remove the dura from the spinal cord and separate the DRG from the underlying connective tissue via lifting the dorsal root until it reaches the adjacent part of the sciatic nerve. Thus, isolate the whole preparation of DRG with an attached sciatic nerve.\nClear the surface of the DRG.\nCarefully remove the spinal dura on the surfaces of L4−L6 DRG using tweezers under a stereoscope at 4x magnification.\nPlace the DRG with attached sciatic nerve in a glass tube containing 1 mL of mixed enzymes (0.2% proteinase and 0.32% collagenase) and digest in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min (blow slightly with a plastic dropper at an interval of 5 min).",
    "Lift the end of the ligation line and move the preparation to a dish filled with a normal Ringer's extracellular solution to wash out the enzyme. Then transfer the digested DRG to a container (Figure 1A) filled with oxygenated Ringer's extracellular solution for recording.\nRecording session\nPrepare intracellular solution (in mM: potassium gluconate 120, KCl 18, MgCl2 2, ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid [EGTA] 5, HEPES 10, Na2-ATP 5, Na-GTP 0.4, CaCl2 1; pH 7.2 and 300 mOsm). Keep at 0 °C until use.\nStabilize ganglia using a slice anchor and connect nerve end to a suction-stimulating electrode (Figure 1A). Visualize and select a DRG neuron with a water-immersion objective at 40x magnification.\nPull an electrode (Table of Materials) and fill it with intracellular solution. Insert electrode on holder and apply positive pressure in the pipette with a final resistance of 4-7 MΩ.\nBring electrode close to the cell and touch it. Give a negative pressure in the pipette, once GΩ seal is reached, set the membrane potential at about -60 mV and then establish whole-cell recording mode.\nDeliver repetitive stimuli of 5-50 Hz to the sciatic nerve through the suction electrode to screen for conduction failure. Measure the amplitude of afterhyperpolarization potential (AHP) from baseline to peak, and the 80% AHP duration.\nNOTE: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; for more than two groups) or Student’s t-test (for only two groups) was used to analyze the data. Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The statistical significant level was set at p < 0.05.\nEnding the Experiment\n​When the experimental task is finished while the rats are still under anaesthetic situation, rats are humanely euthanized with a intracardiac injections of overdose pentobarbital sodium. \nSubscription Required.
