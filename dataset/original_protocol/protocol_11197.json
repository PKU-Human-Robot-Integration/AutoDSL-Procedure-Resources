  "procedures": [
    "Fresh frozen glioma samples were obtained from the National Center for Tumor diseases (NCT)-tissue bank in Heidelberg, Germany. The use of patient material was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg, and informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study.\n1. Experimental preparation\nPerform all steps on ice or at 4 °C.\nPre-chill tubes, dishes, razor blades, Douncers and pestles to 4 °C.\nPrepare all buffers in advance. These buffers are stable at room temperature. Sterile filtration is recommended, especially for sucrose. The stock preparations are modified from Corces et al.19. See Tables 1-7.\nRemove samples from liquid nitrogen or -80 °C freezer storage and keep on dry ice until Step 2.1.\n2. Tissue dissection and dissociation\nTransfer fresh frozen tissue sample (10-60 mg) to a pre-chilled Petri dish. Mince/chop fresh frozen tissue with a razor blade to small pieces on ice.\nAdd 500 µL of chilled nuclei lysis buffer to a pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube. Place the tissue pieces in the 1.5 mL tube containing the nuclei lysis buffer, and transfer to a Douncer (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: There are two Dounce homogenizer pestles: “loose” or “A” pestle for initial sample reduction and “tight” or “B” pestle for complete sample homogenization.\nDounce the tissue pieces with the “loose” pestle for about 20 strokes, until friction is reduced. If debris is present, the sample may be pre-cleared by filtration with a 100 mm strainer.\nDounce with the “tight” pestle for 20 strokes to achieve complete tissue homogenization.\nTransfer the homogenate (about 500 µL) into a pre-chilled 2 mL tube. Add 1 mL of chilled lysis buffer. Mix gently and incubate on ice for 5 min. Gently mix with a wide-bore pipette tip and repeat 1-2 times during the incubation.",
    "Filter the entire homogenate using a 30 µm strainer mesh, collect into a 15 mL Falcon tube and transfer back into a new pre-chilled 2 mL tube. A single strainer is typically sufficient for the entire homogenate.\nCheck under a light microscope to verify the removal of large debris and the intactness of the nuclear membrane. Nuclei need to be round and the nuclear membrane should not be distorted. If debris is present, nuclei can be re-filtered.\nCentrifuge the nuclei at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C on a bench top centrifuge. Remove the supernatant, leaving behind ~50 µL with pellet containing the nuclei. Gently resuspend the pellet in another 1 mL of nuclei lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min on ice.\nCentrifuge the nuclei at 500 x g for 5 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant without disturbing pellet, add 500 mL of 1x homogenization buffer (HB) (Table 4) and incubate for 5 min without resuspending. Then, resuspend the nuclei in another 1.0 mL of 1x HB.\nCentrifuge the nuclei at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and gently resuspend the nuclei in 200 µL of 1x HB into a new 2.0 mL tube.\n3. Gradient centrifugation\nAdd 200 µL of 50% iodixanol solution (Table 5) to give a final concentration of 25% iodixanol. Mix well 10 times with pipette set on 300 mL.\nAdd 300 µL of 29% iodixanol solution (Table 6) under the 25% mixture. Use a P1000 fine tip to avoid mixture of the layers.\nAdd 300 µl of 35% Iodixanol solution (Table 7) under the 29% mixture. Use a P1000 fine tip to avoid mixture of the layers.\n\tCaution: This step requires gradual removal of the pipette tip during pipetting to avoid excessive volume displacement.",
    "Place the samples in a swinging bucket centrifuge, spin for 20 min at 3,500 x g at 4°C with the brake off.\nGently remove the samples without shaking and observe under light. A clear white band of 95% pure nuclei should be visible between the second and third layer (Figure 1).\n4. Isolation of nuclei\nAspirate the top layers until the white nuclei band at the interphase of 29%-35%.\nCollect the nuclei band in a 200 mL volume, transfer to a fresh tube and filter with a 20 µm filter (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The nuclei do not need to be resuspended prior to filtration.\nCheck under a light microscope to verify the removal of large debris and the intactness of the nuclear membrane. Nuclei need to be round and the nuclear membrane should not be distorted.\nCount nuclei using Trypan blue staining on a hemocytometer and aliquot nuclei for snRNA-seq/snATAC-seq.\n5. Single nuclei RNA and ATAC seq\nImmediately process the nuclei using the single cell gene expression and single cell ATAC reagent kits (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The nuclei sample concentrations for the 10x Genomics system are 1500-3000 nuclei per µL for snRNA-seq, and 3500-7000 nuclei per m µL for snATAC-seq. The nuclei can be diluted using 1x PBS.\nSequence the resulting libraries at the Genomics Core Facility.\nPerform quality control analysis of the data. Nuclei are included for further analysis if they contain Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) >1000, number of genes >500 and percent of mitochondrial genes <5%, and are within mean + three standard deviations of the UMIs and genes.\nSubscription Required.
