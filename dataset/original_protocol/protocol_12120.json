    "The collection of patient material and derivation of hiPS cells is approved by the Ethics Review Board, Stockholm, March 28, 2012, Registration number: 2012/208-31/3. Cell culture steps should be performed in biosafety cabinets unless otherwise mentioned. Always practice sterile handling techniques when working with cells. Allow media, plates and reagents to reach room temperature before starting. Incubate cells at 37 ᵒC, 5% CO2 in high humidity.\n1. Isolation of Human Fibroblasts from Dermal Biopsy\nPreparations of culture medium, digestive enzymes, coating of dishes and dissecting tools.\nPrepare Fibroblast medium: 44.5 mL Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), 5 mL Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 500 µL penicillin/streptomycin (PEST) (see Table 1), store at 4 °C.\nPrepare digestive enzymes at a working concentration of 1 mg/mL: weigh aliquots of 4 mg of dispase and collagenase type I powder in separate 15-mL tubes and dissolve in 4 mL of DMEM/F12 + 1% PEST. Sterilize the enzymatic solution by passing it through a 0.22 µm strainer. Prepare fresh enzyme solutions every time.\nCoat one well in a 6-well tissue culture plate (or 35-mm tissue culture dish) per biopsy dissected with 1 mL of 0.1% gelatin in phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nAutoclave one set of surgical scissors and forceps per biopsy for dissection.\nBiopsy handling\n\tNOTE: Process biopsies as fast as possible after being taken. Store in PBS + 1% PEST for up to 48 h at 4 °C. Biopsy should be 2 - 4 mm in diameter in size and in accordance with ethical permits.\n\t\nTransfer the biopsy into a 35-mm dish. Move the biopsy to a new 35-mm dish and submerge the biopsy in 2 mL of 70% ethanol for 30 s.",
    "Move the biopsy to a third 35-mm dish and wash with 1 mL of sterile Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 1% PEST.\nTransfer the biopsy to a fourth 35-mm dish, add 1 mL of freshly prepared 0.1% dispase solution.\nCut the skin biopsy into 1 - 2 mm3 pieces in the dish using surgical scissors and forceps and then transfer biopsy pieces including the dispase solution into a 15-mL tube. Add an additional 2 mL of dispase.\nRinse the 35-mm dish with a 1 mL dispase solution and transfer to the 15-mL tube.\nIncubate the biopsy at 4 °C overnight.\nAdd 4 mL of 0.1% collagenase I to the tube and incubate at 37 °C for 4 h.\nCentrifuge the digested cells 300 x g for 3 min, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the digest in 2 mL of fibroblast medium.\nRemove the gelatin solution from the 6-well tissue culture plate. Transfer the cell suspension including any remaining pieces to 6-well tissue culture plate (or 35-mm tissue culture dish) precoated with 0.1% gelatin in DPBS.\nChange medium every third day.\nExpansion of human fibroblasts\n\tNOTE: Fibroblasts are ready to be passaged to a T25 (25 cm2) tissue culture flask when 80% confluent (Figure 2B). Fibroblasts typically reach 80% confluency within 7 days. However, time required can vary greatly but should be no longer than 4 weeks.\n\t\nAspirate medium and wash once with 2.5 mL of DPBS.\nRemove DPBS and add 1 mL of Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min or until cells display rounded edges and start to detach.\nAdd 2 mL of fibroblast medium, if necessary rinse the cells ensuring proper disassociation of cells. Transfer the cell solution to a 15-mL tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min.",
    "Discard supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of fibroblast medium and plate fibroblasts in a non-coated cell tissue culture T25 flask. When expanding fibroblasts after this step, dissociate as described above and seed 12 x 103 cells/cm2.\nOnce confluent cells are ready to be frozen, expand or plate for reprogramming. Freeze down two rounds of fibroblast before any reprogramming is started (refer to next section for freezing procedure). Reprogramming efficiency is generally higher for lower passage fibroblasts, cells at passage 2 - 4 is optimal. However, successful reprogramming of fibroblasts up to passage 10 has been conducted using this protocol.\nFreezing and thawing of fibroblasts\nPrepare fresh fibroblast freezing medium: 90% FBS + 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Keep at 4 °C (Table 1). Once confluent, the T25 tissue culture flask can be frozen into three cryovials. Prepare 500 µL of fibroblast freezing medium per vial frozen.\nTo freeze cells, dissociate cells as described in Step 1.3, count cells using a hemocytometer and transfer portions of 3 x 105 cells to 15-mL tubes. Spin tubes at 300 x g for 3 min. Aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellets in 500 µL of 4 ˚C fibroblast freezing medium and transfer into cryovials. Place the vials in a freezing container and incubate cells at -80 °C for 24 h before transferring them to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.\nTo thaw the cells, submerge the bottom part of the cryovial in 37 °C water. Once liquefied, transfer the cell-suspension to a 15-mL tube and add 5 mL of fibroblast medium. Spin cells 300 x g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of fibroblast medium. Transfer cells to a non-coated T25 tissue culture flask and incubate in 37 °C.\n2. SeV Vector Reprogramming of Fibroblasts",
    "Preparation of vector aliquots\n\tCAUTION: Handle the SeV under biosafety level 2 containment. Refer to manufacturer's protocol and local guidelines17. Virus titer varies between batches.\n\t\nBefore preparing aliquots calculate the amount of vector needed for 5 x 104 cells according to manufacturer's protocol (e.g., CytoTune 2.0). The virus titer generally varies from 8 x 107 - 1.5 x 108. Thaw and combine vectors 5:5:3 (KOS MOI = 5, hc-myc MOI = 5 and hKlf4 = MOI 3). Portion the amount calculated for the reprogramming of 5 x 104 cells into autoclaved 1.5 mL tubes. Dilute virus aliquots with fibroblast medium to a final volume of 250 µL for reprogramming.\n\t\tNOTE: Each vial is valid for reprogramming of one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate with 5 x 104 fibroblasts. Store virus aliquots at -80 °C.\nSeV Vector transduction\nAspirate cell culture medium and wash with 1 mL of DPBS. Aspirate DPBS and add 1 mL of Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%). Incubate at 37 °C for 5 min or until cells are detached.\nAdd 2 mL of fibroblast medium and resuspend the cells and transfer to a 15-mL tube. Centrifuge 300 x g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of fibroblast medium.\nCount fibroblasts by using a hemocytometer and seed 5 x 104 cells in one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. Incubate cells at 37 °C overnight.\nAspirate cell culture medium, add 250 µL of the SeV solution and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nChange medium daily to fresh fibroblast medium. Allow transduced cells to grow for 7 days before being passaged to LN-521 coated plates. Prepare LN-521 plates the day before passage. Refer to 2.3.1 for coating procedure.\nReplating of transduced fibroblasts",
    "Preparation of LN-521 coated dishes: Dilute LN-521 in DPBS to a final concentration of 0.63 µg/cm2. Pipette 2 mL of the LN-521 solution per 60-mm tissue culture dish. Seal the 60-mm tissue culture dish using parafilm. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nPrepare Essential 8 medium (E8) aliquots for easier handling: 48.5 mL of E8 medium, 1 mL of E8 supplement and 500 µL of PEST (Table 1).\n7 days after transduction, passage the cells to a LN-521 coated 60 mm tissue culture dish. Add 250 µL of Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min or until cells have detached. Add 2 mL of fibroblast medium and centrifuge cells for 3 min at 300 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant. Resuspend pellet in 2 mL of fibroblast medium and count cells in a hemocytometer. Aspirate LN-521 solution from the precoated plate and seed 4 x 104 cells in 5ml of fibroblast medium in the LN-521 precoated 60 mm dish. Add Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (ROCKi) to a final concentration of 5 µM. Incubate in 37 °C overnight.\nImportantly, the next day, change medium to E8 medium. Change E8 medium daily. hiPS cell colonies will emerge within 2 - 3 weeks.\n3. Picking of Colonies and Expansion of hiPS Cells\nNOTE: The following steps are done outside of the biosafety cabinet under a stereo microscope. The use of hairnet and procedure masks are recommended. Work carefully not to contaminate the cell culture.\nPrepare LN-521 coated tissue culture 24-well plates the day before picking. Dilute LN-521 in DPBS 0.63 µg/cm2. Pipette 250 µL of the LN-521 solution into one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. Seal plates using parafilm. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Colonies are ready to be picked when they reach a size > 1 mm in diameter. Colonies should display sharp edges and grow in homogeneous monolayers (Figure 2D).\nAspirate the LN-521 solution and add 500 µL of E8 into one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate.\nCut colonies into smaller pieces with a scalpel in a grid like pattern under a stereomicroscope. Mechanically scrape the cell sheets from the dish and transfer the sheets using a 200 µL pipette to the prepared well (Figure 2D-2E). Pick colonies into separate wells.\nAllow cells to attach without changing medium for 48 h. Thereafter, change E8 medium daily.\nWhen the colonies have reached a size of > 5 mm, enzymatically passage cells as single cells to a new well of a LN-521 coated plate.\nAspirate the cell culture medium from cells and wash with 250 µL of DPBS.\nAspirate DPBS. Add 250 µL of dissociation reagent and incubate for 3 min at 37 °C.\nObserve that the cells have started to round up. Detach cells from the plate by rinsing the cells with dissociation reagent a few times.\nAdd 500 µL of E8 medium to a 15-mL tube. Transfer the cells in the dissociation reagent to the tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 300 x g.\nAspirate the LN-521 solution from the LN-521 precoated well and add 500 µL room temperature E8 medium.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of E8 medium.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and seed 2.5 x 104 - 5 x 104 cells in the prepared LN-521 precoated well (1.25 x 104 -  2.5 x 104 cells/cm2). Cell culture format can easily be upscaled to suit the intended purpose.",
    "Add ROCKi to a final concentration of 10 µM. Incubate cells at 37 °C.\nChange E8 medium daily. Cells are usually ready to passage after 4 - 6 days. Enzymatically passage cells as single cells as described above when about 90% confluent.\n\tNOTE: The reprogramming vectors are progressively diluted during hiPS cell expansion and not detectable after passage 12. Cells that are impartially reprogrammed commonly cease to proliferate around passage 6 - 10 or lose their characteristic pluripotent stem cell morphology (Figure 3B).\nFreezing and thawing of hiPS cells\nTo freeze cells, enzymatically dissociate cells as single cells as described above, count cells in a hemocytometer and transfer 2.5 x 105 cells to a 15-mL tube containing 1 mL of E8 medium. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 250 µL of 4 °C PSC cryomedium and transfer to a cryovial. Place the vial in a freezing container and incubate cells at -80 °C for 24 h before transferring them to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.\nTo thaw cells, prepare a precoated LN-521 well of a 24-well tissue culture plate by aspirating the LN-521 solution and adding 250 µL of E8 medium. Submerge the bottom part of the cryovial in 37 °C water until only a small icicle remains.\nAdd 250 µL of E8 Medium to the cryovial and transfer the cell-suspension to a 15-mL tube and add 1 mL of E8 medium. Spin cells 300 x g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 250 µL of room temperature E8 medium.
