    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn vivo imaging\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes the procedure of in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. At least two separate image sets will be saved: an image time series containing calcium activities for in vivo function characterization and a static 3D imaging volume for in vivo to in vitro co-registration.\nAfter the animal is fully recovered from surgery and habituated to the imaging setup, capture a widefield image showing the surface vasculature pattern of the entire cranial window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: Since this vasculature pattern is relatively stable overtime, this “zoomed-out” widefield image can be captured on a different day from the two-photon imaging session.\nBefore a two-photon imaging session, thaw and inject 30 μL of diluted dextran solution (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) subcutaneously under skin on the back without anesthesia, using a syringe with 31G needle. Blood vessel labeling will appear within 5 min and last for at least two hours.\nPerform functional two-photon calcium imaging of the cortical structures of interest. This should be specific to each research group. In our case, for imaging thalamocortical axons:\nZoom and resolution: 180 μm × 180 μm field of view, 0.35 μm × 0.35 μm per pixel (for imaging cell soma, a larger field of view and lower resolution can be used).\nExcitation: 920 nm.\nEmission filter for GCaMP: 470–588 nm.\nEmission filter for dextran-Texas Red: 600–722 nm.\nObjective: Nikon 16× 0.8NA.\nCritical: After functional imaging, without moving the objective XY position, record a two-photon z-stack with both GCaMP and dextran channels. The 3D vasculature pattern and structures of interest should be visible in this stack.\nZoom: same as functional image.\nStarting depth: ∼10 μm above highest point of pia surface.",
    "Ending depth: 500 μm below pia surface or 100 μm below the structure of interest.\nZ-Step depth: 4 μm.\nAverage 100 frames per step.\nOptional: Without moving the objective XY position, record a surface two-photon z-stack in both channels with the largest field of view.\nZoom: allowing the largest field of view (716 μm × 716 μm with 1.4 μm resolution on our setup).\nStarting depth: ∼10 μm above highest point of pia surface.\nEnding depth: 100 μm below pia surface.\nZ-Step depth: 10 μm.\nAverage 100 frames per step.\nSave the mean projection of the stack as two-photon surface vasculature pattern.\nOptional: Without moving the objective XY position, record a local widefield surface vasculature stack through the same objective (if this has larger field of view than the two-photon field of view).\nStarting depth: ∼10 μm above highest point of pia surface.\nEnding depth: where the surface vasculature pattern is defocused.\nZ-Step depth: 10 μm.\n1 image per step.\nSave the mean projection of the stack as local wide-field surface vasculature pattern.\nNote: Steps 1–6 can be repeated in multiple sessions/days to either image the same structures repeatedly (by aligning two-photon field of view) or image different structures at different locations. For each two-photon field of view, a corresponding two-photon z-stack (step 4), two-photon surface z-stack (step 5), and a local widefield surface stack (step 6) should be recorded.\nNote: The two-photon surface vasculature pattern and the local wide-field surface vasculature pattern recorded in steps 5 and 6, respectively, can aid the alignment with ex vivo volume when the field of view of functional imaging is small and does not contain enough structural information for alignment.\nPerfusion and tissue fixation\nTiming: 1 h",
    "After two-photon imaging was concluded, a standard transcardial perfusion was performed to fix brain tissue. Since this procedure is standard and has been documented (Gage et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Wu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), it is only described briefly here.\nUnder isoflurane (initial: 5%, maintain: 3%) anesthesia, expose thoracic cavity.\nInsert the blunt perfusion needle (which is attached to a peristaltic pump, Harvard Apparatus, MA1-55-7766) into the left ventricle directing the tip of the needle toward the aorta.\nPerfuse 10 mL saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride) using the peristaltic pump through the circulatory system at a flow rate of 9 mL/min or until the liver is clear.\nPerfuse 50 mL freshly prepared 4% PFA (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) at a flow rate of 9 mL/min.\nExtract the brain and immerse it in 4% PFA at 20°C–25°C for 3–6 h and then at 4°C for 12–24 h.\nAfter fixation, immerse the brain in 1× PBS with 0.01% sodium azide (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) at 4°C in the dark for long term storage (up to one year). This can be a pause point.\nHistology: Sectioning\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "A vibratome (Leica VT1000 S) was used to section the brain tangential to the area that was flattened under the cranial window. It is crucial to preserve the top 350 μm–400 μm of cortex including the pial surface in one intact section (due to the shrinkage effect from PFA and the compression by the glass cranial window, we found, this depth range incorporates almost the entire cortical depth within the 5 mm cranial window over visual cortex, Zhuang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16], please see Problem #5 in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for more discussion). Typically, during vibratome sectioning, the blade is automatically lowered at a set interval and slices through an agarose block until it begins to section the embedded tissue. This method would result in an unknown thickness for the first crucial section. To avoid this, the blade must be aligned as closely as possible to the surface of cortex before the first section is cut. The following steps describe this process. The resulting section of cortex will be preserved in its flattened state to aid the alignment with in vivo images.\nTake the fixed brain out of PBS + 0.01% sodium azide (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and gently press the flattened area of cortex facing down against a clean glass slide.\nCritical: The flattened area must be fully in contact with the glass.\nPlace a metal ring around the brain and rest it on top of the glass slide to create a mold. Carefully pour warmed liquid agarose (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) in the mold to embed the brain. The agarose should be filled to the top of the mold to prevent unevenness and bubbles.",
    "Critical: Special care should be taken to ensure the cortical surface is flat against the glass slide. It is possible the brain may move out of position if the agarose is not poured carefully.\nCritical: When embedding the brain, ensure that the agarose has cooled to approximately 40°C to avoid causing tissue damage.\nBefore the agarose hardens, place another glass slide on top of the metal ring so both ends of agarose block will have a level and flat surface. Place a weight (100 g or similar) on top of this slide to make sure it stays in contact with the metal ring and the agarose. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1663-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Photos taken to demonstrate the tissue processing steps\n(A) The brain is placed inside a metal ring on a glass slide (with the flat part of cortex facing down), and the ring is then filled with agarose. An additional glass slide is placed on top, followed by a weight to hold it in place. This helps ensure that the top and bottom of the solidified agar block will be flat and parallel.\n(B and C) (B) The agarose is solidified, and the block is ready to be removed. It is gently pushed out of the ring and onto a glass slide, as shown in image (C).\n(D) Agarose on one side is trimmed away, and the block is then glued to the vibratome stage with the trimmed side facing the blade.\n(E) A section with thickness no less than 350 μm is cut.\n(F) The flat tangential thick section is ready for staining.\n(G) A mounted uncleared section (top) and a mounted cleared section (bottom). White arrow: spacer for making a well to accommodate tissue thickness. Black arrow: cleared section. Scale bar: 0.5 inch.",
    "Critical: The top and bottom of agarose block must be as flat and parallel as possible so the sections can be cut evenly on the vibratome.\nWait about ∼10–15 min for the agarose to cool to 20°C–25°C (or sufficiently hardened) and remove the agarose cylinder with the embedded brain from the mold. (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nTrim off one round edge of the resulting agarose cylinder with a razor blade on the side where the cutting would begin, so that the vibratome blade approaches parallel to the trimmed edge. This will make it easier to see that the vibratome blade is aligned with the top surface of the block in later steps. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nPosition the agarose cylinder so the flat cortex side is facing up and the trimmed side is facing the blade. Affix the agarose to the vibratome stage with a thin layer of super glue. Fill the chamber with PBS just below the surface of the agarose cylinder. This makes it possible to see the blade and top of the agarose cylinder clearly for alignment.\nSet the blade advancing speed at 0.21 mm/s and the blade vibration frequency at 90 Hz. Set cutting depth to a small increment such as 50 μm and, with the blade above the agarose block, slowly lower the blade step by step. When the blade is barely cutting agarose across the full width of the cylinder, STOP the blade BEFORE it reaches the brain tissue. This will be the zero position where sectioning will begin.",
    "Critical: If the blade makes contact along only part of the width of the cylinder, reverse the blade, lower, and repeat until the full width of the cylinder contacts the blade. If the blade is not cutting across the full width of the agarose at the zero position, it means the zero position may be too high and the first brain section may be thinner than desired.\nCritical: The purpose of this step is to carefully align the blade to the top surface of the agarose block (hence the cortical surface). The agarose block should only be barely touched, and the brain tissue should NOT be touched by the blade in this step.\nFrom the zero position, with the blade fully retracted, lower the blade to the desired depth, e.g., 350 μm. Fill the chamber with more PBS so the agarose is completely submerged and cut the first brain section. We find that a relatively thick slice of tissue (∼350–400 μm) will ensure a complete first section that encompasses the entire surface under the cranial window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nOptional: Check the thickness of the section by placing it on a glass slide and imaging it on a microscope with z measurement. The thickness can be measured as the depth difference in the focal planes between the surface of the section and the surface of the glass slide.\nHistology: Staining and clearing\nTiming: 1 week\nIn this step, the endogenous fluorescence will be enhanced using standard immunohistochemistry. During the staining procedure, lectin conjugated dye will also be used to label blood vessels in a different wavelength. After staining, the tissue will be cleared before mounting to facilitate ex vivo imaging.\nAntigen retrieval (optional)",
    "Place tangential sections into 8% SDS in PBS (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) at 37°C on a shaker for two days, then rinse in PBS 5 times for 5 min each. This step will increase antibody binding by exposing more epitopes, but will cause some tissue degradation. In our preparation, it had only a small effect on the results. Skip this step if the tissue to be stained is delicate.\nImmunohistochemistry and blood vessel labeling\nRinse: If the optional antigen retrieval step was not performed, rinse sections on a shaker in PBS 5 times for 5 min each.\nBlocking: Place tissue in blocking buffer NDSTU (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) on a shaker at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.\nPrimary antibody incubation: Incubate tissue for 2 days on a shaker at 20°C–25°C in primary antibody working solution (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nRinse: On a shaker, rinse the tissue at least 5 times for 5 min each in PBST (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nSecondary antibody incubation: Incubate tissue for 2 days on a shaker at 20°C–25°C in secondary antibody working solution (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nIn this step, the secondary antibody will greatly enhance the endogenous fluorescence of GCaMP in the 488 nm channel and the Lectin 649 will label blood vessels in the 649 nm channel.\nRinse: On a shaker, rinse 5 times for 5 min in PBST (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]), then 5 times for 5 min in PBS.\nNote: We found that adding 4 M urea to our staining buffer (NDSTU, materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) helped with penetration of antibody labeling of the thick (>350 μm) sections.\nNote: We found the labeling quality of lectin to be temperature sensitive, with 20°C–25°C providing satisfactory staining.\nClearing",
    "Place the tissue into CUBIC-1 (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) solution for ∼30 min at 20°C–25°C. Use this solution for the following mounting step. Do not rinse the tissue in between clearing and mounting.\nNote: We found the CUBIC clearing crucial for the image quality of confocal imaging. Specifically, it greatly reduces the scattering in deep tissue (>100 μm below the section surface). Without CUBIC clearing, the image quality at the bottom half of the section will not be good enough for extracting spatial information even with increased laser power.\nMounting\nCreate a chamber for the section by stacking spacers (SunJin Labs, iSpacer, thickness: 150 μm #IS101 or 200 μm #IS001) on a glass slide (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 71867-01) up to an appropriate height, e.g., 350 μm or 400 μm.\nMount the section and fill the chamber with 100 μL CUBIC-1 solution (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) solution.\nApply a cover glass (VWR, 16004-332) on top of the chamber (start from one side and slowly lower it toward the other side, avoid creating any bubbles).\nSeal the edges with clear nail polish (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 72180). The cleared and mounted section and its uncleared comparison are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G.\nNote: The pia surface should be facing up. We recommended mounting the tissue with consistent orientation (e.g., lateral side facing left and medial side facing right). This will aid the procedures listed in “Alignment and co-registration”.\nNote: CUBIC-1 will crystallize overtime. We recommend performing ex vivo imaging within a week.\nEx vivo confocal imaging\nTiming: Hours (depending on the size of image volume)\nWe used an Olympus FV3000 laser scanning confocal microscope, but the section can be imaged by any generic laser scanning confocal microscope with appropriate filter sets and resolution.\nTake a low-resolution, single z-plane overview of the sample using a 4× objective.",
    "Critical: surface blood vessels should be visible in the red channel and can be matched to in vivo widefield surface images.\nXY resolution: 800 × 800 pixels.\nObjective: Lens UPLSAPO 4×, air objective.\nPinhole: maximum.\nSampling speed: 2.0 μs/pixel.\nOptical filter cube: GCaMP: excitation 488 nm, emission: 500–540 nm.

    "Optical filter cube:\nGCaMP: excitation 488 nm, emission: 500–540 nm.\nLectin labeled blood vessels: excitation 640 nm, emission: 650–750 nm.\nPost process (align and stitch) the tiled confocal depth stacks using TeraStitcher (https://abria.github.io/TeraStitcher/[href=https://abria.github.io/TeraStitcher/] Bria and Iannello, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), or other software compatible with the data format.\nAlignment and co-registration\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTransform all surface images and image volumes into standard orientation (e.g., top-down view, top: anterior, bottom: posterior, left: lateral, right: medial).\nCompare the in vivo widefield surface image and the ex vivo confocal surface overview and locate the matching major blood vessels (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D).\nNote: only a subset of blood vessels will be labeled in the confocal image (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B), usually due to damage to the dura/pia during perfusion and tissue handling. However, we found in almost all cases, the labeled surface blood vessels were sufficient for locating the region of interest at coarse scale.\nCompare the in vivo widefield surface image and the in vivo two-photon surface view and locate the two-photon field of view in the widefield surface image (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nThrough the matching widefield surface image and confocal surface image (done in step 38), locate the in vivo two-photon field of view in the ex vivo confocal surface image (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nWith matching surfaces of in vivo two-photon volume and ex vivo confocal volume side by side, slowly move down through the cortical depth in both volumes (color composite with green indicating GCaMP and red indicating blood vessels), keeping track of matching descending blood vessels until the target depth is reached (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1663-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Co-registration of GFP/GCaMP labeled structures between in vivo and ex vivo imaging volumes",
    "(A) Co-registration of cell bodies between in vivo and ex vivo volumes. V1 cortical cells were labeled by injecting SiR-Cre (Ciabatti et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) in Snap25-LSL-F2A-GFP mice. Labeled cortical cells in an in vivo cortical stack (left column) can be matched to the confocal stacks imaged from three continuous tangential sections (right column).\n(B) Co-registration of GCaMP labeled dLGN axons between in vivo and ex vivo volumes. All panels show the same field of view. The images in the second row and the fourth row are the same as images in the first row and the third row, respectively, but with the relevant structures marked by colored outlines. For in vivo two-photon images (left column), the dLGN axons were sparsely labeled with GCaMP and blood vessels were labeled by dextran Texas-Red. For ex vivo confocal images (right column), the GCaMP signal was enhanced by antibody labeling, and blood vessels were labeled by lectin. Labeled blood vessels were used as fiducial landmarks for cross-modality registration (bottom row, red lines). After registration, the same GCaMP positive axons were identified in both the in vivo two-photon images and ex vivo confocal images (second row, green lines). (B) is modified from Zhuang et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] with permission.\nAt the matching location between in vivo and ex vivo volumes, search for corresponding neuronal structures labeled by GCaMP in the green channel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). We found that if matching blood vessels can be identified and followed from surface to the targeted region, given a certain level of labeling sparsity, the corresponding brain structures can be easily identified by their unique shape or distribution pattern with naked eye (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Note: In some cases, the steps in stacks (especially in confocal volume) are too thin to provide enough spatial information, we found it is helpful to generate and compare stepped z projections (e.g., maximum or average z projections of small volumes every 50 μm in depth) which can be achieved in FIJI software (Image → Stacks → Tools → Grouped Z Project).\nOnce the corresponding entity (e.g., soma, spine, or bouton) is found in both volumes, the functional characteristics of the entity can be extracted from in vivo calcium activity recorded by two-photon imaging and the morphology can be reconstructed from the confocal volume (reconstruction procedure not covered in this protocol, but see Zhuang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16])."
