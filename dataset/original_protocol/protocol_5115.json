    "Preparation of fluorescently labeled dsRNAAll steps should be performed using nuclease free reagents.Resuspend the RNA oligos to 100 pmol/μl in nuclease free water. Resolve 1 μl on 20% non-denaturing PAGE (Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), stain with ethidium bromide (2 μl of 10 mg/ml stock in 50 ml running buffer) for 15 min at room temperature and visualize the signal using gel documentation system under UV set.Note: This step is necessary to rule out occasional degradation of the oligo from the source itself.Mix 100 pmole (100 pmole/μl stock) of each oligo in 40 μl annealing buffer, incubate at 95 °C for 30 sec and cool gradually to room temperature.Resolve the annealed oligos in 20% non-denaturing PAGE and excise the band corresponding to the RNA duplex.Transfer the excised bands to a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, mince and soak in 500 µl soaking buffer overnight (16 h) in a flip flop rocker at room temperature.Next day, centrifuge the tubes at 13,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Collect the supernatant into a fresh microcentrifuge tube, add 5 μg glycogen (5 mg/ml stock in water) and 1 ml ice cold absolute ethanol and incubate at -80 °C for 45 min.Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Wash the pellet with 500 μl 75% ethanol, centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Remove 75% ethanol and dry the pellet at room temperature.Note: Be careful while removing the 75% ethanol, pellet may be lost.Dissolve the RNA pellet in 30 µl nuclease-free water and incubate at 55 °C for 10 min.Run 1 μl dsRNA in 20% non-denaturing PAGE. Visualize the fluorescent RNA using the gel documentation system using appropriate setting (6-FAM fluorescent dye setting, excitation: 492 nm, emission: 518 nm).",
    "Quantitate the dsRNA by spectrophotometry using NanoDrop and store in aliquots in RNase free microcentrifuge tubes at -80 °C.Preparation of flag-affinity purified proteinsTransfect 3 μg each of pUNO RdRp-flag and pUNO ORF2-flag plasmids into ten 60 mm plates (each plasmid transfected into 10 plates, not cotransfected), containing Huh7 human hepatoma cells, using Lipofectamine 2000 in 1:1 ratio, following manufacturer’s instructions. Incubate cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. 24 h post-transfection, replace media with 2 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Forty eight hours post transfection, wash the cells with 1x PBS and resuspend in 800 μl IP buffer.Generate a homogenous suspension by repeated pipetting and vortexing, and incubate overnight (16 h) on ice at 4 °C (cold room or fridge).Next day, clarify the lysate by centrifugation at 13,000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min and collect the supernatant into a fresh 1.6 ml RNase free microcentrifuge tube.Add 100 μl of flag agarose beads, incubate on a rocker at 4 °C for 4 h, wash 3 x in 1 ml IP buffer each by centrifuging at 800 x g, 1 min, at 4 °C. Add 200 μl flag peptide (0.2 mg/ml in PBS) and incubate on a rocker for 15 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge at 800 x g, 1 min, at 4 °C and collect the supernatant, which contains the eluted protein.Check an aliquot of the purified protein by Western blotting using octa-probe antibody and silver staining, as mentioned below.Resolve the proteins by 10% SDS-PAGE and transfer onto a PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane.",
    "Block the membrane using 5% skimmed milk in 1x PBS for 45 min at room temperature, incubate overnight (16 h) with 1:1,000 octa-probe primary antibody diluted using 5% skimmed milk in 1x PBST at 4 °C, wash 3 x in PBST, incubate with 1:5,000 anti-rabbit IgG HRPO secondary antibody diluted using 5% skimmed milk in 1x PBST at room temperature, followed by detection of the signal by enhanced chemiluminescence using ‘clarity Western ECL blotting substrate’. Acquire the Images and analyze using a gel documentation system. A single band of approximately 27 kDa should be obtained, as illustrated in Nair et al. (2016).For silver staining, resolve the proteins in 10% SDS-PAGE.Proceed for silver staining using silver stain kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). A major band of approximately 27 kDa (corresponding to the size of the band obtained in Western) should be obtained, as illustrated in Nair et al. (2016). Few additional bands are also detected above 27 kDa, which does not affect the efficiency of the assay in our experience. If expected bands are obtained in Western and silver staining, estimate the respective protein concentration by serial dilutions by Bradford assay and store the protein in single use aliquots at -80 °C.RNA strand displacement assayIncubate 1 pmol dsRNA and 2 µg flag affinity purified HEV helicase protein or ORF2 protein in strand displacement buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. Following order may be followed.table:",

Wash the pellet with 1 ml 75% ethanol and resuspend in 10 µl nuclease free water.Note: Be careful while removing the 75% ethanol, pellet may be lost. Although not necessarily a better alternative, it may be possible to minimize pellet loss by gently pipetting out 75% ethanol instead of directly decanting. Irrespective of whatever handling technique preferred, attention should be given not to disturb the pellet.Heat denature an equal amount of dsRNA containing sample at 95 °C for 10 min.Mix the samples with 10 µl RNA loading dye and resolve in 20% non-denaturing PAGE to differentiate the migration between single strand (ss) RNA and dsRNA.Visualize the fluorescent bands using a gel documentation system."
