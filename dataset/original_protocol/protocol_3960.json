Although we describe here the method to isolate autophagic fractions from murine liver, this method can be adapted for isolation of similar fractions from cultured cells.\nNote: There are no pause points in this method.\nPlace 500 mL of 0.25 M sucrose and PBS on ice.\nBegin by taking two 50 mL FalconTM tubes and filling them with 50 mL of 0.25 M sucrose. To each FalconTM tube, add 500 μL of each protease and phosphatase inhibitor (cocktails 2 and 3) referenced in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. Keep the two 50 mL tubes on ice.\nNote: The 100 ml of 0.25 M sucrose with protease and phosphatase inhibitors made in this step will be used in each step that requires 0.25 M sucrose with inhibitors. The remaining 400 ml of sucrose will be used in the wash and centrifugation steps that require sucrose but not inhibitors.\nFor each sample, we typically pool three livers of mice of any sex or age into one 50 mL FalconTM tube containing 15 mL of 0.25 M sucrose. In the non-obesogenic state, three livers approximately amounts to 3–4 g.\nOnce isolated, livers are gently rinsed in a 50 mL beaker containing ice-cold PBS to remove excess blood.\nNote: In our experience, the PBS perfusion is not required. The removal of excess blood in steps 13 and 16 is sufficient.\nUsing a razor blade, we carefully remove the gallbladder to eliminate contamination of the sample with bile/biliary detergents, and we dice the liver into smaller pieces. The dicing of livers facilitates the homogenization process (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/927-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

In our experience, the lack of inhibitors during this step vastly decreases the protein yield.\nWe homogenize the liver using a WHEATON® SAFE-GRIND® Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) pestle tip, which is ideal for soft tissues such as the liver. We homogenize the samples in 15 mL of 0.25 M sucrose using a wall-mounted electric motor rotating the PTFE pestle tip at maximum speed inside the cold room within a ∼4°C–7°C temperature range (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D–1G). Ten strokes per sample is sufficient. We typically, ensure by eye that there are no clumps or residual pieces of liver. On the other hand, excessive homogenization may rupture the lysosomal fraction.",
    "Note: The goal is to evenly homogenize the livers take caring not to exceed more than 10 strokes to prevent rupturing the autophagosome and lysosome membranes. In the absence of a motorized setup, we advise an empirical approach to first determine the minimum number of strokes required to evenly homogenize livers, while keeping the tissue grinder completely submerged in ice. We visually determine there are no large pieces of liver. These steps are time sensitive hence it is imperative to complete the homogenization process in a timely manner.\nOnce the livers are homogenized, we filter the liver homogenate through a 4×4 2-ply gauze into a clean FalconTM tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H). The steps described below aide in the removal of liver lipids that float to the top of the homogenate.\nPlace the gauze over the top of the 50 mL FalconTM tube and use a clean spatula to create a small dip/cup shape into the gauze. This step will prevent the spillover of the homogenate when poured into the tube.\nPour the homogenate into gauze, which will then passively flow through into the FalconTM tube. Lift the sides of the gauze and use a spatula to secure the sides of the gauze to facilitate filtration.\nRepeat steps a through c until all the liver homogenate has been filtered.\nAfter the entire homogenate flows through the cheese cloth into the FalconTM tube, the cheese cloth is gently squeezed with forceps to eliminate any residual homogenate into the tube while the sequestered fat in the cheese cloth is discarded.\nNote: Remove 100–150 μL of homogenate for western blotting. Proceed with the next step, using the remaining homogenate for the autophagic fractions\nSequential centrifugations\nTiming: 45 min",
    "This section outlines the sequential centrifugation steps designed to generate the different organelle fractions and discard nuclear and cellular debris. The 0.25 M sucrose and liver fractions should be kept on ice.\nOnce filtered, we centrifuge the liver homogenate at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C on an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge using the F34-6-38 rotor.\nThe supernatant contains endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytosol, and all autophagic and lysosomal fractions.\nThe supernatant is then collected into a new 50 mL tube and kept on ice.\nCritical: It is difficult to remove all of the supernatant containing the autophagic fractions without disturbing the pellet. Steps 22–24 are included to improve the yield of the starting material by washing the pellet and retrieving as much of the autophagic fractions as possible.\nFill the 50 mL FalconTM tube containing the pellet with enough fresh ice-cold 0.25 M sucrose to fill the tube to 35 mL.\nCritical: Add the sucrose gently to avoid disruption of the pellet.\nCentrifuge the pellet containing fresh 0.25 M sucrose again at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove as much of the supernatant as possible and add to the original 50 mL tube containing the initial supernatant.\nDiscard the 50 mL tube containing the pellet.\nSpin the 50 mL tube containing the supernatant at 12,000 rpm (17,000 g) for 12 min at 4°C on an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge using the F34-6-38 rotor.\nNote: The pellet obtained from this spin will contain the autophagic fractions.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Pellets should be kept on ice.\nAdd fresh 0.25 M sucrose to the 50 mL tube and resuspend the pellet.\nSpin the 50 mL tube again at 12,000 rpm for 12 min at 4°C.",
    "Eliminate as much of supernatant as possible via vacuum suction. This pellet will be used in subsequent steps (see below) to isolate each of the autophagolysosomal fractions.\nPreparation of Nycodenz gradient\nTiming: 30 min per gradient + 3 h centrifugation\nIn this step, we will prepare the differential density gradient. This gradient will allow us to isolate the autophagic fractions.\nTo prepare a Nycodenz gradient, label 4 of the 15 mL tubes, 26%, 24%, 20%, and 15%, respectively.\nCalculate the total amount of Nycodenz needed per sample as per chart below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_927_1.csv\nNote: The values provided in the chart above are the gradient amounts for one sample. When preparing the gradient, make sure to prepare enough Nycodenz for the number of samples that are being prepared. For example, to prepare 2 samples, the total amount of 26% Nycodenz will be 8 ml. Therefore, one will need to prepare 8 ml by adding 2.4 ml (1.2×2) of 85.6% Nycodenz and 5.6 ml (2.8×2) of water.\nNote: The 26% Nycodenz layer is the only layer where 4 ml is added for each sample gradient. The 24%, 20%, and 15% Nycodenz layers only require 2 ml (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/927-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Nycodenz (Ndz) gradients before and after ultracentrifugation\nNycodenz (Ndz) gradients before (left panel) and after (right panel) ultracentrifugation at 24,700 rpm (104,333 g) for 3 h. Brackets in left panel indicate the sample with 51% Ndz (bottom layer), and different Ndz gradients (26%, 24%, 20%, and 15%), and 0.25 M sucrose (top layer). Arrows in right panel depict the bands representing autophagosomes (APh), autolysosomes (AL), and lysosomes (Lys). See also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nResuspend pellet (obtained from step 30 in the previous section) in 950 μL of 0.25 M sucrose containing protease inhibitors.",
    "Add 1.4 mL of 85.6% Nycodenz and mix well.\nPipet the samples into a 13.2 mL Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge tube.\nNote: Please add the sample to the bottom of the tube without touching the sides. Final density of the sample is 51% Nycodenz. The gradient added above the sample will progressively be of lower density.\nUsing a 1 mL extended fine tip transfer pipet, slowly add 26% Nycodenz. Four mL of 26% Nycodenz should be added to each gradient (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nCritical: Key to preparing the gradient is ensuring that the layers below are not disrupted when the Nycodenz is being poured. This is ensured by slowly adding a new layer by apposing the tip of the transfer pipet to the side of the 13.2 ml Beckman Coulter tube and adding the new layer immediately above the existing layer (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSlowly using a fine tip, pipet the 24% Nycodenz layer on the top of the 26% layer.\nRepeat this step for the 20% and 15% Nycodenz layers, respectively, with the 15% layer at the top as indicated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nOnce the Nycodenz layers are added, add a small amount of 0.25 M sucrose to the top.\nAdd the Beckman Coulter 13.2 mL tubes to the Ti41 Beckman buckets and balance the buckets using 0.25 M sucrose.\nLoad the buckets onto the SW41 Ti ultracentrifuge rotor and centrifuge the gradients for 3 h at 104,333 × g at 4°C. We use the Beckman Coulter Optima XPN 90 ultracentrifuge for this step.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "After the completion of the ultracentrifugation, remove the 13.2 mL tubes from the buckets and use 1 mL transfer pipets to collect the different autophagic fractions. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], depicting the various bands representing autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and lysosomes after the ultracentrifugation step.\nThe first step entails use of gentle suction to remove the top layers until the autophagosome fraction is reached. A transfer pipette is used to slowly suction out the autophagosome fraction into 5 mL Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes.\nRepeat this step to individually collect the autolysosomal and lysosomal fractions in separate tubes\nOnce the samples are collected in the 5 mL Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes, add ice-cold 0.25 M sucrose with inhibitors made in step 10 to the tubes. Fill the tubes until 0.5 cm from the top of the tubes.\nCritical: The autophagic fractions are suspended in viscous Nycodenz, which keeps the fractions suspended in solution and prevents them from pelleting. To ensure that the fractions can be pelleted, it is necessary to dilute the Nycodenz using 0.25 M sucrose. Hence step 45 remains critical for collection of each of the fractions.\nThe fractions in the 5 mL polypropylene tubes are spun down at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in a TLA-110 rotor on a bench top Beckman Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge.\nNote: Pelleting the fractions at this speed renders the sample suitable for biochemical analysis such as immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and proteo-lipidomics but may not preserve the architecture of the fractions. To maintain the architecture of the autophagic fractions, it is advised to pellet the cells at 21,000 × g for 1 h. The appearance of the pellets is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/927-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
