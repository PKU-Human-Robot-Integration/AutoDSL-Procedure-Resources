  "procedures": [
    "Prepare primer mix. (see Recipes)Prepare two mixes: (1) For SARS-Cov-2 test. (2) For pop7 positive internal processing and amplification control.Sample lysis and preparation (see Figure 1A)For saliva samples: Resuspend in 1 ml of DNase RNase free water (in the same container of the saliva sample). For throat/nasal swab samples: Use the standard universal transfer media (UTM) for this test. Add 5 µl of the sample (from Step B1) to a PCR tube containing 40 µl of DNase RNase free water.Include a non-template control. Add 5 µl DNase RNase free water instead of the sample.Add 2 µl proteinase K (final concentration 1.22 mg/ml).Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.Incubate samples at 95 °C for 5 min in a PCR machine or any other heat source.Note: We have successfully used thermal cup and hot water. Cool your sample down to room temperature.RT-LAMP reaction (see Figure 1A)Prepare three mixes: (1) For SARS-CoV-2 test. (2) For pop7 gene as positive control. For each mix use the relevant primers. (3) For non-template control (see Step B3) using the SARS-CoV-2 primers.Prepare reaction:LAMP mix                                                           10 µlPrimer mix                                                            2 µlGuanidine hydrochloride                                   1 µlSample lysate (product of Procedure B)          7 µlIncubate at 65 °C for 30-40 min.Read results:If the mix color changes from pink to yellow, the sample has tested positive (see Figure 1B).If the mix maintains its pink color, the sample has tested negative (see Figure 1B).Please note that the results are binary as positive or negative. Only bright yellow results are considered positive. Pink is considered negative, and any other range or gradient of color is considered negative. Positive control results were published at Ben-Assa*, Naddaf* et al., 2020 (Figure 3a).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201015/20201015223256_5738.jpgFigure 1.

    "An illustration of the steps of the protocol: this illustration summarizes the main steps of the protocol. Illustration was created with BioRender.com. B. One negative sample (Neg S.) and one positive sample (Pos S.) before and after incubation. At t = 0 min (left panel), all samples were pink. After incubation of 30min (right panel), positive samples turned yellow while negative samples retained their pink color. Pictures are representative RT-LAMP test results of clinical diagnostic nasal and throat swabs of data published in Ben-Assa*, Naddaf* et al., 2020. Results were confirmed by conventional RT-qPCR clinical test for SARS-CoV-2 following RNA extraction and purification step."
