    "Promoter analysisThe proximal promoter sequence of the promoter of interest, the ITGA1 gene, can be downloaded from the reference human genome or from the switchdb website: http://switchdb.switchgeargenomics.com/productinfo/id_706788/[href=http://switchdb.switchgeargenomics.com/productinfo/id_706788/]Genomatix website: upload the promoter sequence and use the default parameters or use the promoter search.Guideline detailed in:https://www.genomatix.de/online_help/help_matinspector/matinspector_help.html#eldo_promoters[href=https://www.genomatix.de/online_help/help_matinspector/matinspector_help.html#eldo_promoters]The identified response elements are compared to the consensus sequence (which binds the transcription factor). For instance, for MYC, possible response elements are compared to the E-box element CACGTG. In addition to the results obtained with the software, visual analysis of the promoter sequence is highly recommended.Site directed mutagenesisDesign primers manually and change nucleotides in order to completely modify the sequence of the identified response elements (avoid creating a response element for another transcription factor). The mutations should be centrally located in both the forward and reverse primers. The primers should be complementary and 35 to 45 nucleotides in length to insure proper annealing.Prepare the PCR mix (excepting primers, all reagents are included in the GeneArt Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170314/20170314064838_7279.jpgPCR reactionimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170314/20170314064913_0571.jpgRecombination reaction This step allows the conversion of the plasmid from a linear to a circular form.In a 1.5 ml tube add: 4 µl of reaction buffer (5x), 2 µl of enzyme mix (10x), 4 µl of PCR sample and complete to 20 µl with RNase-free water. Incubate 10 min at room temperature (RT). Stop the reaction with 1 µl of 0.5 M EDTA. The next step should be started immediately after recombination. Prepare for the transformation step before beginning the recombination reaction.TransformationThaw vials of DH5α cells on ice for 5 to 7 min.Transfer 2 μl of the recombination reaction directly to the vial of DH5α cells and mix by tapping gently (Reaction A). Incubate the tubes on ice for 12 min.",
    "Immediately incubate the vials at 42 °C for 30 sec (do not exceed 30 sec) and then re-incubate on ice for 2 min.Add 250 μl of SOC medium to each vial (Reaction A) and then incubate at 37 °C for 1 h with 225 rpm shaking (Reaction B).Add 10 μl from Reaction B to 90 μl of SOC medium, then spread 100 μl onto LB plates and incubate overnight.Select 5 to 10 colonies and isolate DNA from the bacteria.Analyze and confirm, by DNA sequencing, the presence of the induced mutations in the promoter.Store DNA at -20 °C.Transient transfectionCulture HEK293T cells in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS (without antibiotics).Use trypsin to dissociate HEK293T cells (1 ml per 10 cm dish) and incubate at 37 °C for 2 min. Add DMEM and count live cells (using trypan blue) in suspension and then plate 50,000 cells per well in 12-well plates. Add a total of 1 ml of DMEM 10% FBS media to each well.Begin the transient transfection the following day.For transfection, prepare plasmids in 1.5 ml tubes as for the following example:Table 1.

Incubate for 48 h.Add one volume of passive lysis buffer to four volumes of distilled water.",
    "Remove the media from the wells and rinse once gently with cold 1x PBS.Add 250 µl of 1x passive lysis buffer for each well of the 12-well plates and then shake gently for 15 min.Luminometer settings: set injectors 1 and 2 to dispense 50 µl of LARII and Stop & Glo solutions.For measurement, use 10 sec for reading time and 2 sec as a delay.Transfer 10 µl from each PLB lysate and put in 96 well-plate (avoid pipetting the cell debris).Run the measurement of luciferase activity."
