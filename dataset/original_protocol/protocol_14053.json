    "The following protocol follows the institutional animal care guidelines of Technische Universität Dresden, Germany (File number: T 2014/4) as well as internationally accepted animal care guidelines (FELASA)17. Figure 1 visualizes the cell isolation process.\n1. Preparing the setup, material and media\nPrepare cell culture medium, PBS solution, collagenase blend stock solution (reconstitute 50 mg of lyophilized collagenase blend in 12 mL of sterile ultrapure water), and 0.25% trypsin solution.\nWarm up the medium, the PBS and the trypsin solution to 37 °C.\nPreheat the ultrasonic water bath to 37 °C.\nDisinfect forceps, a stainless-steel spatula, scalpels (2x scalpels per organ) and 2 glass beakers with 70% ethanol and place these materials under the cell culture hood.\nFill one beaker with 70% ethanol and the other with sterile water or PBS solution. These beakers are required to disinfect and wash the instrument after each organ procession.\nPlace sterile 15 mL plastic tubes containing cold PBS on wet ice. The number of tubes depends on the number of organs you want to isolate fibroblasts from.\n2. Mouse dissection and organ removal\nWear two pairs of gloves one above the other, so the first pair can be removed as soon as the animal has been dissected.\n\tNOTE: This procedure prevents bacteria from the animal's fur and skin from spreading over the organs.\nEuthanize the mouse (e.g., cervical dislocation) and pin the carcass with needles to every limb to a polystyrene pad.\nDisinfect the mouse carcass using 70% ethanol spray. Make sure the fur is soaked in ethanol so the hair will not swirl up.",
    "Cut the fur right above the urogenital tract using surgical forceps and atraumatic scissors. Cut the skin alongside the middle line from the point of the initial incision to the neck (3 - 4 cm) and add relief cuts at the limbs.\n\tCAUTION: Do not perforate the muscular layer at this step to avoid bacterial contamination!\nPin the skin to the polystyrene foam pad to have optimal access to the musculature covering the abdominal cavity.\nDisinfect the abdominal musculature twice using 70% ethanol. Let the ethanol dry before continuing to the next step.\nRemove the first pair of gloves. Use a new, sterile set of forceps and scissors.\nOpen the abdominal cavity and the thorax by incising the muscular layer with surgical scissors to gently remove the organs of choice. Therefore, hold the organ gently with surgical forceps (do not pierce the organ, use minimal pressure) and cut the supplying blood vessels near the entry point at the organ with scissors.\nPut the organs into the sterile tubes containing cold PBS. Close the tubes tightly. Place the tubes on wet ice until continuing with step 3.1.\n3. Tissue mincing, digestion and cell extraction\nTransfer the tubes under the sterile cell culture hood.\n\tCAUTION: Wear a fresh pair of gloves and disinfect the tubes with 70% ethanol before transferring them under the hood!\nTake the organ out of the 15 mL tube using sterile forceps. Place the organ onto one half of a sterile 6 cm Petri dish and wash the organ briefly with PBS to remove excess blood. Transfer the organ to the second half of the Petri dish, remove excess PBS.\nMince the tissue using two sterile scalpels. The remaining tissue fragments should not be larger than 1 - 2 mm.",
    "Transfer the minced tissue into a new sterile 15 mL tube using the sterile spatula and add 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin solution. Place the tube into a cell culture incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.\nVortex the tube gently (circa 1400/min) for 10 s.\nStop the trypsin reaction under the cell culture hood by adding 4 mL FCS-containing cell culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), e.g.).\nAdd 250 µL of collagenase blend solution to each tube containing heart or lung tissue and 100 µL for kidney or liver, respectively.\nPlace the tubes into an ultrasonic water bath (37 °C) and activate the ultrasonic sonicator for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: The ultrasonic water bath used in this protocol has an operating frequency of 35 kHz and a maximal power of 320 W.\nVortex the tubes gently (circa 1400/min) for 10 s.\nPlace the tubes again into the ultrasonic water bath for 10 min.\nVortex gently (circa 1400/min) for 10 s.\nDisinfect the tubes with 70% ethanol and transfer them under the sterile cell culture hood.\nFilter the solution with a 40 µm mesh into a new sterile 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 500 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of fresh medium.\nTransfer the cells into a suitable cell culture vessel (e.g., 6-well plate) and place the vessel into the cell culture incubator overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nThe next day, remove the medium, wash 3 times with PBS, then add fresh medium (the added volume depends on the cell culture vessel of choice, 2 mL per well of a 6-well plate etc.).\nChange the medium every other day.\n\tNOTE: Fibroblasts can be split after reaching optical confluence of 90% (usually after 5-7 days).",
