    "1. Stem Cell Maintenance\nMaintain H9 hESCs on a layer of growth factor reduced basement membrane matrix (see the Table of Materials, henceforth simply referred to as matrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nTo coat one 6-well plate or one 10 cm dish, combine 100 µL of matrix with 5.9 mL of ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 media. Wrap plates in paraffin film and store overnight at 4 °C. Use them on the next day for passaging cells after the excess matrix/media is aspirated.\nCulture the cells week to week at approximately a 1:12 split ratio every 7 days. Maintain the cells using mTESR-1 media in a 37 °C, low oxygen incubator (5% O2, 5% CO2). Refresh media daily. Weed out differentiating cells from the culture between passages using glass tools.\nH9 cells should be passaged four to six days prior to utilizing them to produce organoids. The cells should be passaged at approximately a 1:8 ratio of cell clusters. To do this, start by rinsing the cells with DMEM F12 media and dissociate the cells with a neutral protease (e.g., dispase, henceforth referred to simply as protease), rinse with DMEM/F-12, and plate as 30-60 cell clusters across 4 plates (6-well or 10 cm) at ~20% confluency. Two days prior to harvest, transition them to a regular incubator (21% O2, 5% CO2). Plates should reach ~80% confluency when starting organoid formation.\n2. Dissociation of the hESCs for Organoid Culture\nAliquot the protease stock solution (5 U/mL).\n\tNOTE: We typically freeze down 1 mL aliquots at -20 °C for use over several months.\nDilute the protease stock solution to the working concentration by adding 1 mL of the stock solution plus 5 mL of DMEM/F12 for each 6-well or 10 cm plate of hESCs.",
    "Aspirate and remove cell culture media, then cover the hESCs with the protease solution. Place plates in the incubator for 10-15 min or until the edges of the colonies round up and begin to separate from the matrix.\nTilt the plate, aspirate the protease solution, and gently wash the cells with DMEM/F12 three times. Use 2 mL/well for each wash when using a 6-well plate and 6 mL when using a 10 cm plate. Make sure colonies stay attached to the matrix when performing this step.\nAdd back about 1.5 mL of fresh mTESR media to each well (or 5 mL for a 10 cm plate) and flush the cells off the plate using gentle pipetting.\nUsing a 10 mL pipette, gently aspirate and dispense hESC within the plate until they reach approximately 1/30th of their original size. Colony clusters should resemble ~250-350 µm sized squares at the completion of these steps.\n3. Generation of Organoids\nTransfer cells into a single ultra-low attachment T75 flask containing 30 mL of mTESR media without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).\nThe next day, tilt the flask(s) such that the live cells pool in the corner (this may take 5-10 min on the first day, but will get quicker as the clusters get larger).\n\tNOTE: If there are a large number of cells that have adhered to the bottom of the flask at this step or any subsequent steps, transfer the cells to a new flask. It is normal to have a high population of dead cells for the first two days. When performing media changes, be sure to remove as much of the cell debris as possible.\nOnce the cells settle, aspirate off the media and dead cells leaving about 10 mL of media containing the live cells.",
    "Add ~20 mL of low bFGF media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1x N2, 1x B27, 1x L-glutamine, 1x NEAA, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.1 mM monothioglycerol (MTG) supplemented with 30 ng/mL bFGF).\nCheck the cells on day 2. If most of the cells look healthy and bright, there is no need to do anything. However, if more than a third of the cells appear dark, replace the media (using the same tilting technique as in step 3.2) with ~20 mL of low bFGF media supplemented with 20 ng/mL bFGF.\nOn day 3, replace half of the media (using the tilting technique in step 3.2) with 20 mL of low bFGF media supplemented with 10 ng/mL bFGF.\nOn day 5, replace half of the medium (using the tilting technique in step 3.2) with 20 mL of neural induction media (NIM: DMEM/F12, 1x N2 supplement, 0.1 mM MEM NEAA, 2 µg/mL heparin).\n\tNOTE: If there are any large clusters of cells or organoids that are much larger than the others, they should be removed from the culture. Size is estimated by appearance under the microscope; for example, using an eyepiece with reticle. The majority of organoids are similarly sized (roughly 100 ± 20 µm). We removed organoids that were approximately 2x smaller or larger than the others.\nReplace half of the medium (~15 mL) (using the tilting technique) with NIM every other day.\nAfter 3 weeks in culture, add 100x penicillin/streptomycin to the media (NIM: DMEM/F12, 1x N2 supplement, 0.1 mM MEM NEAA, 2 µg/mL heparin) at a final concentration of 1x if desired. Refresh the media every other day.\n\tNOTE: In this fashion, we maintained the organoids for up to 6 months in culture.\n4. RNA Extraction and Preparation",
    "Gently extract approximately 15 organoids (depending upon size) from the flask using a 10 mL pipette and place into a 1.5 mL tube.\n\t\nGently pellet the organoids in the centrifuge (200 x g for 1 min), and rinse with 1x Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) three times.\nExtract RNA using validated system or protocol (e.g., RNeasy kit).\nMeasure the optical density value of each sample at 260 and 280 nm.\nPrepare cDNA using a validated system or protocol (e.g., iScript cDNA synthesis kit).\nPerform qRT-PCR using pre-validated primers (Table 1) including at least one housekeeping gene.\n5. Immunohistochemistry\nFixation\n\t\nPrepare a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution and place it at 4 °C.\nUsing a sterile razor, cut the tip off of a sterile transfer pipette.\nGently extract organoids using the cut transfer pipette, as they can be easily broken apart, especially when they grow large, and place them into a 6-well plate with additional media or DPBS.\nTilt the plate, aspirate the media, and replace with 1x DPBS. Rinse the cells with 1x DPBS two additional times.\nReplace the DPBS with 4% PFA solution and place on a shaker at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: While we fixed for 2 days (for small organoids) to 7 days (for organoids >3 months), shorter times (e.g., 16-24 h) may also be possible.\nPrepare 30%, 20% and 10% sucrose solutions in DPBS.\nAfter fixation in PFA, replace with the 10% sucrose solution and place on a shaker at 4 °C for 24 h.\nReplace the 10% sucrose with 20% sucrose and place on a shaker at 4 °C for 24 h.\nReplace the 20% sucrose with 30% sucrose and place on a shaker at 4 °C for 24 h.\nFrozen sections\n\t\nPrepare a flat layer of dry ice and place a labeled plastic mold on top of it.",
    "Pour a thin layer of optimal cutting temperature medium (OCT) into the mold and let it start to harden (within a few seconds).\nPlace a few organoids on the top of the OCT in the mold using a transfer pipette with the tip cut off and pay close attention to the location of the organoids.\nSlowly add in OCT until the mold is full and the organoids are covered. Let it harden completely for an additional 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: While freezing over 10 min helps ensure ideal relative placement of multiple organoids for sectioning, it is possible to use an ethanol-dry ice mix or liquid nitrogen to freeze more quickly.\nMark the relative location of the organoids with a marker to make it easier to find them when cutting.\nPlace the molds in a bag or box and store at -80 °C until ready to cut the sections.\nUsing a cryostat, slice 10 µm sections and place the tissue onto labeled, positively charged slides.\nStaining\n\t\nPrepare blocking solution (0.3% Triton X-100, 4% normal donkey serum in PBS).\nUse a hydrophobic pap pen to draw around the perimeter of the tissue.\nRinse the slides with PBS 3 times for 5 min each.\nReplace PBS with blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature.\nReplace the blocking solution with antibody solution (antibody at appropriate concentration, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4% normal donkey serum in PBS) at 4 °C overnight.\nOn the following day, wash the slide 3 times with PBS for 10 min each.\nReplace PBS with the appropriate secondary antibody (at the appropriate concentration) diluted in antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature.\nRinse 3 times for 10 min each time with 1x PBS.\nApply the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain and rinse three times for 10 min each with 1x PBS.",
    "Affix coverslips to the front of the slides with mounting solution, let dry at room temperature in the dark, and store in the dark at 4 °C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
