    "No clearance or approval was needed at the University of Delaware to carry out this work.\n1. GBM cell injection into chick optic tectum\nPreparation of GSCs and GBM cells for injection\n\t\nCulture GSCs in GSC media (Table 1). Culture established GBM cell lines in GBM media (Table 1).\nRinse the cells on plates with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and place 1 mL of trypsin solution into a 10 cm dish. Leave in a cell culture incubator for 2-3 min until the cells start to detach.\nInactivate the trypsin by adding 10 mL of appropriate serum-containing culture media into the 10 cm dish and detach the cells by pipetting up and down. Place the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the media from the cell pellet using a disposable fine glass pipette attached to a side arm flask and vacuum pump. Resuspend the cells in appropriate growth media to a concentration of 10,000 cells per microliter and place in a microfuge tube or small screw-top tube on ice.\nMix the cells with a small amount of sterile 1% Fast Green FCF dye (use a ratio of 5 µL of dye/100 µL of cell suspension).\nInjection of GBM cells into E5 optic tectum in ovo. See Supplementary Figure 1.\n\t\nIncubate the fertilized chicken eggs in a humidified egg incubator, with the pointed end facing down, at 37.5 °C (the 1st day of incubation is embryonic day 0 [E0]). On the 6th day of incubation (E5), sterilize the eggshell by spraying with 70% ethanol.\nUsing an egg candler, trace along the perimeter of the air space above the embryo with a pencil and cover the outlined area with transparent tape.",
    "Using curved scissors, gently cut around the traced area, being careful not to cut into the embryonic membranes or blood vessels, and discard the top of the eggshell.\nPlace a few drops of saline or cell culture media onto the air space membrane to wet it so that it will detach easily. Using fine forceps, carefully pierce the air space membrane over the top of the embryo, remove it, and locate the chick embryo's head.\nUse fine forceps to grab the transparent amnion membrane that immediately surrounds the embryo to position the head so that the optic tectum can be injected with cells. With one hand, use the fine forceps to hold onto the amnion to keep the head in place during the injection process. Be careful not to damage the extraembryonic blood vessels in the chorioallantoic membrane on the yolk.\n\t\tNOTE: The above procedure takes some practice to be able to efficiently grab the clear amnion membrane that intimately surrounds the embryo, since it is invisible until it is grabbed and pulled. Practice using fine forceps to grab the clear amnion that immediately surrounds the embryo.\nHold the head steady by gripping the amnion membrane with fine forceps. Using a glass micropipette and a pneumatic picopump, inject around 50,000 cells in 5 µL of suitable cell culture media into the optic tectum (5 µL is approximately 1/2 of a filled micropipette).\n\t\t​NOTE: See Cretu et al.1 for an image of an E5 embryo that has been injected with GBM cells mixed with dye.\nPlace a few drops of 50 mg/mL ampicillin on top of the embryo.\nCover the hole in the top of the eggs with clear tape and leave in humidifier until E15 for dissection.\n2. Dissection of brain regions from E15 embryos",
    "NOTE: The dissection of E15 brains here for fixation is similar to that described in step 8.2 for live brain slices, but the dissection here does not have to be done under aseptic conditions.\nCut away the tape around the top of the shell, allowing access to the embryo.\nDecapitate the embryo at the neck and place the head in a 10 cm dish with sterile calcium- and magnesium-free Tyrodes (CMF Tyrode's) solution. See Supplementary Figure 2.\nUsing fine forceps, peel away the skin covering the brain to reveal the underlying dura mater. Remove the forming skull bones on the left and right sides of the brain. The forming skull bones do not yet cover the majority of the brain.\nGently use fine pointed forceps to tear through the meninges overlying the center of the brain and peel it to each side to uncover the brain.\nUse curved forceps to scoop the brain from below and gently pull it out of its cavity.\nDissect the brain into its parts: forebrain, tecta, cerebellum.\nRemove the overlying pia mater from the tecta using fine forceps. Note that the pia separates easily from the tecta, but not from the forebrain or cerebellum. Remove the pia from the forebrain by touching it or rolling it on a small piece of filter paper.\nPlace the dissected brain regions in a small dish.\nPlace the brain regions for fixation in a 24-well plate well and fix in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Leave for at least 24 h at 4 °C.\nAfter fixation, rinse the tissue in 3x PBS over at least 1 hour before embedding in agar.\n3. Embedding and slicing harvested brain regions",
    "Prewarm a solution of 3.5% agar and 8% sucrose in PBS until molten and keep it at melting temperature.\nUsing curved forceps as a scoop, gently pick up either the optic tectum or forebrain region of the chick embryo brain, and blot slightly on filter paper to remove extra liquid to ensure adhesion of the agar to the outer brain surface.\nUsing a sterile transfer pipette, fill up the mold with agar solution.\n\tNOTE: A simple mold can be made by forming aluminum foil around an appropriately sized object, such as small rectangular metal vibrating tissue slicer blocks.\nPlace the brain region in agar, and let the agar completely solidify.\nRemove the aluminum foil from around the embedded brain and trim excess agar around the sides using a razor blade or scalpel.\nPlace a drop of cyanoacrylate glue on the stainless-steel square of the slicing tray, place the agarose block with the brain onto the glue, and let the glue bond for 1 min. Place the tray into the vibrating tissue slicer chuck, tighten, and fill the tray with enough PBS to cover the top of the agar block.\nCut the brain slices on a vibrating tissue slicer at a 350 µm thickness using a steel razor blade.\nAs brain slices are cut and float freely into the slicing tray, use a spatula to scoop up and remove the slices from the tray. Gently slide the section off the spatula and into a labeled 10 cm Petri dish with PBS so the sections float freely.",
    "​NOTE: The agar surrounding the brain slice may become detached if the brain is not sufficiently blotted with filter paper to remove excess liquid before embedding. If this occurs, the brain tissue can be gently removed from the solidified agar and re-embedded after proper blotting of excess liquid.\n4. Immunostaining brain slices with tumor cells\nUsing a stereo microscope equipped with epifluorescence, screen individual slices in the 10 cm dish one by one for the presence or absence of tumor cells.\nPrepare a sufficient amount of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum (PBSTG) (see Table 1) for immunostaining and rinse the slices to be immunostained.\nHalf-fill wells in a 24-well plate that will be used for staining brain sections with PBS.\nTrim off the corners of agar around the brain slices with the edge of a spatula or a scalpel, and gently place them into the wells containing PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and replace with 350 µL of primary antibody staining solution in PBSTG (e.g., 2 µg/mL UJ127 in PBSTG).\nIncubate for 24 h in a cold room with gentle agitation so that the slice is seen to move freely within the well.\nAfter 24 h, remove the primary antibody solution and rinse 3 x 1 h with PBSTG in a cold room with agitation.\nWhen finished rinsing, incubate in 350 µL/well of secondary antibody staining solution in PBSTG (e.g., 1/200 dilution of biotin-GAM in PBSTG). Incubate for 20 h in a cold room with agitation.\n\tNOTE: If foregoing the tertiary step and incubating with the fluorochrome-containing secondary antibody at this step, cover to protect from light during incubation now and then skip to step 4.11.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution and rinse 3 x 1 h in PBSTG in a cold room with agitation.",
    "Remove the PBSTG and incubate in the tertiary solution (e.g., 1:250 dilution of Alexa Fluor 647 streptavidin in PBSTG). If desired, stain the nuclei at this step by adding 0.1 µg/mL bisbenzimide to the mixture. Incubate for 20 h in a cold room with agitation.\nRemove the tertiary solution and rinse 3 x 1 h in PBSTG in a cold room with agitation.\nLeave in PBS until ready to mount on microscope slides.\n5. Mounting slices on microscope slides\nPrepare as many microscope slides as there are sections to mount.\nFor each slide, place a 50 mm length strip of 10 mil (254 µm) thick vinyl electrical tape on a piece of parafilm.\nUsing a 1 cm x 1 cm square hole punch, punch a hole through the center of the electrical tape and parafilm.\nPull the tape off of the parafilm and place it on top of the microscope slide, leaving room for labeling tape on the slide.\nUsing a micropipette, place one or two drops of anti-fade mounting media in the square hole in the center of the electrical tape.\nUse a curved spatula to lift the desired vibrating tissue slicer section from the PBSTG and thoroughly wick away moisture with a clean laboratory wipe or piece of filter paper.\nTouch the edge of the slice to the drop of mountant and use another spatula to gently slide the section into the mounting media.\nCover the section with a few more drops of mountant and carefully place a 24 mm x 30 mm (#1.5 thickness) coverslip on top of the section and mountant.\nSeal the edges of the coverslip with nail polish to keep it in place.\n6. Confocal microscopy of fixed brain slices",
    "Use widefield fluorescence to find fluorescent tumors in the mounted brain slice using the appropriate objective lens and filter set(s).\n\tNOTE: Some tumors can be quite large and are easily visible with the 4x objective, while single cells might require the 10x objective.\nSwitch to confocal microscopy using an appropriate objective lens, laser(s), pinhole size, and detector settings. To follow this protocol, use a 20x objective (numerical aperture [N.A.] = 0.75) for routine imaging and a 60x oil objective (N.A. = 1.40) for high-resolution imaging.\nSet upper and lower limits of the z-axis and step size (for the specific situation according to the confocal microscope manufacturer's instructions) for acquiring optical sections. Acquire a z-stack of optical sections.\nUse the confocal microscope software to create a 3D volume render of the tumor, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n7. Spheroid preparation\nCreating poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) plates\n\t\nCreate a solution of 10 µg/mL poly-HEMA in 95% ethanol, and coat 35 mm Petri dishes (or cell culture dishes) with 1 mL of this solution.\nLet the dishes sit on a rocker uncovered overnight at room temperature to develop a coating of the dish surface.\n\t\tNOTE: The solvent will evaporate and leave a translucent coating on the dish, which may appear uneven, but this will not affect the ability to make cell spheroids.\nAfter drying, sterilize the open dishes under UV light in a biosafety cabinet for 1 h. Replace the lids after sterilization. The coated dishes are now ready for use.\nFluorescent DiD staining for time-lapse microscopy\n\tNOTE: This section is for staining single cells with DiD fluorescent dye to be used to make spheroids, which optimizes visualization of cell motility for live time-lapse imaging.\n\t\nSuspend the cells in a serum-free culture medium.",
    "Add 5 µL of DiD stock/mL of cell suspension and gently mix by pipetting. Incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the labeled cell suspension at 800 × g at 5 °C for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in warm media to rinse.\nRepeat this centrifugation and rinse step two more times.\n\t\tNOTE: If desired, skip to step 7.3.6 to make spheroids immediately after this process.\nMaking cell spheroids\n\t\nWarm up 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution to 37 °C.\nCulture GSCs in GSC media17 (Table 1) and U-118 malignant gloima (MG) cells in U-118 culture medium (see Table 1). Use a confluent 10 cm dish for the preparation of one 35 mm plate of spheroids. Add bFGF (10 ng/mL final concentration) and TGF-α (20 ng/mL final concentration) growth factors to GSCs initially and then every 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells used in the current study were green GSC15-2/K72, green GSC16-4/K72, red U-118/L1LE/mCherry2x, and red U-118/1879/mCherry2x. One plate of spheroids should be sufficient for two 6-well plates of brain slices on membrane inserts.\nRinse the cells on the plates with sterile PBS and place 1 mL of trypsin solution onto a 10 cm dish. Place in the cell culture incubator for 2-3 min until the cells start to detach.\nInactivate the trypsin by adding 10 mL of appropriate serum-containing culture media into the 10 cm dish and detach the cells by pipetting up and down. Place the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the media from the cell pellet and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of media.",
    "Place 2 mL of cell suspension on each 35 mm poly-HEMA-coated dish and add 2 mL more of appropriate media to obtain 4 mL of total media per dish. If using GSCs, add growth factors.\nIncubate the cells in a cell incubator until the aggregates reach a size of 100-200 µm, which could be 1-2 days depending on the density of the cells that were plated.\n8. Live chick embryo brain dissection and vibrating tissue slicer slicing\nPrep for dissection\n\t\nPrepare a 6-well polyester membrane insert plate with 1 mL of brain slice culture media (see Table 1) underneath the membrane insert.\nSterilize the work area and tools with 70% ethanol.\nPlace the 6-well insert plate on ice while the dissection is taking place.\nPrepare 100 mL of vibrating tissue slicer slicing media (Table 1) and place on ice.\nPlace a vial of 4% low melt agarose in PBS in a water bath until it melts into a liquid (approximately 50 °C).\nFill up the vibrating tissue slicer tub with ice.\nAseptic E14/15 chick embryo brain dissection\n\t\nUsing an egg candler, trace along the perimeter of the air pocket above the E14 or E15 embryo with a pencil and cover the outlined area with transparent tape.\nUsing curved or fine scissors, gently cut around the traced area, being careful not to cut into the embryo membrane or blood vessels, and discard the top piece of shell.\nUsing curved forceps, remove the air space membrane over the top of the embryo and locate the chick embryo's head.\nDecapitate the embryo and place the head in a 10 cm dish with cold sterile CMF solution. See Supplementary Figure 2.",
    "Using sterile fine forceps, peel away the skin covering the brain to reveal the underlying dura mater. Remove the forming skull bones on the left and right sides of the brain. The forming skull bones do not yet cover the majority of the brain.\nGently use fine pointed forceps (#5 or #55) to tear through the meninges overlying the center of the brain and peel it to each side to uncover the brain.\nUsing fine curved forceps, scoop the brain up from the bottom front and gently pull it out of its cavity.\nDissect the brain into its three main parts: forebrain, midbrain (optic tecta), cerebellum. Consult an atlas of chick development, if needed.\nRemove the overlying pia mater from the tecta using fine forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: The pia separates easily from the tecta, but not from the forebrain or cerebellum. The pia can be removed from the forebrain by touching it or rolling it on sterile gauze.\nPlace the dissected brain regions in a small sterile dish on ice.\nEmbedding and slicing the brain\n\t\nUsing curved forceps as a scoop, gently pick up either the optic tectum or forebrain region and blot slightly on sterile gauze to remove extra liquid to ensure adhesion of the agarose to the outer brain surface.\nUsing a sterile transfer pipette, fill up the mold with low-melt agarose. Prepare a simple mold by forming aluminum foil around an appropriately sized object. The small rectangular metal vibrating tissue slicer block is routinely used as the object. See Supplementary Figure 3.\nQuickly place the brain region in agarose and let it solidify (approximately 4-5 min) on ice.",
    "NOTE: The brain may sink to the bottom of the mold before the agarose hardens. If this occurs, wait 1 min to let the agar start to set, and then place the brain region into the agarose. Try to suspend the brain region directly in the middle of the agarose.\nRemove the aluminum foil from around the embedded brain in the solidified agarose and trim excess agarose around the sides using a sterile razor blade or scalpel.\nPlace a drop of cyanoacrylate glue on the stainless-steel square of the slicing dish/tray, place the agarose block with the brain, and let the glue bond for 1 min. Place the dish/tray in the vibrating tissue slicer chuck, tighten, and fill the tray with slicing media to cover the top of the agarose block.\nCut the sections on a vibrating tissue slicer at 250-350 µm using a sapphire knife, which has been reported to result in less live tissue damage than a steel razor blade.\nAs brain slices are cut and float freely into the slicing tray, use a sterile spatula to scoop up and remove the slice from the tray. Gently slide the section off of the spatula and onto a membrane insert using another sterile spatula.\n\t\tNOTE: Normally, two or three brain slices can be placed onto each membrane insert, if desired. The agarose surrounding the brain slice may become detached if the brain is not sufficiently blotted with sterile gauze to remove excess liquid. If this still occurs after sufficient blotting before embedding, gently pick up the slice without the surrounding agarose and slide it onto the membrane insert.\nPlace the 6-well plate of brain slices on membrane inserts in the cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "The day after plating, use a sterile Pasteur pipette to aspirate the media from below the insert (there are gaps in the sides of the inserts to allow a pipette to gain access to the media below). Add 1 mL of fresh slice media to each well underneath the membrane insert. Continue to change media every other day thereafter.\nWait a few days for the brain slices to attach firmly to the membrane inserts and appear to flatten out somewhat. This is a sign that the slices are viable and ready for the introduction of GBM cells.\n9. GBM cell introduction onto brain slices\nSpheroid method\n\t\nAfter the cell spheroids have reached 150-200 µm in size, use a 20 µL micropipette set to 5 µL to remove one to several spheroids from their culture dish. See Supplementary Figure 3.\nGently expel the media with spheroids onto the desired brain slice.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell spheroids should be visible in the pipette tip. Using a clear pipette tip will make them easier to see in the tip. If the spheroid falls off the brain slice when the liquid is released, an ethanol-sterilized eyelash glued to a thin wood applicator stick should be used to gently nudge the spheroid back onto the brain slice.\nAllow the spheroids to culture on the brain slices for 2-5 days.\n\t\tNOTE: The limitation here seems to be the eventual degradation of blood vessels and brain cells in the slice. Degraded blood vessels will appear as discontinuous balls in the slice when stained for laminin.\nBiopsy punch method\n\t\nAllow the brain slices to attach by appearing to flatten out on the membrane insert (may take 2-5 days in culture).\nThaw the cell matrix on ice.",
    "In the cell culture biosafety cabinet, connect a sterile 1 mm diameter biopsy punch to a vacuum aspirator tube.\nGently touch the brain slice with the biopsy punch to create a 1 mm hole in the center of the brain slice.\n\t\tNOTE: The tissue in the biopsy punch will be aspirated into the punch by the vacuum.\nPrepare a cell matrix suspension by trypsinizing a 60%-70% confluent 10 cm dish of cells and resuspending in 10 mL of media; then, mix 1 mL of that suspension with 100 µL of matrix.\nUsing a 20 µL micropipette, place 1 µL of the cell matrix mixture into each hole in the brain slices.\nAfter cell mixture placement is finished, place the dish of brain slices with embedded cells back into the incubator, and allow the matrix to solidify and the cells to potentially invade the surrounding brain slice.\n10. Widefield fluorescence time-lapse microscopy\nPlace removable tape around the edge of the 6-well plate to prevent evaporation of the media, leaving a small gap on one side for gas exchange.\nPlace the plates in a customized culture chamber on an adjustable automated stage on an inverted epifluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: The chamber was kept at atmospheric conditions of 5% CO2 and 95% air using a gas injection controller, and temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a warm air temperature controller and a temperature-controlled stage insert. See Fotos et al.18 for details of the system used here.\nUsing suitable microscope control software, create a time-lapse acquisition schedule that collects fluorescent images of the areas of interest once every 10 min for 20 h.",
    "NOTE: If a green fluorescent label is used in cells (e.g., green fluorescent protein [GFP]), then use the minimum amount of blue excitation light required to visualize the cells to prevent phototoxicity. Red (e.g., mCherry) and far red (e.g., DiD) labels do not seem to have this potential problem due to longer wavelength excitation.\n11. Immunostaining brain slices after time-lapse microscopy\nNOTE: This immunostaining protocol is optimized for staining blood vessels with laminin and nuclei with bisbenzimide. Use appropriate antibodies for the desired molecule(s) of interest.\nAspirate the media from below the membrane insert using a Pasteur pipette, and place 1 mL of 2% PFA in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer underneath the insert and 1 mL on top of the insert to cover the brain slice. Let the slices fix overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove the fixative from below the membrane insert and any fixative remaining on the brain slice (fixative tends to leak through membrane insert into the well below).\nRemove the insert with slices from the 35 mm well and place them into a larger plastic dish.\nPrep a 24-well plate by adding 350 µL of PBS into as many wells as there are brain slices (one slice/well when immunostaining).\n\t\nUsing a thin spatula, gently remove the agarose from around the brain slice without detaching the brain slice from the membrane insert. Make sure that the agarose detaches from the outer edge of the brain slice easily. If not, leave the agarose attached to the brain slice.",
    "Using a sharp scalpel, cut through the membrane around the brain slice until the slice with the underlying membrane is free from the rest of the insert. Pick up the membrane with the attached brain slice, using fine forceps to grab the membrane, and place it into a well of the 24-well plate in PBS.\nRinse the slices 3x with PBS over 1 h in the cold room with constant gentle agitation or rocking, so that the slice moves within the well.\nWhile rinsing, prepare the primary antibody solution.\n\t\nDilute anti-laminin to 2 µg/mL in PBSTG (see Table 1).\nRemove the PBS from the wells and incubate overnight in primary antibody solution in a cold room with gentle agitation.\nAfter at least 20 h of incubation, aspirate the primary antibody solution and rinse the sections 3x for 1 h in PBSTG.\nWhile rinsing, prepare the secondary antibody solution.\n\t\nDilute fluorescent-GAM with the specific fluorochrome needed to a 1:200 dilution in PBSTG along with a 0.1 µg/mL concentration of bisbenzimide.\nRemove PBSTG and incubate overnight in a cold room with agitation in the fluorescent secondary antibody solution.\nRemove the secondary antibody and rinse 2x over 1 h in PBSTG and 1x over 1 h in PBS.\nLeave in PBS until ready to mount on microscope slides (section 5) and view."
