    "NOTE: This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01829724). All participants are given the opportunity to ask questions and provide informed consent prior to their participation. In consideration of changes to the hemodynamic response caused by recent use of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, participants are asked to refrain from alcohol and caffeine for 24 hr before the experiment3.These animation videos were custom made in our laboratory, but could be recorded with other sounds or images specific to alternative research questions.\n1. Set Up the Room Prior to the Participant’s Arrival.\nCalibrate the motion capture cameras relative to a laboratory’s coordinates according to the motion capture manufacturer’s specific process. Ensure that camera positions will allow recording of all markers on both the body and head of the participant during the tasks that will be tested. The calibration process ensures accuracy of the motion capture system and is standard practice for any motion laboratory. Use a ten camera system, with an approximate volume of 17 m3 where reflective markers could be identified reliably.\nConnect the trigger from the instruction computer to the motion capture and fNIRS computers’ BNC inputs. Ensure that the trigger is connected to a mouse button, and clicking the mouse completes the circuit and sends a pulse simultaneously to the motion capture/EMG data acquisition board and to the fNIRS data acquisition board as auxillary analog inputs.\nConnect this mouse through the USB port to the computer that run instruction animation videos, such that starting the video will cause a voltage change simultaneously on both data acquisition systems.\n\tNOTE: EMG signals are automatically synched and saved by the motion capture software, so additional synching of the EMG system is not needed.",
    "Set up the screen and projector for instructions to be shown to the participant. Remove any unnecessary items that could be distracters. Place the tripod and digital video camera where they will have full view of the participant’s movements.\nVerify that reflective markers are securely attached to the top of each optode in the probe.\nAssemble all necessary documents: consent and assent copies, clinical examination sheets, and experimental note sheets, for example.\n2. Basic Measures\nAfter completing the informed consent process, measure and record participant’s height, weight, age, and head circumference.\nAdminister Edinburgh Handedness Inventory10 and other clinical examinations as indicated. Record participant-reported hair and skin types.\nPlace reflective markers on the posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS) bilaterally. Have the participant walk at their comfortable pace across the lab 3 - 5 times, and average the speed across trials to estimate their self selected walking pace.\n3. Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) Setup\nNOTE: This can be completed simultaneously with the setup of EMG and motion capture, if there are enough experimenters or research staff to assist, and if the participant is comfortable with several people being close to them at the same time.\nMeasure the distance between the nasion (Nz) and the inion (Iz), and between the pre-auricular points on the right (Ar) and left (Al) ears. The intersection of the midpoint of these two measures is Cz, which is marked on the scalp using a washable marker.\nIf the participant has long hair, section off small portions of the hair using braids or ponytails in order to expose the scalp where optodes will be placed.",
    "Place the fNIRS probe onto the participant’s head, taking care to align with Cz, Ar. Then move hair away from under each optode as it is placed it on the scalp. Finally, attach velcro straps to securely hold the optodes in place.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, use a cap that has one strap that goes behind the head, one that goes across the forehead, and one that goes under the chin. Optodes are anchored to this cap with Velcro on a flexible plastic ring that encircles the ear.\n\t\nIf the participant has short hair (less than approximately 2 inches in length), pull out hair between optodes with a small thin stick or plastic end of a comb.\nVerify that all optode cables are lying flat, and that optodes are approximately perpendicular to the surface of the scalp.\n\t\nIf necessary, place a thin piece of foam under the group of optode cables to promote perpendicular alignment of the optodes.\nCheck with the participant about comfort of the probes, and adjust if needed. Instruct them to tell the experimenters if their comfort decreases at any point during the experiment.\nTurn on sources and check the signals.\n\t\nIn this system, ensure a signal that has an intensity of at least 80 dB and a heartbeat clearly visible in the deltaOD (change in optical density) signal, at both 690 and 830 nm wavelengths. When channels have signals not meeting these criteria, confirm that hair is not blocking the optode(s) and then adjust detector gains as needed to maximize the signal intensity. Ensure that motion capture cameras are off during this time.\n\t\tNOTE: Other fNIRS machines may operate at wavelengths different to 690 and 830 nm; in this case, check the wavelengths most appropriate to the machine being used.",
    "Add reflective markers to Nz, Iz, Ar, and Al. Ask the participant to hold still and collect approximately 2 sec of motion capture data for these and the fNIRS optode markers. Verify that all markers have been recorded, and collect additional trials as necessary. It may require the participant to change head position to improve line of sight between the cameras and the markers. Use these collected three dimensional locations during analysis for probabilistic registration of a participant’s individual structural MRI if one is available.\nAdd a cover with several layers of black felt or other optically absorbent material on top of the fNIRS optodes to protect detectors from interference or saturation from the motion capture cameras. Ensure that the cables and front panel of the fNIRS unit are also well shielded using the same optically absorbent material.\n4. Surface Electromyography (EMG) Setup\nLocate the muscle belly of each targeted muscle using anatomical landmarks, palpation during muscle contraction, and electrode placement guides11.\n\tNOTE: The muscles targeted in this protocol include bilateral medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, extensor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi radialis.\nPrepare for EMG electrode placement over the muscle belly by shaving, removing dead skin cells with tape, and then cleaning with an isopropyl alcohol pad, as recommended by SENIAM12 and wait for skin to dry.\nPlace EMG electrode oriented to the direction of the muscle fibers.\nWrap snugly with a self adherent wrap.\nCheck muscle signals on the computer while performing manual muscle testing to ensure proper electrode placement, and clear visualization of signal change when the muscle is active.\n5. Motion Capture Setup",
    "Place reflective markers at joint landmarks. These include medial and lateral malleolus, medial and lateral knee joint, anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS), radial styloid, ulnar syloid, medial humeral epicondyl, and lateral humeral epicondyl.\nPlace 3 or more markers, or a rigid body cluster of markers, onto each segment of interest, including the foot, shank, thigh, hand, and forearm.\nCollect approximately 2 sec of motion capture data while the participant is standing still in a standardized position, such as standing with arms at 90° shoulder flexion and 90° elbow flexion. Ensure that all markers are clearly visible to the cameras.\n6. Gait Task\nHave the participant transfer to the treadmill. Assist them by supporting the fNIRS optode cables and then secure the cables to the ceiling support after the patient is in position. If patient is at high risk for falls, use a body weight support harness for safety during this task.\nStart the treadmill, slowly building up to the measured self selected walking speed to get the participant comfortable with the set up conditions. Then slow to a stop again.\nSet up the animation file with the auditory feedback that will cue the participant to either rest or move. Review task instructions with the participant, telling them to remain as still and relaxed as possible during “rest” periods and to walk at the treadmill’s set speed during the “task” period, while focusing their attention to the small black circle on the screen for the duration of data acquisition.\nDim the lights, and begin data acquisition on the motion capture computer and the fNIRS computer. Begin recording on the video camera.",
    "Using the mouse trigger, click the play button on the animation file associated with this task. Make sure that the trigger was received by both the motion capture and the NIRS systems.\n\t\nSwitch to an image of a black dot located in the participant’s line of sight, so that they have a focus point for the duration of the trial.\n\t\tNOTE: The overview schematic for each trial is shown in Figure 2.\nMonitor participant performance and provide feedback about speed, or extraneous voluntary movements as needed.\nAt the end of the instructional animation, stop recording on the motion capture, EMG, and fNIRS systems, as well as the video camera. Give the participant an opportunity to rest or shift positions as necessary.\n7. Bilateral Lower Extremity Cycling Task\nHave the participant transition to a plinth with movable back and leg support, taking care to support the fNIRS optode cables and to not bump or dislodge the motion capture markers or EMG electrodes. Have a foam seat cushion to improve comfort during the experiment.\nLift the cycle frame into position and secure it to the plinth with a strap.\nSecure the feet into the pedals and adjust the position of the cycle as necessary to promote a comfortable and natural distance to the pedals. At the furthest point in the cycle, maintain their knee in approximately 10° of flexion.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the participant will be in a semi-recumbent posture, which provides some trunk support and facilitates relaxation during the rest period.\nReview task instructions with the participant, telling them to remain as still and relaxed as possible during “rest” periods and to cycle at approximately 60 rpm during the “task” period.",
    "Repeat steps 6.4 to 6.7. Instead of switching to an image of a dot, project the cartoon animation that will cue the participant to either rest or move through visual and auditory feedback. Maximize the movie window so that the participant is not able to monitor the time that has passed, or is remaining, in the current trial.\n8. Hand Squeezing Task\nAfter removing the feet from the cycle and the cycle itself, place a bed table in front of the participant, making sure that participant’s arms are supported on the table at a comfortable position.\nInstruct participant to squeeze a soft object approximately once per sec (1 Hz) during the “task” period, and remain as relaxed as possible during “rest” periods.\nRepeat step 7.5.\n9. Ankle Dorsiflexion Task\nRemove the bed table, and raise the foot rest portion of the plinth up to bring the feet into the participant’s view.\nRemove the participant’s shoe and sock, and replace foot markers in appropriate positions. Support the calf just above their ankle joint with a foam pad to allow ankle joint movement.\nInstruct the participant to dorsiflex their ankle approximately once per sec (1 Hz) during the “task” period, and remain as relaxed as possible during “rest” periods.\nRepeat step 7.5.\n10. Conclusion of Protocol\nRemove the cap and inspect skin for areas of pressure or redness.\nRemove all reflective markers and EMG units.\nThank the participant for their time and invite their input about the subjective experience of the protocol. This can be a formal questionnaire (as used by Garvey and colleagues for transcranial magnetic stimulation13), or an informal discussion to identify common sources of discomfort that could be improved in the future.\nSubscription Required.
