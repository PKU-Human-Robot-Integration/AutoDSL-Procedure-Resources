    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAll data is acquired in triplicate in this assay, using three independent cultures per condition.\nIsolating colonies on a plate\nTiming: 30 min\nDetermine the colony forming units per milliliter of a 0.100 optical density culture, grown to exponential-phase, by performing a set of serial dilutions and subsequently plating dilutions onto agar media. This optical density was selected because it facilitates quick enumeration of total cell numbers per milliliter using a Petroff-Hauser counting chamber.\nGrow up bacterial cultures in 3 mL of liquid media.\nStandardize exponential-phase cultures to an OD of 0.100 with the media they are grown in.\nAdd 1.0 mL of the 0.100 OD culture to a microcentrifuge tube for use in “Staining to detect live or dead cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3]”, step 11.\nNote: When diluting cultures, pipette immediately below the meniscus to avoid transferring bacteria from outside of the pipette tip.\nFor easy counting of CFU, spread 10−5, 10−6, or 10−7 dilutions onto agar growth media from the standardized culture.\nIncubate at optimal growth temperature.\nOnce colonies surface, calculate colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter by multiplying CFU by the appropriate dilution factor.\nNote: A desired CFU count is between 25 to 250 as per standard microbiological laboratory practices.\nDirect cell counts\nTiming: 3–4 h\nStandardized cultures are preserved with fixative to simultaneously prevent culture growth and cell lysis for an accurate direct count determination after other steps of this procedure have been completed. Enumerations of fixed cultures are performed with a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber to determine the cells per milliliter within cultures.\nAdd 20 μL of 5× fixative to 80 μL of standardized 0.100 OD cultures (“Isolating Colonies on a Plate,” Step 2) into a microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by finger vortexing.",
    "Pause point: Once fixative is applied to the culture, store at 4°C.\nNote: Fixative will instantaneously preserve the culture once applied and may be stored at 4°C for up to one week.\nCritical: For an accurate representation of the percentage of live cells within a culture, perform the direct counts at a later time, or date, after all fluorescent stain imaging is completed.\nResuspend the fixed cells (using a micropipettor) to ensure all cells are completely suspended (no pellet or clumps should be visible). Apply 20 μL of the fixative-culture mixture to a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber and apply the manufacturer-provided re-enforced cover slip.\nAllow 2 min to elapse for reduced capillary motion.\nCritical: Failure to suspend an observable pellet or dissociate clumping will affect the repeatability and accuracy of the direct counts.\nView chamber under a table-top phase-contrast microscope at 400× magnification perform total cell counts (as a reference, boxes to be counted are highlighted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.4]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/920-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Pictogram of petroff-hausser counting chamber centric counting area\nBacterial counts are performed on the 5 highlighted diagonal boxes. Within each box lies a grid composed of 16 smaller sub-quadrants where bacteria are counted.\nOnce bacteria are counted, adjust the average number of cells in each of the 5 diagonal quadrants to account for the 5× fixative dilution by multiplying with 1.25 (100/80=1.25), calculated as follows:\nCells per milliliter (refer to Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for a reference range)\n   total cells counted 5  × 25 × 50,000 × 1.25  \nPercentage of cells that form colonies Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.6]\n     CFU milliliter   ( Isolating Colonies on a Plate ;  step  5 )     Cells milliter   ( Direct Cell Counts ;  step  10 a )    × 100",
    "Note: Cells touching the left and top edges in each sub-quadrant are counted whereas the right and bottom edges are not.\nNote: A cell with a clear septum is counted as two cells.\nStaining to detect live or dead cells\nTiming: 2–4 h\nNormalized cultures are treated with stains for the detection of live and dead cells and visualized by fluorescence microscopy to enumerate the percentage of living cells.\nCentrifuge the remainder of the standardized 1.0 mL of the 0.100 OD culture prepared in “Isolating Colonies on a Plate,” step 2 at 2,900 × g for 2 min.\nProceed from “Optimizing Stain Fluorescence for live and dead cells” steps 17–22.\nNote: For step 21 photograph at least several hundred cells via differential interference contrast, or phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy using Cy3 or Texas Red and FITC filters across triplicate cultures.\nFrom the array of experimental images captured, calculate:\nThe percentage of live cells by staining Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.10]\n   Live Cells  Live Cells + Dead Cells    x  100  \nNote: In predivisional cells, if a clear septum is visible, count them as two entities (Stott et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). Some compartmentalized late predivisional cells stain green in one compartment (SYTO9) and red in the other (propidium iodide)."
