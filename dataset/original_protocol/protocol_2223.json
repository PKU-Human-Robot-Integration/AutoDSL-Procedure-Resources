Culturing of mouse hippocampal neurons\n(A) Dissecting microscope and surgical instruments used for hippocampal dissection.\n(B) Dissect whole brain from P0 C57BL/6J mouse. Arrows indicate direction of cuts.\n(C) Mouse brain before and after stripping away meninges.\n(D) Isolate the hippocampus from the cortex.\n(E) Trypsinize hippocampi, rinse with the DMEM culture medium and collect tissue for trituration. Shown are hippocampi before and after trypsinization.\n(F) Rinse PDL-coated coverslips with autoclaved distilled water.\n(G) Plate dissociated hippocampal neurons on coverslips. Replenish culture medium regularly Scale bars: 1 mm.\nPreparation of coverslips for dissociated culture of primary hippocampal neurons\nTiming: 3–7 days\nSoak coverslips in cleaning solution for 12–16 h or longer in 150 mm glass petri plates on a flat rotator.\nRemove cleaning solution, rinse coverslips sequentially with distilled water (dH2O) and double distilled water (ddH2O) for more than ten times each on a flat rotator, change water every 30 min or longer.\nNote: Concentrated sulfuric acid in cleaning solution removes inorganic and organic dirt on the surface of coverslips and produces a large number of hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl groups and other reactive groups by dissociating the sodium, potassium and calcium cations, which renders coverslips highly hydrophilic. As sulfuric acid is harmful to cells, it is imperative to rinse the coverslips thoroughly before coating and plating of cells.\nRinse coverslips twice with absolute alcohol for 1 h or longer on a flat rotator.\nAutoclave sterilize the coverslips in 90 mm glass petri dish.\nStore and use the coverslips in 3 months.\nCritical: Separate the coverslips piece by piece in glass petri dish before sterilization to avoid adhesion to each other.",
    "Coating of coverslips with Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) in a tissue culture hood\nTiming: ≥2 h\nAdd coverslips into 24-well cell culture plate, one coverslip per well.\nCoat coverslips with 300 μL PDL solution (0.1 mg/mL) for at least 2 h before culturing of primary neurons. Proceed to step 15 during trypsin treatment of hippocampal cells.\nCritical: PDL can be repeatedly used and discarded if used more than 15 times.\nPreparation of surgical instruments\nTiming: 20–30 min\nSterilize surgical instruments (Dissection tools were purchased from manufacturers in China. Equivalents can be found at https://www.dumonttweezers.com/[href=https://www.dumonttweezers.com/]) by ultraviolet light irradiation or soaking in 75% ethanol for more than 20 min and air dry in a tissue culture hood before use (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nDissection of mouse hippocampi\nTiming: 30–60 min\nAdd 15 mL dissection buffer to a sterile 100 mm cell culture petri dish for dissection and 1 mL dissection buffer to a 1.5 mL sterile Eppendorf tube for collection of hippocampi. Keep the 1.5 mL sterile Eppendorf tube with dissection buffer on ice.\nSanitize P0 C57BL/6J mouse by quick immersion in 75% ethanol, transfer the pup to a sterile petri dish, and decapitate mouse quickly with sharp straight delicate scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nFix the head with straight ophthalmic forceps, cut the skull along the medulla oblongata with mayo spring scissors, dissect out mouse brain and transfer to precooled dissection buffer in 100 mm petri dish with a small spatula.\nRemove the olfactory bulb, epencephalon and brainstem, thoroughly strip away meninges under a dissecting microscope (stereomicroscope) with a pair of fine smooth forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). For more detailed description of brain tissue preparation, please refer to Güler et al. (Güler et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Reverse the brain, fix it gently on the periphery of the cortex with fine forceps, cut off one hippocampus from the cortex, clear up the meninges and remove extra tissue from the hippocampus with fine smooth forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Isolate the other hippocampus from the contralateral side of the cortex.\nTransfer hippocampus to the precooled dissection buffer in 1.5 mL sterile Eppendorf tube, keep the tube on ice until all hippocampi are collected. Put no more than 6 hippocampi in one tube. Transfer to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube for later steps if more than 6 hippocampi are collected.\nCritical: Removing extra tissue from the inner side of hippocampi can effectively reduce the number of glial cells in neuronal culture.\nDissociation and plating of hippocampal neurons\nTiming: 1 h\nRemove the dissection buffer, add 0.25% trypsin (# hippocampi ≤ 6: 1.5 mL, ˃ 6 : 2–5 mL) and keep the tube in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37°C) for 15–17 min, gently reverse the centrifuge tube 3–4 times every 5 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nDuring trypsinization of hippocampal tissue, aspirate off PDL from coverslips, add 500 μL autoclaved ddH2O to wells, shake the plate gently and keep coverslips in water for 5 min or shorter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nRepeat step 15 at least twice.\nAspirate off water, position coverslips in the center of wells, and let them air dry for less than 10 min in the hood, then keep the plate in a humidified incubator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nRemove 0.25% trypsin, rinse the hippocampi with equal volume of DMEM culture medium by reversing the tube 6–8 times gently and let stand for 3 min at 21°C–25°C or until the hippocampi settle at the bottom (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nRemove the culture medium and repeat rinsing of hippocampi twice.",
    "Add 0.5 mL DMEM culture medium, transfer hippocampi to a fresh 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and gently triturate the hippocampal tissue 8 times with P1000 pipette. Let the tube stand still for ∼ 3 min, transfer the supernatant (dissociated cells in suspension) to a fresh 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 0.5 mL DMEM culture medium to the pellet and repeat gentle trituration with P1000 pipette for 8 times to dissociate more cells. Let the tube stand still for ∼ 3 min, collect the supernatant and discard the pellet.\nCombine the supernatants (cell suspensions) collected from steps 20 and 21.\nCount the number of cells in suspension with a hemocytometer.\nNote: If the cell suspension is too diluted, concentrate by centrifugation at 300×g for 10 min, remove the supernatant and resuspend cells with appropriate volume of DMEM culture medium.\nAdd hippocampal neurons in 60–70 μL DMEM culture medium on air-dried PDL-coated coverslip carefully at a density of 2–3×104 cells/well, keep the tissue culture plate in humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37°C) for 5–10 min. Then add 450 μL DMEM culture medium into each well, incubate in humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37°C) for 4 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nReplace DMEM with 500 μL Neurobasal-A culture medium pre-warmed to 37°C.\nReplenish the dissociated culture by adding 500 μL of fresh Neurobasal-A culture medium to each well on Day 3 in vitro (DIV3) and every three days afterward.",
    "Critical: Repeat step 15 for 5 times when coating coverslips with fresh PDL. Move coverslips to the center of wells using pipette tip while sucking water with vacuum pump. Air dry coverslips in appropriate time, as culture medium would flow out of coverslips if too wet and could not spread throughout coverslips if too dry. Keeping plates in humidified incubator before culture prevents coverslips from being overly dry. Avoid generation of air bubbles when triturating hippocampal tissue in medium. To prevent cell damage during plating and medium replenishment, operate on well wall when removing or adding culture medium and avoid touching the well bottom or coverslips.\nPreparation two (optional): Transient transfection to express green or red fluorescent protein as morphological marker, or overexpress/silence gene of interest\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes transfection of mouse hippocampal neurons in dissociated culture with the Lipofectamine® LTX & PLUS™ Reagents (http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/LipofectamineLTX_PLUS_Reag_protocol.pdf[href=http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/LipofectamineLTX_PLUS_Reag_protocol.pdf]).\nDilute 0.5 μg DNA in 50 μL Neurobasal-A Medium, then add 0.5 μL PLUS™ Reagent and mix gently by pipetting up and down. Incubate for 5 min at 21°C–25°C.\nDilute 1 μL Lipofectamine® LTX Reagent in 50 μL Neurobasal-A Medium and mix gently. Incubate for 5 min at 21°C–25°C.\nAdd the mixture of diluted DNA and PLUS™ Reagent to diluted Lipofectamine® LTX Reagent and mix gently. Incubate for 20 min at 21°C–25°C.\nReplace the culture medium in each well of the 24-well culture plate with 400 μL Neurobasal-A Medium (pre-warmed to 37°C). Save the culture medium in a new centrifuge tube for later use. To achieve high transfection efficiency, the transfection is usually performed on DIV 3–12.\nAdd the DNA-lipid complex to neurons cultured in 24-well culture plate drop by drop. Shake the plate gently back and forth to uniformly disperse the DNA-lipid complex.",
    "Incubate neurons for 50–60 min at 37°C, and replace the DNA-lipid complex with culture medium (mixture of old and fresh Neurobasal-A culture medium, and the fresh medium accounts for 1/3–1/2 of the total volume).\nIncubate neurons at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 72 h or longer to express mCherry in neurons as cell fill (morphological marker).\nCritical: Do gently mix the Lipofectamine® LTX Reagent and Lipofectamine PLUS™ Reagent in their original tubes respectively before use. Prolonged incubation with the membrane-perforating transfection reagent may cause damage or even death of primary neurons, so the incubation time should be no longer than 1 h.\nIntracellular PIP staining of primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons\nTiming: 5–6 h\nFor intracellular PIP staining of primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, all steps were performed at 21°C–25°C. This protocol was modified from a previously published protocol described by Hammond et al. (Hammond et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nFor intracellular PIP staining without any manipulation before fixation, please refer to step a. For staining with manipulation, such as inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) before fixation (Guo et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), please refer to step b.\nNote: Keeping growth medium at the fixation step can protect neuronal cells from shrinking caused by hypo-osmotic shock. Likewise, 4% sucrose is added to the fixing solution to maintain osmolality when neurons are incubated in medium-free buffer for drug treatments such as LTP induction. There is no apparent difference between the two fixation methods in terms of final output.\nFix neurons in 200 μL medium by adding 200 μL PBS containing 4% FA (pre-warmed to 21°C–25°C) along the sidewall of the culture plate to a final concentration of 2%, and incubate for 15 min at 21°C–25°C.",
    "Note: Compared with FA, GA is a much stronger fixative that irreversibly crosslinks proteins. GA preserves membrane effectively but may alter protein configuration to mask target epitopes, and prevents penetration of antibodies into the cell interior by crosslinking proteins in the cytoplasm, so it is only used for immunostaining of PM-distributed antigens. For immunostaining of intracellular PIPs and proteins, mild fixation of cells with 2% FA allows accession of antibodies to epitopes located at the cytosolic side of endomembranes.\nRemove buffer or medium and fix neurons rapidly by adding 400 μL PBS containing 2% FA and 4% sucrose (pre-warmed to 21°C–25°C) along the sidewall of the culture plate and incubate for 15 min at 21°C–25°C.\nRinse neurons three times with PBS containing 50 mM NH4Cl, 5 min each.\nPermeabilize neurons with buffer A containing 25 μg/mL digitonin for 5–10 min.\nNote: Digitonin is a weak nonionic detergent, which at low concentrations selectively renders the plasma membrane permeable but leaves intracellular organelles intact, so it is used for immunodetection of antigens located at the cytosolic side of endomemebranes.\nRinse neurons immediately for three times with buffer A, 5 min each.\nBlock neurons with buffer A containing 5% (v/v) NGS and 50 mM NH4Cl for 45 min.\nRinse neurons once with buffer A.\nIncubate neurons with primary antibodies (PI3P, Z-P003, Echelon, 1:50, PI4P, Z-P004, Echelon, 1:200, or PI(4,5)P2, Z-A045, Echelon, 1:150 and Rab8, R5530, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:150 or TGN46, ab50595, Abcam, 1:200) in buffer A containing 5% NGS for 1 h.\nRinse neurons for three times with buffer A, 5 min each.",
    "Incubate neurons with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, IgG, A-11001, 1:1500 or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, IgM, A-21042, 1:1500 and Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit, IgG, A-31573, 1:1500) in buffer A containing 5% NGS for 45 min away from light. Do keep neurons away from light for the rest of the procedure.\nRinse neurons for three times with buffer A, 5 min each.\nPostfix neurons with 2% FA in PBS for 5 min.\nRinse neurons for three times with PBS containing 50 mM NH4Cl to remove the residual FA.\nIncubate neurons with PBS containing DAPI for 5 min.\nMount coverslips on glass slide with mounting medium after one rinse with PBS and then with distilled ddH2O.\nCritical: Do not move the coverslips during fixation, and handle them gently when rinsing cells or aspirating the liquid (with a vacuum pump) to preserve the integrity of neurons. Avoid excessive permeabilization which will cause severe loss of signals.\nUsing the procedures described above, we performed costaining of intracellular PIP (PI3P, PI4P or PI(4,5)P2) and Rab8 (protein marker for secretory endosome) or TGN46 (protein marker for the trans-Golgi network) in neurons. The intracellular PIPs and Rab8/TGN46 were detected easily with the intracellular staining procedure (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). We can see in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] that the distribution of PI3P, PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 in neurons are different. Overall, both the cell body and dendrites are enriched in PI3P and PI4P, whereas PI(4,5)P2 signals in the cell body are scarce. Different PIPs show differential distribution indicated by their extent of colocalization with Rab8 and TGN46. Specifically, colocalization of PI4P with Rab8 is slightly higher than PI3P and PI(4,5)P2 (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C, 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]I, and 5J).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1831-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Mouse hippocampal neurons were fixed on DIV12 and co-immnunostained for intracellular PI3P, PI4P or PI(4,5)P2 and Rab8 or TGN46. DAPI-stained cell nuclei are shown in blue.\n(A–F) Shown are representative confocal microscopy images of intracellular PI3P and Rab8 (A), intracellular PI4P and Rab8 (B), intracellular PI(4,5)P2 and Rab8 (C), intracellular PI3P and TGN46 (D), intracellular PI4P and TGN46 (E), intracellular PI(4,5)P2 and TGN46 (F). Rab8: protein marker for secretory endosomes, TGN46: protein marker for the trans-Golgi network. Lower panels are magnifications of outlined regions in the top panels. Scale bars: 5 μm.\nPlasma membrane (PM) PIP staining of primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons\nTiming: 5–6 h\nFor PM PIP staining of primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, all steps were performed on ice with all buffers and solutions pre-chilled after removing the fixing reagent with rinsing buffer. This protocol was also modified from a previously published protocol described by Hammond et al. (Hammond et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nFor PM PIP staining without any manipulation before fixation, please refer to step a. For staining with manipulation, such as inducing LTP in neurons before fixation (Guo et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), please refer to step b.\nFix neurons rapidly in 200 μL medium by adding 200 μL PBS containing 8% FA and 0.4% GA (pre-warmed to 21°C–25°C) along the sidewall of the culture plate to a final concentration of 4% FA and 0.2% GA for 15 min at 21°C–25°C.\nRemove buffer or medium and fix neurons rapidly with 400 μL PBS containing 4% FA, 0.2% GA and 4% sucrose (pre-warmed to 21°C–25°C) along the sidewall of the culture plate for 15 min at 21°C–25°C.\nRinse neurons three times with PBS containing 50 mM NH4Cl at 21°C–25°C, 5 min each.\nPlace coverslips in ice bath for 4 min to pre-chill samples before blocking.",
    "Block neurons with buffer A containing 5% (v/v) NGS, 50 mM NH4Cl and 0.5% saponin for 45 min.\nNote: Saponin can punch holes in the cell membrane by specifically dissolving cholesterol in the cell membrane, thus allowing access of antibodies to antigens located at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Because saponin-mediated cell permeabilization is reversible, it is critical to keep the cells in the presence of low concentration saponin (0.1%) during PM immunostaining.\nRinse neurons once with buffer A.\nIncubate neurons with primary antibodies (PI3P, Z-P003, Echelon, 1:50, PI4P, Z-P004, Echelon, 1:100, or PI(4,5)P2, Z-A045, Echelon, 1:50 and endophilin A1, 159002, Synaptic Systems, 1:100) in buffer A containing 5% NGS and 0.1% saponin for 1 h.\nRinse neurons twice with buffer A, 5 min each.\nIncubate neurons with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, IgG, A-11001, 1:1500 or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, IgM, A-21042, 1:1500 and Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit, IgG, A-31573, 1:1500) in buffer A containing 5% NGS and 0.1% saponin for 45 min away from light. Do keep neurons away from light for the rest of the procedure.\nRinse neurons for three times with buffer A, 5 min each.\nPostfix neurons with 2% FA in PBS on ice for 10 min before warming to 21°C–25°C for an additional 5 min.\nRinse neurons for three times with PBS containing 50 mM NH4Cl to remove the residual FA.\nIncubate neurons with PBS containing DAPI for 5 min.\nMount coverslips on glass slide with mounting medium after one rinse with PBS and then with distilled ddH2O.",
    "Critical: Do not move the coverslips during fixation, and handle the coverslips gently when rinsing cells and aspirating the liquid with a vacuum pump to keep the integrity of neurons. Do all the manipulations on ice after removing the fixing reagent to prevent lipid molecules from fast diffusion in cellular membranes.\nFollowing the protocol described above, we performed the PM PIP (PI3P, PI4P and PI(4,5)P2) staining (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C), and the costaining of PI(4,5)P2 and endophilin A1 (EEN1, a peripheral membrane protein (Yang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) in neurons (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). The staining results show that PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 distribute in the PM of neurons with different patterns (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1831-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Immunofluorescence staining of PM PIPs and EEN1 in mouse hippocampal neurons\nMouse hippocampal neurons were transfected with pAOV-CaMKIIα-mCherry-2A-3Flag on DIV5 to express mCherry as volume marker (Note: the CaMKIIα promoter drives gene expression specifically in excitatory neurons but not inhibitory neurons) (Kohara et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), fixed on DIV8 and immnunostained for PM PI3P, PI4P or PI(4,5)P2. DAPI-stained cell nuclei are shown in blue.\n(A–D) Shown are representative confocal microscopy images of PM PI3P (A), PM PI4P (B), PM PI(4,5)P2 (C), and costaining of PM PI(4,5)P2 and PM EEN1 (D). Lower panels are magnifications of boxed regions in the top panels. Scale bars: 5 μm.\nOf note, consistent with previous studies, PI3P is not detected in the PM of neurons (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Furthermore, using PI(4,5)P2 as a control for antigens located in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the PM, PM-associated endophilin A1 was labeled successfully (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) (Yang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), demonstrating the applicability of the PM staining method to proteins localized at the inner leaflet of the PM.\nQuantitative analysis of fluorescent images",
    "To measure the signal intensity of PIPs or proteins in neurons, we used different methods to quantitatively analyze confocal images of intracellular and PM PIP staining. First, we analyzed the intensity of intracellular PIPs or Rabs (for example, intracellular PI3P and Rab8 in dendrites of neurons expressing mCherry (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])) with the Fiji-ImageJ software (NIH).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1831-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Switch to channel 3 (Rab8) with Channels Tool (Channels Tool / Color / Channel 3) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F), press M or click Analyze/Measure to measure fluorescence mean intensity of Rab8 in ROI (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nTransfer the data to Excel, analyze the mean intensity of PI3P or Rab8 of more than 10 neurons. Perform statistical analysis (t-tests or One-way ANOVA) using the GraphPad Prism software.\nFrom the above results, we can see that intracellular PIP staining method can be employed to investigate distribution of PIPs in protein marker-labeled organelles or vesicular structures. Next, we performed colocalization analysis of PIPs and Rab proteins with the NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) (alternatively, use Fiji-ImageJ), for example, the colocalization between PI4P and the Rab8-positive secretory endosome (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1831-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
