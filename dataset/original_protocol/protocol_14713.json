    "Note: The acquisition process for obtaining capillary images has previously been published and is accomplished using a still digital camera with a corresponding image acquisition and analysis computer program. 1121 This lab utilizes still images for analysis, not videos, simplifying image acquisition for analysis. The following describes the new technique for quantitating the capillaries from the images.\n1. Image Enhancement Process\nObtain digital images with a monochrome digital camera. Calibrate the images to an object of known size by taking a picture of an object of known length such as a ruler with the camera. This process allows the computer program to measure and count capillaries accurately after processing. Ideally for the highest precision, a reticule (scientifically manufactured piece of glass with a ruler etched into it) should be used. Measure the number of pixels in a 1 mm square box using a computer program.\n\tNote: The key to the reproducibility and standardization of this protocol depends largely upon proper placement of the 1 mm2 box that is counted.\nUse contrast enhancement tools to darken the capillaries and lighten the background, which will maximize visualization of the capillaries. Initial differentiation of capillaries from background is important for proper cropping of the image in later steps. Do this by adjusting the image using a “best fit histogram.” To do this click on: capture, intensity, image histogram, best fit.\nCrop a region of interest (ROI) for capillary counting as a new image (select, regions of interest). Use a 1 mm2 box, which was determined by calibrating the images at 530 pixels equaling 1 mm. check that the cropped image places the apex of the capillary loops at the very top of the image.",
    "Flatten the image so all future image adjustments will be evenly applied to the image. To do this click on: process tab, 2D filters, flatten, BG intensity of “bright,” object width to “75,” apply.\nRaise the contrast of the image so capillaries are maximally visualized. To do this click on: adjust tab, display, raise contrast to 75.\nDespeckle the image to smooth the edges of the capillaries by clicking on process tab, 2D filters, despeckle, kernel size 7 x 7, apply.\nFinalize the image contrast so capillaries are black and the background is white. Perform this step by adjusting the histogram to the “best fit” model.\n\tNote: Please refer to Figure 2 in Representative Results for an example of what the processed image should look like following these steps.\n2. Performing Capillary Counts / Quantitating Capillary Density\nOn each image, manually select one part of a well-defined capillary using the “target object” feature to be recognized as objects to be counted by the program. Then, select a small part of background, using the “background” feature, as a reference to areas that need to be disregarded by the counting algorithm.\n\tNote: The combination of these highlights causes all capillaries to be highlighted while disregarding the background noise. The quantitation (counting) protocol utilizes computer functions to differentiate parts of the image based on color and morphology.\nUse the count function to instantly count all capillaries in the image with the imaging equipment. Set the minimum diameter of counted objects to 5 pixels in order to avoid counting background noise as capillaries.\nFor each individual, count the average of 3 - 4 images in order to obtain a more reliable assessment.",
    "Note: Please refer to Figure 3 in Representative Results for an example of what the image should look like during the counting procedure.\n3. Creating and Using Macros to Automate Image Processing\nNote: To save time, macros can be created in order to automatically perform a specific sequence of processes on one or many images. These sequences can be customized in order to make the image modifications quicker. In essence, these macros remember how the images are processed, and perform all the steps quickly and with no user input. Performing counts on 12 capillary images takes this lab between 20 to 30 min with the macros (2 to 3 min per picture), as opposed to about 8 min per picture without the macros. Therefore using the macros is 3 to 5 times more efficient than manually processing each individual image.\nIn order to create a macro, select “record macro” and on one image perform the steps and processes desired, as described in steps 1 and 2 above. Name the macro based on which image processing steps were performed for future reference. When using the macro on future pictures, simply click “run macro” and the program will automatically apply the recorded enhancements to the image(s) desired.\n\tNote: This lab uses a macro to perform all but one of the steps in Section 1 of the methods in a few seconds. The only step that requires user input is choosing where to crop the image, Step 1.2.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
