    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTumor dissociation\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes how to process solid tumor samples into single-cell suspension in order to isolate each cell population. We recommend to process the sample few hours after the surgical collection, but the tumor can be stored into the medium tube at 4°C up to 24 h.\nDecontaminate working spaces under the hood and equipment (scissor and tweezers) with 70% ethyl alcohol before beginning.\nPrepare enzyme digestion mix in a 15 mL tube:\nAdd 4.7 mL of RPMI medium without serum and any other supplements.\nAdd 200 μL of enzyme H, 100 μL of enzyme R and 25 μL of enzyme A into the tube.\nMix well by vortexing.\nCut the tumor into small pieces of approximately 2 mm3 and place it directly into the enzyme mix.\nPlace the sample into a 37°C incubator under continuous rotation during 40 min.\nNote: Usually, we obtained 4 to 12 cm3 tumor sample. The protocol is for around 6 cm3 tumor sample volume and we recommend splitting the tumor into two mix enzyme tubes if it is larger than 6 cm3.\nPlace a 100 μm cell strainer on 50 mL tube and rinse the cell strainer with 1 mL of culture medium.\nTransfer digested tumor pieces on the cell strainer with the enzyme digestion medium.\nSmash the tumor gently with the flat end of a 1 mL syringe plunger (remove the plunger from the syringe).\nRegularly wash the cell strainer with culture medium during smashing of the tumor.\nContinue to smash until the maximum of tumor tissue is dissociated.\nWash the cell strainer until reaching 48 mL of cell suspension volume in the 50 mL tube.",
    "Critical: At this step, if the tumor is over smashed or smashed with too much force, there is a risk to decrease cell viability, especially for tumor cells, which are often sensitive. Depending on the tumor features, some tissue fragments with calcifications are not well digested and cannot be dissociated in single-cell suspension. These fragments are tough to dissect and have to be wasted after the washing step of the cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 10 min at 400–500 × g.\nDuring the centrifugation, prepare 5 mL of Red Blood Cell (RBC) lysis solution 1×.\nDiscard the supernatant and keep a small volume of medium into the tube (around 500 μL).\nDissociate gently the pellet by tapping the tube.\nResuspend slowly the pellet with 5 mL of RBC lysis solution using a 5 mL pipette and make 5× up and down.\nIncubate 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20 mL culture medium.\nCount the number of cells and the viability with trypan blue solution.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of culture medium.\nSet apart around 0.5–1 million of total cells for flow cytometry staining in a 5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g, discard the supernatant and proceed to column cell isolation (see Isolation of tumor-resident memory T cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]).",
    "Pause Point: It is possible to keep cells in culture for 24 h before the isolation of CD8+ T cells; however, the viability could be reduced. For cell culture, plate cells in a 6-well cell culture plate at 2 million/mL in rIL2 culture medium, and place cells in 37°C incubator. Another possibility is to freeze cells in freezing media at 10–20 million cells/mL. However, this process will also give rise to cell mortality. The tumor cell population is the most sensitive cell subset.\nFor flow cytometry staining, centrifuge cell suspension (0.5–1 million of total cells) for 5 min at 400–500 × g, discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of PBS.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g, discard the supernatant.\nNote: During the following steps, cells have to be protected from light with aluminum foil.\nDuring the spin, prepare LIVE/DEAD Fixable blue viability staining by diluting 0.1 μL of concentrated stock with 100 μL of PBS.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 100 μL of diluted LIVE/DEAD Fixable blue and incubate 25 min at 20°C–25°C .\nDuring the incubation, prepare the antibody mix (see mix 1).\nAdd 100 μL of FACS buffer and centrifuge 5 min at 400–500 × g, discard supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 25 μL of Fc block solution diluted 1/10 with FACS buffer. Incubate 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd directly on cell suspension the 25 μL of antibody mix 1 (concentrated 2×). Incubate 25 min on ice.\nWash by adding 300 μL of FACS buffer in the tube. Centrifuge 5 min at 400–500 × g, discard supernatant.\nResuspend in 200 μL FACS buffer and filter cell suspension on a 50 μm cell strainer before analysis with Fortessa 488/640/405/561/355 (BD Biosciences ) flow cytometer.",

Gating strategy for analyses of tumor-infiltrating CD8+CD103+ TRM cells by flow cytometry\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_366_8.csv\nPause Point: The stained cell could be keep 12–20 h at 4°C before flow cytometer analyses. To keep the cells intact, we recommend fixing the cells with 100 μL of diluted FoxP3 fixation/permeabilization solution according to the manufacturer protocol. Wash cell suspension with 100 μL of FACS buffer, centrifuge, and resuspend in 200 μL of FACS buffer. Keep at 4°C up to 24 h until flow cytometer analysis.\nIsolation of tumor-resident memory T cells\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the protocol leading to the isolation of the CD8+CD103+ TRM cell population. First, it consists in a positive selection of total CD8+ T cell population with magnetic bead Miltenyi system and it is followed by the FACS isolation of CD8+CD103+ T cells.\nCritical: This section has to be processed under biosafety hood and in sterile conditions.\nResuspend total cells in cold Miltenyi buffer at the concentration of 10 × 106 total cells for 80 μL.\nAdd 20 μL of human CD8 microbeads for 10 × 106 total cells and mix well with up and down pipetting. Incubate at 4°C during 15 min.\nNote: Always wait until the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\nAttach the magnet to the magnetic stand and place the LS column in the magnet field of a suitable Miltenyi magnet.\nAdd the 50 μm pre-separation filter in the LS column.\nEquilibrate the column by pipetting 3 mL cold Miltenyi Buffer into the 50 μm pre-separation filter. Wait until the column reservoir is empty.",
    "Place a 15 mL tube under the column to collect unlabeled cells. The unlabeled CD8-negative cells will be in the flow through from the column.\nAfter incubation with microbeads, wash cells by adding 5 mL cold Miltenyi buffer. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g and aspirate the supernatant completely.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL cold Miltenyi buffer (or 500 μL if less than 10 million cells).\nApply cell suspension through the cell strainer in the LS column. If the cell suspension is dense or contains a lot of dead cells, split the volume to pass cell suspension through two cell strainers. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nWhen cell suspension is passed through the column, wash by adding 3 mL of cold Miltenyi buffer. Keep collecting the flow through into the 15 mL tube. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nOptional: The negative fraction contains tumor cells for further cell separation (see the section Isolation of tumor cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]).\nWhen the column reservoir is empty, perform washing steps by adding 3 mL of Miltenyi buffer. Repeat step 26 three times.\nWhen the column reservoir is empty, remove the LS column from the magnet and place it in a new collection 15 mL tube.\nTo recover the positive CD8+ fraction, add 5 mL of Miltenyi buffer in the LS column and immediately flush out the cells by pushing the plunger into the column.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g, aspirate the supernatant completely, and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL culture medium.\nCount the number of cells in the positive fraction and the viability with trypan blue solution.\nCentrifuge the CD8+ cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g.",
    "Optional: It is possible to keep CD8+ cells in culture to amplify them in culture medium supplemented with 50 U/mL of recombinant (r)IL-2. Plate cells in a 96-V-well culture plate at 10,000 cells/200 μL/well and place it in 37°C incubator. Another possibility is to freeze cells; resuspend total cells in 1 mL in freezing media and place the tube at −80°C.\nNote: All cells and reagents should be kept on ice during this section of the protocol to prevent cell death.\nWhile the cells spin, prepare the following antibody mix 2 (for up to 20 million cells, scale up accordingly)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_366_9.csv\nCritical: We recommend avoiding sorting the cells with anti-CD3 antibody as it could result in non-specific activation of T cells and consequently biased results.\nAspirate supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet with the antibody mix and incubate for 20 min at 4°C (protect the tube from light).\nAdd 3 mL of culture medium and centrifuge the CD8+ cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g.\nResuspend cells in culture medium at a concentration of approximately 10 million cells/mL.\nFilter the cell suspension in a 50 μm cell strainer.\nAdd to the cell suspension TO-PRO3 iodide at a final concentration of 0.1 μM just prior to cell sorting.\nNote: We use an aliquot of stained cells for area scaling and setting sort gates.\nNote: The TO-PRO3 iodide is added just prior to FACS in order to prevent overstaining that can occur with prolonged exposure (not more than 1 h) of cells to TO-PRO3 iodide.\nPrepare two 5 mL tubes containing 1 mL of culture medium to collect the sorted cell populations.\nSort cells on a BD FACS Aria fusion 488/561/640/405/355 (Becton Dickinson).",
    "Note: A 85 μm nozzle is used with 45 psi pressure and frequency fixed at 60 kH. Adjust the sorting rate at 4,000 events/s.\nSort desired CD8+CD103+ and CD8+KLRG1+ (or CD8+CD103−) populations, according to the gating strategy (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), into culture medium in sterile, capped tubes and transfer onto ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/366-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating strategy for sorting CD8+CD103+ and CD8+KLRG1+ cells by FACS\nPause Point: For culture of T cell populations, centrifuge cell suspension in conic 15 mL tube or 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and resuspend in culture medium with rIL-2 (final concentration at 50 U/mL) at 0.2 to 0.5 million/mL and transfer in culture plate.\nNote: T cells can be cultured and amplify for several days in culture medium with rIL-2. The culture medium needs to be replaced every 4 or 5 days.\nPause Point: For RNA sequencing analyses, add 2 mL PBS in the tube containing the sorted cells and centrifuge cell suspension in conic 15 mL tube or 1 mL Eppendorf tube for 10 min at 500 × g. Remove completely and carefully the supernatant with a 200 μL pipette without touching the cell pellet. Resuspend cell pellet directly in 100 μL buffer RL (Kit Norgen) supplemented with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and mix by pipetting up and down a few times. Proceed with the RNA purification (Kit Norgen) according to the manufacturer protocol, or keep the cell lysate at −80°C until RNA extraction.

    "This section describes the isolation of tumor cells from the CD8-negative cell fraction obtained previously. The isolation of tumor cells is based on Tumor Cell Isolation Kit from Miltenyi, designed for the enrichment of untouched tumor cells and depletion of non-tumor cells (see manufacturer protocol at https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/FR-en/products/tumor-cell-isolation-kit-human.html#130-108-339[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/FR-en/products/tumor-cell-isolation-kit-human.html#130-108-339]). The isolation of CD8+ T cells and autologous tumor cells enable to perform in vitro functional experiments to assess the tumor specificity of CD8+ T cell populations, as such cytotoxicity with chromium51 release assay or conjugate formation.\nDetermine the number of cells in the CD8-negative fraction.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g. Aspirate the supernatant completely.\nResuspend up to 10 million total cells in 60 μL of cold Miltenyi buffer (scale up according to cell number).\nAdd 20 μL of Non-tumor cell depletion Cocktail A and 20 μL of Non-tumor cell depletion Cocktail B for up to 10 million cells (scale up according to the cell number), mix well with up and down pipetting and incubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: CD8-negative fraction cells could be kept at 4°C for 3 h before cell isolation; however, longer storage could result in reduction of cell viability.\nNote: For next steps, always wait until the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\nDuring incubation, place the LS column in the magnet field of a Miltenyi magnet.\nAdd the 50 μm pre-separation filter in the LS column.\nEquilibrate the LS column by pipetting 3 mL cold Miltenyi Buffer into the pre-separation filter. Wait until the column reservoir is empty.\nPlace a 15 mL tube under the LS column to collect unlabeled cells. The unlabeled tumor cells will be in the flow through from the column.",
    "Bring up the cell suspension to 500 μL of cold Miltenyi buffer for up to 10 million cells (scale up according to the cell number).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/366-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Purity of sorted CD8+ TRM cells post-FACS\nApply cell suspension through the cell strainer in the LS column.\nWhen the column reservoir is empty, perform washing steps by adding 1 mL of Miltenyi buffer in the column. Keep collecting the flow through from the washing steps into the 15 mL tube containing the unlabeled cells.\nRepeat step 49 once.\nOptional: The labeled fraction containing non-tumor cells can be recovered by removing the column from the magnet, placing it into a new 15 mL tube, adding 3 mL of Miltenyi buffer, and immediately flushing out the cells by pushing the plunger into the column.\nDetermine the cell number and viability with trypan blue solution of the untouched tumor cells.\nCentrifuge the tumor cell suspension for 5 min at 400–500 × g and discard the supernatant completely.\nResuspend in LC medium at 200,000 tumor cells/mL and plate them in 6/12 or 24-well culture plate depending of the number of cells.\nPlace the cells in incubator 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNote: The number of tumor cells recovered is extremely dependent of the tumor piece. A strong variability between patient tumors exists both for the cancer cell number and for immune cell infiltration.",
    "Note: For the majority of tissue samples, isolated tumor cells usually attached to the plastic culture plate after a few hours of culture. However, depending of the tumor sample, it appends that tumor cells do not attach on the plastic, reflecting a weak viability. To detach tumor cells, we recommend to remove the culture medium, wash with 2–3 mL of PBS, remove the remaining medium and then apply PBS with EDTA diluted at 1/1000. Incubate 2–3 min at 37°C and monitor the detachment of tumor cells under microscope. Perform gently up and down pipetting with a 1 mL pipette to continue detaching adherent cells. Stop the EDTA by adding LC medium and transfer cell suspension in 15 mL tube to centrifuge and resuspend in the desired volume of culture medium."
