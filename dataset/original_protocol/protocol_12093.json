    "NOTE: To measure pHi in the FSC lineage, we calculate the ratio of fluorescence intensities of pHluorin to mCherry in FSCs, pFCs, and follicle cells in physiological conditions, and convert the ratios into pHi values with standard calibration curves for each cell type7. First, live imaging experiments are performed to measure fluorescence intensities of pHluorin and mCherry in germaria dissected into a buffer containing NaHCO3, which mimics physiological conditions1,7. Next, standard curves are generated by measuring pHluorin and mCherry fluorescence intensities in a Na+-free, K+ buffer containing the ionophore nigericin adjusted to two different pH values, 6.5 and 7.5. In the presence of nigericin, pHi equilibrates with the pH of the buffer across the plasma membrane, causing pHi to match the extracellular pH. Lastly, the standard curves are used to convert pHluorin to mCherry ratios to estimated pHi values.\n1. Pre-Trial: Preparation Before Measuring pHi In Vivo\nNOTE: To measure pHi in vivo, the mCherry::pHluorin transgene must be expressed in the cell type of interest. Below are some common ways to generate transgenic pHluorin flies in the FSC lineage. Generating mCherry::pHluorin clones is particularly useful for identifying FSCs, which are located on the anterior edge of an FSC clone. Tissue specific mCherry::pHluorin expression is useful for measuring pHi across the entire tissue and is also more convenient when combining with expression of an RNAi or transgene.\nGeneration of transgenic pHluorin flies\nmCherry::pHluorin-labeled FSC clones\n\t\t\nTo make mCherry::pHluorin FSC clones, cross UAS-mCherry::pHluorin1 to an Act-Gal4 flipout stock or other stock with a Flp/FRT inducible Gal4.\nTo make heatshock inducible clones, heatshock adult F1s for 2 days post eclosion in empty vials for 1 h in a 37 °C water bath, four times approximately every 12 h.",
    "To ensure normal growth and maximum rates of oogenesis during this period, maintain flies by providing fresh wet yeast (approximately equal parts dry baker's yeast and water) daily for at least 6 days after clone induction.\nTissue specific mCherry::pHluorin expression\nCross UAS-mCherry::pHluorin1 to a follicle cell specific driver, y1w*;P{GawB}10930/CyO (Bloomington ID: 7023).\n3 days after flies start eclosing, collect and place them in vials containing wet yeast, for at least 24 h prior to dissection.\nMaking solutions\n\tNOTE: It is important to prepare the following buffers on the day of the experiment because the pH and solute concentrations in the buffer can change over time.\n\t\nPrepare bicarbonate, nigericin, and dissection buffers. Add the components in the order listed to avoid formation of precipitates (Refer to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3).\n2. Trial: Measuring pHi in the FSC Lineage\nNOTE: The dissection, mounting, and live imaging steps for the bicarbonate buffer and the two nigericin buffer conditions may need to be performed twice: once to determine the microscope settings and a second time to collect experimental data. See the section 2.2 below for more information.\nDissection and mounting\n\tNOTE: For materials required to perform this step please refer to Figure 1 and Table of Materials. For 3D printed mounting chambers, 3D printer files are provided as Supplemental File 1 and Supplemental File 2.\n\t\nDissection:\n\t\t\nPrepare mounting chambers by applying a thin coating of vacuum grease to the flatter side of the 3D printed mounting chamber. Place that side on a 22 x 40 mM coverslip to seal the coverslip to the mounting chamber.\nDissect ovaries from female adult flies in 500 µL dissection buffer (bicarbonate or nigericin buffer, Table 3)\n\t\t\nAnesthetize 3 - 4 flies using CO2 gas and transfer flies onto a fly pad perfused with CO2 gas.",
    "Pick up an anesthetized fly with forceps and place into the dissection media.\nPinch the thorax of the fly with one forcep, while tugging on the tip of its abdomen until its ovaries are exposed.\nAfter detaching the ovaries from the other organs, tease apart the ovarioles using 221/2 syringe needles. Carefully separate the muscle sheath from the ovaries and separate individual ovarioles from the cluster of ovarioles. An effective technique to isolate the muscle sheath is to use one syringe needle to hold the cluster of ovarioles in place at its anterior end, and stroke downwards along the length of single ovarioles.\nIncubate the dissected ovaries in dissection media for exactly 10 min before proceeding to the mounting step so that there is enough time for the pHi of cells to fully equilibrate with the pH of the nigericin dissection media.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the muscle sheath is removed from the ovarioles. The muscle sheath may attenuate the fluorescence signal, which makes it difficult to identify individual cells using Concanavilin-A, and may cause ovarioles to move spontaneously during live imaging.\nMounting\n\t\t\nPlace a small drop of dissection media onto the glass coverslip inside the mounting chamber.\nTransfer separated ovarioles using forceps.\nSeparate later stage egg chambers from germaria associated with earlier stage egg chambers, and try to ensure that the dissected germaria are placed at the center of the dissection media drop.\nAdd two small drops of nail polish to opposite sides of a round 12-mm coverslip and let it air dry for about 10 s.",
    "Place the round coverslip on the drop of dissection media containing separated germaria such that that side with nail polish faces down and contacts the dissection media. Press down on the parts of the edge with nail polish to flatten and secure the germaria in position. We recommend using older nail polish because it smears less over the surface of the coverslip as it is being secured in place.\nFill the mounting chamber with additional dissection media. Condition specific buffer that does not contain Concanavalin-A dye can be used to fill the chamber.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The total time spent dissecting and mounting should not exceed 15 min. This is important to minimize the effects of tissue damage and cell death.\nLive imaging:\n\tNOTE: In this step, first collect images from the bicarbonate condition and the two nigericin conditions to determine the proper microscope settings; adjust the microscope settings as necessary, and then collect images for the experimental data. Use a confocal microscope capable of imaging in 3 channels: GFP (475 excitation/509 emission), mCherry (575 excitation/610 emission), and far-red (633 excitation/647 emission).",
    "NOTE: Set Microscope Settings: The pixel intensities of the images collected will be quantified to determine the estimates of pHi, so it is important that the intensity values of the signal in each image set is neither too low nor saturated. The range of intensities that can be captured in an image is defined by the image bit depth. In many cases, 8-bit images are generated by default, but we recommend acquiring the data as 16-bit images, which have a broader dynamic range. It is important to ensure that the crosstalk between fluorescent channels is minimized, so the settings should be adjusted so that the emission spectrum collected from each fluorophore does not overlap. To test these settings, take a sample image using the excitation spectrum for GFP and collect in the emission spectrum for mCherry and vice versa. If the settings have been adjusted properly, there should be no signal in either case. Set the microscope settings (i.e., voltage settings on a laser scanning confocal, laser power and pinhole size) so that the pixel intensities of the signal in all three image sets are within the dynamic range of the image file. For all our experiments, we used a white light laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40x objective to acquire 16-bit images in 1,024 × 1,024 format, while we optimized voltage gain for every experiment as needed. For example, in one experiment, we set the voltage gain for GFP, mCherry, and far-red as 37.8%, 72.9%, and 260%, respectively.\n\t\nImage ovarioles in nigericin dissection buffer at pH 6.5, and adjust settings such that pixel intensities of the pHluorin and mCherry images are low, but not below the limits of detection of the camera.",
    "Image another set of ovarioles in nigericin dissection buffer at pH 7.5 and adjust the settings such that the pixel intensities of the pHluorin and mCherry images are high, but not saturated.\nImage ovaries in bicarbonate dissection buffer and ensure that the pixel intensities of the pHluorin and mCherry images are not saturated with the chosen settings. If the pixels are saturated, adjust the settings as necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: Microscope setting parameters may differ based on the exact microscope setup being used, and must be optimized for each experiment. After microscope settings have been set, do not change them for the remainder of the experiment. Settings should be consistent across control and experimental conditions. In our initial pHi experiments, we generated 2 and 3 point nigericin calibration curves and found no significant difference between calculated pHi using either method. However, in general, the addition of more points in the calibration curve would be expected to improve accuracy. Therefore, we recommend generating curves with different numbers of points to determine how many are needed for a given set of experimental conditions.\nData collection:\n\t\nPerform dissection, mounting, and imaging of the samples in the bicarbonate and nigericin buffer conditions. After dissection and mounting, the maximum time spent imaging one set of samples should not exceed 45 min to ensure that the fluorescence intensity measurements are made in live, healthy tissue.\nFor each condition, acquire images for at least 5 germaria.\n3. Post-trial: Image Analysis\nMeasure fluorescence intensities in FSCs, pFCs, and follicle cells\nBackground subtraction:\n\t\t\nOpen unprocessed images in FIJI with each channel in a separate window (Figure 4C).\nUse the rectangle tool to draw a region of interest (ROI) in the pHluorin channel window in a part of the image without signal.",
    "Optional step: Set the lower limit of the threshold so that pixels with intensity values below background are excluded and set the upper limit of the threshold to maximum. When the threshold is set in this way, the areas of the image without signal are mostly blue and the signal is clearly visible (Figure 4A).\nMeasure the mean fluorescence intensity in the ROI. If the threshold was set in step 3, make sure to check the \"Limit to threshold\" box in the Set Measurements dialog box.\nSubtract the measured background intensity from each channel and slice of the image using the Subtract function, found in the Process → Math menu.\nRepeat steps 3.1.1.2-6 for the mCherry channel window except that, in step 3.1.1.2, instead of drawing a new rectangle with the rectangle tool, use the Restore selection function, found in the Edit→ Selection menu, to add a rectangle with the same dimensions and position on the image.\nIdentify FSCs, pFCs, and follicle cells:\n\t\t\nIdentify the FSCs, pFCs, and follicle cells by morphology and location using the Concanavalin-A staining to find cell boundaries (Figure 2).\nFSCs are thin triangular cells located on the edge of the germarium at the Region 2a/2b border. If mCherry::pHluorin is expressed in an FSC clone, FSC can also be identified as the anterior most cell of the clone.\npFCs are irregular shaped cells in Region 2b, immediately adjacent to and downstream of FSCs.\nFollicle cells are square or columnar cells that surround the germ cell cyst in Region 3.\nObtaining fluorescence intensity ratios\n\t\t\nChoose one or more slices in which the cell of interest has highest fluorescence intensity in the mCherry channel and make sure that the Concanavalin-A staining, seen in the far-red channel, is in focus within the selected slice.",
    "Draw ROI around each FSC and measure the mean fluorescence intensity of pHluorin and mCherry in all slices chosen for measurements.\nDivide the mean fluorescence intensity of the pHluorin channel by the mean fluorescence intensity of the mCherry channel to calculate a ratio of pHluorin to mCherry fluorescence.\nDerive pHi values and generate pseudocolored images\nDerive pHi values\nIn all cases, the linear regression curve should be generated using ovaries from flies of the same genotype for both experimental and control conditions. Generate a linear regression curve for each cell type using the data from two nigericin buffer conditions (Figure 3). In Excel, this can be done by plotting the data on a graph and adding a linear trendline. Alternately, see:\nUse the slope and the y-intercept of the linear regression curve calculated from the nigericin conditions and the equation of a line (y = mx + b) to convert the pHluorin to mCherry ratio values calculated from the samples in the bicarbonate condition to pH values. In this equation, substitute the slope form (the y-intercept) for b, put the ratio value in for x, and solve for y.\nGenerate a pseudocolored image reflecting the ratio values in FIJI.\n\t\t\nFollow the procedure above for background subtraction (step 3.1.1 and Figure 4).\nDivide the pHluorin channel from the mCherry channel using the Image Calculator function, found in the Process menu. Be sure the \"Create new window\" and \"32-bit (float) result\" checkboxes are both checked. Change the lookup table (LUT), found under the Image menu, to Thermal or LUT of choice. See Figure 4 for other suitable options.",
    "In the adjust brightness and contrast dialog box (Image → Adjust → Brightness/Contrast), click the \"Set\" button. Set the Minimum displayed value to 0 and the Maximum displayed value to a ratio that best captures the data, usually 1.0-2.0 (Figure 5).\nSubscription Required.
