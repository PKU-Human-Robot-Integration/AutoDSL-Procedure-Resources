    "Tissue samples were obtained for research purposes in accordance with the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and samples were further de-identified.\n1. Antibody selection\nDefine the research questions to choose the best available antibody clones. Use the Human Protein Atlas, published research, and antibody manufacturer websites as research resources.\n\tNOTE: The selection of adequate human tissue controls and the same human tissue controls to be stained in the different steps is critical to make sure that the markers are stained correctly, in the right place, and in the correct cellular compartment. A small tissue microarray (TMA) including normal tissue and neoplastic tissues is always recommended for staining validation.\nUse only carrier-free antibodies to design the panel.\n\tNOTE: The use of carrier-free antibody formulations is required if a commercial carrier-free antibody is not available; purification kits can be used to adjust the antibody to the correct formulation. Protein additives such as bovine serum albumin are known to diminish conjugation capacity.\nTest and titrate each antibody using standard chromogenic immunohistochemistry to determine the subcellular pattern of a marker's expression; membrane, cytoplasmic, or nuclear staining; and expression in specific cells in control tissues.\n\tNOTE: However, each antibody must be tested in pH 6 citrate and pH 9 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and whether the panel will be stained with pH 6 citrate or pH 9 EDTA must be determined. The use of pH 9 EDTA is recommended to obtain good signals, especially when working with this methodology.\nChoose the optimal staining concentration according to the pattern of expression in positive controls.\nAssign each antibody to one of the available metal isotopes according to the immunohistochemical marker abundance, subcellular localization, and cellular co-expression with the other targets.",
    "Stain the antibody with the corresponding assigned metal and compare with the expression in the same control tissue used previously.\n\tNOTE: Antibody metal conjugation starts with antibody preparation, reduction, and subsequent conjugation (Supplementary File 1). Each metal-loaded polymer tube is sufficient for labeling 100 µg of an antibody.\n2. Antibody panel design\nCreate small batches of antibody staining. Test up to five markers in a cocktail.\n\tNOTE: Testing antibodies already conjugated and analyzed using immunohistochemistry in batches facilitates the early identification of channel interferences and provides the opportunity to reconjugate the antibodies with another metal. It also provides an opportunity to evaluate adequate marker co-expression.\nStain each small batch with four different antibody concentrations (0.05 µg/mL, 0.2 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL, and 4.0 µg/mL).\n\tNOTE: Comparing different titers, identify the antibody concentration that results in the correct location and highest expression with minimum background staining (best signal-to-noise ratio).\n3. FFPE tissue sectioning\nSelect gold-coated slides (specific for this purpose) and keep them close to the microtome. Prepare the microtome by inserting a new blade into the holder. Set the section thickness to 4-5 μm.\nPut FFPE blocks on ice before sectioning. Prepare a tissue floatation bath by heating distilled water or deionized water (diH2O) to 40-45 °C.\n\tNOTE: Using diH2O or distilled water reduces the possibility of contamination.\nStart sectioning. Place the tissue section in the water using tweezers and let it flatten. Use the slides to remove tissue sections from the water.\nPlace the slides in a slide rack and let them dry at room temperature overnight.\n4. FFPE antibody staining\nNOTE: The staining process takes place on two separate days.",
    "CAUTION: The solutions employed in this protocol are potentially corrosive and represent hazards to the skin and eyes. Wearing gloves, a lab coat, and protective eye and face equipment is advised and part of our institution's biosafety policy.\nReagent preparation (day 1)\n\t\nDilute 50 mL of 20x Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBS-T) into 950 mL of diH2O to make 1 L of TBS-T.\nDilute 8 mL of 10x Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) into 72 mL of diH2O to make a 1x heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) solution.\nDilute donkey serum in 1x TBS-T to a final concentration of 5% to make blocking buffer. Store the solution at 4 °C until ready to use.\nHIER preparation: Pretreatment (PT) module\n\tCAUTION: Wear chemical protective gloves when handling any reagents or parts immersed in any reagents used in the PT module.\n\t\nDilute 140 mL of 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into 1,260 mL of diH2O to make 1.4 L of 1x PBS. Alternatively, dilute seven PBS tablets into 1.4 L of diH2O.\nFill a tank with 1.4 L of PBS and place the prepared slide chamber container with 100 mL of 1x HIER solution into the tank.\nPreheat the tank in a PT module to 75 °C.\nExcess paraffin removal\n\t\nBake slides at 70 °C in an oven for at least 20 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Some tissues or sections may need longer baking times. The recommended baking time for brain tissue or a TMA is 1 h. This can be extended to 16 h (overnight) or according to lab experience.",
    "Place baked slides in a slide holder and perform the following washing steps on a shaker under a fume hood. Wash the slides in the following solution: Xylene 2x for 30 s (metal-free), 100% alcohol 2x for 30 s (metal-free), 95% alcohol 2x for 30 s (metal-free), 80% alcohol for 30 s (metal-free), 70% alcohol for 30 s (metal-free), and diH2O 2x for 30 s (metal-free).\nKeep the slides in a fresh diH2O container until ready for antigen retrieval.\n\t\tNOTE: The slides should not be dried until the end of the procedure.\nAntigen retrieval\n\t\nPlace the slides in a preheated slide chamber containing 1x HIER buffer inside the PT module. Place the cover on the tank. Close and latch the lid.\nPress the Menu button on the PT module to open the main menu and press the Setup cycle (time and temperature) button to create a custom program.\nRun the PT module at 97 °C for 40 min. Afterward, the PT module will automatically cool to 65 °C.\nRemove the slides from the PT module once the 65 °C temperature is reached. Keep the slides at room temperature for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The PT module will not open until the temperature cools to 65 °C. Do not touch the golden surface of the slides during this process, and always use gloves.\nAntibody blocking\n\t\nSet a shaker to 70 rpm.\nWash the slides by dipping them in 1x TBS-T for 5 min 2x.\nUsing a hydrophobic barrier pen, draw a border around the tissue section at least 1 mm away from the slide edges and let it dry for 15-30 s.",
    "NOTE: Take care to prevent the pen fluid from touching the tissue section to avoid any tissue interference with the staining. Do not press the pen down too hard while drawing the barrier to avoid potential leaks. For optimal staining and image acquisition results, the tissue sections are placed in the middle of the gold-coated slides in a frame no larger than 15 mm x 30 mm to allow enough space to draw the barrier without touching the tissue or the guide dots placed on the outer edge of the slide.\nTo remove any pen residue, dip the slides in TBS-T.\nIn a moisture chamber at room temperature, incubate the tissue section with 100-200 μL of blocking buffer for 20 min. Leave the tissue incubating in the blocking buffer until an antibody master mix is ready.\nAntibody panel preparation\n\tNOTE: The final volume of the antibody panel cocktail varies according to the estimated tissue section surface area. To cover an area of 20 mm x 20 mm, prepare 100-200 μL of the cocktail.\n\tDo the following to prepare an antibody panel cocktail of metal isotope-conjugated antibodies:\n\t\nConfirm the final volume of the cocktail that equals the antibody cocktail volume added to the blocking buffer volume.\nConfirm the specifications for all antibodies, dilutions, and/or antibody concentrations in a panel spreadsheet for the project.\nSpin down all the antibody-containing tubes at 10,000 x g for 5 min. Add individual antibodies to the blocking buffer and mix very well. Do not disturb the bottom of the antibody tube when pipetting it.\nFilter the antibody panel by prewetting a 0.1 μm centrifugal filter device with 100 μL of blocking buffer. Spin the filter at 10,000 x g for 2 min and remove the blocking buffer flow-through with a pipette.",
    "Transfer the antibody panel into a spin column and spin the filter at 10,000 x g for 2 min. Discard the spin column and use the flow-through as the filtered antibody panel.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform the staining immediately after making the cocktail to prevent metal exchange. If storage of the antibody cocktail for an extended time is needed, it can be subjected to lyophilization.\nAntibody staining\n\t\nCarefully remove the blocking buffer from the slides by tipping each slide on its side and gently tapping the edges against a task wiper.\nPlace the slides in a moisture chamber and add 100-200 μL of antibody master mix to the tissue (avoid contact with tissue and the creation of air bubbles).\nAdd positive and negative control slides to the staining batch.\nIncubate the slides at 4 °C overnight (14-16 h).\nReagent preparation (day 2)\n\t\nDilute 100 mL of 10x low-barium PBS, pH 7.4, in 900 mL of diH2O to make 1x PBS.\nPrepare 350 mL of a working stock solution of 2% glutaraldehyde in low-barium PBS (340 mL of low-barium PBS + 10 mL of 70% glutaraldehyde).\n\t\tNOTE: Perform the dilution under a hood. Glutaraldehyde is a very viscous liquid. Use a 1 mL pipette and add 1 mL of low-barium PBS to the glutaraldehyde tube every time until it becomes liquid enough to pour out of the tube.\nDilute 10x Tris, pH 8.5, in 900 mL of diH20 to make 1x Tris.\nFixation and dehydration\n\t\nRemove the antibody master mix from each slide by tipping the slide on its side and gently tapping the edge against a task wiper.",
    "Wash the slides with light to moderate agitation in the following buffers: 1x TBS-T, 3x times for 5 min each (metal-free); filtered 2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min; filtered 1x tris, pH 8.5, 3x for 30 s; filtered diH2O 2x for 30 s; 70% alcohol for 30 s (metal-free); 80% alcohol for 30 s (metal-free); 95% alcohol for 30 s (metal-free); and 100% alcohol for 30 s (metal-free).\nGently tap the edge of each slide against a task wiper to remove excess alcohol and allow residual alcohol to evaporate at room temperature (~5-10 min).\nDry slides in a desiccator for at least 1 h prior to image acquisition or keep the slides in a vacuum chamber for long-term storage.\n5. Image acquisition\nSlide setup\n\tNOTE: Before scanning using the instrument, the slides must be defined and set up using the web-based image management application following the steps described below.\n\t\nOn the slide page in the web-based image management application, click Accession New Slide and enter the desired details (name, slide identification, location, and description).\nCreate scanning sections by clicking Add Section. Fill in the information for each section (name of the project, slide name, block, and position). To save the new slides/sections created, click Submit.\nUnder the resources tab, open the panels page and select the panel to be used. For new panels, click Create New Panel.\nAfter selecting the panel, click on Sections. Add the sections created in step 2. by clicking Edit Section Assignment. Save by clicking Submit.\nInstrument setup\n\tNOTE: This instrument (see Table of Materials) is operated using a specific control software program (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nLog in to the control software. Click Wake Up if the instrument is in sleep mode.",
    "NOTE: At least 1 h before the operation, warming up the instrument is recommended, which helps with beam focus stabilization.\nTo load a slide, click on Exchange Sample and then click Continue to open the door. Put the slide in the loading slot with the sample facing up and the label on the right. Click Continue to close the door.\n\t\tNOTE: If the slide is not loaded correctly, a warning sound and notification to adjust the slide will appear.\nSelect the project and then select the slide name for the loaded sample.\nVisualize the panoramic image on the slide optical image pane.\nField of view (FOV) selection and acquisition\n\t\nClick on the Mode menu and select SED (Secondary Electron Detector). Click on the imaging mode menu and pick QC −300 μm.\nClick on Jog Stage to control the FOV location and then click on the arrows to navigate and select the position of the FOV.\nClick Add FOV, set 400 μm x 400 μm as the field size, and select fine as the imaging mode and 1 ms of dwell time. Click Confirm.\n\t\tNOTE: The set dwell time will depend on the desired resolution. The dwell time increases as the resolution increases. The acquisition time may vary depending on multiple factors, including detector break-in period and length of operation. Our mean acquisition time for one FOV is about 17 min. Use the instrument nonstop for up to 8 h, which allows for scanning of about 28 FOVs. The quality of the acquired images decreases after many consecutive hours of use.\nAfter creating an FOV list, proceed to image focus and adjust the stigmation by moving the beam to a tissue region that will not be imaged. Adjust the parameters until a clear central image is obtained.",
    "NOTE: To optimize image acquisition, keeping the tissue section centralized on the slide is ideal. While focusing, a clear image of only the central area can be obtained. If the tissue section is too large, the edges will be out of focus, and the image will be blurred.\nClick on Start Run. Acquired images will be automatically uploaded and stored in the web-based image management application.\n6. Image preparation\nImage isobaric correction\n\tNOTE: The purpose of isobaric correction is to remove spillover signal between channels resulting from the presence of isotopes of equal or very similar mass whose differences in mass cannot be detected using the mass analyzer.\n\t\nIn the web-based image management application, click on the green Download icon to save the FOVs (TIFF images).\nDownload the most updated version of the image processing software (see Table of Materials) available on the about tab in the web-based image management application and save it in a file. Open the .zip archive file and follow the installation steps. Open the software once the installation is complete.\nSelect the folder containing the images to be corrected by clicking on the File icon on the input pane of the image processing software. An FOV list will be loaded.\nClick on the Filter icon on the input pane to apply default corrections. For each channel, visualize images obtained before and after correction on the right side of the screen.\nClick on the Floppy disk icon on the output pane to save the corrected image.\nImage filtering: Voronoi tessellation\n\tNOTE: Voronoi tessellation diagrams illustrate a partition of space containing seed points into Voronoi cells. The aim is to estimate the cell density and define cell boundaries. Using the Voronoi tessellation calculation, a mask is generated and applied to the original image for filtering.",
    "Click on the Filtering tab and select Voronoi Tesselation on the filtering parameters menu.\nOn the input pane, select the MassCorrected.tiff image. Click on the Filter icon on the input pane.\nClick on the Floppy disk icon on the output pane to save the filtered image. The two resulting files will have the suffixes -Filtered.tiff and -Filtered.json.\n\t\tNOTE: The image named MassCorrected-Filtered.tiff then can be uploaded to a third-party digital analysis software program or open-source software program.\nSubscription Required.
