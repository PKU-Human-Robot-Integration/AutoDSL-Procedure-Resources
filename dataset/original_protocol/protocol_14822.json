    "The presented procedure takes place under a research protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, registration number NL41985.018. Written informed consent is required from all participants.\n1. System\nFor this experiment, use a Fourier domain OCT system, operating at a 1,280–1,350 nm wavelength band 13. Fourier domain low-coherence interferometry allows for continuous scanning which increases the data acquisition speed when compared to the first generation time-domain OCT systems. Note: The OCT system is interfaced with a fiber optic probe, scanning helically at ~90° angle. It has an outer diameter of 2.7F (0.9 mm) and an insertable length of 135 cm. The probe connects to the OCT console through a drive motor and optical controller (mounting dock) with a pullback range of 54 mm. The acquired OCT datasets consist of 541 cross-sectional images (B-scans) with an axial resolution of 15 µm (Figure 1, 2).\nTo guarantee accurate and reproducible attenuation measurements, calibrate by measuring μoct for increasing concentrations based on weight percentage of a fat emulsion, (e.g., Intralipid) as described previously by Kodach et al.14, 15.\n\tIn short:\n\t\nDilute a standard batch of 20% fat emulsion with demineralized H2O to achieve concentrations of 0.125, 0.250, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 10, 15 and 20 (stock) percent.\n\t\t\nPlace the OCT probe in 200 ml of fat emulsion mixture and acquire an OCT measurement.\nCross reference extracted μoct values with known values in literature.\n2. Time Out and Patient Positioning\nPrior to starting the procedure, perform a “time out” checking name, date of birth, procedure, procedural side, anticoagulant use, and allergies.",
    "Depending on the tumor location, place the patient in either prone or lateral decubitus position. Provide the patient with adequate support and verify if he/she expects to be comfortable in this position over a 20 to 40 min period.\nUsing ultrasound (US)16, localize the tumor and mark the needle entry point on the skin with permanent ink.\n\tNOTE: When using computed tomography (CT), use a flexible needle guidance template to localize the preferred position of the access needle.\n3. Disinfection and Sterile Draping\nPut on a surgical cap and mouth cover.\nClean the skin around the puncture site using a chlorhexidine/alcohol solution, taking care not to remove the previously placed needle entry mark (step 2.3). Disinfecting a wide area will prevent the necessity for additional cleaning in case of unexpected access needle repositioning.\nWith regard of the sterile content, open the percutaneous puncture set containing: a 10 ml syringe, a blunt aspiration needle, a 21 G injection needle, a scalpel, a 15 G co-axial introducer needle, a 18 G trocar needle, and a 16 G core biopsy gun.\nWash hands thoroughly, applying hand disinfectant afterwards. Put on a surgical gown and sterile gloves.\nCover the patient in sterile drapes.\nApply a sterile cover around the ultrasound probe and fix the needle guide in place.\n4. OCT Preparation\nStart the OCT console and enter the patient details in the fields labeled patient ID, last name, first name and DOB (date of birth) using the console interface.\nWith regard of the sterile content, unpack the OCT package containing an OCT probe, a sterile mounting dock cover, and a 5 ml luer-lock syringe.\nApply the sterile cover to the OCT console mounting dock. Guiding the non-sterile mounting dock requires the help of an assistant.",
    "Fill the 5 ml syringe with 0.9% NaCl and attach it to the flushing port. Flush the OCT probe until water appears in the distal part of the probe cover.\nLoad the OCT probe into the mounting dock. After loading the probe will rotate and emit red light confirming proper functioning. Leave the probe in its protective cover during flushing and loading to minimize the risk of damage.\nRemove the OCT probe from its cover. Place the probe on a hard surface and use a scalpel to shorten the tip. Fix the distal part of the probe during cutting in order to minimize pressure on the optical fiber and prism. Cut 5 mm distal from prism, using the emitted (red) light for orientation.\n5. Puncture\nAnesthetize the skin and deep layers using 2% lidocaine (20 mg/ml). Wait several minutes allowing for the lidocaine to take effect. Ask the patient if there is any pain.\nUsing the needle guide, place the 15 G co-axial introducer needle verifying the position through imaging. If placement is satisfactory, remove the obturator (sharp needle core).\nPlace the 18 G trocar needle through the introducer needle, piercing the tumor. Again verify the position of the needle with imaging. If placement is satisfactory remove the obturator.\nFeed the OCT probe up the trocar needle until feeling resistance.\nWhile fixing the OCT probe, retract the trocar needle, exposing the OCT probe to the tumor tissue. Keeping the tip of the trocar needle within the tumor minimizes kinking of the OCT probe during breathing cycles. This lowers the risk of probe damage.\nOCT Scan:\n\t\nPerform an OCT scan, with the console set at 541 B-scans per dataset. The OCT system used here will perform an automated pullback over a length of 5.4 cm requiring no specific parameter adjustments.",
    "Check the scan for quality, artefacts and the appearance of solid tissue (Figure 1A). Artefacts most commonly appear as circular bands standing out from the normal OCT pattern (Figure 1B).\nReplace the probe if artefacts persists after rescanning.\nRepeat step 5.6 until a minimum of 3 OCT datasets are acquired.\nRemove the OCT probe and trocar needle, leaving the introducer needle in-place.\nArm the core biopsy gun and place it through the introducer needle, verifying the position on imaging.\nIf the positioning is satisfactory, fire the biopsy gun.\nPlace biopsy material in container according to pathology department protocol. Here, place biopsies on a petri dish with a paper inlay, sufficiently saturated with 0.9% NaCl.\nCheck the core biopsy quality and repeat step 5.9 and 5.10 until sufficient material is obtained.\nSubscription Required.
