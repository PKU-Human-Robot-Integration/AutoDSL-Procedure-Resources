    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell plating and treatments\nTiming: 2 days\nThese steps are required to induce the expression of the POI fused to BirA∗ in the stable Flp-In T-REx cell line. To robustly biotinylate proximity proteins, BirA∗ requires exogenous biotin as a substrate.\nSeed the Flp-In T-REx stable cell line in a 15 cm dish cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% TET-free FBS and allow them to adhere and proliferate overnight (about 16 h). The number of cells can vary from one cell line to another and should be optimized in each lab.\nWhen the confluency reaches 75%–80% treat the cells.\nAspirate the media.\nGently replace it with fresh media supplemented with 10% of FBS, 1 ug/mL of tetracycline and 50 μM of biotin for 24 h.\nNote: The treatments can otherwise be added directly to the cells.\nCell harvesting\nTiming: 40 min\nThese steps describe how to properly harvest the cells prior to performing the BioID.\nNote: The following steps are done on ice.\nAspirate the media and add 5 mL of ice-cold PBS to the dish.\nAgitate on an orbital shaker at 4°C for 10 min.\nScrape the cells using a cell scraper and transfer them to a 15 cm tube.\nAdd 7 mL of cold PBS to the dish.\nCollect the remaining cells and transfer into the same 15 cm tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nWash the pellet with 10 mL of cold PBS.\nRepeat steps 8–10.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nPause point: At this point, you can freeze the cell pellets at −80°C for several months. This can be useful to synchronize the processing of samples from different experiments.",
    "Affinity capture of biotinylated proteins\nTiming: 5–7 h depending on the number of samples\nThese steps explain how to lyse the cells and how to capture the proteins that were biotinylated by BirA∗ in cellulo using streptavidin Sepharose® beads.\nNote: Keep the samples on ice.\nThaw frozen cell pellets in 1,5 mL of ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with inhibitors (DTT, PMSF and protease cocktail inhibitor).\nResuspend by pipetting up and down\nTransfer to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 1 μL of benzonase (250 U/μL) to each sample to digest nucleic acids, prior to the following step.\nTo complete cell lysis, sonicate samples for 30 s at 30% amplitude. Perform 3 rounds of 10 s with 2 s pause in between.\nNote: Ideally, the sonication performed at step 16 should be done on ice. If not possible, the sample can be taken from the ice and replaced back after.\nCentrifuge the lysates for 30 min at 12,000 g at 4°C to pellet the cell debris.\nMeanwhile wash 70 μL of streptavidin Sepharose® beads slurry in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 1 mL of RIPA buffer (with or without inhibitors) to the 70 μL of beads.\nSpin for 1 min at 375 g at 4°C to pellet the beads.\nAspirate the wash buffer.\nRepeat step 18 two more times.\nCollect the clarified cell lysates of step 17 and transfer it to the 2 mL Eppendorf tube containing 70 μL of the pre-washed beads.\nNote: A 20 μl or 40 μL aliquot of the supernatant should ideally be stored at −80°C to monitor protein expression, lysis efficiency and solubility.\nSecure tubes with parafilm to prevent leaking.\nIncubate with rotation at 4°C for 3 h.\nSpin down the beads by centrifuging them for 1 min at 375 g at 4°C.",
    "Remove the supernatant.\nNote: You can keep the supernatant to monitor unbound bait as a control and store it at −80°C.\nAdd 1 mL of RIPA lysis buffer without inhibitors to the beads and transfer to a new 2 mL Eppendorf tube to remove unwanted material that adhered to the tube walls.\nSpin down the beads by centrifuging them for 1 min at 375 g at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nWash with 1 mL of RIPA lysis buffer.\nRepeat steps 25–26 one more time.\nCentrifuge 1 min at 375 g at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nWash the beads with 1 mL of 50 mM cold ABC which provides an optimal pH for the trypsin digestion and is also compatible with the downstream MS analysis.\nRepeat step 28–29 two times and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend beads in 100 μL of 50 mM cold ABC.\nBiotinylated proteins digestion\nTiming: 18 h\nThese steps allow the trypsin-mediated digestion of the bound biotinylated proteins. It is essential to work in a clean environment for steps 32–46.\nResuspend trypsin stock in 200 μL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,0 by vortexing for around one minute and make sure it is well dissolved.\nCritical: Wear a mask to perform this step, trypsin powder can be harmful to the respiratory tract.\nAdd 10 μL (1 μg) of resuspended trypsin to each sample.\nSecure tube with parafilm to prevent leaking.\nIncubate overnight (about 15 h) at 37°C with rotation to digest peptides. Make sure all samples rotate correctly.\nThe next day, resuspend a new tube of trypsin stock in 200 μL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,0.\nNote: It is important to use a new tube of trypsin each day. Trypsin stored at 4°C overnight can lose its activity.",
    "Add 10 μL (1 μg) of resuspended trypsin to each sample.\nSecure tube with parafilm to prevent leaking.\nIncubate for 2 h at 37°C with rotation to make sure proteins are maximally digested.\nPeptide recovery\nTiming: 4–5 h depending on the number of samples\nThese steps describe how to collect the released peptides from the digestion and how to concentrate them.\nPellet the beads by centrifugation for 1 min at 375 g at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nTransfer 100 μL of supernatant which contains peptides to a 1,5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nNote: From now on be careful not to carry over any beads. To avoid disturbing the bead pellet, we recommend limiting movement by staying close to the centrifuge and manipulating the samples the least possible.\nRinse beads with 100 μL of HPLC grade water.\nCentrifuge the beads for 1 min at 375 g at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nCollect the supernatant containing the remaining peptides in the same tube as step 41 to pool all peptides.\nRepeat steps 42–44 one more time.\nAdd 30 μL of 50% formic acid stock solution for a final concentration of 5% formic acid to the 1,5 mL Eppendorf tube containing peptide to end digestion and mix by pipetting up and down.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 16300 g at room temperature (20°C–25°C) to pellet remaining beads.\nTransfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube making sure not to carry over any beads by leaving a few μL (5–15) in the tube.\nRepeat steps 47 and 48 again.\nPlace samples in a SpeedVac for 3 h at maximum speed and 35°C to dry completely.\nFreeze samples at −80°C.\nPause point: Frozen samples can be stored for several months.",
    "Before MS injection, resuspend the pellet in 15 μL of 5% formic acid by pipetting up and down.\nMS injection\nTiming: 145 min/sample\nThese steps of the protocol describe how to inject the samples prepared above in the LC-MS/MS system.\nFor each series of samples (duplicates or triplicates) perform an LC-MS/MS analysis using a short concentration gradient on at least one diluted sample (1:20) prior to the full gradient injection.\nCritical: This run is important as it allows to determine the highest volume to be injected for the full gradient analysis. The goal is to reach the maximum sensitivity without saturating the LC-MS/MS system.\nLoad the samples at the previously determined dilution into a 75 μm i.d. × 150 mm Self-Pack C18 column installed on the Easy-nLC II or the Easy-nLC 1000 system.\nElute the peptides with a two-slope gradient at a flow rate of 250 nL/min (The HPLC system is either coupled to a Q Exactive or the LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer through a Nanospray Flex Ion Source.)\nSet the Nanospray and S-lens voltages to 1.3–1.7 kV and 50–60 V, respectively.\nSet the capillary temperature to 250°C.\nIncrease solvent B from 2 to 36% in 100 min and then from 36 to 82% B in 10 min.\nAcquire full scan MS survey spectra (m/z 360–2000) in profile mode in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 and the AGC target at 1E6.\nDepending on the machine available follow the steps (a) or (b) below:\nOn the Q Exactive\nFragment the 16 most intense peptide ions in the collision cell at a normalized collision energy of 27.\nAnalyze MS/MS spectra in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 17,500, the AGC target at 1E5, and the dynamical exclusion set to 7 s.\nOn the LTQ Orbitrap Velos",
