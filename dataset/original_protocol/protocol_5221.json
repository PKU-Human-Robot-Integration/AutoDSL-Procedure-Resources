    "Preparation of GFP-expressing E. coli Inoculate 50 ml LB broth with a GFP E. coli colony.Incubate overnight at 37 °C with shaking.Use spectrophotometer to measure optical density at 600 nm (OD600).Measure bacteria with broth, and broth alone.Subtract OD600 of fresh LB broth from bacteria with broth.Dilute bacteria to OD600 = 0.1Spin 10 ml of bacterial solution at 4,000 x g for 10 min in 15 ml Falcon tubes at room temperature.Decant LB broth.Re-suspend, by vortexing in sufficient 1x PBS, to adjust bacteria to an OD600 of 0.1.Aliquot 1 ml into Eppendorf tubes.Heat-kill by placing tubes at 65 °C for 20 min.Freeze aliquots and thaw when ready to use.Re-suspend bacteria in Schneider’s Drosophila medium with FBSCentrifuge Eppendorf tube with heat-killed GFP-bacteria at 4,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Decant PBS supernatant.Add 1 ml Schneider’s Drosophila medium and vortex to re-suspend.For the E. coli we use this yields about 40,000 bacteria per µl of solution.Once re-suspended, warm to 25 °C before exposure to cells.Primary hemocyte isolationWarm fresh Schneider’s Drosophila medium to 25 °C.Collect ten wandering third instar larvae in a large drop of water on dissecting dish–wash thoroughly and place in fresh drop.Place a 22 mm2 coverslip in a 100 x 15 mm Petri dish.Add 200 μl Schneider’s Drosophila medium from step B1 to the coverslip.This should create a large droplet.Keep the area of the droplet as small as possible.Do not let the droplet spread out across the coverslip.Place the washed larvae into the large droplet on the coverslip.Under a dissecting microscope, use forceps to pinch and immobilize the tail end of the larva and use another forceps to grab and rip the outer cuticle of the larvae from tail to mouth (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170530/20170530191801_5875.jpgFigure 1. Larval dissection.",
    "This image depicts the way forceps are used to hold (left forceps) and dissect the cuticle of larvae covered with S2 cell media with the right forceps along the larval midline (jagged black line) thereby releasing the larval hemolymph into the S2 cell media.Rip open all ten larvae in the media droplet on the coverslip.Note: Do this step as quickly as possible.Remove larval carcasses from the media droplet.Incubate hemolymph in media on coverslip in the Petri dish to allow hemocytes to attach to coverslip (at 25 °C for 15 min).This 15-min incubation will be sufficient time for hemocytes to adhere to the coverslip.After about 10 min, melanization may begin to occur (see Figure 2).Begin washes with PBS if the media features small black spots. These indicate the beginning of melanization that we seek to avoid.Do not allow the media to turn black.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170530/20170530191912_5355.jpgFigure 2. Early signs of melanization. The image displays a coverslip (22 x 22 mm) with a drop of medium containing hemocytes settling on the coverslip. Over time, crystal cells in the medium will initiate melanization that can be detected by the dark spots in the solution (arrow) and the dark ring at the edge of the drop (arrowhead). At this stage, hemocytes should be washed with PBS to remove crystal cells.Pour 1x PBS carefully into the Petri dish away from the coverslip to avoid dislodging the adherent cells.Wash thoroughly by slowly swirling the dish.Pour off PBS from Petri dish.Repeat wash (B10).Hemocytes will adhere to the coverslip, while the PBS washes remove the majority of crystal cells, which are mainly responsible for melanization.Remove the coverslip with forceps and place on Kimwipe, then place in a dry Petri dish on ice.",
    "Expose hemocytes to GFP bacteriaAdd enough GFP bacteria in Schneider’s Drosophila medium from step A5 (40,000 bacteria/µl) to cover the entire coverslip without spilling over the edge of the coverslip (~200 µl).Incubate bacteria with hemocytes on ice for 20 min to allow the bacteria to adhere to the cell surface.Rinse 3 x by pouring PBS into the Petri dish and swirling gently. Remove PBS by pouring off.Remove coverslip with forceps and place on Kimwipe, then place in dry Petri dish.Add fresh, warm Schneider’s Drosophila medium on the coverslip for the desired amount of chase time (in wild-type hemocytes the majority of bacteria will be digested and undetectable by 45 min).Fix, stain, and mount hemocytes (all performed at room temperature)Wash the media with PBS as before.Add enough 4% paraformaldehyde to cover the coverslip without spilling over its edges.Fix cells for 30 min.Thoroughly wash cells with PBS as before.Add PBSS for 30 min to permeabilize cell membranes.Remove PBSS and add 10% NGS in PBSS for 30 min to block unspecific antibody binding.Stain with primary and secondary antibodies of your choice and/or Phalloidin-Alexa 594 in PBSS for one hour. Note: Keep specimen in the dark as much as possible during and after secondary antibody staining.Wash with PBS 3 x 15 min after each antibody.Place the coverslip on Kimwipe to dry it.Add a small drop of Vectashield to a microscope slide.Slowly lay the coverslip with stained hemocytes onto the drop of Vectashield.Seal the edges of the coverslip to the slide with nail polish.Image the cells on a confocal microscope with a 63x objective and 3x digital zoom."
