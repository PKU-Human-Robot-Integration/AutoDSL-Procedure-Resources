    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection of intestinal tissues\nTiming: 8 min\nEuthanize mouse by cervical dislocation or other approved method and expose the abdominal cavity.\nLay euthanized mouse on its back on a hard surface (e.g., Rodent Surgery Board).\nLift the skin of the lower abdomen with tweezers and make a V-shape incision with scissors;\nCut away skin to expose abdominal cavity.\nCollect ileum tissues.\nCut the colon from the anus and gently pull out the intestine from the abdominal cavity.\nCut the end of the small intestine from the cecum.\nTake the similar length as colon moving proximal from the ileocecal junction (ileum).\nRemove the fat and mesentery tissues from dissected ileum with tweezers; Flush away the luminal contents using cold DPBS with an animal feeding needle.\nUsing scissors, cut open the ileum longitudinally. Place tissues in 50 mL falcon tube pre-filled with 10 mL cold DPBS and keep the tube on ice until all animals are processed.\nCritical: After tissue dissection, perform all procedures as fast as possible and keep all buffers and preparations at 4°C or on ice unless specified otherwise.\nPreparation of epithelial single-cell suspension\nTiming: 60 min\nWash the tissue three times with cold DPBS.\nRemove DPBS by pouring it out.\nAdd 10 mL of cold DPBS and shake the tube up and down for 20–30 s.\nRepeat steps 6a and 6b two more times.\nTransfer tissue to a petri dish and slice into small fragments roughly 2–3 cm in length.\nTransfer tissue fragments into 15 mL falcon tube pre-filled with 7 mL of cold EDTA buffer and keep the tube on ice.\nShake the tube by hand (up and down for about 60 cycles; 0.5 s/cycle) every 7–8 min.\nAfter 30 min of ice incubation, shake the tube vigorously for 2 min.",
    "Use a tweezer to remove the tissues from the tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 g and 4°C for 5 min; remove supernatant and add 10 mL of cold DPBS to wash cell pellets.\nPellet the cells and add TrypLE Express Enzyme to the tube.\nSpin down the cells at 500 g and 4°C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant by pouring. Using pipette tips, remove the residual supernatant.\nImmediately add 2 mL TrypLE Express Enzyme and gently resuspend cell pellets using 1 mL pipette tips.\nKeep at 22°C–25°C for 10 min; During incubation, pipette up and down 10 times with 1 mL pipette tips to gently break cell aggregates every 3–4 min.\nNote: Room-temperature (22°C–25°C) incubation is recommended in this step as higher temperature (37°C) may impact cell viability.\nFill the tube with 10 mL of cold DPBS and pass through 70 μm cell strainer placed on a 50 mL falcon tube; add another 10 mL of cold DPBS to wash the cell strainer; collect all the flow-through (single-cell suspension).\nCentrifuge at 500 g and 4°C for 5 min. Cell pellets are ready for staining.\nProcedures for cell surface staining\nTiming: 60 min\nResuspend cells using 1 mL of Live/Dead staining solution (1:1000 dilution in DPBS); transfer to FACS tubes and keep in a 4°C fridge for 20 min.\nWash cells by directly adding 4 mL of cold DPBS to the tube; spin down to remove supernatant.\nAdd 300 μL of FcR blocking reagent (1:50 dilution in FACS buffer) to resuspend cell pellets; keep in a 4°C fridge for 5 min.\nDilute antibodies (anti-CD45, anti-CD31, anti-TER-119 and anti-EpCAM) into FACS buffer (1:50 dilution). Without wash, directly add 300 μL of antibody cocktail to the FACS tube (1:100 final dilution); gently vortex to mix; keep in a 4°C fridge for 30 min.",
    "Wash cells by adding 4 mL of cold FACS buffer; spin down the cells at 500 g and 4°C for 5 min; remove supernatant by pouring out the buffer.\nResuspend cells in 300 μL of MACS buffer and transfer to FACS tubes mounted with 35 μm cell strainer cap; Keep cells on ice.\nNote: If cells do not pass through cell strainer by gravity, a short centrifugation step can be applied.\nFlow cytometry and cell sorting\nTiming: (20 min per sample)\nAcquire samples on FACS machine and sort cells into post-sort buffer.\nNote: For our studies, we used SH800S cell sorter (Sony, Japan) and CytoFlex SRT cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, USA) and analyzed the data using FlowJo software package (Tree Star, USA).\nMix cells with AOPI staining solution at 1:1 ratio; Load 20 μL onto slide and count using Auto 2000. Adjust volume to obtain the required cell recovery target.\nAlternatives: Cells can also be counted using a hemocytometer.\nNote: The actual number of cells is about 65%–80% of counts recorded by cell sorter.\nAfter cell counting, immediately proceed to downstream analysis:\nIf cells are used for bulk RNA-seq, spin down the cells at 500 g and 4°C for 5 min and carefully remove supernatant by pipetting; resuspend cell pellets in 350 μL of Buffer RLT Plus supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol.\nPause point: samples can be stored at −80°C for months until being further processed for RNA isolation using RNeasy Micro Plus kit (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-plus-kits/[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-plus-kits/]).\nCritical: Removal of supernatants as much as possible is crucial for ensuring efficient cell lysis. We normally keep less than 20 μL of supernatants in the tube so that the cell pellets are not disturbed.\nCritical: Wear a mask when handling β-mercaptoethanol.",
    "If cells are used for single-cell RNA-seq, immediately proceed to GEM generation and barcoding (https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/single-cell-immune-profiling/documentation/steps/library-prep/chromium-single-cell-5-reagent-kits-user-guide-v-2-chemistry-dual-index[href=https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/single-cell-immune-profiling/documentation/steps/library-prep/chromium-single-cell-5-reagent-kits-user-guide-v-2-chemistry-dual-index]).\nIf cells are used for metabolomic analysis, spin down the cells at 500 g and 4°C for 5 min and carefully remove supernatant by pipetting; resuspend cell pellets in1 mL cold DPBS and transfer to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube for washing. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 500 g and 4°C for 5 min; completely remove the supernatants.\nPause point: Cells can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or on dry ice and store at −80°C for months until metabolite extraction."
