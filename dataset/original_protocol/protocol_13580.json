    "Intracoronary ACh testing has been approved by the local ethics committee of the Academic Medical Centre, and the protocol follows the guidelines of Amsterdam UMC for human research.\n1. Preparation of the ACh stock solution\nMix the 20 mg of ACh with the 2 mL of solvent provided with the package (Table of Materials).\nAdd 1 mL of the ACh solution to 499 mL of 0.9% NaCl to create the stock solution, corresponding to a 20 µg/mL dose.\nFill a sterile dish with 50 mL of the stock solution, which will be used to prepare the syringes under sterile conditions.\n2. Preparation of the syringes containing ACh for intracoronary injection\nPrepare five 10 mL syringes under sterile conditions for the intracoronary injection according to the Supplementary Material.\n\t​NOTE: It is advised to prepare each syringe sequentially after administration and not all at once to avoid confusion when administering the syringes\n3. Diagnostic coronary angiography\nAnesthetize the puncture site of the right radial artery (usually 2 mL of lidocaine) or the area of the puncture site of the right femoral artery (usually 15 mL of lidocaine) when the femoral artery is the preferred route of catheterization.\n\tNOTE: By puncturing the skin with the needle, the successfulness of the local anesthesia can be assessed.\nPuncture the artery with a cannula using the Seldinger wire technique, then insert a wire through the cannula. After removing the cannula, insert a sheath (6F) over the wire. Perform coronary angiography under sterile conditions.\nAdvance the wire into the ascending aorta through the sheath and subsequently position the diagnostic catheter (6Fr) above the aortic valve. Withdraw the wire and attach the contrast syringe to the catheter.\n\tNOTE: The contrast agent used is iodixanol Injectable Contrast Medium.",
    "Position the tip of the diagnostic catheter for the left coronary artery in the left main coronary artery. Confirm the position of the catheter by injecting 2 mL of the contrast agent.\nExclude the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease by perming coronary angiography. Inject ~5-10 mL of the contrast agent to visualize the coronary arteries in different views.\n\t​NOTE: Most often, the following projections provide the best overview: LAO 40° and RAO 35° for the right coronary artery and LAO 45°/CRAN 25°, RAO 30°/CRAN 30° and RAO 20°/ CAUD 30° for the left coronary artery.\n4. Preparations for Doppler flow assessment\nNOTE: Here, ComboWire was used as the Doppler guidewire with the ComboMap system (Table of Materials)\nConnect the Doppler guidewire to the system and zero the pressure on the console and the aortic pressure on the hemodynamic system.\nAdvance the Doppler guidewire through the guiding catheter into the ostium of the coronary artery with the pressure sensor of the Doppler guidewire placed just distally of the tip of the guiding catheter. Press normalization (Norm) on the system to equalize the two pressures.\nAfter normalization, reintroduce the wire via the microcatheter into the proximal or mid LAD and acquire a stable flow signal.\n\tNOTE: The Doppler guidewire can alternatively be introduced more distally into the LAD or in the CX when acquiring an adequate signal in the proximal LAD is not feasible, such as in the case of tortuous anatomy or when another position is otherwise required, for instance, proximal from a myocardial bridge.\nDocument the position of the wire using fluoroscopy.\nStart ACh testing as described in section 5 after exclusion of any relevant epicardial stenosis (≥50%) by visual assessment.\n5. Intracoronary administration of ACh",
    "Administer the first syringe containing 2 µg of acetylcholine as described in the Supplementary Material into the LCA through the guiding. Inject this in 60 s with continuous monitoring of the ECG, average peak velocity (APV), and the patient's symptoms (e.g., angina and/or dyspnea).\n\t\nFlush the ACh that remains in the guiding into the left coronary artery at a similar injection speed to the injection itself with contrast using the contrast syringe.\nPerform coronary angiography of the left coronary artery by injecting 10 mL of the contrast agent into the catheter in the same projection as done for the baseline coronary angiography. Bookmark and print a 12-lead ECG after every dose of ACh or when symptoms and/or ECG changes occur.\nIf diagnostic criteria are not met, continue with the administration of the second syringe containing 20 µg of acetylcholine as described in the Supplementary Material using the same technique as described in steps 5.1.1-5.1.3. Pause for 3 min between every dose.\nIf diagnostic criteria are not met after the second dose, continue with the administration of the third syringe containing 100 µg of acetylcholine as described in the Supplementary Material using the same technique as described in steps 5.1.1-5.1.3. Pause for 3 min between every dose.\n\t\tNOTE: At dose 3 most patients will report some symptoms, ischemic ECG changes can occur, and some epicardial diameter reduction may occur. In some cases, the speed of the manual injection will have to be slowed down. For instance, at doses 3 and 4, bradycardia may occur, and the speed of the injection will have to be slowed down. An extended injection over 1-3 min may also be feasible.",
    "If diagnostic criteria are not met after the third dose, continue with the administration of the fourth syringe containing 100 µg of acetylcholine as described in the Supplementary Material using the same technique as described in steps 5.1.1-5.1.3. Pause for 3 min between every dose.\n\t\tNOTE: At dose 4 most patients will report some symptoms, ischemic ECG changes can occur, and some epicardial diameter reduction may occur. In some cases, the speed of the manual injection will have to be slowed down. For instance, at doses 3 and 4, bradycardia may occur, and the speed of the injection will have to be slowed down. An extended injection over 1-3 min may also be feasible.\nWhen diagnostic criteria according to COVADIS are not met after step 5.1.6 in the LCA, continue with RCA as the target vessel. Inject 80 µg of ACH (10 mL, syringe #RCA) in 60 s into the right coronary artery while continuously monitoring the ECG and the patient's symptoms.\n\tNOTE: Clinical practice on testing of the RCA can vary among centers as routine testing of the RCA is advocated according to the JCS guidelines as multi-vessel epicardial coronary vasospasm is associated with worse prognosis2,15. In contrast, vasospasm provocation protocols from European and United states centers do not routinely test the RCA16. Acetylcholine can induce bradycardia and can be resolved by decreasing the speed of the injection to prevent prolonged bradycardia and/or asystole.\n\t\nFlush the remaining ACh in the guiding into the left coronary artery at a similar injection speed to the injection itself with contrast using the contrast syringe. Perform coronary angiography of the RCA (perform angiography in the same projection as the baseline angiography).",
    "Inject 200 µg of intracoronary NTG into each target vessel after the test, or when severe symptoms (e.g., angina and/or dyspnoea)), ischemic ECG changes or epicardial spasm occurs. Continuously monitor the APV and patient's symptoms to monitor the effect of NTG.\nPerform coronary angiography of the target vessel after 1 min or when the APV has returned to baseline, and no symptoms are present to document reversion of spasm\n6. Rechallenge\nIn the case of a positive diagnosis, wait for 3 min after NTG administration until the patient is free of symptoms, ECG changes have resolved, and APV values have returned to baseline before starting the rechallenge.\nInject 10 mL of the syringe containing the acetylcholine dose that previously induced vasospasm as described in the Supplementary Material into guiding. Inject this in 60 s with continuous monitoring of the ECG, APV and the patient's symptoms (e.g., angina and/or dyspnea).\nFlush the remaining ACh in the guiding into the left coronary artery at a similar injection speed to the injection itself with contrast using the contrast syringe. Image the target vessel in the same projection as done in the baseline angiography after injection of the 10 mL.\nPerform coronary angiography of the left coronary artery by injecting 10 mL of contrast into the catheter in the same projection as done for the baseline coronary angiography. Bookmark and print a 12-lead ECG after every dose of ACh or when symptoms and/or ECG changes occur.\nInject 200 µg of intracoronary NTG into each target vessel after the test or when severe symptoms (i.e., angina and/or dyspnea), ischemic ECG shifts, or epicardial spasm occurs.\nPerform coronary angiography of the target vessel after 1 min or when the APV has returned to baseline, and no symptoms are present to document reversion of spasm",
