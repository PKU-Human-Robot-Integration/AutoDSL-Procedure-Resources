Count viable cells via standard Trypan Blue protocol using a hemocytometer or an automated Cell counter.\nDilute 9 ×105 cells in 15 ml of N2B27 maintenance medium (calculated for 100 wells to have cell suspension in excess).\nNote: In each well, a total of 9 ×103 cells are seeded in 150 μL of N2B27 maintenance medium.\nCritical: Initial cell number for 3D colony generation has to be precise. We strongly advise to count multiple times and estimate the average number of viable cells.\nTROUBESHOOTING: In case of inaccurate cell counting, please refer to Problem 1.\nDistribute the 15 mL cell suspension in a sterile media reservoir.\nUsing a multichannel pipet, transfer 150 μL of cell suspension in each well of the 96-well ULA plate.\nNote: This is considered Day 0 of the protocol.\nChange media every 2nd day (Day 2 and 4) until Day 6.\nCritical: When changing media do not touch the colony by placing the tip to the bottom of the well.\nWe advise to remove 2/3 of the media by placing the tip on the side of the well and replacing with 150 μL of fresh N2B27 maintenance media.\nNote: Every day observe the colonies under the microscope. Single colonies should be formed within the first 2–3 days (depending on the cell line) with only a few cell debris left (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/641-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative picture of a single NESC 3D colony at day 6 showing minimal amount of debris and ready for embedding\nEmbedding material preparation (day 5)\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Material preparation a day before the embedding\nCut 6 Parafilm squares approx. 5×5 cm big (enough for one 96-well plate), spray them with 70% ethanol and place under the biosafety cabinet.\nRemove the parafilm from the paper and allow the ethanol to evaporate.\nUsing sterile forceps, place one square of Parafilm over an empty tip tray (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/641-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of dimpled parafilm\nThe different steps highlighted are: (A) placement of the square-shaped parafilm on the tips box tray; (B) pressing the dimples by applying pressure on the parafilm above each hole; (C) completed 4×4 dimpled parafilm and (D) drying of the dimpled parafilm after immersion in ethanol and subsequent storing in a Petri dish.\nCreate small dimples (4×4 dimples per Parafilm square) by pressing a gloved finger over the holes (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nNote: You can either use an empty 200 or 1000 μL tip box/tray without the lid.\nSpray the dimpled parafilm square with 70% ethanol and using sterile forceps place it in a sterile 10 cm Petri dish in order for the ethanol to fully evaporate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nOnce the parafilm is dry, close the Petri dish and seal it with Parafilm until embedding (step 12).\nPlace the Geltrex stock vial on ice at 4°C in the fridge and let it thaw overnight (8–14 h).\nNote: Embedding in extracellular matrix supports neurite outgrowth and development of a more complex neuronal morphology.\nAlternatives: Matrigel can also be used for embedding with the same protocol described here. Importantly, we have not observed any difference in organoid development between both alternatives. However, for result reproducibility we strongly advise to only use one brand of matrix (Matrigel or Geltrex) and adhere to the same throughout the whole experiment.\n3D colony embedding (day 6)",
    "Timing: 3–4 h (for a single 96-well ULA plate)\nNote: Throughout the following steps, sterile forceps and scissors are used (see Before you begin)\nAt day 6 of organoid culture, transfer the 3D colonies to an untreated 24-well tissue culture plate (TCP).\nDistribute 500 μL of pre-warmed (37°C) N2B27 maintenance medium to each well of the TCP.\nCut a 1 ml pipet tip using sterile scissors and transfer each single 3D colony taken from the 96-well plate to a single well of the 24-well TCP (i.e., transfer one single 3D colony from one well to another).\nNote: Cutting the tip allows easier and gentler aspiration of the 3D colony.\nCritical: This step helps to clean the 3D colony from cellular debris and reduces the possibility for side colonies to be present in the upcoming embedding process.\nTROUBLESHOOTING: If there is a presence of a side colony in one of the wells, please refer to Problem 2.\nEmbed the NESC colonies in a Geltrex droplet.\nCritical: Always use sterile forceps to handle the Parafilm squares and sterile scissors to cut the pipet tips.\nPlace one dimpled Parafilm square in a fresh Petri dish.\nPlace a single 3D colony from the TCP into each dimple using a cut 1 mL pipet tip (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/641-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Step by step instruction of the colony embedding process\n(A–D) (A) Transfer of a single colony from the TCP to a dimple; (B) addition of the Geltrex to each colony after aspiration of the residual culturing medium; (C) placement of the polymerized Geltrex/colony droplets in medium and (D) shaking process in order to detach the embedded colonies from the parafilm.\n(E and F) Transfer of the embedded colonies in individual wells (24-well plate) using a 1 mL pipet with a cut tip.",
    "Remove the medium around the 3D colony using a 10 μL pipet tip.\nCritical: Remove as much medium as possible to avoid Geltrex dilution. Be careful, not to leave the colonies to dry out on the dimpled parafilm.\nAdd 35 μL of Geltrex around the 3D colony and try to keep the colony in the center of the Geltrex droplet (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: Place Geltrex on top of the 3D colony. If colony is not in the center, gently aspirate some Geltrex from one side of the droplet and add the aspirated amount to the other side of the droplet in order to push the 3D colony more to the center.\nCritical: Avoid touching the 3D colony with the pipet tip as this would destroy it or lead to the formation of side colonies.\nTROUBLESHOOTING: If a colony drops out of the Geltrex droplet or is not centered, please refer to Problem 3.\nIncubate at 37°C for 25 min to allow the Geltrex to polymerize.\nCollect the Geltrex droplets with the embedded 3D colonies.\nFlip the Parafilm with the embedded colonies in order to immerse them into a new Petri dish filled with pre-warmed (37°C) DMEM/F12 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nIncubate at 37°C for 25 min.\nRemove the Geltrex droplets from the Parafilm by shaking slightly until the droplets fall off by themselves (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nUsing a cut 1 ml pipet tip, transfer a single embedded colony per well in a 24-well TCP (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4F).\nNote: Ideally, you can use the same TCP plate as in step 7.\nReplace DMEM/F12 with 500 μL per well of N2B27 maintenance medium (see ‘Materials and Equipment’).\nKeep organoids in an incubator under static conditions until the differentiation (step 11).\nOrganoid differentiation (day 10)\nTiming: 6 days",
    "At the 2nd day after embedding (Day 10 of organoid culture) replace N2B27 maintenance media with N2B27 differentiation media + PMA (see ‘Materials and Equipment’, 500 μL per well)\nNote: During media change, always try to remove as much media as possible before adding the fresh one. Since the matrix can be fragile and organoids are still small a few days just after embedding, media change can be done with a 1ml pipet by gently aspirating media and then adding a fresh one. After initiation of differentiation (from Day 10 on), neurite outgrowth stabilizes the matrix and organoids grow bigger, then a pump can be used to aspirate the media.\nAt day 12 of organoid culture, proceed to a full media change using fresh N2B27 differentiation media + PMA (see ‘Materials and Equipment’, 500 μL per well)\nAt day 14 of organoid culture, fully change media to fresh N2B27 differentiation media + PMA (see ‘Materials and Equipment’, 500 μL per well) and place the organoids on a horizontal shaker set at 80 rpm inside the incubator.\nCritical: Shaking is an essential step for optimal nutrient supply/exchange as well as organoid growth.\nNote: Sterilize the shaker before putting it in the incubator. We strongly advise to dedicate an incubator with shakers inside only to be used for this step.\nTROUBLESHOOTING: If there is a side colony in the same Geltrex droplet, please refer to Problem 2. If the organoid is close to the edge of the Geltrex droplet, please refer to Problem 4. Lastly, if the organoid falls out of the Geltrex droplet, please refer to Problem 5.\nAt day 16 of organoid culture, proceed to a full media change using fresh N2B27 differentiation media without PMA (500 μL per well)",
    "Critical: At this stage, be aware to leave out the PMA for subsequent media changes. This stabilizes midbrain identity after initiation of differentiation (for further information, please refer to Reinhardt et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nFor long term culture, full media change using 500 μL of N2B27 differentiation without PMA is done every 3–4 days.\nCritical: Along with organoid development, nutrient consumption and cell metabolic activity increases. Visually we can see that when media becomes yellow before the regular media change (every 3–4 days). This is an important indicator to increase the volume of fresh media for the next media changes. Our observation shows that until day 30, organoids can be cultured in 500 μL per well. After this time, media volume should be increased to 600 μL per well in order to ensure optimal culture conditions."
