    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAfter accomplishing the screening and evaluation of UAA incorporation system in vitro, we attempted to deliver this orthogonal tRNA-enzyme pair into mdx mice using an AAV viral vector, to further advance this method for clinical purposes. The step-by-step method details can be divided into two main parts. The first is to prepare an AAV, and the second is to systematically analyze and evaluate the in vivo efficacy and safety after AAV injection in mice. If a fresh virus is to be used for delivery, the administration of AAV should be performed 72 h after transfection of the packaging cells.\nPart 1 preparation of AAV\nGeneration of AAVPyl\nTiming: 5 days\nIn this protocol, we constructed AAV2/9 carrying the MmPylRS/tRNAMmPyl (AAVPyl) system by transfecting AAV-293 cells with three packaging plasmids, and purified the collected virus to obtain the concentrated AAV virus with high titers.\nDay 1: AAV-293 cells are grown and plated for transfection of packaging plasmids.\nSeed 2.0 × 106 AAV-293 cells in 100 mm cell culture plates containing 10 mL of growth medium (DMEM (Macgene) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Macgene)).\nIncubate the cells in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C until the confluent is approximately 80%, about 12 h.\nDay 2: Transfection of the plasmids into the packaging cell line. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdd plasmids and transfection reagents into two clean tubes containing Opti-MEM medium, respectively.\nPlease mix them thoroughly.\nIncubate at room temperature for at least 15 min.\nNote: Amounts of plasmids and reagents needed per plate are listed below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_15.csv\nReplace with 10 mL of fresh growth medium 6 h after transfection. Transfected AAV-293 cells would be in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for another 72 h.",
    "Alternatives: You could use HEK293 cells for AAV generation as well according to this protocol.\nCritical: Since the life cycle of AAV is less than 6 h, the discarded medium might contain viruses released from packaging cells, be careful when you replace the medium and remember to sterilize the items by ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and autoclaving used in virus manipulation.\nDay 5: Collection of AAV virus.\n72 h after media refresh, cells containing AAV particles were digested by 0.25% Trypsin or gently scraped off into a 15 mL centrifuge tube, centrifuge at 800 rpm for 3 min. Discard the supernatant and wash cell pellets once with PBS. Finally, suspend the pellet with 300 μL PBS and transfer cells to a clean 1.5 mL tube.\nPut the tube containing cells in liquid nitrogen for quick freezing (about 40 min) and transfer to a 37°C water bath for thawing (about 8 min). Repeat the freezing-thawing step three times for thorough lysis of cells and release of AAV virus. Centrifuge the tube at 4°C, 10,000 rpm for 20 min and collect the supernatant containing AAV particles to continue.\nNote: We recommend to package a AAV virus containing the gene of MmPylRS/tRNAMmPyl system and GFP, which could help you measure the transfection efficiency using the GFP signal and refine your experimental process.\nConcentration of AAVPyl\nTiming: 3 h\nAdd 0.1 μL Benzonase Nuclease (Sigma) per 1 mL of the supernatant from last step. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 1 h to remove the cell genomes and plasmid DNA. Centrifuge at 4°C, 600 rpm for 10 min and collect the supernatant.",
    "The AAV-containing supernatant is concentrated using a commercial kit (Biomiga, Catalog #: V1269-02, https://biomiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/V1269.AAV_.Maxi_.pdf[href=https://biomiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/V1269.AAV_.Maxi_.pdf]) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the supernatant is loaded to the column and gradually run through the column. Then wash the column with binding buffer to exclude the nonspecific bindings and elute the AAV by elution buffer at last.\nThe purified virus sample (about 4 mL) was added to an ultrafiltration tube and centrifuged at 4°C, 1,400 rpm for 30 min to obtain approximately 1 mL of concentrated AAV.\nAliquot and store the final purified virus in PBS or DMEM at −80°C.\nPause point: The purified AAVPyl could be stored at −80°C for about 6 months. But if the fresh virus is needed in your experiment, we recommend continue to the next step without freezing the virus.\nTitration of AAVPyl\nTiming: 4 h\nThis AAV Titration protocol is to determine the number of AAV genome-containing particles of your AAV prep using SYBR green technology by quantitative PCR (qPCR).\nDesign and synthesis of the required primer sets for amplifying the conserved components, WPRE and ITR, in AAV genome.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_16.csv\nTreat the sample of your AAV virus using DNase I (Thermo) to exclude the AAV DNA that is not packaged in a viral particle.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_17.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_18.csv\nLyse the sample of DNase I-treated AAV virus using Proteinase K (Thermo).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_19.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_20.csv\nDilute the lysed AAV sample by ten-fold.\nCritical: DNase I and Proteinase K treatment are both important for tittering AAV.\nAlternatives: We recommend to make a serial dilution of your lysed AAV sample, but no less than 1: 106 dilution. The original lysed AAV sample and dilutions can all be used for qPCR.\nDilute the plasmids containing AAV genome sequences to copies of 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 1010, respectively as standards in qPCR.",
    "Set up qPCR reactions for the diluted AAV sample and standards. Two technical replicates were carried out for each sample.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_21.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_22.csv\nCreate the standard curve by plotting Ct values against the corresponding plasmid copies, and calculate the genome titer of your AAV virus based on the curve (Figure 6A[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2286-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Preparation of AAV\n(A) The standard curve by plotting Ct values (Y axis) against the AAV genome copies (X axis). The titer of your AAV could be calculated using the equation.\n(B) AAV infect primary cells and the activity is measured by the GFP positive cells percentages (mentioned in step 14 in AAV titration).\nOptional: Before starting animal experiments, you can measure the activity of AAVPyl by infecting cell lines or primary myoblast cells derived from pathogenic mice (Figure 6B[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nPart 2 In vivo restoration of dystrophin by AAVPyl delivery\nIn this part, we will investigate the in vivo efficacy of MmPylRS/tRNAMmPyl pair delivered by AAV in two routes. Remember to make sure that your pathogenic animals are ready for following experiments. For mdx mice used in this protocol, all mice are reared in house (temperature: 20°C–25°C, humidity: 40%–70%) under specific-pathogen-free conditions with lighting controlled (light: 06:00–18:00). All mice had free access to food and water. Before experiments, male and female mdx mice at 6 weeks old are randomly allocated to each experimental group (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2286_23.csv\nCritical: Here we provide a scheme for arranging four experimental groups, which is a relatively low configuration for this research. We recommend to add groups for evaluation of efficacy in different time points if you need, for example, we recommend to evaluate the efficacy and safety in 4, 6, and 8 weeks after injection.",
    "Note: Though the AAVs used in this protocol are replication-incompetent in conventional cells, the leakage of AAVs would result in undesired expression of the translation system in control or mock mice, and even the experimenters. Please wear the medical mask and gloves to do experiments and do not to handle mice from different groups at the same time.\nIntraperitoneal injection of AAVPyl in mdx mice\nTiming: 1 h\nGently remove the mouse from the cage and restrain appropriately in the head-down position (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2286-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Handling of mouse\n(A and B) Restrain the mouse in a head-down (A) or prone (B) position before AAV injection intraperitoneally (i.p.) and intramuscularly (i.m.) (steps 15–16 and 22–24 in intraperitoneal or intramuscular AAV injection).\nOptional: You can comfort the mice by gently scratching its back and head.\nInsert needle with bevel facing “up” into the lower right quadrant of the abdomen towards the head at a 30–40° angle to horizontal. Insert needle to the depth in which the entire bevel is within the abdominal cavity (no more than 2 cm).\nNote: Be careful to feel that the needle passed through the mouse skin and avoid damage to the urinary bladder.\nPull back on the plunger to ensure negative pressure prior to injecting.\nCritical: The presence of blood in the syringe indicates an abdominal blood vessel has been punctured. We recommend to discard the syringe and syringe contents and carry out experiments in other mice.\nDepress the plunger until the AAV solution (about 4.0 × 1012 AAVPyl or AAVctrl in 100 μL) has been fully administered. The injection can better be completed in 2 s. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Note: The titer of AAV here is suitable for DMD therapy in mdx mice. If you want to investigate other nonsense diseases, or in other animal models, or via other injection routes, please adjust the titer based on your needs.\nPull the needle straight out and place the syringe/needle directly into a sharps container without recapping. Use a new needle and syringe and repeat steps 15–18 for each mouse.\nNote: Please make sure there is no reflux of the injected solution.\nPlace the mouse back into its cage and monitor closely for any signs of pain, distress or illness induced by injection.\nIntramuscular injection of AAVPyl in mdx mice\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe mouse is weighed and injected intraperitoneally with 4 mL / Kg of 1% pentobarbital sodium and placed in a rearing cage for about 10 min.\nNote: For most 6-week old mdx mice, their weight is about 25 g and 100 μL of 1% pentobarbital sodium is enough for anesthesia.\nRestrain the anesthetized mouse in a prone position and secure the rear foot nearest you.\nIsolate the muscle mass to be used with your fingers or cotton balls. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Please use the muscle cranial to (in front of) the femur (that is, quadriceps), do not use the thigh muscles caudal to (behind) the femur (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nDirect the needle cranially (toward head) and insert into the quadriceps muscle. Be careful to avoid the sciatic nerve (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nNote: Be careful not to let the needle penetrate the muscles, and if necessary, hold the needle with your finger so that it does not move around.\nAspirate to ensure negative pressure prior to injecting.",
    "Critical: The presence of blood in the syringe indicates the needle has entered a blood vessel. We recommend to discard the syringe and syringe contents and carry out experiments in other mice.\nIf no blood is aspirated, depress the plunger slowly until the AAV solution (about 2.0 × 1012 AAVPyl or AAVctrl in 50 μL) has been fully administered. The injection can better be completed in 10 s.\nWithdraw the needle and discard the syringe/needle directly into a sharps container without recapping. Use a new needle and syringe and repeat steps 21–26 for each mouse.\nNote: Please make sure there is no reflux of the injected solution and no bleeding in the injection site.\nReturn the mouse to its cage and monitor closely for any signs of pain, distress or illness induced by injection.\nDaily monitoring of experimental mice\nTiming: 4–8 weeks\nInjection of the mouse intraperitoneally with 100 μL of 500 mg/mL NAEK solution or 0.9% NaCl solution every two days. Remember to vary the side injected between right and left for multiple administrations. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: The concentration of NAEK solution can be adjusted between 250 and 1,000 mg/mL if you need. Ensure that the pH of solution is about 7.0 and the injection volume is between 50 and 200 μL (50 mg NAEK).\nDaily record the body weight and survival rate of the experimental group (injected with NAEK or 0.9% NaCl solution) mice, the control group (injected with 0.9% NaCl solution) mice, and the mock group mice (healthy wild-type C57BL/6 mice).\nGrip strength tests for experimental mice\nTiming: 3–4 h (for step 31)",
    "Recovery of grip strength is a sign of disease alleviation in mdx mice. Here we design a double-blind study of grip strength for mice from each group, to measure the outcomes after treatment with no bias.\nThe four groups, AAVPyl-treated mdx mice with NAEK or 0.9% NaCl solution, AAVctrl-treated mdx mice, and wild-type C57BL/6 mice of different time points (4, 6 and 8 weeks) are randomly picked.\nTake the mouse out of the cage and lift it by the tail, causing the four limbs or a single limb to grasp the pull-plate assembly connected to the grip strength meter (Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nThe mouse is drawn along a straight line leading away from the sensor until the grip was broken and the peak amount of force in grams was recorded.\nTest 4–6 times for each mouse and collect the average grams of force.\nNote: Please test all experimental mice in a group once in turn, and then retest them in the same order for at least three times.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Grip strength measurement for four limbs of the mouse\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Grip strength measurement for two or a single limb of the mouse\nMeasurement of restored dystrophin after treatment\nTo further evaluate the dystrophin recovery in experimental mice, we should quantify and compare the protein levels in every group. We recommend to detect dystrophin expression in multiple ways, and we will provide two general approaches, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining in details here. For other diseases treatment, you could choose other approaches to demonstrate the restoration, according to the protein’s characteristics.\nWestern blot analysis for dystrophin expression\nTiming: 12 h\nIsolate the tibialis anterior muscles from experimental mice.",
    "Note: If you inject AAV intramuscularly, be careful to tell the two anterior muscles from different legs, injected with AAV or not.\nTissue is broken with a homogenizer at 3,000 rpm for 1 min and tissue debris was removed by centrifugation at 4°C, 16,000 rpm for 15 min.\nAdd RIPA buffer and protease inhibitor to extract total proteins from supernatant and quantify them by BCA assay, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo, catalog #: 23227, https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf]).\n100 μg of protein from each sample is boiled with loading buffer respectively.\nAlternatives: The high amount of loaded proteins is because of dystrophin characteristics. You could load 20–100 μg of sample proteins for electrophoresis, but we recommend to determine an optimal usage for your target proteins at first.\nElectrophoresis: Separate samples on 4%–12% NuPAGE (Invitrogen) with a voltage of 120 V.\nActivate a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with methanol for 30 s before use, and remove air bubbles between the layers with a glass rod.\nElectroblotting in a 4°C refrigerator with a voltage of 100 V for 1 h.

    "Alternatives: Since we have incorporated an unnatural amino acid, NAEK, into dystrophin, the functional side chain could be conjugated with fluorescent dye by click reaction (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). We could incubate the slides with Click-iT Alexa Fluor 488 sDIBO (1: 1,000, C20020, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h, instead of the primary and secondary antibodies. This labelling method is simpler in manipulation and efficient in imaging, while after incubation you need to carefully wash the sections by PBS to exclude the unconjugated dye.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2286-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.
