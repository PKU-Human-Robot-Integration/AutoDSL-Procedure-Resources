    "1. Fixation\nFixatives are carcinogenic; wear gloves and handle the fixatives in a fume hood. Unless otherwise noted, all incubations are done on ice and all solutions should be filtered before use. Use electron microscopy-grade reagents.\nDay 1\nAfter experimental conditions (e.g. viral injection, drug treatment), place the membrane with organotypic hippocampal slices in a 60 x 15 mm polystyrene Petri dish containing ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer (Sorensen's phosphate buffer), pH 7.3. Add 1 - 2 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer directly on top of the slices to keep them cold.\nCRITICAL STEP: Always use freshly prepared buffers and fixatives. Make sure the pH of buffer is within desired range. A failure to do so could damage cellular structures.\nTo isolate the CA1 subfield of the slice, use a disposable scalpel to gently cut across the slice next to the DG, parallel to the CA1 cell layer (Figure 1). Then cut the remaining slice vertically to remove the CA3 subfield and the subiculum. Cut a corner of the slice to help identify the top surface of the tissue.\nNOTE: In case no viral delivery of protein of interest is required, the entire tissue slice can be fixed after the media is removed with a gentle rinse of ice-cold buffer. This is then followed by cutting out the CA1.\nCRITICAL STEP: Keep track of the topside of the tissue in order for proper sectioning of the grids later on.\nCarefully remove the tissue from the membrane using the backside of the scalpel. Use a Pasteur pipette to gently transfer the tissue to a 12-well plate containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer.",
    "Remove the buffer in the well from the plate and add 500 μl - 1 ml of ice-cold fixative (pH 7.3) comprised of the following: 0.1% picric acid, 1% paraformaldehyde, and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Incubate for 2 hr at 4 °C.\nNOTE: Picric acid may be explosive when dry. Keep it wetted with water in a container tightly closed. Store in a dry and well-ventilated place.\nRemove the fixative from the well and wash samples 3 times (20 min each) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer.\nIncubate for 40 min in 1% tannic acid (w/v) in 0.1 M maleate buffer, pH 6.0.\nRinse twice (20 min each) in maleate buffer.\nIncubate for 40 min in 1% uranyl acetate (w/v) in maleate buffer in the dark. Uranyl acetate is sensitive to light and is radioactive. Cover the beaker with Parafilm when dissolving and store any unused buffer in dark at 4 °C.\nRinse twice (20 min each) in maleate buffer.\nIncubate for 20 min in 0.5% platinum chloride (w/v) in maleate buffer.\nRinse twice (20 min each) in maleate buffer. Store the samples at 4 °C until they are ready for further processing.\n2. Dehydration and Embedding\nPropylene oxide is carcinogenic. Avoid vapors by working with it in a fume hood. Use absolute, 100% pure ethanol that contains no trace of water. Dilute this absolute ethanol to produce different concentrations for dehydration.\nDay 2\nIncubate for 5 min in 50% ethanol and then for 5 min in 70% ethanol.\nIncubate for 15 min in freshly prepared 1% p-phenylenediamine (PPD) in 70% ethanol.\nRinse three times in 70% ethanol.\nIncubate for 5 min in 80% ethanol and then for 5 min in 95% ethanol.\nIncubate in 100% ethanol twice 5 min each.",
    "Prepare glass vials with screw caps and make sure they are clean and completely dry. Transfer slices to glass vials and label each vial simply and clearly.\nIncubate for 5 min in 1:1 ethanol:propylene oxide.\nIncubate in 100% propylene oxide twice 5 min each.\nAdd resin (Epon) to each vial to make a 1:1 mixture with propylene oxide. Gently mix for 2 hr. Do not shake the vials too rigorously to prevent bubbles that could interfere with embedding.\nAdd resin to make a 3:1 mixture with propylene oxide, and mix for 2 hr.\nTransfer to 100% resin and incubate O/N.\nDay 3\nSandwich samples between strips of ACLAR plastic and cure for 24 hr at 60 °C.\n3. Sectioning and Mounting on Grids\nDay 4\nCut semi-thin (0.5 μm) sections and stain with 1% toluidine blue + 1% borax to determine the correct orientation of samples.\nCut ultrathin sections (60 nm) and mount on nickel grids, one section per grid.\n4. Immunohistochemistry\nAll buffers and water should be filtered before use.\nDay 5\nPlace a drop (~50 μl) of 1% Tween-20/phosphate buffer (T/PB), pH 7.5, on a piece of clean Parafilm on a flat surface. Gently pick up the grid with clean forceps by the edge and float it on the buffer, section down, and incubate for 10 min at RT.\nDrain excess liquid from the grid by placing section side up on to filter paper and then float on 50 mM glycine in T/PB for 15 min at RT.",
    "CRITICAL STEP: To avoid excessive 'carry-over' of solutions from one solution droplet to the next during the incubations, drain excess liquid by gently touching the edge of the grid onto #1 filter paper between each solution change. Also remove any solution trapped between the arms of the EM forceps holding the grid by gently wicking with a sliver of filter paper between the forceps arms while ensuring the sections do not dry out completely.\nDry the grid with filter paper and then float on blocking solution containing 2.5% BSA and 2.5% serum from the animal of the secondary antibody in T/PB for 30 min at RT.\nIncubate with primary antibody (in T/PB) at RT or O/N at 4 °C. The optimal time and temperature of incubation, as well as antibody concentration, need to be experimentally determined.\nWash the grid three times (2 min each) with T/PB.\nIncubate with secondary antibody (1:20 anti-rabbit or anti-mouse coupled to 10 nm gold) for 1 hr at RT.\nWash three times (2 min each) with T/PB.\nPostfix with 2% glutaraldehyde in T/PB for 5 min.\nWash three times (2 min each) with T/PB and then three times (2 min each) with filtered water.\nIncubate with 2% uranyl acetate in water for 10 min.\nWhile the grid is staining, prepare a CO2-free chamber by placing a piece of Parafilm in the center of a glass Petri dish. Then place 4-6 pellets of NaOH in the dish around the Parafilm to absorb CO2 in the air. Keep the top closed for a few minutes. Use a Pasteur pipette and quickly transfer a small volume of Reynold's lead citrate solution to the Parafilm in the glass Petri dish. Open the top just enough to insert the Pasteur pipette to minimize the re-introduction of CO2 into the chamber.",
    "NOTE: To make Reynold's lead citrate solution, boil 100 ml of deionized water in a microwave oven and let cool in an airtight container. In a 50 ml volumetric flask with stopper, mix 1.33 g lead nitrate, 1.76 g sodium citrate and 30 ml of the boiled water by shaking vigorously for 1 min. Then shake intermittently for 30 min. To this cloudy solution, add 8 ml of 1 M sodium hydroxide and slowly invert the flask a few times. Solution will become clear. Bring the solution to 50 ml with the boiled water. Store the solution tightly sealed. If precipitate appears, discard and make a new one.\nIn three smaller beakers prepare warm, freshly boiled deionized water. Wash off the uranyl acetate by dipping the grid in the first beaker and gently swirl it around for 30 sec. Repeat this step in the other two beakers.\nOpen the top of the glass Petri dish just enough to place the grid on the drop of Reynold's lead citrate solution. If possible, wear a mask while doing this to avoid breathing on lead citrate and to prevent formation of precipitate. Incubate for 10 min.\nOpen the top just enough to remove the grid. Avoid breathing on the lead citrate. Wash the grid three times by dipping it sequentially in three beakers with warm, freshly boiled distilled water. Let the grid dry on a piece of filter paper, section up. The sample is now ready for the electron microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
