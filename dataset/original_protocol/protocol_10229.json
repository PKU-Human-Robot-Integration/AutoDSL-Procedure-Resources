    "1. Growth and Enumeration of Bacteria\nNOTE: This is applicable to almost any bacterial strain grown in the appropriate medium36. In our example, we use three strains: Serratia marcescens as a common, easy identifiable lab strain; and a smaller, highly motile environmental strain, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. To compare detection of motile vs. non-motile cells, a non-motile Shewanella mutant, Δ FlgM, is also used for comparison37. All strains are grown in lysogeny broth (LB).\nPrepare sterile LB medium (per liter of distilled water: 10 g bacto tryptone, 5 g bacto yeast, 10 g NaCl; filter or autoclave). Prepare standard 100 mm diameter LB-agar plates (same recipe as medium plus 15 g agar per liter; autoclave (121 °C, 20 min) to sterilize and pour when cool enough to handle). Store medium and plates in refrigerator.\nThe day before the experiment seed 5 - 6 mL of \"Master\" culture medium from a fresh bacterial colony, using correct sterile and biosafety technique. Incubate on a shaker (120 rpm) at 30 °C for ~12 h. Incubation time will be dependent on the strain and growth rate. In our experiments, the Shewanella strains are incubated for 12 hours; however, Serratia is harvested after 8 hours, to ensure the culture will be exhibiting mid-logarithmic growth.\nThe day of the experiment, take a spectrophotometric reading (OD600) of the bacterial Master culture, which is expected to be in the range of 0.6 to 0.7. It should be in the logarithmic growth phase (as determined previously). If not, subculture 100 µL into 5 mL of medium and allow cell growth to the mid-log phase.\nTake a sample of the Master culture and count the cells directly using a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber. This will enumerate both live and dead cells.",
    "Extract a 10 µL sample of the undiluted culture with a micropipette and transfer into the chamber.\nImage under a high-dry objective microscope (40X or 63X, NA 0.7 - 0.8) using phase contrast.\nCount the bacteria in at least 20 squares and average.\n\t\tNOTE: Count only those bacteria which are entirely within a square and only those crossing over the top and left boundaries (or bottom and right, if you prefer). If squares are separated by several lines, choose one as a boundary.\nCalculate concentration as the average of 20 squares x dilution factor. Note that direct counts do not work well for concentrations <107/mL.\nMake serial dilutions of the culture for counting of colony-forming units (CFU). This will enumerate live cells only.\nMake a serial dilution of each of the selected bacterial samples with sterile 0.9% saline solution. Transfer 20 µL of the bacterial solution and dilute it with 180 µL saline. Repeat until the lowest concentration is ~103 cells/mL.\nTake 100 µL from at least two dilutions-suggested are 103 and 104/mL — and plate on an appropriate solid media plate. Spread with a sterile spreader. Perform at least 3 replicates of each dilution.\nIncubate at an appropriate temperature for your bacteria overnight or until colonies grow.\nCount colonies and calculate colony forming units (CFU) according to (# of colonies x dilution factor)/volume plated = CFU/mL. Average CFU over the replicates.\n2. Preparation of Highly Dilute Samples for DHM\nMake serial dilutions of the Master culture for DHM and post-DHM counting of colony-forming units on LB media plates (See 1.4.1 - 1.4.4). Perform this double-blind so that the person doing the recordings is unaware of the concentration in each measured sample.",
    "Dilute the bacteria into 10 - 15 mL of a minimal medium that will encourage motility (as appropriate) but inhibit cell division, so that the concentration of cells does not change appreciably during the experiment. This may be 0.9% saline or a more specific motility medium. For example, if using Escherichia coli, motility medium must contain EDTA38. For these examples, we use 0.9% saline.\n3. Recording DHM Videos\nUsing a sterile syringe, pull in about 10 mL of the dilution of interest.\nConnect the syringe to the DHM sample chamber using sterile fittings and tubing.\n\tNOTE: A custom-made microfluidic chamber was constructed in order to allow the consistent flow of sample through the optical path of the instrument. See the Results section for more details. Prior to the experiment, all components of the sample chamber should be sterilized by autoclaving.\nFlow the sample from the syringe through the sample chamber continuously using a syringe pump.\n\tNOTE: Appropriate flow rates vary depending on fluidic channel dimensions, desired throughput as well as data acquisition limitations.\nAs the sample is flowed through the sample chamber, acquire holograms consecutively at an appropriate frame rate. A time-stamp file will be created which logs the time of each image capture to be used later during data analysis (protocol section 4). Obtain all holograms at ambient temperature (23° C). Record holograms by executing a pre-written C++ executable file provided by the camera manufacturer.\n\tNOTE: Appropriate frame rates vary depending on the flow rate chosen. For this experiment, it is recommended to use a frame rate such that a bacterium would be imaged >2 times as it traveled across the instrument's field of view.\nAllow sufficient time for the entire 10 mL of sample to be flowed through the DHM.",
    "To ensure that bacteria are not growing or dying during the experiments, inoculate enriched media plates with 100 µL of the spent media post-DHM image capture. Spread with a sterile spreader and incubate at appropriate temp for 24 hours; count colonies present.\n4. Calculation of Cell Density and Limits of Detection\nWith the acquired hologram videos, analyze the data for presence of bacteria.\nCalculate the median pixel value for a time series of holograms then subtract this median value from each respective pixel to eliminate stationary artifacts in the hologram. This may be done in ImageJ by performing the following steps:\n\t\t\nConvert to 32-bit (Image-Type-32 bit)\nCalculate the median (Image-Stack-Zproject-Median)\nSubtract the median from the rest of the stack (Process-ImageCalculator-Subtract)\nCount the number of visible Airy rings and in-focus cells manually. In ImageJ, this is done by pointing at the objects with the Point tool.\nEach series of holograms will be accompanied by a time-stamp file (recorded at time of hologram acquisition). Use the time-stamp file to calculate the total amount of sample pumped at the time the image was captured.\nCalculate the cell density by dividing the total number of cells detected by the total volume of sample imaged. Average 5 - 10 frames for accurate statistics.\n5. Image Reconstruction to Amplitude and Phase\nChoose representative videos with 10 - 200 cells per frame. Load raw (not median-subtracted) holograms into the reconstruction software (examples: ImageJ Numerical Propagation39; SHAMPOO [GitHub]).\nUsing ImageJ, go to OD-Numerical Propagation-Numerical Diffraction.\nAt the prompt, draw a Fourier mask to choose the real or virtual image and eliminate any sinusoidal noise features.\nReconstruct amplitude and phase at appropriate z-steps by entering the reconstruction distance.\nMedian subtract the amplitude data to reduce noise as in 4.1.1.",
