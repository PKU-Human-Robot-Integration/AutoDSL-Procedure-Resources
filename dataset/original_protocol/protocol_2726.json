    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe following steps describe how to isolate nuclei from snap-frozen human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) for subsequent full-length single nuclei transcriptional profiling.\nTissue pulverization and homogenization\nTiming: 30 min\nThe following steps describe how to pulverize and homogenize snap-frozen human subcutaneous WAT.\nAdd 2mL of homogenization buffer into glass vessel and place on ice in a beaker.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2383-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. White Adipose Tissue pulverization and homogenization\n(A) Human WAT prior to pulverization. WAT on the right has had a cleaner biopsy and is ideal starting material.\n(B) Human WAT in LN2 prior to pulverization (step 2b).\n(C) Human WAT during pulverization (step 2c).\n(D) Human WAT powdered after LN2 has evaporated (step 2e).\n(E) Powdered WAT in glass vessel prior to homogenization (step 2f).\n(F) WAT after homogenization (step 3).\n(G) WAT homogenate in 1.7mL LoBind Tubes.\nPulverize 100mg of frozen human subcutaneous WAT in liquid nitrogen (LN2) using a mortar and pestle (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1D).\nNote: This step does not need to be performed in a safety hood. It is advised to wear cryogloves to assist with handling the mortar and pestle when using LN2. A face shield should be worn during this process to protect the face from LN2. Care should be taken not to splash the LN2 when performing the pulverization.\nNote: We have previously isolated nuclei from 50mg of WAT and 50mg of VAT using this technique. Reducing the starting material of WAT to 50mg poses the risk of not isolating enough nuclei for subsequent ICELL8cx dispense and therefore 100mg starting material is recommended. If using 50mg of WAT, it is recommended to scale down the homogenization and nuclei resuspension buffers to reduce loss of nuclei.",
    "To cool the mortar and pestle with LN2, first pour LN2 in the mortar with pestle until full, let it evaporate and repeat once for a total of two times.\nIn a separate mortar place spatula and pour LN2. Continue to top up LN2 during pulverization process to keep spatula cool.\nNote: It is important to keep all pulverization equipment cool during the entire pulverization step.\nRe-fill mortar with LN2 and then place 100mg of WAT in the mortar.\nNote: Keep sample on dry ice until it is in the mortar.\nPulverize tissue by firmly pressing down on WAT with pestle in the mortar.\nContinue strokes until WAT has completely powdered (approximately 50 strokes).\nNote: During this time, you may need to top up LN2 (approximately twice) to ensure equipment and tissue stays cold.\nTilt the mortar towards the lip and let LN2 evaporate. This will leave a pile of pulverized WAT.\nNote: When LN2 is evaporating, pulverized tissue may pop into the air. Wearing laboratory glasses is highly recommended.\nUse LN2 cooled spatula to scrape the pulverized WAT into the glass vessel containing 2mL of homogenization buffer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCritical: Omitting the pulverization step significantly reduces nuclei yield from human WAT.\nHomogenize 12 strokes forward and 12 strokes backward with automated dounce homogenizer (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nNote: If an automated dounce homogenizer is not available, manual hand douncing should be sufficient with 10 strokes of pestle A and 10 strokes of pestle B, although this has not been validated.\nCritical: There should be no visible lumps after this process.\nTransfer homogenate equally to 2 × 1.7mL LoBind tubes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nUse 400μL of homogenization buffer to clean glass vessel and add to the LoBind tubes containing the homogenate.\nNote: Each tube should contain 1200μL of homogenate.\nNuclei isolation",
    "Timing: 90 min\nThe following steps describe nuclei isolation, filtration, and cleaning steps to achieve a clean nuclei preparation .All steps should be performed on ice, unless otherwise stated.\nAdd 12 μL of 10% Triton X-100 to each 1.7mL LoBind Tubes (to achieve 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v)) and pulse vortex.\nLeave on ice for 30 min, protect from light and pulse vortex every 5 min.\nPlace a 100μm filter over a 50mL conical tube and a 40μm filter over a 50mL conical tube and pre-wet each filter with 100μL PBS (−/−).\nFilter homogenate solution through 100μm and 40μm filters (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). This step can be completed on a flat bench lab and does not need to be completed on ice.\nNote: It is advised to work quickly because it is not done on ice.\nPipette homogenate through 100μm filter into the 50mL conical tube.\nUse 400μL homogenization buffer to wash any remaining homogenate solution from the 1.7mL LoBind tubes and transfer through 100μm filter.\nPipette homogenate solution through the 40μm filter into the 50mL conical tube.\nDispense filtered homogenate solution equally into pre-chilled 2 × 1.7mL LoBind Tubes.\nCentrifuge the homogenates at 2700g for 10 min at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2383-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Nuclei Isolation\n(A) 100μm (left) and 40μm (right) filters after homogenate solution has been filtered through (step 8).\n(B) WAT homogenate after initial centrifugation (step 9). Lipid layer and lipid smear can form at the top. Nuclei pellet can be seen at the bottom of the Eppendorf. N.B. Pellet can also be smaller than one in the picture.\n(C) WAT homogenate after removal of lipid layer and supernatant. Tube on the right is after re-suspension in ∼50μL (step 11–13).\n(D) Nuclei pellet after 2nd centrifugation (step 14).\n(E) Nuclei pellet after the 3rd centrifugation step (step 19).",
    "(F) Nuclei after being resuspended in nuclei resuspension buffer before 25g filtering (step 22).\n(G) Nuclei after 25g filtering (step 23).\nNote: Following centrifugation, nuclei should be visible at the bottom of the Eppendorf as a pellet. There is usually a layer of lipid on the top of homogenate solution. When isolating nuclei from human WAT we found 1000g is insufficient to pellet down from the lipid.\nRemove lipid layer by carefully pipetting off using a P1000 tip.\nRemove remaining supernatant and leave ∼50μL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: If you have a larger pellet, remove supernatant up until you reach the pellet.\nRepeat for 2nd tube containing homogenate solution.Keep 1st tube on ice during the process.\nCritical: It is important to perform steps 10–12 in an quick manner to prevent nuclei resuspending in solution and being removed with supernatant.\nRe-suspend 50μL of homogenate solution in each 1.7mL LoBind tube and combine to one 1.7mL LoBind tube.\nResuspend first 50μL pellet thoroughly with pipetting up and down (approximately 30 times).\nTransfer homogenate solution to pre-chilled 1.7mL LoBind tube.\nResuspend second 50μL pellet solution thoroughly with pipetting up and down (approximately 30 times).\nTransfer homogenate solution to pre-chilled 1.7mL LoBind used in step 13b.\nNote: The homogenate solution will now be in the same 1.7mL LoBind tube.\nAdd 100μL homogenization buffer to homogenate solution and mix by pipetting.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at 2700g for 10 min at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Following centrifugation step there should be a visible pellet and no lipid at the top.\nRemove supernatant and leave ∼50μL.\nResuspend 50μL pellet thoroughly by pipetting up and down (approximately 30 times).\nAdd 950μL of Nuclei Resuspension buffer and mix with pipetting.\nCentrifuge the nuclei at 2700g for 10 min at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).",
    "Note: This centrifugation step can be reduced to 1000g.\nRemove supernatant and leave ∼50μL.\nResuspend 50μL pellet thoroughly by pipetting up and down (approximately 30 times).\nAdd 450μL of Nuclei Resuspension buffer and mix with pipetting (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nFilter nuclei solution through 25g syringe 10 times (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nCritical: Be careful not to let the 25g syringe touch the plastic of the 1.7mL LoBind Tube. This step helps to prevent nuclei aggregation.\nStaining and counting nuclei\nTiming: 15 min\nThe following steps detail how to stain and count the number of nuclei extracted.\nAdd 1 drop of ReadyProbes NucBlue (Hoechst 33342) to the 500 μL nuclei solution and leave on ice protected from light for 15 min.\nNote: It is possible to count the nuclei extracted using DAPI under a microscope.\nMix nuclei solution with pipetting before immediately adding 10μL of nuclei solution to countess slide.\nCount nuclei with Countess 3 Automated Cell Counter (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2383-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Isolated Nuclei from human WAT\nNuclei isolated from human subcutaneous WAT and stained with NucBlue and counted with Countess 3 Automated Cell Counter. Image is jpg readout from the Countess 3.\nNote: Typical yield is 180K nuclei at a concentration of 360K/mL.\nTo ensure accurate nuclei loading on the ICELL8 CX, we recommend diluting the sample with DPBS (−/−) to 200K/mL and re-counting for validation.\nICELL8 CX single nucleus RNA sequencing\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThe following steps describe how to load the nuclei isolation onto ICELL8 CX platform and the parameters used for detecting nanowells that contain a single nucleus.\nNuclei preparation is mixed with reagents from TakaraBio USA SMART-Seq® ICELL8® Application Kit – 5 Chip (including second diluent (100x), BSA (1%), RNase Inhibitor (40 U/μL), SMART-Seq ICELL8 CDS) and DPBS (−/−) to achieve a final concentration of 40K nuclei/mL.",
    "Dispense nuclei solution onto ICELL8 350v chip as per manufacturer’s instructions.\nConfirmation of single nucleus candidacy is checked using ICELL8 CellSelect software. The following settings used to detect which nanowells contain a single nucleus can be found in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2383_3.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2383-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Confirmation of single cell candidature using TakaraBio USA Cellselect software\n(A) A nanowell showing a single nucleus. These nanowells are selected for downstream processing.\n(B) A nanowell void of nuclei.\n(C) A nanowell with more than one nucleus.\n(D) A nanowell with more than one nucleus clustered together.\nNote: The algorithm can include some false negatives that are usually identified as no cells even when there is a cell. By ordering the cells by type and confidence, it is advised to check for non-cell nanowells that do contain a nuclei and manually push these through using cellselect software.\nSingle nuclei RNA-Seq libraries are prepared according to the recommendation of the manufacturer. (https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/SMART/SMART-Seq%20ICELL8%20cx%20Application%20Kit%20User%20Manual.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/SMART/SMART-Seq%20ICELL8%20cx%20Application%20Kit%20User%20Manual.pdf]).\nNote: TakaraBio have recently updated their technology to SMART-Seq Pro. (https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/SMART/SMART-Seq%20Pro%20Application%20Kit%20User%20Manual.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/SMART/SMART-Seq%20Pro%20Application%20Kit%20User%20Manual.pdf]). This nuclei isolation technique has also been validated by SMART-Seq Pro.\nThe single nuclei RNA-Seq libraries are quantified for cDNA content using Qubit™ 1X dsDNA Assay Kits, high sensitivity (HS) and broad range (BR) and following manufacturers instructions. Typical yield is approximately 20 ng/μL.\nNote: Total DNA yield is lower with SMART-Seq Pro and is likely due to different PCR steps and number of cycles used.\ncDNA library is diluted to 2 ng/μL and checked for quality using High sensitivity DNA kit on Agilent Bioanalyzer following manufacturer’s instructions.\nFor a good quality library, we expect to have >80% of total bp to between 200–1000bp and overall concentration to be between 5–10mM.\nTwo snRNA-Seq libraries can be sequenced simultaneously with Illumina HiSeq 4000 aiming for 250 million paired end reads.",
    "Note: The library is compatible with any Illumina sequencing platform using dual 8nt barcode. We typically sequence two snRNA-libraries (index A kit and index B kit) on a single HiSeq lane. If ICELL8 full length libraries would be pooled with other types of library, please check the barcoding scheme to avoid demultiplexing issue (page 39–44 https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/SMART/SMART-Seq%20ICELL8%20cx%20Application%20Kit%20User%20Manual.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/SMART/SMART-Seq%20ICELL8%20cx%20Application%20Kit%20User%20Manual.pdf])."
