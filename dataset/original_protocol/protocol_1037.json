    "**Part 1. Sample preparation for proteome-wide SICyLIA analysis**\n**1. Cell-based SICyLIA application**\n\\(1) Plate cells to be compared \\(i.e. GEMM-derived wild-type and knock-out cells) in 10 cm dishes in regular medium and grow overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Use a density that achieves ==<sub>== 80% confluence after ==</sub>== 20 hrs \\(i.e. 1 million cells). \n\\(2) Pre-chill bench top centrifuge to 4 °C\n\\(3) Prepare lysis buffer 1 \\(100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 4% SDS) and immediately before cell lysis and protein extraction, add light or heavy iodoacetamide \\(IAM) to lysis buffer 1 to achieve 55 mM IAM solutions.\n→ Note: iodoacetamide is unstable and light sensitive, so solutions are best made fresh and kept in the dark until use. \n\\(4) Remove medium and wash cell monolayers twice with pre-chilled PBS \\(4 °C) ensuring to aspirate PBS thoroughly.\n\\(5) Add 500 µl lysis buffer 1 with IAM per dish and immediately scrape cells using a cell lifter.\n\\(6) Collect lysates in Eppendorf tubes.\n\\(7) Sonicate lysates for 4 x 5 s to shear DNA/RNA.\n→ Note: heavy IAM \\(<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>INO) can be affected by hydrogen-deuterium exchange, which is exacerbated at high pH and temperature. This has been minimised in our protocol through optimisation of pH and temperature at all steps. Here, it is important to use ice during sonication to ensure samples do not heat up, yet prevent the SDS buffer from precipitating on ice over time. Clean sonicator thoroughly with 70% EtOH between samples to prevent cross-contamination. \n\\(8) Centrifuge lysates at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at RT.\n\\(9) Transfer supernatants to new Eppendorf tubes and incubate in a bench top shaker at 1400 rpm for 1 h in the dark at room temperature \\(RT).\n\\(10) Determine protein concentration of samples using bicinchoninic acid \\(BCA) assay or equivalent.",
    "\\(11) Store samples in the freezer \\(-80 °C) until further processing.\n**2. Tissue-based SICyLIA application**\n_Note: this procedure was optimised for the analysis of mouse kidney tissues. Tissue resection and homogenisation strategy suitable for the tissue type under study may need to be optimised._ \n\\(1) Pre-chill plastic or glass dishes, scalpel, and forceps on dry ice.\n\\(2) Pre-chill Precellys24 bead-based homogeniser \\(Bertin Instruments, or equivalent).\n\\(3) Prepare lysis buffer 1 and immediately before tissue homogenisation, add light or heavy IAM to lysis buffer 1 to achieve 55 mM IAM solutions.\n→ Note: iodoacetamide is unstable and light sensitive, so solutions are best made fresh and kept in the dark until use. \n\\(4) Prepare homogenisation tubes by adding 800 µl lysis buffer 1 with IAM to the ceramic beads. \n\\(5) Sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation. \n→ Note: this is preferred over CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, as this can induce tissue hypoxia and influence cellular redox status. \n\\(6) Excise kidneys, place in plastic tubes, and snap freeze tubes in liquid nitrogen. \n\\(7) Once frozen, place kidneys on pre-chilled plastic or glass dishes on dry ice and excise representative samples.\n→ Note: ensure tissue does not defrost at any stage of the procedure until homogenisation to preserve cellular redox status.   \n\\(8) Add frozen tissue slices to homogenisation tubes with lysis buffer, and immediately homogenise for 3 × 20 s at 5000 rpm.\n\\(9) Centrifuge lysates at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at RT.\n\\(10) Transfer supernatants to new Eppendorf tubes and incubate in a bench top shaker at 1400 rpm for 1 h in the dark at RT.\n\\(11) Determine protein concentration of samples using bicinchoninic acid \\(BCA) assay or equivalent.\n\\(12) Store samples in the freezer \\(-80 °C) until further processing.\n**Part 2. Reduce/alkylate and proteome digestion**",
    "\\(1) Pre-chill bench top shaker and centrifuge to 4 °C\n\\(2) Thaw samples by incubating in a bench top shaker at RT until homogenously mixed and combine volumes equivalent to 150 µg of protein from the heavy and light labelled samples for SICyLIA analysis. \n→ Note: use label-swap replication: heavy IAM-labelled wild-type replicate 1 with light IAM-labelled knock-out replicate 1 forms forward replicate 1; light IAM-labelled wild-type replicate 2 with heavy IAM-labelled knock-out replicate 2 forms reverse replicate 1, etc.\n\\(3) Transfer additional volumes equivalent to 150 µg of protein of all samples for dimethyl labelling for proteome normalisation.\n→ Note: keep these samples separate; they are not combined until after dimethyl labelling\n\\(4) Bring the total volume of all samples to 300 µl by adding ammonium bicarbonate \\(Ambic, 0.1 M stock solution in water, pH 7.0).\n\\(5) Add dithiothreitol \\(DTT) to all samples to a final concentration of 71 mM \\(1 M stock solution in water, freshly made). \n\\(6) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm for 1 h at RT or 4 °C.\n\\(7) Bring the volume to 650 µl by adding Ambic.\n\\(8) Add N-ethylmaleimide \\(NEM) to all samples to a final concentration of 90 mM \\(0.2 M stock solution in water, freshly made).\n\\(9) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm for 1 h at RT.\n\\(10) Add TCA to all samples to a final concentration of 25% w/v \\(100% stock solution) in water to precipitate proteins.\n\\(11) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 300 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. \n\\(12) Centrifuge samples at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\\(13) Carefully remove supernatants and add 1 ml of TCA \\(10% stock solution) to protein pellets.",
    "\\(14) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 300 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. \n\\(15) Centrifuge samples at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\\(16) Wash pellets with water until pH = 7.0 \\(typically 4-5 washes required).\n\\(17) After last wash, centrifuge samples at 16000 _g_ for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\\(18) Remove supernatants and re-suspend protein pellets in 50 µl Urea buffer \\(8 M stock solution in water).\n\\(19) Incubate in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm for 15 min at RT.\n\\(20) Add 150 µl Ambic and vortex samples.\n\\(21) Add Lys-C \\(ratio 1:33 enzyme:protein) and incubate in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm for 1 hour at RT.\n\\(22) Bring volume to 500 µl with Ambic \\(pH 7.0) and vortex samples.\n\\(23) Add Trypsin \\(ratio 1:25 enzyme:protein) and incubate overnight in a bench top shaker at 1000 rpm at RT.\n→ Note: proteome digestion is usually carried out at higher pH and temperature to allow the enzymes to work optimally, but this can also promote hydrogen-deuterium exchange on heavy IAM. We established that overnight digestion at RT and pH 7.0 does not compromise efficiency as it had minimal effects on the miscleavage rate, while minimising hydrogen-deuterium exchange.\n\\(24) Next morning, acidify samples with trifluoroacetic acid \\(TFA, 50% stock solution in water) to a final concentration of 5%.\n\\(25) Forward/reverse mixed SICyLIA samples can now be stored at -80 °C until fractionation \\(Part 4).

Off-line reverse phase HPLC fractionation**\n\\(1) Reduce all sample volumes to 300 µl using vacuum centrifugation to remove ACN and TFA.\n\\(2) Bring the volume up to 500 µl per sample to match the injection loop volume, using HPLC solvent A.\n\\(3) Equilibrate the C18 column \\(150 × 2.1 mm i.d. - Kinetex EVO \\(5 µm, 100 Å)) using 4% HPLC solvent B. \n\\(4) Inject samples \\(500 µl) manually through a Rheodyne valve onto the RP-HPLC column. \n\\(5) Apply a two-step gradient at a flow-rate of 200 µl/min \\(from 4–27% B in 36 min, then from 27–48% B in 8 min) followed by a 5 min washing step at 80% solvent B and a 10 min re-equilibration step, for a total run time of 65 min.",
    "\\(6) Monitor column eluate at 220 and 280 nm and collect fractions using a Foxy Jr. FC144 fraction collector \\(Dionex).

For all gradients, use 20 min for step one and 7 min for step two. Change the percentage of MS solvent B \\(%B) as follows: For F1-7, %B was 2 at the start, 20 at step one, and 39 at step two. For F8-14, %B was 4 at the start, 23 at step one, and 43 at step two. For F15-21, %B was 6 at the start, 28 at step one, and 48 at step two. Follow all gradients by a washing step \\(100% B) for 10 min followed by a 5 min re-equilibration step \\(5%), for a total run time of 40 min.",
    "\\(5) Load samples with 8 µl of MS solvent A into a 20 cm fused silica emitter \\(New Objective) packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ, 1.9 μm resin \\(Dr Maisch GmbH). Keep the packed emitter at 35 °C using a column oven \\(Sonation) integrated into the nanoelectrospray ion source \\(Thermo Scientific). Eluting peptides are electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer \\(Q-Exactive HF, Thermo Scientific) using a nanoelectrospray ion source \\(Thermo Scientific). An Active Background Ion Reduction Device is used to decrease air contaminants signal level.  \n_Note on conditions:_ Use the following ionisation conditions: spray voltage 2.1 kV, ion transfer tube temperature 250 °C. Carry out acquisition in positive ion mode using data dependent acquisition; acquire a full scan \\(FT-MS) over mass range of 375–1400 m/z at 60,000 resolution at 200 m/z, with a target value of 3,000,000 ions for a maximum injection time of 20 ms.

Please see the Supplementary Note of the SICyLIA publication \\[5] for extended substantiation of this statistical approach. \n\\(29) Processing --- Density estimation. With x: log2 Median peptide oxidation ratio, and y: log2 Intensity.  \n→ Note: you can now create a density plot with x: log2 Median peptide oxidation ratio, and y: log2 Intensity.
