While Xie et al. describe how icSARS-CoV-2-mNG was generated, here we describe its propagation in Vero E6 cells.\nDay 1\nSeed Vero E6 cells in a clearly labeled T-175 flask(s) at a seeding cell density of 18 × 106 cells per flask (85%–90% confluency) in 25 mL complete DMEM.\nIncubate flasks overnight in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nSeed at least one additional flask in parallel for each propagation cycle to use for cell counting.\nNote: Multiple flasks can be seeded if larger quantities of stock are desired. ∼80 aliquots can be generated per T-175 flask (see step 16 below).\nNote: Mock control cells are necessary if different strains of virus are being propagated simultaneously to ensure there is no cross contamination.\nDay 2\nDetermine cell number using the additional flask prepared as follows:\nAspirate medium from flask and wash once with 12 mL PBS.\nAdd 5 mL 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and incubate flask in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nMonitor for cellular detachment using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. Gentle tapping of the flask is encouraged. Detachment should take no longer than 5 min.\nAdd 3 mL complete DMEM to the flask to inactivate trypsin. Using a serological pipette, gently wash the cell monolayer several times to create a single cell suspension.\nCollect the cell suspension into a 50 mL conical tube.\nWash the flask twice with 8 mL complete DMEM to collect residual cells. Transfer washes into same 50 mL conical tube used to collect original cell suspension.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 500 × g for 10 min.",
    "Aspirate the resulting supernatant and resuspend the cells in 8 mL complete DMEM. Perform a cell counting per flask using any desired method (e.g., hemocytometer).\nNote: We have found that diluting the cell stock 1:8 (dilution factor of 8) in complete DMEM works best for hemocytometer counts using these conditions.\nUsing the total cell number per flask, calculate the required volume of stock icSARS-CoV-2-mNG needed to achieve a multiplicity of infection [MOI; number of plaque forming units (PFU) of virus per cell] of 0.01.\nPrepare viral inoculum to a final volume of 2.5 mL per flask in serum-free DMEM.\nTo ensure that your viral inoculum is in excess, prepare for one additional flask than needed in the calculation.\nExample calculation: assume you have 20 × 106 cells per flask, and plan to infect 3×T-175 flasks at a MOI of 0.01 with a viral stock that has a titer of 4 × 106 PFU/mL. Plan to infect 4 × T-175 flasks; therefore, dilute virus stock in a final volume of 10 mL (4 × 2.5 mL) in serum-free DMEM.\n  DEFINE  UNITS:  M O I =   P F U   c e l l     and   s t o c k  v i r u s  t i t e r =   P F U   m L    \n    #  o f  c e l l s   f l a s k   × #  o f  f l a s k s ×   P F U   c e l l   ×   (   P F U   m L   )   − 1   = m L  s t o c k  v i r u s",
    "20,000,000  c e l l s   f l a s k   × 4  f l a s k s ×   0.01  P F U   c e l l   ×   m L   4,000,000  P F U   = 0.2  m L  s t o c k  v i r u s  \nIn this case, 0.2 mL of stock virus at 4 × 106 PFU/mL will be diluted in (10−0.2 =) 9.8 mL of serum-free DMEM to infect 3× T-175 flasks containing 20 × 106 cells/flask at a MOI of 0.01, leaving [10−3(2.5) =] 2.5 mL of viral inoculum in excess.\nCritical: While higher MOIs can induce infection and produce infectious virions, the MOI used for virus propagation must be low (i.e., 0.01). Otherwise, infection at relatively higher MOIs can lead to the production and release of defective interfering particles (Thompson and Yin, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) which can have downstream impacts in experimental use, particularly for in vivo studies (Banerjee et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nRemove a stock virus-containing vial from −80°C storage.\nThaw virus in a 37°C water bath (2–5 min).\nTransfer tube to BSC and mix the vial by pulse-vortexing for 10 s (within the BSC).\nPrepare the viral inoculum which was calculated in step 3.\nRetrieve the T-175 flask(s) of Vero E6 cells from the 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator and bring into the BSC.\nRemove medium from the flask(s) and add 2.5 mL viral inoculum to each flask directly.\nSeal the flask cap using parafilm.\nRock the flask(s) gently by hand to distribute virus inoculum over cells.\nTransfer the sealed flask(s) to a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 1 h.\nGently rock the flask back-and-forth by hand once every 10 min to redistribute the viral inoculum thus preventing the cells from drying out.",
    "After 1 h incubation with regular rocking, transfer the sealed flask(s) from the incubator into the BSC.\nAdd 17.5 mL low-serum DMEM directly to viral inoculated flask(s).\nNote: Final volume in the flask should be 20 mL (2.5 mL viral inoculum + 17.5 mL low-serum DMEM).\nTransfer the sealed flask(s) to a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator and incubate for 40–48 h.\nNote: Medium does not need to be replenished or spiked with fresh medium during the viral growth incubation period.\nDay 4\nMonitor for cytopathic effects (CPE) using an inverted phase-contrast microscope after 40 h post infection (hpi). Monitor for viral gene expression by detection of green fluorescence that will be produced in infected cells after expression of the mNeonGreen reporter gene (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1895-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Successful propagation of icSARS-CoV-2-mNG in Vero E6 cells\nVero E6 cells were infected with icSARS-CoV-2-mNG at a MOI of 0.01 for 1 h with intermittent shaking. CPE was monitored at 26 and 45 hpi (Stock 1) or 41 hpi (Stock 2) using an inverted phase-contrast microscope with or without exposure to GFP LED. GFP-positive cells express mNG reporter from icSARS-CoV-2-mNG which indicates successful viral replication within the cells. Titer of each respective stock was performed as described in the “plaque assay for determining icSARS-CoV-2-mNG stock titer” section and is reported as plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. The CPE observed for stock 2 was more advanced than CPE observed for stock 1, suggesting that titer increases more accurately correlate with CPE stage rather than time of harvest, an effect that can be explained by slight variability between the initial viral inoculum. Scale bar, 300 μm.",
    "Note: CPE is evident when cells begin to contract, lose cell-to-cell contact, and lose adherence to the cell culture vessel. Stock 1–26 hpi shows the progression of viral infection (indicated by green fluorescence) but the absence of CPE since all of the cells remain adherent and maintain cell-to-cell contact (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Conversely, Stock 1–45 hpi and Stock 2–41 hpi show both the progression of viral infection and presence of CPE with the latter having more severe CPE. Conversely, Stock 1–45 hpi and Stock 2–41 hpi show both the progression of viral infection and presence of CPE with the latter having more severe CPE.\nHarvest when CPE is visible and remaining adherent cells fluoresce green. Reliance on only green fluorescent signal without CPE will produce a stock of lower titer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nCritical: CPE should not progress beyond what is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. A population of cells which remain adherent to the flask should always remain when harvesting, as late harvest will increase the risk of defective interfering particles (Hein et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). This decreases the infectious viral stock and can impact experimental procedures, particularly for in vivo studies (Banerjee et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nWhen CPE indicates that the virus-containing supernatant is ready to harvest virus, transfer the infected flask(s) to the BSC. Transfer the virus-containing supernatant to 50 mL conical tubes and distribute equal volumes of virus-containing medium into each tube.\nCentrifuge supernatant at 500 × g for 10 min to clear cellular debris.\nFilter the cleared virus-containing supernatant using a 0.45 μm CA filter into a new 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: Try not to disrupt the debris pellet. The filtering step is necessary to clear any residual cellular debris.\nMix supernatant thoroughly by pulse-vortexing for 10 s.",
    "aliquot resulting viral supernatant into externally threaded cryogenic tubes for single-use workable stocks.\nUse 0.25 mL per tube which produces ∼80 tubes per T-175 flask.\nCritical: It is essential to transfer the resulting centrifuged supernatant into a new tube and mix by pulse-vortexing prior to aliquoting to ensure a consistent titer of virus between aliquots. If a vortex is not available within the BSC, mix well by repeated inversion or pipetting.\nCritical: Viral supernatant from multiple flasks can be combined. However, if you have multiple tubes of collected virus, each tube should be treated as its own stock. The titer may differ between tubes even if collected viral supernatant is from the same propagation cycle.\nPlace the aliquots at −80°C for long-term storage.\nCritical: Multiple freeze-thaw cycles of virus-containing liquids causes a significant decrease in viral titer (Greiff et al., 1954[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Do not thaw and then re-freeze an aliquot for re-use.\nPlaque assay for determining icSARS-CoV-2-mNG stock titer\nTiming: 7 days\nThis step is necessary for quantifying the titer of each icSARS-CoV-2-mNG stock. Following infection with serially diluted virus samples, utilization of a colloidal cellulose semi-solid overlay restricts spread of virus that would occur in liquid medium. As such, a single infectious virion causes infection and cell lysis in a localized area, resulting in a zone of clearing, or plaque, that can be used to calculate the stock titer.\nDay 1\nSeed Vero E6 cells in a 12-well plate at a seeding cell density of 3.3 × 105 cells per well in complete DMEM.\nIncubate plates in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator overnight.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1895-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Successful titer determination using plaque assay method in Vero E6 infected with icSARS-CoV-2-mNG",
    "Vero E6 cells were infected with serially diluted stock icSARS-CoV-2-mNG for 1 h with intermittent shaking, followed by the addition of cellulose overlay. Cells were fixed and stained 62 hpi, and plaques (black circles at the 10-6 dilution) were enumerated. Clearings caused by pipetting/tears (white circles at the 10−6 dilution) were not counted as plaques. Counts for the number of plaques at the 10−5 and 10−6 dilution is indicated at the top-right of each respective well with the average plaque number, calculated titer and averaged titer reported to the right. The average titer is used as the stock titer value.\nNote: A minimum of 28 wells (three 12-well plates) are required for each viral stock to be titered (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for plate layout).\nDay 2\nRemove an aliquot vial of stock virus (generated as described above) from −80°C storage.\nThaw virus in a 37°C water bath (2–5 min).\ntransfer tube to BSC and mix the vial by pulse-vortexing for 10 s.\nWithin the BSC, prepare 1:10 serial dilutions by transferring 50 μL of stock into 450 μL of serum-free DMEM up to 6 times (to 10−6) using sterile 1.5 mL tubes.\nNote: Each dilution of virus will be used to infect cells in four replicate wells, using 100 μL viral inoculum per well, a total of 400 μL. The dilution series noted above will provide enough excess volume to accommodate this setup.\nRetrieve the plates of Vero E6 cells from the 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator and bring into the BSC.\nAspirate medium and add 100 μL diluted virus stock in 4 replicate wells to each respective well of the 12-well plates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Critical: Work with one plate at a time to avoid cells from drying out. Close the plate lid when not actively adding medium/sample to prevent desiccation or contamination of cell monolayers.\nCritical: Add diluted virus in the following order: most dilute (10−6) to least dilute stock (10−1). This eliminates the need to change the pipette tip while also avoiding inaccurate titer determination.\nSeal the plates using parafilm then rock them gently by hand to distribute viral inoculum.\nTransfer the sealed plates from the BSC to a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 1 h.\nNote: Gently rock the plates back-and-forth by hand once every 10 min to redistribute the viral inoculum over the cell monolayer. This step is essential to prevent cells from drying out.\nDuring the incubation, freshly prepare the cellulose overlay medium (as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section). Keep the mixture in the 37°C water bath until ready to be used.\nNote: Store the colloidal cellulose solution at room temperature and use within 4 months.\nAfter the incubation, transfer the sealed plates from the incubator into the BSC and remove parafilm.\nNote: For this assay, the viral inoculum does not need to be removed.\nTransfer the cellulose overlay mixture to the BSC.\nAdd 1 mL cellulose overlay mixture directly to each well of the 12-well plates containing the 100 μL viral dilution.\nRe-seal the plates with parafilm then transfer the sealed plates from the BSC into the incubator.\nAfter plates are on the shelf in the incubator, gently tilt the plates forward and back, side to side, to evenly distribute the overlay.\nIncubate the plates for 62–66 h.",
    "Note: The incubation time should range from 62–66 hpi for fixation. If the plaque assay is fixed too soon, plaque sizes may be too small to accurately count. If too late, plaque sizes may be too large and not well spaced.\nCritical: Do not touch the plates for the entire incubation period. Colloidal cellulose is a semi-solid overlay and any movement/disruption of the overlay can lead to spread of virus, yielding plaques with comet tails, causing an inaccurate titer determination.\nDay 5\nTransfer the sealed plates from the incubator into the BSC.\nRemove parafilm.\nShake the plates to agitate the cellulose overlay.\nDiscard overlay according to the appropriate CL3 biosafety protocol.\nWash the cells with 1 mL PBS to remove residual cellulose then pipette to remove the PBS.\nCritical: Be careful to limit tears in the monolayer which can appear as plaques to the untrained eye (see white circles in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAdd 1 mL fixative solution (4% formaldehyde) to the cells and incubate for 60 min at room temperature (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nCritical: The CL3 facility must have a BSC with thimble connection so that toxic fumes from the formaldehyde are not entrapped within the facility. The plates, now containing fixative solution, must remain within this BSC for entire incubation period.\nIn the BSC with thimble connection, remove formaldehyde and wash the cells with 1 mL dH2O (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nAdd 0.5 mL staining solution to each well and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. In the BSC with thimble duct, remove staining solution and wash wells at minimum three times with 0.5 mL dH2O.\nNote: Store the staining solution at room temperature and use within 6 months of preparation.",
    "Examine the stained plates for plaques to determine stock titer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Plaque numbers should decrease with increasing dilution of the viral inoculum (troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nCount the number of plaques in a minimum of two different viral dilutions.\nCalculate the titer from each well.\nDetermine the average of two calculated titers to achieve accurate determination of your stock titer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nThe following example is based on plaque counts in the 10−5 dilution in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]:\n  T i t e r   (   P F U   m L   )  =    a v e r a g e  #  o f  p l a q u e s  a t  o b s e r v e d  d i l u t i o n     (  d i l u t i o n  f a c t o r  )   (  d i l u t i o n  v o l u m e  )     \n  T i t e r  =     ( 40 + 40 + 27 + 35 )  / 4     (  10  − 5   )   (  0.1  m L  )     \n  T i t e r  =    35.5  P F U     10  − 6    m L    \n  T i t e r  =  3.55 ×  10 7    P F U   m L    \nGeneration of kidney organoids from human iPSC lines\nTiming: 30 days\nWe have modified an established protocol developed by Takasato (Takasato et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) to generate kidney organoids more efficiently and economically in our laboratory. The steps below describe the differentiation of kidney organoids from iPSC in 500K and 250K sizes (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for overall steps).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1895-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(B) Alternative protocol for 250K kidney organoids.\nDay −1\nPrepare one T-25 flask coated with 2 mL Matrigel on the day of iPSC plating for differentiation.\nPassage iPSC at 70%–80% confluence (∼1.0 × 106 cells) from a well of 6 well plate to the Matrigel-coated T25 flask with at a seeding density of 50,000 per cm2 in 3 mL mTeSR1 medium.\nGently agitate the flask to disperse colonies evenly in the flask and incubate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator overnight. iPSC at 40%–50% confluence is anticipated on the next day.\nNote: . A cell seeding density for each iPSC line will need to be optimized as the number of attached colonies and their growth rates can vary for each line.\nDay 0\nAspirate the mTeSR1 medium and add 4 mL APEL2 medium containing 8 μM CHIR (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1895-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Replace the medium with fresh APEL2 containing 8 μM CHIR after 2 days.\nDay 4\nAfter 92 h CHIR treatment, replace the medium with 8 mL fresh APEL2 medium supplemented with FGF-9 (200 ng/mL) and heparin (1 μg/mL).\nReplace the medium with fresh APEL2 medium supplemented with FGF-9 and heparin every 2 days until day 7 of differentiation.\nDay 7\nPrepare Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%), neutralization medium and APEL2 medium pre-warmed to room temperature.\nAspirate the medium and wash the cells with 3 mL PBS.\nAdd 1 mL Trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 2 min in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nNote: Tap the flask to detach the cells after 2 min of trypsin incubation. Monitor the cells under the microscope to ensure that most of the cells have been detached.\nCritical: Do not expose the cells to trypsin more than 3 min. Over-trypsinization may contribute to breaking of pellet during pellet transfer to transwell membrane (step 54).\nAdd 5 mL neutralization medium to the flask to neutralize trypsin.\nGently pipet the cells 6–8 times into single cell suspension using a 10 mL serological pipette.\nTransfer the cells in suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.

    "Prepare wide bore P200 tips by manually cutting off the end of tips with a sterile razor blade. The resulting diameter of open tip should approximately 3–4 mm for 500K pellets and 2–3 mm for 250K pellets (troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]).\nCollect the pellet using a P200 wide bore tip and transfer up to 4 pellets (500K or 250K cells per pellet) onto a six-well transwell (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nCritical: Minimize carry-over volume during pellet transfer. Avoid placing pellets too close to each other or near the corner edge of transwell.\nAdd 1.3 mL APEL2 medium containing 5 μM CHIR to the lower compartment of transwell insert and place the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2, humidified incubator for 1 h.\nRemove the medium and add 1.3 mL fresh APEL2 medium supplemented with FGF-9 and heparin.\nCulture the pellets for 6 days in a 37°C, 5% CO2, humidified incubator. Refresh APEL2 medium supplemented with FGF-9 and heparin every 2 days for 6 days.\nDay 13\nAfter 6 days of FGF-9 and heparin supplementation, switch the culture medium to APEL2 medium without growth factors every 2 days until the day of experiment (day 28).\nInfecting kidney organoids with SARS-CoV-2\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes the protocol to infect kidney organoids with SARS-CoV-2 and collection of the supernatant from the kidney organoids for a tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay.\nPrepare a sterile fine forceps, razor blade and 10 cm culture plates.\nPlace the transwell plate with kidney organoids in a BSC.\nHold the upper plastic region of the transwell insert with one forceps and start cutting the transwell membrane with a razor blade along the edge of the transwell from the bottom side.",
    "Note: Leave ∼2 mm of the membrane still attached to the transwell insert to avoid a sudden drop of the membrane.\nPlace the transwell insert on the sterile surface of 10 cm culture plate.\nDetach the membrane from the transwell by pressing the membrane with one forceps while gently pulling the transwell insert in the opposite direction.\nCut the membranes around each organoid in approximately 1 cm × 1 cm square using the forceps and razor blade.\nCritical: This process should be completed within 1 min otherwise organoids will start to dry out. Supplementation of small volume of APEL medium (∼300 μL) underneath the membrane can prevent organoids from rapid drying out.\nTransfer each organoid with sterile forceps to a 24-well plate pre-filled with 1 mL APEL2 medium. Place the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2, humidified incubator.\nRemove an aliquot of stock icSARS-CoV-2-mNeonGreen from −80°C storage.\nThaw virus in a 37°C water bath (2–5 min).\nTransfer tube to BSC and mix the vial by pulse-vortexing for 10 s.\nDilute the stock virus to achieve working stocks of 103 PFU/500 μL and 105 PFU/500 μL in serum-free, drug-free advanced RPMI medium.\nRemove medium from the kidney organoids add 500 μL of either 103 or 105 PFU virus inocula directly into the wells. Seal the plates using parafilm.\nNote: Kidney organoids are submerged in 500 μL medium containing virus.\nTransfer the sealed plates to a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator and incubate the organoids for 1 h.\nNote: Plates do not require intermittent shaking as the volume of medium used is enough to cover the organoids. Do not touch the plates during the incubation period.\nAfter 1 h incubation, wash the organoids in 0.5 mL PBS three times to remove unbound virus.",

Add 200 μL low-serum DMEM to each control well.\nSeal the plates with parafilm and transfer the plates from the BSC to a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Incubate for 5 days.\nNote: Feeding/medium supplementation is not necessary during the entire incubation period.\nNote: Since the virus expresses an mNG reporter, monolayers can be observed under GFP exposure to check for the progression of CPE during the entire incubation period.\nDay 7\nRemove plates from the incubator when CPE is observed (5 days post infection in our experience).\nUsing an inverted phase-contrast microscope, score each well for presence or absence of CPE by visual inspection.\nRecord the number of wells per dilution that are CPE-positive (troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nOptional: Fix and stain the 96-well plate if you wish to store a physical record of the result. Follow steps 28–33 with the following volume adjustments: use 0.2 mL PBS, 0.2 mL fixative solution (4% formaldehyde), 0.2 mL of dH2O, and 0.1 mL staining solution.\nCritical: Control wells should be absent of CPE and absent of fluorescence under GFP exposure. If CPE/fluorescence is present, cross-contamination has occurred, and the assay must be repeated.\nBased on the CPE scoring, TCID50/mL is calculated according to the Kärber method, also referred to as the Spearman-Karber method (Kärber, 1931[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Ramakrishnan, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).
