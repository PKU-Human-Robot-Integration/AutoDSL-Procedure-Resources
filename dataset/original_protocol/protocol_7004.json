    "Culture 50 worms on a NGM agar plate. Each plate of 50 worms serves as a replicateNote: The protocol will work with any number of worms between 50 and 100. We suggest using two replicates for each experimental condition. Worm retrieval from agar platesWash worms off the plate using 1 ml of M9 buffer and place the solution in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Note: We suggest retrieving the M9 solution from the plates using a glass pipette, which reduces the adhesion of worms to the pipette’s walls. Spin briefly in a centrifuge to pellet the worms but not the bacteria (do not exceed 400 × g); 10 s is sufficient to pellet adult worms.Remove as much supernatant as possible using a micro-pipette (1,000 µl and 200 µl).Note: C. elegans tend to swim, so the pellet is not stable; avoid bringing the tip of the pipette too close to the pellet to prevent sucking in any worms. Repeat steps from 1 to 3 one more time to ensure that all the worms are retrieved from the plate.Snap freeze the worms by immerging the Eppendorf tube in liquid nitrogen.Note: At this stage, worms can be stored at -80°C for months. Worm permeabilizationOpen the Eppendorf tube and place it in a SpeedVac Vacuum Concentrator to dry the worm pellet at 20°C. This step typically takes ~10 min but can vary according to the amount of supernatant that is left from Step B3.Add three drops of ice-cold acetone to the dry worms. Gently tap the Eppendorf tube five times.Note: It is important to cover all the worms; additional drops of acetone could be used if necessary. If worms are not correctly permeabilized, the protocol will fail. Incubate 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Remove as much of the acetone as possible using a micro-pipette (1,000 µl and 200 µl) and air dry the remaining acetone in a laboratory fume hood.After complete evaporation of the acetone, worms can be stored at -20°C for months.Phalloidin stainingNote: We suggest working in a dark environment to prevent phalloidin degradation and consequent failure of the protocol. Place 2.5 U (for each replicate) of Rhodamine Phalloidin in an Eppendorf tube.Use the SpeedVac Vacuum Concentrator to remove the methanol in which the Rhodamine Phalloidin is dissolved.Note: It takes ~5-10 min to dry the Rhodamine Phalloidin, but this varies according to the volume that is used. Resuspend the dried Rhodamine Phalloidin in 20 µl (for each replicate) of M9.Add 20 µl of the M9-resuspended Rhodamine Phalloidin to the dried worms. Gently tap the Eppendorf tube five times.Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 30 min.Wash the worms twice in 1 ml of washing buffer.If nuclei staining is not required, proceed to Procedure F.DAPI stainingNote: We suggest working in a dark environment to prevent DAPI degradation. Resuspend the worms in 20 µl of 2 µg/ml DAPI in M9. Gently tap the Eppendorf tube five times.Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 5 min.Wash the worms twice in 1 ml of washing buffer.Preparation of the worms for imagingNote: We suggest working in a dark environment to prevent degradation of the fluorescent dyes and consequent failure of the protocol. Resuspend the worms in 10 µl of M9.Prepare a 2% (w/v) agarose pad on a microscope slide for each replicate. To prepare the agarose pad, apply lab tape on two microscope slides and place a third one in between them (Figure 1a). Apply 2-3 drops of agarose in the center of the microscope slide not wrapped in tape using a micro-pipette (1,000 µl).",
    "Place another microscope slide on the top of the agarose (Figure 1b). Wait 1-2 min for the agarose to solidify and remove the microscope slide on the top. Store the agarose pads in a humid place before usage to prevent dryness.Note: One layer of tape is sufficient to create the space needed for the formation of an agarose pad. Cut the micro-pipette tip to facilitate the dispensation of agarose. Gently put the last microscope slide on the liquid agarose to avoid the formation of bubbles in the agarose pad. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4183/bioprotoc-11-19-4183-g001.jpgFigure 1. Agarose pads preparation. First (a) and second (b) steps for the preparation of agarose pads described in Step F2.Transfer all the M9 containing the worms to the agarose pad using a glass pipette.Apply a cover slip, avoiding the formation of bubbles. Surface tension of M9 will keep the cover slip steady during the imaging process but avoid touching it.Imaging using a confocal microscopeNote: We suggest not using inverted microscopes to keep the cover slip steady during the imaging process. Images analysisUse Fiji to open the images recorded with the confocal microscope.Add scale bar: “Analyse” -> “Tools” -> “Scale bar” (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4183/bioprotoc-11-19-4183-g002.jpgFigure 2. Phalloidin staining applications and comparison with GFP-tagged muscle fibers. (a) Representative image of day 1 adult N2 worms; in red, actin filaments stained with Rhodamine-Phalloidin; in blue, nuclei stained with DAPI. (b) Day 11 adult N2 worms present disorganized muscle fibers, visualized here through Rhodamine-Phalloidin staining (in red), when compared to young (day 1) worms as described before (Romani et al., 2021). These results are comparable to those obtained using a transgenic worm strain (RW1596) in which the muscle fibers are labeled with GFP (in green).",
    "(c) Rhodamine-Phalloidin staining of the inducible muscle proteotoxicity model, GMC101, reveals altered muscle fiber morphology compared to the control strain CL2122, consistent with the data obtained in young and old worms and as described before (McColl et al., 2012).
