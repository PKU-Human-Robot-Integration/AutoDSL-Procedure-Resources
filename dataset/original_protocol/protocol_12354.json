  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All procedures in this protocol have been approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care, which serves as the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for the Massachusetts General Hospital, and are in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n1. Animal Housing and Handling Procedure\nUpon arrival, house adult Sprague Dawley female rats about 8-10 weeks of age (weighing 200-225 g) in groups of 3-4 inch plastic bins with woodchip bedding. Maintain them on a diet of ad libitum access to chow and water and a 12 hr light/dark cycle. Leave rats to acclimate to the housing conditions and animal facility for a minimum of 1 week.\n\tNOTE: All procedures in this manuscript are conducted during the light cycle.\nFollowing this acclimation period, handle all animals for 5 min each for 2-3 days. Properly pick up the rats one at a time (supported by the torso and not by the tail), hold them securely, and pet them during this time. Handle animals that appear more stressed, jumpy, or anxious for longer periods of time. Do this to minimize handling stress, which could affect the following steps in this protocol.\n\tNOTE: The number of days and amount of time handling the animals can vary between different labs; however, these should be consistent between experiments within the same lab.\n2. Monitoring the Estrous Cycle: Vaginal Swab Smearing and Staining Procedure\nMake 0.9% saline solution (sodium chloride dissolved in distilled water). Moisten a cotton-tipped applicator in this solution. Blot the tip using a paper towel to avoid oversaturation, which could lead to inadequate sample collection or loss of cells. Holding the tail upward away from the vaginal opening, gently insert the cotton tip into the vaginal canal and roll around the walls to capture loose vaginal cells.",
    "If the animal urinates on the cotton tip, replace with a new one, as urine contamination will make it difficult for phase identification. Be extremely careful as to not cause distress to the animal during this procedure because exposure to stress will disrupt the estrous cycle. When swabbing, aim to achieve a swift insertion and withdrawal that is not too deep as to minimize extra stimulation to the cervix, which can induce pseudopregnancy.\n\tNOTE: Pseudopregnancy can be identified as an acyclic estrous cycle that typically lasts for about 12 days, i.e. consecutive days of diestrus25.\nCarefully remove the applicator tip and roll it onto a pre-labeled microscope slide. Avoid pressing down too hard as too much fluid on the slide can make phase identification difficult once dry.\n\tNOTE: One slide can contain multiple days for each animal, although this can be done according to individual preferences.\nMake sure the sample transfers onto the slide. Collect samples for several consecutive days on one slide to be able to better track and identify daily estrous phases changes.\n\tNOTE: If possible, it is also ideal if the people collecting samples remain the same for all animals.\nOnce the slide is dry, begin the staining protocol for phase identification. Using the staining kit (see Table of Materials), immerse slides 10 times in the fixative (light blue), 10 times in stain solution (pink), and 5 times in counterstain solution (purple). Rinse slides gently under running water. Let slides completely air dry before viewing under microscope.",
    "NOTE: The typically 4-5 day long estrous cycle consists of (in this order): estrus (E), metestrus (M), diestrus (D), and proestrus (P)26. Estrus is characterized by blue, cornified cells, metestrus by leukocytes and a combination of cornified and nucleated cells, diestrus is similar to metestrus in presence of cell types except they are very sparse, and proestrus by purple-stained aggregates of nucleated cells (Figure 1). There are various staining procedures, in addition to those described above, that are equally effective for vaginal smear cytology.\nCollect samples for at least two complete cycles (~8-10 days) in order to monitor the phases accurately prior to experimentation. Be consistent with the time of day the samples are taken. Collect vaginal smear samples daily throughout and until the end of the experiment.\n3. Pre-exposure\nPrior to the initiation of the experiment, pre-expose the animals to the conditioning chambers allow the animals to acclimate to the context (conditioning chambers) before any behavioral testing.\n\t\nPre-expose the females to the conditioning chambers (located in sound-attenuating boxes) with the house lights on for 20-30 min per day for 3 days prior to any experimentation. Assign the box they are pre-exposed to as their chamber for the study. Thoroughly clean the boxes (walls and trays) between sessions and animals to remove odors since they can affect behavior and estrous cycle.\n4. Day 1: Habituation/Fear Conditioning\nOnce the animals have been verified to be in the estrus phase of their estrous cycles, begin the habituation/conditioning phase of the 3-day experiment.",
    "Take pre-tone baseline measures of freezing prior to the first tone conditioned stimulus(CS) presentations on each day of the experiment. Do this by acquiring percent freezing scores(calculated by dividing the seconds spent immobile by the duration of trial, multiplied by 100) during the stimulus-absent time interval at the beginning of the first CS-alone trial before the CS onset.\n\t\tNOTE: These measures can be used to assess and compare baseline freezing levels with those during habituation, conditioning, extinction, and recall.\nTo conduct extinction training during the metestrus phase, condition the rats in their last day of estrus. Swab and identify estrous phase (step 2) each day before starting the experimental protocol (conditioning/extinction/recall). As the estrus phase may last longer than one day, use cycle history to predict length of phases to determine when the animals are ready to begin training.\nIn the conditioning chambers, connect the foot-shock grid floor to an electric stimulation generator. Use a stimulation level of 0.5-0.6 mA as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Use a 4 kHz, 80 dB tone as the conditioned stimulus (CS).\n\tNOTE: These parameters may vary across laboratories and may be modified for optimal conditioning.\n\t\nIf the freezing analysis program requires visual cues (as opposed to temporal), co-activate an LED light with the tone. Position the light on the outside of the operant chamber, within the video frame. At the start of each trial, activate the LED light and keep it illuminated until the end of the trial.\n\t\tNOTE: This light is not visible by the animal and only serves as a marker for the initiation and end of the trial within the recorded video files (to be used to measure freezing behavior).",
    "Place the animals into the conditioning chambers for 5 CS-alone trials of habituation. Immediately following the habituation session, perform 7 paired CS-US trials of fear conditioning. Ensure that the CS tone lasts for 30 sec and coterminates with the 0.5 sec US shock. Run trials in all sessions (habituation, conditioning, extinction, and recall) with a variable intertrial interval averaging 3 minutes.\nAt the end of the conditioning session, return the animals to their home cages and to the animal facility until the next day.\n5. Day 2: Estradiol Preparation\nSwab and identify the estrous phase for all animals that underwent Day 1 of this protocol. Prepare estradiol (also known as E2, 17beta-estradiol, or beta-estradiol) for a 15 μg/kg dose subcutaneous injection using sesame oil or 0.9% saline as vehicle.\nTo calculate the amount of estradiol to prepare for injections, use the body weights of all animals, which were measured and recorded when they were conditioned on Day 1 of this protocol.\nMake calculations to standardize the administered volume of estradiol (i.e. 0.2 ml) per rat. Since estradiol is difficult to dissolve due to its water insolubility and requires a large volume of solvent for the small dose, prepare a stock solution by mixing estradiol in sesame oil over heat until dissolved. The solution can then be passed through a 0.22 μm filter to remove contaminants. For example, add a calculated volume of a 3,000 μg estradiol/1 ml sesame oil stock solution to the total needed volume of sesame oil in order to achieve a 15 μg/kg dose in a 0.2 ml injection volume per animal.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, use other forms of estrogen that are water-soluble and easier to dissolve.\n6. Day 2: Estradiol Administration/Extinction Training",
    "Administer the estradiol subcutaneously. Lift the loose skin between the scapula by the neck in a gentle pinch and insert the syringe needle into the triangle that is formed by the skin folds.\n30 minutes following subcutaneous injections of estradiol, place the animals in the conditioning chambers again and begin extinction training. In this extinction session, perform 20 CS-alone trials, with each trial consisting of a 30 sec, 4 kHz, 80 dB tone, presented at a variable intertrial interval averaging 3 min.\n\tNOTE: The effect of estradiol on recall occurs when estradiol is administered prior to extinction training or immediately after extinction. The effect is not observed 4 hr post-extinction, so it is recommended to inject close in time to the beginning or end of the training session15.\n7. Day 3: Extinction Recall\n24 hr after the extinction training, swab the animals that completed Day 1 and 2 of this protocol.\nPlace the animals into their assigned conditioning chambers (same as Day 1 and 2). Begin the extinction recall session by presenting 3 CS-alone trials (the three trials of extinction recall), which consists of only 3.80 dB CS-alone trials with intertrial intervals similar to the 20 trials administered for extinction training as described in step 6.2.\nUpon completion of the recall session, return the animals to their home cages.\n8. Data Analysis\nAcquire behavioral data through video and analyze them using computer software.",
    "NOTE: Freezing scores can also be manually counted by an experimenter that is blind to the drug treatment by timing freezing bouts during the CS presentation of each trial, expressed as percentage of the time spent freezing during the tone. Freezing is defined by complete lack of movement with the exception of breathing during the 30 sec CS-US trials. Calculate percent freezing by dividing the seconds spent freezing (immobile) by 30 seconds (duration of trial) multiplied by 100.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
