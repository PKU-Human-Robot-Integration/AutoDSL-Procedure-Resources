    "Save the images of the same stack in one folder.   Open Fiji software and drag the folder to Fiji software to open the images.    Click Plugins/Registration / Linear stack Alignment with SIFT to produce an aligned stack images.    Save the stack images as tiff format.   Click File/New/TrakEM2 (blank), and then choose the location to store the TrakEM file.    Drag the Aligned stack images in tiff format to TrakEM image procession station.   In Template window, right click anything / Add new child / area list.   In Project Objects window, right click Untitled / Add / New anything.   In project Objects window, right click anything / Add / New area_list.   Right click New area_list / Rename to rename the layer as nucleus.   In project Objects window, right click anything / Add / New area_list.   Right click New area_list / Rename to rename the layer as mitochondria.   In image processing station, right click the stack images, choose display / calibration, change the Unit of Length as micron, and put the Pixel Width, Pixel Height and Voxel Depth in the window. The Pixel Width and Pixel Height should be calculated according to the image scanning settings. The Voxel Depth is the interval of each image in the stack. For example, if the interval of the images is 100 nm, the Voxel Depth should be 0.1 micron.   In Layers window, choose all the layers and right click the layers, choose Scale Z and thickness, calculate the scale number, which should put in the winder and could make the interval of each layer equal to the Voxel Depth.   In image processing station, two layers named nucleus and mitochondria should appear in the left of the window.   Click nucleus layer, double click the eyedropper tool to choose the one color.",
    "Use pen tool to draw the outline of nucleus in each image of the stack and click shift + F to fill the nucleus area in each image to make 3D reconstruction of the nucleus   In control penal of Fiji, click Analyze / measure to measure the parameters of the nucleus including volume.   Quantification of nuclear shapes is conducted in 3D reconstructions. Nuclei were categorized as follows; Round: round shape and smooth surface with ratio of length/width≤1.5; Elongated: elongated or oval shape with length/width>1.5, and may have small indentations; Bilobulated: two connected lobes with single intervening large indentation; Irregular: complicated shape with corrugated surface, and may have multiple and variable sizable indentations.   Click mitochondria layer, double click the eyedropper tool to choose one color other than nucleus.    Use pen tool to draw the outline of the mitochondria in each image of the stack and click shift + F to fill the outline are in each image to make 3D reconstruction of the mitochondria   In control panel of Fiji, click Analyze / measure to measure the parameters of the mitochondria including volume and max diameter (Length of the mitochondria).   Go through all the stack images, choose five different images where the cross section area of the mitochondria could be representative of the median of the cross section area.    In the five representative images, use line tool and Analyze / measure in the control panel to draw and measure length of an Axis and b Axis.   Use Cross section area = πab. Save all the parameters in a excel file. Calculate the mean Cross section area by the formula: Sum of five Cross section areas / 5.   Repeat steps 11-12 to add another layer for the second mitochondria.   Repeat steps 20-25 to do the quantification of mitochondria.",
    "Repeat steps 26-27 until finish the quantification of all the mitochondria in the cell.    Calculate the number of mitochondria and the total volume of mitochondria in the cell."
