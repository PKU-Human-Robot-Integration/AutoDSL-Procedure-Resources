    "1. Preparation of Culture Media, Coating of Cell Culture Plates and Maintenance of Undifferentiated hPSCs\nMedia Preparation\nNote: Sterilize media using a 0.22 µm filtration device and store at 4 °C protected from light for up to 4 weeks. Reagent names, suppliers and catalog numbers are listed in Materials Table.\n\t\nFor Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF) Medium, combine 445 ml DMEM, 50 ml Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 5 ml cell culture media (e.g., Glutamax).\nFor hESC Medium, combine 390 ml Knockout-DMEM (KO-DMEM), 100 ml Knockout Serum Replacement (KO-SR), 5 ml cell culture media, 5 ml MEM minimum essential amino acids solution and 0.5 ml 55 mM β-mercaptoethanol.\nCAUTION: β-Mercaptoethanol is toxic. Avoid inhalation, ingestion and skin contact.\nFor RPMI-B27 (RB) Medium, combine 475 ml RPMI 1640, 10 ml B27 minus insulin, 5 ml cell culture media, 5 ml MEM minimum essential amino acids solution, 5 ml penicillin/streptomycin and 0.5 ml 55 mM β-mercaptoethanol.\nFor the Dissociation Solution (DS), combine 10 ml 0.05% trypsin, 4 ml KO-SR, 1 ml collagenase type IV (1 mg/ml), 5 ml KO-DMEM and 20 µl CaCl2(1 M).\nFor Feeder-cell Conditioned Medium, add 15 ml hESC medium (without bFGF) to a T75 flask with conﬂuent feeder cells (MEF or human foreskin fibroblasts) which have been previously inactivated by treatment with either mitomycin C or by irradiation. Harvest conditioned medium after 24 hr and replace with fresh hESC medium. Cells can be used for up to 2 weeks.\nCoating of Cell Culture Plates\nECM Gel Coating:\nUpon purchase, thaw the ECM gel extract at 4 °C until it is in an evenly consistent liquid state, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Dilute at a ratio of 1:2 in cold KO-DMEM medium, aliquot and store at -20 °C.",
    "Note: During the preparation of the ECM gel, keep all materials required for use in the aliquotting and coating procedure cold. The concentration of ECM gel varies with batch number. Ensure the concentration is noted on aliquots. Aliquots can be kept at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\nThaw an ECM gel aliquot at 4 °C. When thawed, add cold KO-DMEM medium for a final concentration of 0.34 mg/ml. Pipette well and add 0.75 ml per one well of a 6-well plate. Incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C.\nMitotically Inactivated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast Feeder Cell (MEF) Coating\nNote: Preparation of MEF feeder cells has been described previously. 14\nCoat a 6-well cell culture plate with Attachment Factor (AF) or 0.1% gelatin (see step 1.2.3) at RT for 5 min (0.75 ml per one well of a 6-well plate). Remove and leave plate in the biosafety cabinet (BSC) to dry.\nThaw MEF by transferring a frozen vial to a 37 °C water bath for approximately 2 - 3 min.\nAdd 7 ml MEF medium to a 15 ml tube. When the vial of cells is thawed, slowly transfer the contents to the 15 ml tube. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 4 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in MEF medium.\nCount the cells and plate 1 × 106cells per 6 well plate (~ 1.7 x 105 cells/well). Transfer to a 37 °C / 5% CO2 incubator and allow cells to attach O/N before use.\nGelatin Coating:",
    "Dissolve 1 g of gelatin powder in ultrapure water to make a 0.1% (w/v) solution. Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C then autoclave the solution at 121 °C for 15 min. When cooled, add to the required number of wells (0.75 ml per one well of a 6-well plate) and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.\nNote: Any remaining 0.1% gelatin solution can be kept at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nLaminin Coating:\nThaw laminin (1 mg/ml) at 4 °C until thawed. To 5 µl of laminin solution, add 1 ml of cold PBS. Pipette well then add to the required number of wells (0.75 ml per one well of a 6-well plate) and incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C.\nSilicon Coating of Spinner Flask Internal Surface:\nThoroughly wash a 100 ml spinner flask (with 1 glass pendulum) with distilled water, using a cleaning brush to remove any dust and/or culture residue. Fill with 70% ethanol and after 30 min rinse with distilled water. Add 5 M NaOH and leave O/N.\nRemove NaOH solution and rinse the flask under running water for 5 min. Fill the flask with 1 M HCl and leave for 15 min. Wash the flask with running water for 5 min, then twice with double distilled water to completely remove any trace of HCl. Leave the flask to dry completely in the BSC.\nAdd 1.5 ml of siliconizing solution to the flask and rotate horizontally to cover all surfaces. Repeat the same procedure for the glass pendulum.\nHeat the coated flask in a dry oven at 100 °C for 1 hr or allow to dry O/N at RT. If heated in an oven, leave to cool to RT for 30 - 60 min.",
    "Rinse the flask 3 times with deionized water for 15 min each, then sterilize by autoclaving at 121 ˚C for 20 min.\nMaintenance of Undifferentiated hPSCs\n\tNote: For each of the protocols described, unless specifically stated, cells are grown and cultured in wells of 6-well culture plates and volumes will be given appropriate for this format.\n\t\nhPSCs Cultured as Undifferentiated Spheroids in a Static Suspension System\nNote: Cells used in these steps should already be adapted to single-cell culture. 15\nStart experiment with hPSCs cultured on ECM gel in a 6-well culture plate at approximately 70 - 80% confluency. Remove any differentiated colonies using the stereomicroscope in the BSC. Add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and incubate at 37 °C for 1 hr.\nNote: For removing the differentiated colonies, use a pipette tip to detach and gently remove all the differentiated parts manually under the stereomicroscope. Be careful not to remove undifferentiated colonies.\nRemove cells from incubator and aspirate medium. Wash the cells with 1 ml PBS, remove and add 0.5 ml cell dissociation enzyme. Incubate the cells for 4 - 5 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 1 ml hESC medium and harvest the cells using a cell scraper. Dissociate the cells into single cells using a p1,000 pipette. Count the viable cells using Trypan blue and a hemocytometer.\nResuspend cells to 2 × 105 viable cells/ml in feeder-cell conditioned medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml bFGF and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Transfer cells to ultra-low attachment plates using a 5 ml pipette (3 ml per well of 6-well plate).\nAfter 2 days, carefully remove cells from incubator and aspirate half of the medium (approximately 1.5 ml). Replace with fresh conditioned medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml bFGF .",
    "Change half of the medium every day with conditioned medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml bFGF until day 5. Now, either further culture cells, passage for continued undifferentiated culture (step 1.3.1.2 - 5), or use for cardiac differentiation (Section 2). If continuing culture, passage cells every 4 - 8 days.\nhPSCs Cultured on Feeder Cells and Passaged Using Collagenase Type IV\nBefore passaging hPSCs, remove any differentiated colonies using the stereomicroscope in the BSC. Aspirate the medium and wash cells with 1 ml PBS per well. Remove then add 0.75 ml collagenase type IV (1 mg/ml) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 - 15 min, as required to have the edges of the colonies starting to peel off.\nAspirate collagenase and add 1 ml of hESC medium per well. Detach colonies to small clusters using a cell scraper, then transfer the cells using a p1,000 pipette into a 15 ml tube. Be careful not to break up the clusters into small pieces.\nWash the well with 1 ml hESC medium to collect any remaining cells and add to 15 ml tube. Centrifuge at 100 x g for 2 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in hESC medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml bFGF.\nRemove a MEF coated plate from the incubator and aspirate the MEF medium. Transfer the cells at a ratio between 1:3 and 1:10, as appropriate. Change medium daily with fresh hESC medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml bFGF. Passage cells every 4 - 8 days.\n2. Differentiation of hPSCs as Spheroids in a Static Suspension System\nStart experiment using day 5 undifferentiated spheroids as prepared in Section 1.3.1.\nNote: At this stage, the average size of spheroids should be 175 ± 25 µm. A minimum of 50 spheroids should be used when starting a differentiation experiment.",
    "Transfer spheroids into a 15 ml tube using a 5 ml pipette. Wash the well with 1 ml RB medium to collect any remaining spheroids and add to the same 15 ml tube. Leave the cells for 5 min until spheroids have sedimented to form a loose pellet (DO NOT centrifuge). Aspirate the supernatant, being careful not to take any spheroids.\nAdd 3 ml RB medium supplemented with 12 µM CHIR99021. Transfer the cells back into one well of a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate. After 24 hr, repeat step 2.2.\nNote: RB medium is light sensitive. When working with RB medium, keep the BSC light switched off.\nAdd 3 ml RB medium to the cell pellet. Transfer the cells back into one well of a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate. After 24 hr, repeat step 2.2.\nAdd 3 ml RB medium supplemented with IWP2, purmorphamine and SB431542 (5 µM each). Transfer the cells back into one well of a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate. After 2 days repeat step 2.2.\nResuspend the cells in 3 ml of RB medium and transfer to a gelatin-coated plate to allow the cells to attach.\nNote: At this stage, cells can also be kept in suspension. In order to continue with static suspension culture, transfer the cells back to an ultra-low attachment plate.\nChange the medium with 3 ml RB medium after 2 days. The cultures will start to beat next day. Change the medium every 3 - 4 days with RB medium.\n3. Differentiation of hPSCs as Spheroids in a Stirred Suspension Bioreactor\nStart experiment with undifferentiated spheroids cultured in static suspension for at least 3 passages (See Section 1.3.1). Add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and incubate at 37 °C for 1 hr.",
    "Remove cells from incubator and transfer all spheroids into a 15 ml tube using a 5 ml pipette. Wash the well with 1 ml hESC medium to collect any remaining spheroids and add to the same 15 ml tube. Leave the cells for 5 min until spheroids have sedimented to form a loose pellet (DO NOT centrifuge). Aspirate the supernatant, being careful not to take any spheroids.\nWash the cells by adding 1 ml PBS. Leave for 5 min until spheroids have sedimented to form a loose pellet (DO NOT centrifuge). Remove supernatant and add 0.5 ml 0.05% trypsin plus 0.53 mM EDTA. Incubate the cells for 4 - 5 min at 37 °C.\nRemove cells from the incubator and add 1 ml hESC medium. Using a p1,000 pipette, dissociate the cells into single cells, count the cells using Trypan blue and a hemocytometer. Resuspend to 2 × 105 viable cells/ml in conditioned medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml bFGF and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.\nTransfer 100 ml of cell suspension into the siliconized bioreactor flask with 1 pendulum (see Section 1.2.5). Start with 35 rpm agitation and after 24 hr increase to 40 rpm.\nAfter 48 hr, stop agitation for 5 - 10 min until all the spheroids have settled to the bottom of the flask. Replace half of the medium with conditioned medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml bFGF. Repeat the same process every 24 hr until day 5.\nNote: At this stage, undifferentiated spheroids with an average size of 175 ± 25 µm should be formed.",
    "Stop agitation for 5 - 10 min until all the spheroids have settled to the bottom of the flask. Transfer all spheroids to a 50 ml tube in a minimum amount of medium (less than 50 ml). Discard any remaining medium in the bioreactor flask, carefully ensuring no spheroids are remaining in the vessel.\nLeave for 5 - 10 min until all the spheroids have settled at the bottom of the 50 ml tube then carefully remove the supernatant without disrupting the loose cell pellet. Wash with 25 ml PBS with calcium and magnesium or RB medium, then leave again for 5 - 10 min until all the spheroids have settled at the bottom of the 50 ml tube to again form a loose pellet.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and add 40 ml RB medium supplemented with 12 µM CHIR99021, 10 µM Rock inhibitor and 0.1% poly vinyl alcohol (PVA). Resuspend the spheroids and transfer all cells back to the bioreactor flask. Add medium to make the total volume 100 ml. Restart agitation at 40 rpm for 24 hr.\nNote: RB medium is light sensitive. When working with RB medium keep the BSC in light switched off mode.\nRepeat Steps 3.7 - 3.8.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and add 40 ml RB medium supplemented with 0.1% PVA. Resuspend the spheroids and transfer all cells back to the bioreactor flask. Add medium to make the total volume 100 ml. Restart agitation at 40 rpm for 24 hr.\nRepeat Steps 3.7 - 3.8.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and add 40 ml RB medium supplemented with IWP2, purmorphamine and SB431542 (5 µM each). Resuspend the spheroids and transfer all cells back to the bioreactor flask. Add medium to make the total volume 100 ml. Restart agitation at 40 rpm for 2 days.",
    "Repeat Steps 3.7-3.8.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and add 40 ml RB medium only. Resuspend the spheroids and transfer all cells back to the bioreactor flask. Add medium to make the total volume 100 ml. Restart agitation at 40 rpm. Beating spheroids should be observed 48 - 72 hr later.\nChange half of the medium every 3 - 4 days with RB medium only by stopping the agitation for 5 - 10 min until all the spheroids have settled to the bottom of the vessel. Carefully remove 50 ml of medium without disturbing the spheroids and carefully replace with 50 ml of fresh RB medium.\n4. Differentiation of hPSCs Using Cultures not Adapted to Single Cell Passaging\nNote: This approach is specifically useful for the fast differentiation of a high number of hPSC lines without having to adapt to single-cell culturing techniques, an enormously labor-intensive and time consuming process. This technique is applicable to cell lines which are highly sensitive to enzymatic cell dissociation, such as newly established hPSC lines. \nStart experiment with hPSCs cultured on MEF (as in Section 1.3.2) which are approximately 70 - 80% confluent. Remove any differentiated colonies using the stereomicroscope in the BSC.\nRemove medium and add 0.5 ml Dissociation Solution (DS). Incubate for 0.5 - 1 min until MEF cells have rounded up and the edges of hPSCs colonies become clear. Quickly remove DS and add 0.75 ml collagenase type IV (1 mg/ml).\nIncubate the cells for 5 - 15 min at 37 °C. Check the cells under the microscope during the incubation period, and when whole colonies are starting to lift off and detach, remove collagenase and add 1.5 ml hESC medium.",
    "Note: If after 15 min most of the colonies are still attached, put the cells back to incubator. Check the cells under the microscope every 5 min. Be careful not to leave the cells in collagenase for more than 30 min. If there are many floating colonies in the collagenase solution, do not remove the collagenase; just add 1 ml hESC medium.\nUsing a p1,000 pipette, gently pipette colonies to detach as whole colonies. Do not break the colonies into small pieces. Transfer the cells into a 15 ml tube using a 5 ml pipette. Wash the well with 1 ml hESC medium to collect any remaining cells to add to the same tube. Leave for 5 min until all colonies have sedimented (DO NOT centrifuge).\nCarefully remove the supernatant and add 2 ml hESC medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL bFGF. Transfer the cells into an ultra-low attachment plate using 5 ml pipette (1 ml into each well of a 24-well plate and 3 ml into each well of a 6-well plate). Incubate at 37 °C/5% CO2 for at least 6 hr (maximum of 12 hr).\nDuring this time, prepare the required number of laminin-coated wells/plates for step 4.7. Recommended cell transfer ratios are 1 confluent well of a 6-well plate to 2 wells of a 24-well plate (or equivalent amount per surface area).\nAfter 6 hr, carefully transfer the colony aggregates into a 15 ml tube using 5 ml pipette. Wash the plate with RB medium to collect any remaining aggregates and add to the same 15 ml tube (0.5 ml per well for 24-well and 1 ml per well for 6-well plates). Wait 5 min until the aggregates sediment, then carefully aspirate the supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the loose pellet.",
    "Add 2 ml RB medium supplemented with 12 µM CHIR99021 and carefully transfer with a 5 ml pipette to your pre-prepared laminin coated wells (as in Section 1.2.4) to allow the cells to attach.\nAfter 24 hr, carefully remove the medium in each well and add 1 ml RB medium only.\nNote: Some of the aggregates will have only attached very weakly to the culture plate; therefore it is important to not remove any large aggregates which may have come loose during the medium change procedure. It is important, however, to remove as much of the small cell debris as possible.\nAfter 24 hr, carefully remove the medium and add RB medium supplemented with IWP2, purmorphamine and SB431542 (5 µM each).\nChange the medium after 2 days with RB medium only. Cells will start to beat next day.\nChange the medium every 3 - 4 days with RB medium only.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
