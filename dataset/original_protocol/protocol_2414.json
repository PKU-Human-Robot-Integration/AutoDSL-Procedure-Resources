    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMitochondrial isolation from mouse liver tissue\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section follows the manufacturer’s instructions for the Mitochondrial Isolation Kit for Tissue, Option A (soft tissues), Protocol 2: Dounce Homogenization for Soft Tissues. We start with 3–6 mouse livers, and process 1–2 pooled livers simultaneously in a Dounce homogenizer with a liquid volume capacity of 15 mL.\nPrepare Mitochondria Isolation Kit Reagents and PBS according to materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section, above. Prepare immediately prior to use and maintain on ice.\nWash each mouse liver in 20–40 mL PBS to remove excess blood and debris from tissue. Swirl tissue in PBS in 50 mL conical tubes using sterile tweezers, or cap tube and gently invert to wash (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Washing of liver in cold PBS, using sterile tweezers\nNote: We perform two successive washes in 50 mL conical tubes from “dirty” to “clean”. Sterile culture dishes could also be used.\nUse scissors or razor blade to cut liver tissue into smaller pieces (∼ 6–8 50–200 mg pieces) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]); this will allow for easier Dounce homogenization.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Mouse liver cut into smaller pieces to facilitate Dounce homogenization\nTransfer liver pieces to Dounce homogenizer and add appropriate volume of Reagent A/BSA/protease inhibitor solution (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) according to materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section, above, and volume capacity of the Dounce Homogenizer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Liver pieces and Reagent A/BSA solution with protease inhibitor in Dounce Homogenizer\nCritical: Over-filling Dounce homogenizer will result in ejection of fluid and loss of tissue from homogenizer during Dounce strokes.\nPerform Dounce homogenization on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Liver tissue that has been completely dissociated following Dounce homogenization",
    "Note: We perform 75–100 strokes per 1–2 mouse livers, although this may vary slightly depending on Dounce homogenizer used. Continue with Dounce homogenization until liver is completely dissociated and no visible pieces of intact liver tissue remains (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nDiscontinue once no visible pieces remain to avoid overprocessing.\nCritical: Avoid excessive homogenization (i.e., more homogenization than is necessary to remove intact liver tissue, or greater than 130 strokes) as this may compromise mitochondrial integrity and affect downstream applications.\nTransfer homogenized mixture of liver tissue and Reagent A/BSA/protease inhibitor solution to 2 mL microfuge tubes, adding 0.8 mL to each tube.\nAdd 0.8 mL Reagent C/protease inhibitor solution to each tube, cap, and invert gently to mix (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Do not vortex.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Liver homogenate in 2 mL tube, following addition of Reagent C with protease inhibitor\nUse benchtop microcentrifuge (pre-chilled to 4°C) to centrifuge at 700 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant, being careful not to disturb the pelleted material, and transfer supernatant to new 2 mL microfuge tube. Discard pelleted material (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Liver homogenate and Reagent C solution, following centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min\nUse benchtop microcentrifuge to centrifuge at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: The manufacturer’s protocol allows for the optional centrifugation at either 3,000 × g or 12,000 × g. We centrifuge at 3,000 × g. The resulting pellet contains mitochondria from the heavy mitochondrial fraction (Islinger et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nRemove supernatant and discard; the pelleted material contains isolated mitochondria.\nNote: Keep the supernatant containing the cytosolic cell fraction for future analysis, if desired, for downstream applications.",
    "Perform surface wash by adding 500 mL of Wash Buffer/protease inhibitor solution to the mitochondrial pellet; it is not necessary to resuspend the pellet (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Mitochondrial pellet following surface wash with Wash Buffer and subsequent removal of supernatant\nUse benchtop microcentrifuge to centrifuge at 12, 000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant.\nNote: Sometimes a layer of white fatty substance may appear on surface of supernatant. This is normal, but care should be taken to discard this layer along with the rest of the supernatant: see (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]) in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Section, below for details.\nResuspend mitochondrial pellets in HBSS/protease inhibitor solution and combine in a single 15- or 50-mL conical tube (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). Volume of HBSS/protease inhibitor used to resuspend pellets will depend on quantity of mouse livers used in isolation protocol (generally 337 μL/liver). See materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] Section and troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for details.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Isolated mitochondria resuspended in HBSS with protease inhibitor\nNote: Mitochondrial pellet in HBSS/protease inhibitor solution will be viscous. Take caution when pipetting.\nMaintain mitochondrial pellet in HBSS/protease inhibitor solution on ice. Proceed directly to sonication, below.\nSonication\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the sonication of isolated mitochondria to simulate tissue damage, as described (Zhang et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Where possible, care should be taken to maintain sterility by working in a biological safety cabinet.\nCritical: Sonication generates heat and must therefore be performed on ice to protect mitochondrial protein from denaturation.\nSonicate mitochondria solution on ice at 100% amplitude in 30 s intervals, with 30 s of rest between sonication pulses, for a total of 10 min of sonication (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Sonication of isolated mitochondria on ice",
    "Note: Sonication at 100% amplitude may result in disruption of labile proteins – reduce sonication amplitude or duration if preservation of these proteins is desired for your experiment.\nFollowing sonication, transfer mitochondria solution to a tube(s) that is suitable for ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. Please consult centrifuge-specific manufacturer regarding recommendations for suitable tubes.\nMaintain tube containing mitochondrial solution on ice and proceed directly to ultracentrifugation.\nUltracentrifugation\nTiming: 1 h of processing, 24 h of cold storage at −80°C\nCarefully balance tube(s) containing mitochondria solution for ultracentrifugation.\nNote: We weigh both sample and balance tubes and adaptors on a digital scale to ensure there is <1 mg difference in weight.\nCritical: Care must be taken to precisely balance tube/adaptors/etc. prior to ultracentrifugation; please follow equipment and institution specific standard operating protocols.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: Confirm that the centrifuge was properly balanced during step 21, and carefully re-balance tube(s) before proceeding to step 22.\nCentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant (this is the isolated mitoDAMP fraction) and aliquot, if desired, into microfuge tubes (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). Store mitoDAMP preparation at −80°C until use.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2050-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Isolated mitoDAMPs (supernatant; right), and non-mitoDAMP fraction (pelleted material; left, following 100,000 × g centrifugation\nAfter aliquots have been at -80 for at least 24 h, a standard Bradford protein quantification assay may be performed (see below for anticipated protein concentration and mitoDAMP yield)."
