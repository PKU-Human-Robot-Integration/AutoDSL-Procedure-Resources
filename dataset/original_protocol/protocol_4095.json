    "Note: Adapted from Waugh et al. (1997) and Pouilly et al. (2008); as used in Sarilar et al. (2013). Targeting TE insertion sitesRestriction of genomic DNAsMake a restriction reaction mixture that will be distributed equally into individual Eppendorf tubes. The reaction mixture combines (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 36 µl per reaction), the 1x enzyme buffer and the selected endonuclease (6 U per reaction), taking into account that 5 µl of genomic DNA will be added into the mix.Distribute 31 µl of the reaction mixture into each Eppendorf tube.Add 5 µl of each DNA solution to be analysed (which correspond to 500 ng of genomic DNA) to the corresponding tube.Mix gently the solution in each tube by pipeting, and centrifuge shortly.Incubate at least 3 h at 37 °C.Stop the enzyme activity by incubating the tubes 20 min at 65 °C.Put the tubes on ice, centrifuge briefly and replace them on ice. Proceed immediately to the ligation step.Prepare the adapters and ligate them to the restricted DNAsIn a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube, mix the two oligonucleotides (100 µM each) in equal proportions to make the adapter solution (final concentration of 50 µM).Incubate the mix at 95 °C for 5 min (in a thermocycler) and let cool it down on the bench at room temperature.Make a ligation reaction mixture, by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 50 µl per reaction), 1x ligase buffer, adapter solution (50 pmol) and T4 DNA ligase (1 U per reaction).Distribute 14 µl of the reaction mixture into the Eppendorf tubes containing each 36 µl of restricted DNAs.Mix gently using a pipette and then centrifuge shortly.Incubate at 20-25 °C overnight (on the bench) to allow ligation.",
    "Dilute the ligation products to 1/10 in 96-well PCR plates: 90 µl of sterile ultrapure water + 10 µl of the restriction-ligation products.Note: Store non-diluted restriction-ligation products at -20 °C, but keep 1/10 diluted restriction-ligation products at 4 °C to avoid DNA degradation because of freezing - thawing cycles.Pre-amplificationUse the first primer pair P1/P2 (Figure 1b) for the pre-amplification.Make a pre-amplification PCR reaction mixture by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 20 µl per reaction), 1x Taq polymerase buffer, MgCl2 (2.5 mM), dNTP solution (200 µM), primer P1 anchored in the adapter (8 pmol), primer P2 anchored in the TE under study (8 pmol) and Taq DNA polymerase (3-4 U).Distribute 17 µl of the pre-amplification reaction mixture into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate.Add 3 µl of the 1/10 diluted restriction-ligation products. Mix gently for each reaction by pipeting 2-3 times.Centrifuge.PCR program1 cycle at 72 °C for 2 min1 cycle at 94 °C for 3 min25 cycles of (94 °C for 30 sec, 56 °C for 30 sec and 72 °C for 1 min)1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 minKeep at 10 °CVerification of the pre-amplification products can be performed by agarose gel electrophoresis: Load 4 µl of the reaction product (with loading buffer) and run the electrophoresis for ~20 min at 100 V.Note: A smear should be obtained (an example of the gel is shown in Figure 1b).Dilute the pre-amplification product in 96-well PCR plates according to the plate layout to carry out the separation of fragments using the LI-COR DNA analyzer.",
    "Note: The factor of dilution is usually 1/10 (36 µl of sterile ultrapure water + 4 µl of pre-amplification product) but it has to be adapted (1/2, 1/5, 1/10, or no dilution) according to the intensity of the smear observed after electrophoresis, in order to get homogeneous selective amplification products.Selective amplificationUse the second primer pair P3/P4 (Figure 1c) for the selective amplification to perform a nested PCR (to increase the specificity of the PCR reaction).Make a selective PCR reaction mixture by combining (in order) sterile ultrapure water (with a final volume of 20 µl per reaction), 1x Taq polymerase buffer, MgCl2 (2.5 mM), dNTP solution (200 µM), selective primer P3 anchored in the adapter with 3 additional selective nucleotides (4 pmol), selective primer P4 anchored in the TE under study and labelled with IRDye (4 pmol) and Taq DNA polymerase (1.5-2 U).Note: The primer labelled with the IRDye is sensitive to the light; the PCR plate has to be covered with aluminium foil to avoid degradation.Distribute 15 µl of the selective PCR reaction mixture into the wells of a 96-well PCR plate.Add 5 µl of the diluted pre-amplification products. Mix gently for each reaction by pipeting 2-3 times.Centrifuge.PCR program: a typical touchdown program is performed (Vos et al., 1995) to increase the specificity of the PCR amplification.1 cycle at 94 °C for 4 min13 cycles of [94 °C for 30 sec, 65 °C (then -0.",
    "7 °C per cycle) for 30 sec and 72 °C for 1 min]25 cycles of (94 °C for 30 sec, 56 °C for 30 sec and 72 °C for 1 min)1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 minKeep at 10 °CNote: Maintain the 96-well PCR plates out of the light by covering them with aluminium foil and once the program is finished keep them at -20 °C.Electrophoresis run on LI-COR DNA analyzer to separate amplified productsPrepare the DNA analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions. Use 0.25 mm spacers between glass plates and prepare 40 ml of 5.5% acrylamide gel. Do pre-run with autofocus and following parameters: 45 °C; 2,000 W; 25 mA.Load the gelMix the PCR products of selective amplification (2 µl) with equal amount of loading buffer.Heat the samples at 95 °C for 5 min for DNA denaturation and snap cool on ice before loading. Keep also on ice while loading the samples on the acrylamide gel.Load 0.5 µl of each sample in each well. Between each deposit, rinse the multi-syringe in water. Load on the same acrylamide gel the samples which have to be compared, and load the controls on each gel if necessary.Analyze the SSAP multiband fingerprints by scoring polymorphic bands which may correspond to TE insertion site polymorphisms (Figure 1d).Note: Wear gloves when working with acrylamide because of its carcinogenic and toxic properties.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140226/20140226212427_2370.jpgFigure 1. Schematic description of the different steps of the SSAP procedure to detect TE insertion site polymorphisms. (a). The genomic DNAs to be analysed are restricted using an endonuclease (here EcoRI, as used in Sarilar et al., 2013) and then ligated to corresponding adapters. (b).",
    "A pre-amplification is performed on the restriction-ligation products using a specific PCR primer pair (to be designed) with one primer (P1) complementary to the adapter and the other primer (P2) anchored in the TE of interest. As illustrated by the picture, the pre-amplification should lead to a PCR product visualized as a smear after agarose gel electrophoresis. (c). The resulting PCR products are then subjected to a selective PCR amplification using another specific PCR primer pair (to be designed) with one primer (P3) complementary to the adapter with 3 additional selective nucleotides and the other primer (P4) anchored in the TE and labeled with an IRDye (at the 5’ end). (d). The resulting amplicons are finally resolved in a denaturing acrylamide gel; polymorphic bands can be visualized and scored as non-additive SSAP bands (being additional + or missing -) when comparing the progeny profiling with the parental ones (as illustrated here for the analysis of resynthesized allotetraploid lines in comparison with their diploid progenitors, Sarilar et al., 2013). Identification of the nature of the polymorphism responsible for non-additivity (e.g. transposition, genomic rearrangement, polymorphism at the endonuclease cutting site) requires further cloning and sequencing of the corresponding SSAP amplicon."
