    "Culture conditions, including cell passaging methods, affect the genetic and epigenetic stability of iPSCs; importantly, enzymatic passaging of iPSCs is associated with increased genomic instability of iPSCs (Garitaonandia et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-bib-0010]). To circumvent this problem, enzyme-free dissociation methods, such as the EDTA-based passaging procedure, have been developed to successfully derive and expand iPSC (Beers et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-bib-0003]).\nCRITICAL STEP: During iPSC selection and expansion, cell survival is the priority. Procedures related to iPSC dissociation should be performed quickly to avoid keeping cell cultures outside of incubator for long periods of time. We recommend completing this procedure in approximately 30 min or less.\nFor iPSC expansion, we recommend treatment with a dissociation reagent (Allele Biotechnology) for 2 to 5 min at 37°C to preserve iPSC clusters. Microscope observation can be performed every 2 min to evaluate the dissociation of the colonies. iPSCs are ready for dissociation when cells become rounded and separated throughout the colony, usually after 3 min of treatment (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-fig-0004]), and small clusters of iPSCs are dissociated from the original tissue culture vessel. Tapping of the tissue culture vessel after treatment was found to induce dissociation of the colonies into single cells, therefore gentle rocking, instead of tapping, is recommended to preserve iPSC clusters.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6c81ef70-53e6-4993-9de9-e4cdc9cee4b5/cpsc117-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nDissociation of iPSCs.

Prior to cell dissociation, reagents including: DPBS (without calcium and magnesium), dissociation reagent, and E8 should be pre-warmed at 37°C from 30 min to 2 hr.\nCRITICAL STEP: Repeated pre-warming of E8 medium may reduce the effectiveness of growth factors in cell culture media; therefore, only the amount of E8 medium required for each procedure should be pre-warmed.\n2. Prepare the amount of E8 + ROCKi required for each procedure according to Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-tbl-0001].\nTable 1..\n                Required Volume of Reagents and iPSC Seeding Number According to Flask Size\ntable:\n﻿Flask size,DPBS without calcium and magnesium,Dissociation reagent,E8+ROCKi,iPSC seeding number\n12.5 cm2,3 ml,1 ml,3 ml,<5E5\n25 cm2,5 ml,3 ml,5 ml,5E5∼1E6\n225 cm2,50 ml,15 ml,50 ml,1E6∼5E6\n3. Retrieve the iPSC culture from the incubator, disinfect the outside with 70% isopropanol wipes, and transfer into BSC.\n4. Aspirate medium from iPSC culture that is about to be dissociated.\n5. Add pre-warmed DPBS (with no calcium and magnesium) to rinse the cells. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature in the BSC.\nRecommended DPBS volumes: 3, 5, and 50 ml for 12.5-, 25-, and 225-cm2 flasks, respectively.",
    "6. Aspirate DPBS from the flask.\n7. Add pre-warmed dissociation solution and spread gently by rocking the flask side to side. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature in BSC.\nRecommended dissociation solution volumes: 1, 3, and 15 ml for 12.5-, 25-, and 225-cm2 flasks, respectively.\nCRITICAL STEP: Dissociation solution should be added slowly to the wall of the flask to avoid washing the iPSC colonies off the flask.\n8. Carefully remove most of dissociation solution without drying out the cells. Incubate the flask in the incubator for 2-5 min.\nThe purpose of removing most of the dissociation reagent is to eliminate the need of additional centrifugation steps to remove the dissociation reagent. We recommend removing 50%-70% of dissociation solution, which allows enough dissociation of iPSCs without drying out the cell culture. Longer incubation times will result in smaller colony size. It is important to check the cells under microscope after incubation with dissociation solution to confirm that ∼90% of the cells have rounded up (see Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-fig-0004]). If cells are sticking to the surface of the flask, gentle tapping of one side of the flask will help releasing iPSC form cell culture surface.\n9. Transfer the required volume of E8+ROCKi into the flask (3 ml for 12.5-cm2 and 25-cm2 flasks and 15 ml for 225-cm2 flasks), pipette cell suspension up and then gently allow it to flow back down over the cell culture surface to help release remaining iPSC colonies. Transfer the entire cell suspension to conical tube and gently pipette up and down to suspend iPSCs without breaking apart the colonies.",
    "If iPSC counting and viability tests are required, pipette up and down cell suspension approximately 5 times to mix and transfer a small volume (0.3 ml to 0.5 ml) to the microcentrifuge tube to perform cell counting. Follow the corresponding aggregated cell counting protocol according to manufacturer's instructions.\nPlating iPSCs on VTN-coated flask\n10. Disinfect with 70% isopropanol wipes and transfer a new VTN-coated flask into BSC. Aspirate the coating solution, transfer the required volume of cell suspension and E8+ROCKi into new flask according to Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-tbl-0001].\nCRITICAL STEP: iPSC seeding numbers suggested by us have been optimized for fast dividing cell populations. If the cells show slower doubling times, the seeding number should be adjusted accordingly. If cell counting is not required, 1:6 to 1:10 split ratio is recommended.\n11. Shake the flask back and forth and side to side to distribute the cells evenly. Place the flask in the incubator (settings: 37°C, 5% CO2, 5% O2).\n12. On the next day, observe the cells under the microscope to confirm cell attachment and confluency.\n13. Monitor the cell culture daily and evaluate readiness to cell dissociation according to cell density.",
    "Complete Essential 8™ Medium is prepared by adding Essential 8™ Supplement (50×, provided with the medium) to Essential 8™ Basal Medium. Once E8 complete medium is prepared, it should be stored up to 2 weeks at 2°C-8°C.\nTo ensure adequate nutrition levels in a highly proliferative iPSC culture and avoid spontaneous differentiation, media change every day is recommended. Cell proliferation is optimal at 37°C whereas low temperatures can slow down cell growth and negatively impact the quality of cells; therefore, media used for daily change should be pre-warmed at 37°C. On the other hand, previous studies have shown that growth factors in stem cell media are sensitive to proteolysis and thermal denaturation and degradation of some of these factors are observed after 24 hr at 37°C (Levenstein et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-bib-0016]). Thus, long-term exposure to 37°C of E8 medium should be avoided prior to use. During our process development work, we have found optimal performance of cGMP-E8 medium can be achieved by warming the medium between 30 and 120 min.",
    "Human embryonic stem cells are prone to cell death after individualization during cell dissociation treatments. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor has been shown to increase cell survival of dissociated cells by preventing dissociation-induced apoptosis in human embryonic stem cells (Watanabe et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-bib-0035]). Therefore, we recommend adding ROCK inhibitor (ROCKi) to E8 medium at concentrations of 5 or 10 μM after cell dissociation, which is not necessary during daily iPSC culture medium change without passaging.\nROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. SCM075) is supplied as a solid powder in 5 mg vials. For reconstitution, add 14.8 ml sterile cell culture grade water to make 1 mM stock solution. Dividing into small volume aliquots is recommended (30- and 250-µl aliquots are used in this protocol). Aliquots are stored up to 1 year at −80°C per Allele's cGMP protocol. We have evaluated working ROCKi concentrations of 5 and 10 μM in E8 medium and demonstrated that both concentrations efficiently inhibit apoptosis of dissociated hiPSCs and promote cell survival without affecting pluripotency. We routinely add ROCKi to E8 medium at 5 μM. Whenever relevant in the following protocols, ROCKi from Sigma Aldrich will be included at such a concentration. Note that cGMP grade ROCKi is now also available from Tocris Bioscience and can be incorporated into our protocol described below once it passes the Quality Control Testing in our cGMP system.",
    "We have tested cell therapy-grade Vitronectin (CTSTM-VTN-N, GibcoTM, ThermoFisher Scientific) for iPSC culture and observed consistent support of pluripotent stem cell renewal. VTN-N (GibcoTM, ThermoFisher) is provided in 1-ml aliquots at 0.9 mg/ml by the manufacturer with a recommended coating concentration range of 0.1-1.0 μg/cm2 on the culture vessel surface. We recommend using a solution concentration at 9 μg/ml with a minimum amount of 0.9 μg/cm2.\nMaterials\nVitronectin: CTSTM-VTN-N solution at 0.9 mg/ml (GibcoTM,ThermoFisher, cat. no.

SCT150SSCS)\n15- and 50-ml Conical tubes (ThermoFisherTM, NuncTM, cat. no. 339653 and 339651)\nCoating flasks with vitronectin\n1. Prior to use, thaw the stock vial of VTN at room temperature and prepare small aliquots (12.5-, 25-, 75-, and 225-µl aliquots for 12.5-, 25-, 75-, and 225-cm2 flasks, respectively) in polypropylene tubes. Freeze aliquots up to one year at −80°C.\n2. Prior to coating, thaw one aliquot of VTN at room temperature and dilute VTN in DPBS (with no calcium and magnesium) at 1:100 and gently resuspend by pipetting up and down.\n3. Add diluted VTN solution to each flask at 0.1 ml/cm2, close the flask tightly and tap the flask to spread and cover the entire cell culture surface with the coating solution.\n4. Place the flask into BSC for 1 min and then make sure that the solution covers the whole surface of the flask.",
    "The purpose of this short incubation time in the BSC is to ensure homogeneous distribution of the coating solution over the surface of the vessel before placing it into incubator.\n5. If the coating solution does not cover the entire surface, gently tap the flask again to help homogeneous distribution of the coating reagent. Once an even coating is achieved, incubate the coated flask for 1 to 3 hr at 37°C.\nCRITICAL STEP: Uneven coating coverage will result in poor iPSC attachment after seeding. Make sure that the entire surface is covered both before and after incubation at 37°C. Incubation can be performed at room temperature; however, better coating is achieved at 37°C.\n6. Prior to use, aspirate the VTN solution and discard.\nVTN-coated flasks can be stored for up to 3 days at 4°C and wrapped to avoid drying. However, optimal results are achieved when coated flasks are used the same day. If a coated flask is stored at 4°C, pre-equilibration of the flask in the incubator is recommended prior to use.",
    "The quality of iPSC can be severely influenced by culture conditions and culture manipulation techniques, with cryopreservation being a major potential obstacle to maintaining iPSC quality. Human embryonic stem cells typically suffer from very low post-thaw recoveries. Similarly, cryopreservation is one of the most critical steps after iPSC expansion. Suboptimal cryopreservation methods lead to poor recovery of iPSCs after thawing, resulting in low survival rate of their population. The low cryopreservation efficiency of human pluripotent stem cells often leads to the arising of abnormal cells as well. To counter this, we (as described below) and others (Liu & Chen, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-bib-0017]) have extensively tested and achieved technical improvements in cryopreservation methods.\nCryopreservation parameters, including components of cryopreservation medium and methods for processing samples during cryopreservation, were thoroughly evaluated in our Process Development:\n         \n-Methods: Optimization of cryopreservation procedure begins with good training of operators to ensure robustness and consistency to provide uniform cell population for downstream clinical applications. Critical steps during cryopreservation should be performed in a timely and efficient manner to preserve cell viability, especially when generating Master Cell Banks (MCB). The protocol shown here for cryopreservation of iPSC has been validated for large cGMP banking and, importantly, provides a robust method and easily performed by different operators.\n-Cell freezing containers: The CoolCell® freezing containers available from BioCision (San Rafael, California) have already been adopted for use in cGMP cleanrooms. These containers provide highly reproducible, alcohol-free −1°C/min controlled rate freezing when transferred to a −80°C freezer. The −80°C freezer must follow the cGMP requirements for temperature-controlled storage equipment.\n-Cryopreservation medium: A critical component of the cryopreservation medium is the cryopreservant dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), we established that DMSO concentration at 10% in E8 medium provides high cryopreservation efficiency.",
    "Protein-rich medium has been shown to increase cryopreservation efficiency; thus, serum is commonly added to cryomedium in most research labs. However, medium containing serum is not recommended to manufacture cGMP-grade iPSC. Human serum albumin (HSA) had been widely used as replacement of serum for human pluripotent stem cell cultivation (Ludwig et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-bib-0018]). Along this line, we investigated cryopreservation efficiencies using cryomedium containing different concentrations of HSA and found high cryopreservation efficiency in medium containing 1% or 2.5% HSA. Post-thaw cell viability of iPSC lines cryopreserved under these conditions was generally higher than 90% (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.117#cpsc117-fig-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/64def560-6b4e-456a-9a90-d3e090d35e1b/cpsc117-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nHSA concentration in cryopreservation medium.

We routinely use cryomedium containing 1% HSA but this concentration can be adapted according to each cell line's growth conditions.\nThe following procedure describes cryopreservation of iPSC at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells /ml in 1 ml of cryopreservation medium.\nVolume of cryopreservation medium and number of cryogenic vials to prepare are determined by the results of live cell number of iPSCs obtained during cell count of the flask being cryopreserved.",
    "If only a fraction of the iPSCs are to be cryopreserved, calculate the volume of cryopreservation medium accordingly, but maintain concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ ml to preserve high survival rate.\nMaterials\n70% USP-grade isopropanol wipes, Contec™ PROSAT™ Presaturated Knitted Polynit Wipes (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 19-120-817)\nDMSO: Dimethyl Sulfoxide, USP grade (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no.

Alternatively, if slow speed is difficult to achieve through continuous pipetting, drop-wise addition of CM should be performed. Be careful not to over-pipet the cell suspension to avoid breaking apart iPSC colonies. Once cell suspension is added to CM, next steps should be performed quickly as speedy processing is critical to preserve cell viability. We recommend completing this procedure in approximately 15 min or less.\n5. Transfer 1 ml of cells in CM into each cryotube.\nCRITICAL STEP: If many aliquots are going to be prepared in cryovials, frequent mixing of cell suspension is required to ensure homogeneous cell suspension in CM.\n6.
