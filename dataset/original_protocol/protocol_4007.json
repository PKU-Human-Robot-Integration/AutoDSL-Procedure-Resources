    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nSeeding Cells\nTiming: day 1\nHandling the cells for this experiment does not require special treatment. However, in addition to the recommended cell confluencies for transfection, which might deviate from manufacturer protocols, and required cell culture dishes, there is a general point to consider: Any disturbances that may influence cell metabolism (e.g. fluctuations in atmosphere, temperature) should be strictly avoided!\nEmpirically optimized confluency values for model cell lines for this protocol are given in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]. For cell cultivation, 30 mm glass coverslips are placed in the 6-well culture plates. The cells are seeded in the culture dishes and attach to the glass slide, which in further consequence serves as the coverslip in the inverted microscopy setup. In case other cell lines are used a confluency of around 80% on the measuring day can be taken as a reference point.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_97_4.csv\nValues are given for the cell lines HeLa, HEK293a and INS-1 for either of the two mentioned lipid-based transfection reagents (TransFast, PolyJet). “2d”: transfection performed two days before measurement; “1d”: transfection performed on the day before the measurement day.\nTransfecting the Sensor Plasmid\nTiming: day 2\nDepending on the transfection method, there are different protocols to follow. In our laboratory, mostly lipid-based transfection using TransFast Transfection Reagent or PolyJet In Vitro DNA Transfection Reagent is applied for mitochondria-targeted constructs. (We have not tested primary cell lines with this exact protocol yet, however, from our experience, expressing the sensor in primary cells might be challenging)\nFollow the manufacturer’s protocol for the transfection of mammalian cells using TransFast (Technical Bulletin TB260; 1.5 μg/ml plasmid concentration) or PolyJet (General Protocol for Transfecting Mammalian Cells, SignaGen Laboratories website: signagen.com[href=http://signagen.com], Cat#SL100688; 1 μg/mL plasmid concentration).",
    "Note: Empirical testing in our laboratory has shown that the incubation period with DNA and TransFast Reagent can be lengthened up to an overnight treatment (14–16 h) and the time after medium exchange can be as short one day in some cases. Times may vary depending on the cell line and sensitivity of the imaging system. Increasing incubation times may increase the expression levels of mtAT1.03 but may also lead to mislocalization of the ATP probe outside of mitochondria.\nNote: Application of a different transfection reagent is possible depending on the cell type. While using other reagents might be beneficial in some cases, there might also be adverse effects – especially in case of excessive sensor production (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Transfection methods based on other physical phenomena like electroporation have not been tested within this experimental setup in our laboratory.\nCritical: The transfection is a critical step to return to later on, in case of problems with probe mislocalization or dysfunctionality of the sensor (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPreparation of Cells and Imaging Setup for Measurement\nTiming: day 4\nGet culture dish containing cells out of the incubator.\nCompletely remove full medium and add the same amount of CSB.\nLeave cells on CSB for 60 min at room temperature (22–24°C) in ambient atmosphere to ensure that cells have adjusted and that the metabolic state is stabilized.\nCritical: The equilibration in CSB at room temperature (22–24°C) must not be shortened since ATP-levels can fluctuate significantly, when cells are in a state of adjustment. When keeping the cells on CSB, it is recommended not to exceed a maximum time of 8 h in order to ensure reproducibility of results. It might be favorable to stagger the transfer of cells to CSB.",
    "Note: If buffers have not been prepared before the experiment or unstable additives have to be added this is the recommended time point to do that. Now, Oligomycin-A should be added to the standard EB containing 10 mM glucose to yield EB +Oligomycin-A.\nPrepare perfusion system at the microscopy site\nFill containers of the perfusion system with your buffer solutions\nOpen every valve consecutively to ensure functionality and removal of air out of the tubings\nEnsure that the flow rate of all buffers is similar to avoid interruptions when switching channels\nUse two containers for washing solutions (ddH2O and 70% ethanol)\nWash the system with 70% ethanol to remove any substances not soluble in water from the tubes\nWash the system with ddH2O to remove any remaining buffer and ethanol residues\nRepeat steps e. and f. after every experiment!\nAfter the 60 min CSB-incubation, transfer the coverslip into the perfusion chamber and close the chamber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Do not let dry out, immediately add basal buffer (usually basic EB + Glucose) when the chamber is closed (also see Eroglu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; link to video: https://www.jove.com/video/55486/application-genetically-encoded-fluorescent-nitric-oxide-no-probes?status=a57492k[href=https://www.jove.com/video/55486/application-genetically-encoded-fluorescent-nitric-oxide-no-probes?status=a57492k]).\nDry the bottom of the glass slide with a lint-free tissue\nFix chamber on the microscope table and add immersion oil if an oil objective is used. We recommend using 20x and/or 40x objectives to control the correct targeting of mtAT1.03 in single cells.\nNote: In case of using single imaging dishes, the CSB is replaced by the starting buffer with an optional washing step with starting buffer; perform step 9., then skip to step 13.\nMake sure that the outlet of the perfusion system contains basal buffer before starting the experiment.\nSwitch on the perfusion and connect the perfusion system to your chamber. Immediately attach the vacuum pump to avoid buffer overflow.",
    "Establish a laminar flow of buffer through your chamber at a flow rate of approximately 1 mL/min. Conventional tube clamps might be used on both sides to control buffer inflow and vacuum.\nCheck the sample for a suitable imaging section with good signal intensity.\nCritical: Make sure that cells show a correct targeting of the ATP-sensor to the mitochondrial matrix and do not show cytosolic and/or nuclear mistargeting. We highly recommend performing a preliminary experiment testing for correct targeting and expression of the sensor. The application of a mitochondrial tracking dye (e.g. MitoTracker Red CMXRos, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vienna, Austria) for this purpose can be an option but has to be done with caution with regard to potential side effects on the (metabolic) activity of the organelle. Ensure that cells are not too dense, (i.e., changed in their morphology due to lack of space) within the area of interest.\nNote: The signal-to-background ratio needed to yield good results depends on the imaging system. We recommend choosing cells with similar signal intensities corresponding to equal expression levels across all experiments.\nThe protocol for measuring ATP-dynamics can now be started.\nMeasurement of Mitochondrial ATP Dynamics\nTiming: day 4 (4–6 h)",
    "Setting up measurement parametersThe mtAT1.03 sensor is excited at a wavelength of 430 nm; emission is collected at 535 nm and 480 nm, images are acquired every 2 s (see Note). Select regions of interest (ROIs) for each cell with correct targeting and expression of the sensor individually and at least one background region. The fluorescence intensities for data analysis will be calculated as averaged intensities of the ROIs for each channel (FRET and CFP).Take into account that a full measurement of all parameters in one sample can take up to 35–50 min. We recommend measuring at least three wells of each treatment condition and controls on three separate days to ensure reliable results. Usually this takes 4–6 h for one full set of experiments per day. However, there is no limit for the maximum number of individual measurements per day, if you have free access to an appropriate imaging system.\nRecord baselineBaseline mitochondrial ATP in the presence of glucose is measured for approximately 2 min (see Note).\nNote: In order to avoid photobleaching and phototoxicity, we recommend increasing the camera binning, if available on the system (e.g. binning 4), and minimizing the intensity of the excitation light as well as the exposure time. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, increase exposure time rather than light intensity. For the setup described in the Material-part, we used 300 ms exposure time at a camera binning of 4 and recommend around 150 mW LED power with a 6% transmission filter as a starting point. These parameters can vary depending on microscope setup, cell type, and expression levels.\nNote: The interval between measurement points can vary depending on the desired temporal resolution. Increasing the intervals reduces light exposure of cells over time, which will also reduce photobleaching and phototoxicity.",
    "Note: It is essential to record a stable baseline, which is required to correct for photobleaching during data analysis if necessary.\nCritical: Do not change imaging parameters such as exposure time and light intensity from experiment to experiment, as this may cause artifacts.\nAssessing glycolytic ATP production\nSwitch to buffer without glucose (preferentially via a perfusion system; exchanging the buffer manually might produce severe noise). Follow the dynamics of mitochondrial ATP changes for at least 10 min until they stabilize again at a certain value. In HeLa cells, ATP levels sometimes first drop slightly, then they usually increase, and finally, strongly decrease until they reach a stable minimum (see Note).\nNote: The sensor is ratiometric, which means FRET intensity (535 nm) decreases when ATP levels decline, while CFP intensity (480 nm) increases under such conditions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The exact timing depends on the cell type – test, which protocol is most useful for your purposes. We advise being patient to not miss potentially meaningful signals.\nSwitch back to glucose-containing buffer and follow the signal for at least 10 min until mitochondrial ATP levels increase back to baseline (or stabilize; see Note).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/97-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Exemplary Data of the ATP Profiling Protocol\n(A–C) Show a single-cell response to glucose-removal measured with mtAT1.03. (A) Fluorescence intensity curves of CFP (480 nm, cyan) and FRET (535 nm, yellow) showing a mirror-inverted reaction upon glucose-removal underlining the ratiometric nature of the sensor. Values are given in arbitrary units (a.u.). (B) The single curves from A are used to calculate a ratio-value over time (grey) representing mitochondrial ATP-content. The function R0 is calculated using GraphPad Prism (dotted curve, see Data Analysis). (C) A normalized and bleaching-corrected Ratio-curve enabling a readout of the maximum delta upon glucose-removal.",
    "(D) Fluorescence microscope images of mitochondria-targeted ATP-sensor mtAT1.03 showing the CFP- (left) and FRET-channel (right), respectively, in HeLa cells using a 40x objective and binning 4. Scale bar, 20 μm.\n(E) Comparison of normalized ratios when measuring with mtAT1.03 over the course of the protocol between two example cell lines (“typeA“: red, “typeB“: blue). The example nicely illustrates the power of the single-cell imaging protocol: resolving differences in general metabolic profiles between cell lines based on their mitochondrial ATP dynamics but also minor differences between single cells of the same cell line! For data used in this figure see Depaoli et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nNote: Usually, mitochondrial ATP levels reach the baseline again. Sometimes the signal first overshoots above basal levels and then declines again. The kinetics may vary significantly between different cells. You may have to wait for up to 20 min until the signal stabilizes.\nMeasuring mitochondrial ATP changes in response to ATP synthase inhibition by Oligomycin-ASwitch to Oligomycin-A-containing buffer (2 μM). Mitochondrial ATP levels will either increase or decrease. Follow mitochondrial ATP changes for at least another 5 min. In this part of the protocol mitochondrial ATP production is assessed by inhibiting ATP synthase with Oligomycin-A (2 μM for all cell lines tested in our lab so far; may need to be adapted when using other cell lines).\nNote: This protocol aims to assess both glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP production of individual cells in one single experiment. As it might be difficult to completely adverse Oligomycin-A induced inhibition of ATP-synthase, we add it at the end of the experiment. Moreover, residual Oligomycin-A might remain in the tubes and confound the following experiment. Hence, it is crucial to properly rinse the tubes of the perfusion system and the perfusion chamber with ethanol after each experiment.",
    "Critical: It is possible that the first part of the protocol (glucose depletion and re-addition) may affect ATP synthase activity in your cells. We recommend performing an additional set of experiments, in which only ATP synthase activity is measured (18.) without previous glucose depletion (17.), and comparing the results.\nEnd experimentStop measurement and export data (average fluorescence intensities of ROIs over time), e.g. as a Microsoft Excel file. Dispose of the coverslip, clean perfusion system and chamber with ethanol and ddH2O.\nData Analysis\nTiming: day 4/any time after measurement\nBackground correction: Subtract the background values for each channel (FRET and CFP), respectively.\nPlot fluorescence intensities of FRET (F535) and CFP (F480) over time and ensure that signal changes are ratiometric to exclude any possible artifacts (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3D).\nCalculate the FRET ratio signal R=(F535/F480) by dividing FRET by CFP values (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSelect baseline values and calculate a function for the fluorescence bleaching effects (see Note) using the following equation: R0 = Rinital•exp(-K•Time) + Rplateau. Rinital: maximal fluorescence ratio signal once imaging is started; K: rate constant of fluorescence bleaching over time; Rplateau: fluorescence ratio minimum reached by bleaching over time. (GraphPad Prism: one phase decay; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nFrom this function, calculate R0 for each time point (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3E).  For data normalization and bleaching correction to initial ratio, divide R/R0 for each time point. Display the data in a scatter plot with smooth lines (x-axis: time, y-axis: R = (F535/F480)/R0). (For bleaching correction without normalization, calculate R = (F535/F480) – R0 + Rinitial.)",
    "Use the normalized data to calculate the maximal ATP change during glucose depletion (Δmax [ATP]mito by glucose depletion, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C), and the maximal ATP change upon Oligomycin-A treatment (Δmax [ATP]mito by Oligomycin-A) for each cell (it may be a positive or negative value; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Blot single cell values on a scatter dot blot (x-axis: Δmax [ATP]mito by Oligomycin-A, y-axis: Δmax [ATP]mito by glucose depletion; see Depaoli et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: Photobleaching is an unwanted side effect and should be reduced to an absolute minimum by adjusting imaging parameters. Note, that numerous different approaches for bleaching correction are available – the given protocol describes one of them."
