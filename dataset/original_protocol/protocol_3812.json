    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: This protocol for the generation of interspecies mouse–>rat or rat–>mouse chimeric embryos has been based on the standard mouse chimera generation protocol (Poueymirou et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nHarvesting early embryos for the ES cell microinjection\nTiming: 90 min, followed by incubation for up to 4 h\nIn the following steps, 8-cell stage embryos from either mouse or rat are collected and prepared for the microinjection with the ES cells of the respective other species.\nEmbryo collection and washing:\nSacrifice the plugged donor females (E2.5 mice or E3.5 rats) by cervical dislocation. In the case of rat, anesthetize the animals with 4% isoflurane before cervical dislocation.\nNote: For breeding the animals, we used a light-dark cycle of 12 h, starting at 6 p.m. Under this condition, to ensure the right stage of the embryos (8-cell stage), embryo isolation should be done early in the morning (before 9 a.m.). Alternatively, blastocysts can also be used for microinjections; in that case, collect mouse blastocysts at E3.5 and rat blastocysts at E4.5.\nNote: If the embryos are not collected early in the morning, some of the embryos may also enter the uterine horn, in which case flushing of the uterine horn may also be required to collect all the embryos. Depending on the light-dark cycle of breeding and the strain of the animal used, one may need to standardize the timing of embryo collection.\nImmediately dissect out the Fallopian tubes and place them in a Petri dish (Tissue Culture Dish, Sarstedt, 83.3900.500) containing M2 medium (for recipe see: materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nUse a needle (Hamilton, 33-gauge N-Needle, 90033) screwed on a 3-mL syringe (Braun Omnifix, 4617022V) to flush the embryos out of the oviducts (at 20°C–22°C).",
    "When collecting from mice, flush the oviducts by injecting the M2 medium directly into the ampulla of the oviduct.\nWhen collecting from rats, first rupture the oviducts with fine forceps and a 27G × ¾” needle (BD-Microlance, 302200), and then use the syringe to flush the embryos out with M2 medium.\nCritical: Unlike in mouse, it is not easy to flush the embryos from rat oviducts, and therefore rupturing of the oviduct, as described in step 1cii, is extremely important.\nThe flushed embryos are then collected by mouth-pipetting (using a custom-made pipetting device as described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 2e, equipped with a handling capillary) and transferred to a fresh Petri dish filled with M2 medium.\nNote: Typically, one can expect to collect 6–8 good-quality embryos per one rat donor (Wistar Crl:WI strain) and 4–6 good-quality embryos per one mouse donor (in our case Tg(ACTB-EGFP)D4Nagy/J line in BL6 background). Embryo yield can differ, and may be lower, if inbred or sub-healthy animals are used as donors.\nIn a separate Petri dish, wash the isolated embryos 10 times in drops of M2 medium (100 μl per drop):\nFill the handling capillary with a small amount of M2 medium and introduce an air bubble. This air bubble serves to prevent the capillary forces to cause an uncontrolled aspiration of the embryos.\nPick all the healthy 8-cell embryos by mouth pipetting (using the custom-made pipetting device described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 2e, equipped with a handling capillary) and wash them in the first drop of M2 medium.\nNote: After all the embryos are transferred to the first M2 medium drop, either change the handling capillary or clean it with 70% ethanol before using it to move the embryos to the next drop of M2 medium.",
    "Using the handling capillary, collect the embryos from the first drop of the M2 medium and pass the embryos to the second drop of M2 medium.\nNote: When transferring the embryos, first fill the capillary with the fresh M2 medium from the next drop and do not forget to introduce the air bubble.\nRepeat the above steps until all the embryos are in the last drop of the M2 medium – the embryos are considered clean after having been moved through 10 drops and thereby washed to remove debris.\nEmbryo maintenance prior to the microinjection:\nAfter the embryos have been washed, move all of them to 200 μl of KSOM medium (Nagy et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) in a Petri dish (Sarstedt, Tissue Culture Dish, 83.3900.500) and cover the KSOM medium with paraffin oil (Merck, 1.07160.1000).\nIncubate the isolated embryos in a cell culture incubator (Labotect, C16), in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 / 95% air at 37°C, until the start of microinjection. They can be kept for optimally 1–2 h, but no longer than 4 h.\nES cell microinjection into the isolated embryos\nTiming: 20 min per batch of embryos (do not exceed 4 h in total)\nIn the following steps, the embryos from the recipient species are microinjected with the ES cells of the donor species (e.g., rat embryo microinjected with mouse ES cells or vice versa) to generate chimeric embryos for transfer to the pseudo-pregnant foster females of the recipient species.\nPrepare a single-cell ES cell suspension (from cells cultured as described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], steps 4 or 5):",
    "Aspirate the culture medium (mouse ES cell culture medium from mouse ES cells or 2i medium from rat ES cells) from the ES cell culture dishes/plates and wash the ES cells with 1 mL of pre-warmed PBS per 10-cm dish or per well of the 12-well plate.\nAspirate the PBS and add chicken serum (with 0.1% trypsin) (for recipe see: materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) – 1 mL per 10-cm dish or per well of the 12-well plate.\nIncubate for 7–8 min in a cell culture incubator (Heraeus, HeraCell), in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 / 95% air at 37°C.\nResuspend the trypsinized cells in ES cell culture medium (for both species) and centrifuge the suspension for 5 min at 123 × g (Heraeus, Biofuge Primo R).\nNote: The serum in the ES cell culture medium serves to quench trypsin activity. 2i medium does not contain serum and is therefore not suitable for this purpose.\nFor mouse ES cells, aspirate most of the supernatant, leaving about 500 μL medium for resuspending the cell pellet. For rat ES cells, aspirate the supernatant completely and add 500 μL of 2i medium to resuspend the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet with gentle shaking of the medium and store the suspension on ice until the microinjection (for maximum 4 h).\nNote: The ES cell suspension should be kept on ice during the procedure to ensure cell stability and to avoid aggregation. Use an aliquot from this suspension for microinjecting the embryos.\nInject the embryos of the recipient species with ES cells from the other species to generate chimeric embryos:\nFill the microinjection chamber with HEPES-buffered ES cell culture medium (prepared by adding 47 mg HEPES into 10 mL ES cell culture medium).",
    "Note: The microinjection chamber is a custom-made flat-bottom chamber assembled by inserting a glass coverslip (Roth, Deckgläser 24 × 40 mm, 1870) between two custom-made aluminium plates as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C. The glass slide is secured to the plates using silicon paste (Obermeier GmbH, Korasilon-Paste high viscosity, 0857.1).\nNote: This custom-made flat-bottom microinjection chamber allows placement of the ES cells and the embryos on the opposite side of each other. It also allows an easy sorting of the already microinjected embryos from the un-injected embryos because the flat-bottom shape prevents any crowding in the middle.\nUse the mouth-pipetting device equipped with a handling capillary (described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 2e) to place a vertical strip of the ES cells from the single-cell suspension (2000–4000 cells) into the microinjection chamber. ES cells should be placed on the side where the collection capillary / injection needle manipulator is located.\nClean the handling capillary and use it to place the embryos (10–12 per batch) on the side of the chamber opposite to the ES cells.\nNote: Inject the embryos in batches (10–12 embryos per batch) to avoid a prolonged incubation in the unfavorable conditions under the microinjection microscope. For subsequent batches, replace the ES cells in the microinjection chamber with fresh ES cells.\nFrom the ES cells that were placed in the microinjection chamber, collect 80–100 ES cells (enough for 10–12 embryo microinjections by an experienced experimenter) into the collection capillary / injection needle. ES cell collection into the collection capillary / injection needle is shown in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nCritical: Make sure that the ES cells collected in the collection capillary / injection needle have minimal gaps between one another. This avoids microinjecting excess medium into the embryo, which can potentially damage the embryo.",
    "Attach an 8-cell stage embryo to the holding capillary of the microinjection system, such that a region of the embryo that is devoid of blastomeres is oriented away from the holding site.\nInsert the collection capillary / injection needle (in the following steps simply referred to as injection needle) through the zona pellucida into the perivitelline space, in a region devoid of blastomeres, by one of the following two methods:\nManually: simply push the injection needle through the zona pellucida (see Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]) (referred to as piercing).\nUsing a laser-assisted system: from a XYClone laser system (Hamilton Thorne Bioscience), deliver a tangential laser pulse for 640 μs, at 64% power, to the outer margin of the zona pellucida, in a region far away from any blastomeres. Then insert the injection needle through the laser-created puncture (see Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]) (referred to as puncturing).\nCritical: Take extreme care not to damage any blastomeres during the piercing/puncturing of the zona pellucida.\nNote: Laser-assisted microinjections are recommended because they are easier and less disruptive with regard to the zona pellucida.\nSlowly inject 8–10 ES cells into the embryo.\nGently withdraw the injection needle after the microinjection of the ES cells.\nRelease the microinjected embryo from the holding capillary and repeat the procedure with another embryo, until the whole batch is microinjected.\nNote: Successful microinjections can be observed by light microscopy by observing the presence of the small ES cells next to the large native blastomeres (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). If the microinjected ES cells carry a fluorescent transgene, the successful microinjections can also be confirmed by the presence of small fluorescently-labeled ES cells next to large non-fluorescent blastomeres (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B; Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/730-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(A) Bright-field microscopic image of Wistar rat embryos microinjected with mouse ES cells. The area indicated by the black box is shown at higher magnification. Note the cell size difference between the large native rat blastomeres (red arrowheads) and the small ES cells (black arrowheads). All embryos are surrounded by an intact zona pellucida (blue arrowhead). Scale bar, 65 μm.\n(B) Higher magnification view under a fluorescent microscope of the Wistar rat embryos microinjected with Tg(ACTB-EGFP)D4Nagy/J-derived GFP-labeled ES cells. The rat blastomeres are large and non-fluorescent (red arrowheads), and the microinjected ES cells are small and easily distinguishable due to their green fluorescence (black arrowheads). Embryos are surrounded by a largely intact zona pellucida (blue arrowheads) – a small post-injection puncture can be seen in the embryo on the right. Scale bar, 14 μm.\nUsing the handling capillary and the mouth-pipetting device (described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 2e), transfer the microinjected embryos (after washing 2–3 times in KSOM medium, as described in step 1e) to a 200-μL drop of fresh KSOM medium (for recipe see: materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) in a 3.5-mm cell culture dish. Cover the KSOM medium with paraffin oil (Merck, 1.07160.1000) and place the dish in the cell culture incubator (Labotect, C16), in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 / 95% air at 37°C, until the embryos are transferred into pseudo-pregnant fosters, which must be carried out on the same day (try to avoid a delay of more than 3–4 h between the beginning of the embryo microinjection and transfer into pseudo-pregnant fosters).\nNote: In principle, blastocyst microinjections can be performed in the same way as the 8-cell stage embryo microinjections.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods video S5.

    "Chimeric embryo transfer into pseudo-pregnant fosters\nTiming: 5–10 min per foster (depending on the transfer type)\nNote: For chimeric embryo transfer into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant mouse foster females, the timing is 5–10 min per unilateral oviduct transfer into one foster. For chimeric embryo transfer into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant rat foster females, the timing is 10 min per unilateral oviduct transfer into one foster. For chimeric embryo transfer into the uterus of pseudo-pregnant rat foster females, the timing is 10 min per uterine horn transfer into one foster.\nIn this step the chimeric embryos are transferred into the oviducts of (A) mouse or (B) rat pseudo-pregnant foster females. In an alternative version of this protocol, the chimeric embryos are transferred into the uteri of rat foster females (C).\nPrepare the microinjected embryos for transfer into the foster females:\nWash the microinjected chimeric embryos 5–6 times in consecutive 100 μl drops of M2 medium to remove any traces of KSOM medium (as described in step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details], step 1e).\nMove the washed embryos to a new sterile Petri dish containing M2 medium.\nCollect the embryos by mouth-pipetting (using the device described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 2e) into a transfer capillary (retransfer capillary, BioMedical Instruments, 114–118 μm inner diameter):\nFill the transfer capillary with a small amount of M2 medium and introduce an air bubble. This air bubble serves to both prevent the capillary forces to cause an uncontrolled aspiration of the embryos and to monitor the successful transfers.\nCollect 6–8 chimeric embryos per unilateral oviduct transfer into a rat foster and 11–13 chimeric embryos per unilateral transfer into a mouse foster.\nNote: For each animal, prepare one individual transfer capillary per unilateral transfer.",
    "Note: The transfer capillary used for transferring embryos into a foster female is different from the handling capillary used for transferring the embryos between media drops and cell culture dishes. Make sure you are using the appropriate capillary. The embryos should be positioned very close to the tip of the capillary. Also, make sure that the capillary has only one air bubble.\nVersion A: Chimeric embryo transfer into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant mouse foster females.\nPrepare the pseudo-pregnant (E0.5) foster females for oviduct transfer surgery. Place the animal under anesthesia using one of the following two methods:\nIntraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine mixture (65/11/2 mg/kg body weight) (Arras et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nContinuous inhalation of 2.5%–4% isoflurane (CP Pharma/WDT, 21311) with 0.4–0.8 L/min O2 flow for the duration of surgery.\nPlace the animal with its back facing upwards and wait until there is an observable loss of the righting and palpebral reflexes.\nCritical: Protective cream (Medpex, Bepanthen, 1578681) must be applied to the animal’s eyes to prevent drying.\nCritical: The operating table or heating pad must be set to maintain 37°C. The animal must be kept on the operating table or heating pad for the entire duration of both surgery and anesthesia recovery to avoid hypothermia. It applies regardless of the type of anesthesia used.\nNote: When using isoflurane-based anesthesia, treatment against post-operative pain should be given by subcutaneous injection of metamizole, administered 10 min before the start of surgery (200 mg/kg of body weight).\nNote: No treatment against post-operative pain is required after intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine because this mixture already contains a painkiller.",
    "Shave the hairs around the operating region (dorsal side, parallel to the mid-line and close to the ovary position for the oviduct transfers) with a razor blade. Clean and disinfect the skin at the shaven site with 70% ethanol.\nPerform the surgery to transfer the chimeric embryos into the oviduct of a foster female:\nOpen the skin and the abdominal cavity at the shaven area by making a 0.8–1 cm long incision with 11-cm fine scissors.\nExpose the region of oviduct proximal to the ovary by gently pulling out the fat pad.\nFix the fat pad with a bulldog clamp (Fine Science Tools, 18051-35).\nLocate the infundibulum and the ampulla.\nCritical: For successful embryo transfer it is important to use only the females with clear signs of pseudo-pregnancy. Therefore, after exposing the oviduct, but before the embryo transfer, check for a swollen ampulla and the presence of a corpus luteum in the ovary.\nInsert the transfer capillary containing the embryos into the ampulla through the infundibulum.\nUsing gentle pressure by mouth-pipetting (using the device described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 2e), transfer the embryos from the transfer capillary into the ampulla (a successful transfer can be recognized by the presence of the air bubble inside the ampulla).\nSlowly remove the capillary.\nGently place the oviduct back into the abdominal cavity, in its original position.\nCritical: When placing the oviducts back into the abdominal cavity, do not apply pressure to the oviducts to avoid squeezing any of the microinjected embryos out of the transfer site.\nFor bi-lateral oviduct transfers, expose the oviduct on the other side and repeat the procedure.\nClose the peritoneum by suturing with sterile surgical sutures (Ethicon, Vicryl, P3, USP 5-0, 45 cm, V493H).\nClose the skin using 9-mm metal Autoclips (Agnthos, 59023 and 59024).",
    "Move the operated animal to a fresh cage and monitor it during the period of recovery from anesthesia.\nCritical: Keep the animal warm by using either infrared light or by placing a heating pad under the cage, and monitor the animal for the entire period of recovery from anesthesia. A recovered animal must not show any signs of pain and should start moving freely. Typical recovery times are up to 10–15 min for isoflurane-based anesthesia and up to 25–35 min for ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine-based anesthesia. The recovery time can increase after longer surgery times (>30 min) and for certain animal lines.\nPlace the operated foster females in a calm and quiet environment and provide post-operative pain treatment (metamizole 1.33 mg/mL in drinking water for two days post-operation).\nNote: Regularly monitor the foster females for signs of pain for the next few days. Avoid opening the cage to minimize disturbance of the animal.\nNote: Foster mothers can be periodically weighed and examined for the signs of pregnancy after mid-gestation. However, avoid daily disturbances that could cause excessive stress, which in turn could result in termination of the pregnancy.\nAfter the skin has healed (typically 5 days post-operation), carefully remove the metal clips with a clip remover (Agnthos, Clip Remover, 59026) to avoid pain and discomfort to the foster female due to skin stretching in the course of pregnancy.\nVersion B: Chimeric embryo transfer into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant rat foster females.\nPrepare the E0.5 pseudo-pregnant foster females for oviduct transfer surgery. Place the animal under isoflurane-based anesthesia – continuous inhalation of 2.5%–4% Isoflurane (CP Pharma/WDT, 21311) with 0.4–0.8 L/min O2 flow for the duration of surgery (detailed in step 7aii above).",
    "Critical: Rats must be anesthetized with 2.5%–4% isoflurane because the duration of anesthesia upon intraperitoneal injection of the ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine mixture is not reliable in this species.\nPlace the animal with its back facing upwards and wait until there is an observable loss of the righting and palpebral reflexes.\nCritical: Protective cream (Medpex, Bepanthen, 1578681) must be applied to the animal’s eyes to prevent drying.\nCritical: The operating table or heating pad must be set to maintain 37°C.

For example, in the mouse–>rat chimeric embryos generated by microinjecting mouse Tg(ACTB-EGFP)D4Nagy/J-derived GFP-labelled ES cells (which are male) into Wistar rat recipient embryos (Stepien et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]), a high degree of chimerism was observed under a standard fluorescent microscope (Nikon, HB-10104AF) as patches of GFP-expressing green regions and dark non-fluorescent regions upon dissection of the embryonic brain. However, a low degree of chimerism may not be detectable in this way and may need to be assessed using more sensitive methods (e.g., PCR-based genotyping of tissue samples or immunofluorescence; see Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nOptional: Genotyping of tissue and organ samples by PCR can be done to detect moderate degrees of chimerism. Small samples of tissues and organs can be collected during embryo dissection and either processed directly or frozen until use. DNA is then isolated using isopropanol extraction. The detailed protocol for genotyping can be found in (Stepien et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). We suggest using multiple primer pairs in PCR reactions to distinguish the cells from the two species. As an example, we used three sets of primers: rat-specific and mouse-specific primers (Steube et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), EGFP-amplifying primers (Stepien et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) and gender-specific primers (Jimenez et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) to distinguish the EGFP-positive male mouse cells from wild type rat cells."
