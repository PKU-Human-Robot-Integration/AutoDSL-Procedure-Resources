    "Note: In this protocol, the staining does not require antigen retrieval. Choosing paraffin slidesIf possible, choose appropriate slides (with intact tissue sections) with date (experiment) and number (block and slide).Label slides with staining date, antibody and dilution, host species using pencil.Place slides in glass staining jar, being careful not to scrape other slides/tissues.Note: Be sure to record slide date, number, antibody, dilution information in staining book along with start times on small form. Pre-treatment of slidesDeparaffinate: Soak slide in xylene: 2 x 15 min.100% ethanol (ETOH): 3 x 10 min.Freshly prepared 100% Methanol with 0.3% H2O2: 20 min to remove endogenous peroxidases (200 ml 100% methanol + 2 ml 30% H2O2).Rehydrate: Soak slide for 1-min intervals with: 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, and 30% ETOH.PBS: 3 x 10 min.Block non-specific reactionsTake out slides from the glass container and absorb excess PBS from slides with a tissue wipe, being careful not to disturb tissue.Add 500 μl blocking solution (or according to tissue size) per slide, allowing the solution to cover all tissue.Place the slides into slide chamber that has ddH2O in the bottom for 1-2 h at room temperature.Primary antibodyTake out slides from chamber, discard blocking solution and absorb residual solution with a tissue wipe, being careful not to let the tissue dry.Add 500 μl primary antibody solution (or according to tissue size) per slide, allow solution to cover all tissue.Place the slide into the same slide chamber with ddH2O at the bottom, cover chamber and incubate at 4 °C overnight.Secondary antibodyFill 3 beakers and the staining jar with PBS.Decant primary antibody solution if not recycled. Rinse slide through 3 beakers sequentially, and then place it in staining jar.Leave the staining jar at room temperature, changing PBS for at least 5 times, with 10 min intervals.",
    "It is optimal to place the staining jar on an orbit shaker that is set at a slow motion (60 rpm).Add 500 μl secondary antibody solution (or according to tissue size) per slide to allow solution to cover all tissue.Place slides into a slide chamber for 1 h at room temperature.Tertiary antibodyRepeat Steps 5a-5c.Add 500 μl tertiary antibody solution (or according to tissue size), allow solution to cover all tissue.Place slide into slide chamber for 45 min at room temperature.Repeat Steps 5a-5c.DAB reactionDecant PBS from staining jar.Gently pour DAB solution into the staining jar for exactly 10 min.Decant DAB solution into designated waster container. Deactivate DAB solution by adding a small amount of bleach to water container.Wash slide immediately with H2O twice to stop color development.DAB reactive product is brown.CounterstainDecant H2O from staining jar.Pour toluidine blue working solution into the jar. When tissues have a blue color as well as brown, stop counterstain by decanting the counterstain solution into a container. It takes 5-10 min.Wash slide with H2O: 3 x 1 min.Toluidine blue stains nuclei with blue color.Dehydrate-Xylene-PermountDehydrate slides with ETOHs with 30-second interval, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100%. Repeat 100% ETOH.Immerse with xylene: 2 times.Permount.Place slide on a flat surface and place in a 40 °C oven until the permount dries.Inspect slide with microscope and record result."
