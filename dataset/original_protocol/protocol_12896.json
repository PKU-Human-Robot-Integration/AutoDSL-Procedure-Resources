    "The following protocol involves working with mammalian cells; familiarity with sterile technique/cell culture is expected.\n1. Cell Line and Culture Conditions\nMake 500 mL of medium for the culture of HCT 116 cells: McCoy's 5A modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin (this is complete medium).\n\tNOTE: Grow HCT 116-19 cells in a T-75 or T-175 flask prior to plating. When 90% confluent, each T-75 flask will yield 8.4 x 106 cells, roughly five 10-cm plates, and each T-175 will yield 18.4 x 106 cells, roughly fifteen 10-cm plates.\n2. Harvesting Cells from the Flask\nAspirate away the medium, wash with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline without calcium and magniesium (PBS) (10 mL for T-75 or 25 mL for T-175), and aspirate.\nAdd trypsin dropwise to the flask using a 2-mL pipette (2 mL for T-175 or 1 mL for T-75). Place the flask in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min to allow the cells to detach.\nTap the flask to make sure that all cells are dislodged and then quench with complete medium by dispersing it over the entire surface of the flask (8 mL for T-175 or 4 mL T-75).\nPipette up and down multiple times to break up cell clumps and transfer the cells to a 15-mL conical tube\nBefore spinning the cells down, take 10 µL from the 15-mL conical and combine it with 10 µL of trypan blue to count the cells. Pellet the cells by spinning for 5 min at 125 x g and 16 °C.\n3. Counting the Cells\nTransfer 10 µL of the cells mixed with trypan blue to the hemocytometer. Count the 4 grids around the outside (each grid contains 16 squares).",
    "Take the average cell count from each set of sixteen corner squares.\nMultiply by 10,000 (104).\nMultiply by the total volume of medium used to harvest the cells to correct for the dilution from the trypan blue addition.\n\t\tNOTE: The equation format to calculate the volume to resuspend the cells follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56195/56195eq1.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56195/56195eq2.jpg\n4. Plating the Cells\nFor each 10-cm plate of cells to be synchronized, add 5 mL of complete medium and 6 µM of aphidicholin (12 µL of a 2.5 mM stock in 200-proof ethanol).\nTransfer 100 µL of re-suspended cell pellet, 2.5 x 106 cells, to each 10-cm plate and swirl gently to mix.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 16-24 h to synchronize cells at the G1/S border.\n5. Releasing the Cells from Aphidicolin Synchronization\n4 h prior to targeting, aspirate the medium, wash with PBS, aspirate the PBS, and add 5 mL of complete medium\nPlace it back in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h\n6. RNA Complexing\nEnter the mutant eGFP gene sequence into the Zhang Lab's online generator25 (http:// crispr.mit.edu/) and choose the CRISPR guide sequences that bind with close proximity to the target site. Obtain the CRISPR guide sequences from a commercial source.\nStore the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), and Cas9 protein at 20 °C and use according to manufacturer suggestions.\n\t\nMix the RNA in equimolar concentrations to 45 µM. Add 6.75 µL of a 200 µM stock of crRNA and 6.75 µL of a 200 µM stock of tracrRNA to a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube. Add 16.50 µL of TE Buffer to make a final volume of 30 µL.\nHeat at 95 °C for 5 min in a heat block or PCR machine.\n\tCaution: Hot!\nAllow to cool to room temperature.",
    "NOTE: If using a PCR machine, set the cooling to 0.2 °C/s.\nPerform the following steps for each sample.\n\t\nDilute 2.22 µL of crRNA:tracrRNA complex in 2.78 µL of TE Buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 0.1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0) to a final volume of 5 µL.\nDilute 1.67 µL of Cas9 Protein from a 60 µM stock in 3.33 µL of low-serum medium to final volume of 5 µL.\nMix 5 µL of Cas9 protein with 5 µL of complexed RNA\n7. Harvesting the Cells for Targeting\nAspirate the medium, wash with 5 mL of PBS, aspirate the PBS, and add 1 mL of pre-warmed trypsin to each 10-cm plate. Put the plates in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min.\nTap on the 10-cm plate to make sure all cells are dislodged and then quench with 4 mL of complete medium by dispersing it over the entire surface of the plate.\nPipette up and down multiple times to break up cell clumps and transfer the cells to a 15-mL conical tube.\nBefore spinning the cells down, take 10 µL from the 15-mL conical tube and combine it with 10 µL of trypan blue to count the cells. Pellet the cells by spinning for 5 min at 125 x g and room temperature.\nAspirate the medium and wash with 5 mL of PBS. Pellet the cells by spinning at 125 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\n8. Counting the Cells\nTransfer 10 µL of the cells mixed with trypan blue to the hemocytometer. Count the 4 grids around the outside (each grid contains sixteen squares).\n\t\nTake the average cell count from each set of sixteen corner squares.\nMultiply by 10,000 (104).",
    "Multiply by the total volume of medium used to harvest the cells to correct for the dilution from the trypan blue addition.\n\t\tNOTE: Following is the equation format to calculate the volume to resuspend the cells. Re-suspend the required number of cells in serum-free McCoy's 5A modified medium.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56195/56195eq3.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56195/56195eq4.jpg\n9. Targeting Samples\nTransfer 100 µL of cell suspension (5 x 105 cells) from step 8.1 to each electroporation 4-mm gap cuvette. Add 10 µL of RNP complex from step 6.7 to 100 µL of cells at a 5 x 105 cell density. Add ODN (2 µM) to each sample.\n\tNOTE: For a positive control, add 1 µL of eGFP at 1 µg/µL expressing plasmid\n\t\nTake the rack to an electroporation machine, lightly flick each sample, and place them in the chamber. Electroporate at 250 V, LV; 2 pulses, 1 s; 13 ms; unipolar pulse.\nTransfer the rack back to the hood. Transfer each sample to a well containing 2 mL of complete medium in a 6-well plate. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 72 h before checking for correction levels.\n10. Analysis of Gene Edited Cells and Transfection Efficiency\nAspirate the medium and wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS. Aspirate the PBS and add 500 µL of pre-warmed trypsin to each well of the 6-well plate. Put the plates in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min.\nTap the plate to make sure all cells are dislodged and then quench with 1 mL of complete medium by dispersing it over the entire surface of the well.\nPass the cells into a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube and pellet at 5,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Aspirate the medium. Re-suspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of FACS buffer (0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA, and 2 µg/mL propidium iodide in PBS).\nMeasure the cell fluorescence (eGFP+) by flow cytometry.\n\t\nCalculate the correction efficiency as the percentage of the total live eGFP-positive cells over the total number of live cells in each sample, as described in Rivera Torres et al30.\n11. DNA Sequence Analysis\nElectroporate the synchronized and released HCT 116-19 cells at a concentration of 5 x 105 cells/100 µL, with RNP complex at 100 pmols and 72NT ODN at 2.0 µM.\nTransfer the cells to 6-well plates and allow them to recover for 72 h.\nSort the cells individually into 96-well plates using a FACS sorter with a 488-nm (100 mw) laser for eGFP+/-, as described in Rivera-Torres et al30.\n\tNOTE: Not all wells will successfully grow.\nExpand the cells over 6 weeks and harvest as described in step 7.\nFrom the wells that have growth, isolate cellular gDNA using a commercially available DNA isolation kit (see the Table of Materials) and amplify the region surrounding the target base via PCR (718 bp; forward primer 5'-ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3' and reverse primer 5'-ACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3').\nPerform DNA sequencing analysis on the samples."
