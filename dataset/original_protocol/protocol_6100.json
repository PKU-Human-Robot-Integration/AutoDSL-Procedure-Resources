    "Vaccine preparationPreparation of CDGPrepare sterile CDG stock (2 mg/ml) with endotoxin-free physiological water in a 1.5 ml sterile Eppendorf tube. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down.Store at -80 °C. The CDG stock retains its activity for at least 3 years in our lab.Preparation of antigensPrepare sterile stock antigen (PspA, OVA or H1N1 NP) solution (1 mg/ml) with endotoxin-free PBS.Mix the solution by pipetting up and down.Store at -80 °C. The protein antigen stocks are stable for at least 3 years in our lab. Intranasal vaccine administrationAt Day 0, freshly prepare a suspension containing 5 µg of CDG and 2 µg of antigen per mouse in endotoxin-free 1x PBS for experimental samples.At Day 0, freshly prepare a suspension containing 2 µg of antigen per mouse in endotoxin-free PBS for control samples.Anesthetize the mouse by placing in the isoflurane chamber.To use the machine, turn on the supply gas and have the flowmeter between 500-1,000 ml/min.Turn on vaporizer to 5%.Place the mouse in the chamber and seal the top.Wait until the mouse is anesthetized.Remove the mouse from the chamber and hold the mouse in your hand by the dorsal skin so that the head is up.Administer 30 µl of the vaccine solution into animal’s nostril. Let the animal breathes in the vaccine solution. Wait for 14 days before administrating a second immunization (Total 2 immunizations).Collection of sera to measure antigen-specific antibodies in the bloodCDG-induced serum antibodies can be detected at 2-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month after the last immunization.Collect blood from the tail of each mouse.Cut as close to the bottom of the mouse tail.Collect around 50-100 µl of blood and place in a serum collection tube.Spin samples down at 600 x g at RT for 10 min.Collect the supernatant and store samples at -20 °C.",
    "Harvest of bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) to measure antigen-specific antibodies in the lungCDG-induced BALF antibodies can be detected at 2-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month after the last immunization.Sacrifice mouse with CO2. Clean the mouse with 70% ethanol.Place the mouse on a styrofoam board and restrain the arms and legs with needles.Remove the skin around the neck to expose the thoracic cage and neck.Gently remove the muscles around the neck with forceps to expose the trachea.Using scissors, make a small cut on the surface of the trachea. Load a 1 ml syringe with 0.8 ml of 1x PBS.Attach a BD Instyle Autoguard BC Shielded IV Catheter to the 0.8 ml syringe and insert into the trachea.Slowly inject and recover the 1x PBS into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and place on ice.Spin down samples at 350 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and place on ice.Store samples at -20 °C.Detection of antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2C (C57BL/6 mice) or IgG2A (BALB/c mice) and IgA production in the serum and BALFCoat an ELISA assay plate using 1 µg/ml of antigen (PspA, H1N1 NP or OVA) in coating buffer.Add 50 µl per well.Keep plate at 4 °C overnight.Wash the plate 5 times using wash buffer. Add 100 µl of blocking buffer to each well and leave at room temperature for 1 h.After blocking is done, wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer.Dilute sera samples starting with 1:5,000 in blocking buffer at 2-fold dilutions for 4 dilutions.Dilute the BALF samples starting with 1:100 in blocking buffer at 2-fold dilutions for 4 dilutions.Add 50 µl of each serial dilution to the respective wells.Keep plate at 4 °C overnight.Wash the plate 5 times using wash buffer.",
    "Add secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP to each well and leave at room temperature for 2 h.Wash the plate 5 times using wash buffer.Add 50 µl TMB solution to each well and incubate for 15 min.Add 50 µl stop solution.Read samples at 450 nm on a plate reader.Recall assay to measure antigen-specific T cell responses in the lung (mucosal responses, carry out under sterile conditions)Harvest the lung at 2-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month after the last immunization.To isolate lung cells, sacrifice immunized mice with CO2.Clean the mouse with 70% ethanol.Open the rib cage to expose the heart and lungs.Cut the aorta above the liver.Using sterile 1x PBS, inject 10 ml of cold 1x PBS into the left ventricle to perfuse the lungs. Perfused lung should be white.Transfer the lungs into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes that contain 500 µl of ice-cold 1x PBS to wash the lungs.Add the lungs to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes that contain 1 ml digestion buffer and keep at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The digesting buffer has been prewarmed to 37 °C.Make a single cell suspension after digestionUse a 1 ml syringe plunger to press the digested lung tissue through a 70 µm mesh with sterile RMPI and into a sterile 50 ml tube.Spin the samples down at 350 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Decant the supernatant. Add 1 ml of ice-cold sterile ACK lysis buffer to the pellet.Disaggregate the cell pellet, re-suspend and transfer the cells to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and invert for 2 min at RT.Spin tubes down at 350 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Decant supernatant.Disaggregate the cell pellet and re-suspend cells in 1 ml of sterile RPMI and count cells.",
