The Percoll-gradient is critical for removal of myelin and separation of the CNS cells including microglia for the following steps. The surface marker staining is necessary to measure the respiratory chain activity specifically in microglial cells. The gating strategy includes single, live, CD11b+CD45lowMitoGreen+ cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1447-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gating strategy for flow cytometric analysis of single, live, CD11b+CD45low MitoTracker Green+ microglia\nThe last dot plot depicts the back gating of CD11b+CD45low cells. Representative dot plots are shown. FSC: forward scatter. SSC: side scatter.\nNote: Here, we provide the flow cytometry-based protocol for respiratory chain analysis for microglial cells. We analyzed individual samples from max. 10 mice in one individual experiment with at least 5,000 microglial cells. Importantly, either CI or CII function should be analyzed in one approach when handling 10 samples. Otherwise, the metabolic function might be impaired when handling more than 10 samples for more than 6–8 h. Alternatively, using less samples would allow the analysis of CI and CII in two smaller approaches from separate replicates. This protocol can be also used for other ex vivo isolated cells or cultured cells.\nDissect the required mice and perfuse with 10 mL ice-cold PBS\nRemove the brain and homogenize the tissue with a Dounce potter in dissection medium at 4°C (total volume 20 mL).\nTransfer the cell suspension from each sample through a 70 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL Falcon tube respectively and spin at 300 g at 4°C for 5 min (total volume 20 mL).",

While acquiring the sample for flow cytometry, the temperature should be kept at 37°C.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 600 μL MAS buffer + PMP + TMRM solution and incubate for 2 min at 37°C in the dark in order to permeabilize the cells.",
