    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample collection and transport\nTiming: 2 h\nSurgeons perform sample collection. Bone marrow (BM) containing bone marrow adipose tissue (BM-AT) is harvested from the femoral cavity of patients undergoing hip surgery. Then, the collected sample is rapidly transferred to the lab for processing.\nAspiration of BM from the femoral proximal metaphysis and diaphysis\nDuring the surgical procedure, exposure is made as routinely. During femur preparation, after the femoral neck is cut, the surgeon has access to the intramedullary canal. If required, the first broach can open the canal, especially in young patients with dense trabecular bone\nAspirate BM cautiously with 60 mL syringe and a soft cannula, e.g., a 4.0 mm tracheal tube, in the femoral proximal metaphysis and diaphysis.\nImmediately place the sample (10–20 mL bone marrow aspirate) in the 37°C pre-warmed tube containing 20 mL KRBHA.\nPlace the tube in the transport bag (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and bring the sample back to the laboratory within 1 h for processing.\nNote: This procedure describes how to collect BM from femoral cavity. It can be adapted to collect BM from other long bones such as tibia during knee surgery.\nBM-Ad isolation and purification\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step consists of isolating bone marrow adipocytes (BM-Ads) from BM-AT and removing hematopoietic cells to obtain a pure BM-Ad suspension.\nSeparately, wash and collect BM samples (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2E). As BM aspirate often contain a significant amount of blood, it is necessary to rinse the aspirate with KRBHA to facilitate dissection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/754-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dissection and washing of the bone marrow adipose tissue",
    "Bone marrow aspirate is very bloody (A). Rinse the cell strainer (B), pour the tissue on it (C), and wash the tissue with 20 mL warm KRBHA (D). Transfer the BM sample to a petri dish (E) and dissect the yellow BM-AT with tweezers and scissors (F). Transfer the dissected BM-AT to a new 15 mL tube and weight the tissue prior BM-Ad isolation (G).\nPlace a 100 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL tube, rinse the strainer with KRBHA, and pour the tissue sample on top.\nPour 20 mL KRBHA on the sample to remove blood.\nCollect BM sample present on the strainer with tweezers and transfer it to a petri dish.\nDissect and weigh the BM-AT. BM samples contain “red marrow”, an area rich in hematopoietic cells, as well as “yellow marrow”, an area rich in BM-Ads present in the BM-AT. To avoid contamination with hematopoietic cells and increase digestion efficiency, it is recommended to keep only the BM-AT (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and 2G).\nUsing tweezers and scissors isolate the areas of BM-AT that are recognized by their yellow color and transfer this material to a new petri dish.\nAdd 10 mL KRBHA to the petri dish to wash the BM-AT.\nTransfer BM-AT to a pre-weighed 14 mL tube.\nWeigh the tube containing BM-AT and calculate the tissue weight.\nDigest BM-AT (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/754-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Bone marrow adipocyte isolation",
    "Incubate BM-AT with collagenase (A) for 20 min shaking horizontally on an orbital shaker (B). Digested BM-AT should have a “soup-like” consistency (C). Adipocytes rapidly float to the surface of the tube (D). Filter the suspension through a 100 μm cell strainer (E) and rinse the strainer with warm KRBHA. Wait a few minutes to allow adipocytes to float at the surface (F) and remove a maximum of KRBHA to facilitate adipocyte collection (G). Transfer BM-Ads with a 1 mL pipet to a new 2 mL tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 g at 22°C to pellet contaminant cells (H).\nUse 2.5 mL collagenase 1× solution per gram of tissue. Calculate the volume of collagenase 1× solution necessary for the experiment and prepare it by diluting the 5× stock solution in PBS 2% BSA.\nAdd the collagenase 1× solution to the tube containing the BM-AT, close the tube and seal it with parafilm.\nPlace the tube in a horizontal position on an orbital shaker at 37°C, 150 rpm.\nIncubate for roughly 20 min.\nCritical: Depending on the size of BM-AT pieces, digestion can be more or less rapid. At the end of the digestion period, the digested adipose tissue should have a “soup-like” consistency. If the digestion is not finished, pieces of intact tissue will remain, whereas if the digestion takes too long, adipocytes will burst and release oil. We suggest checking the digestion regularly from 15 minutes onwards. As mentioned above, digestion efficiency depends on the collagenase lot and type.\nStop the digestion (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nPlace a 100 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL tube, rinse the strainer with KRBHA, and filter the suspension through it to remove cellular debris, undigested fragments, and bone trabeculae.",
    "Pour 20 mL KRBHA on the strainer to recover a maximum of BM-Ads.\nWait 1–3 min to allow the lipid-laden adipocytes to rise up and float at the surface (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F)\nRemove 15–18 mL KRBHA from under the floating BM-Ads with a syringe and a 21G needle to facilitate the collection of the adipocytes and their transfer to a new tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G)\nCollect gently floating BM-Ads with a 1 mL pipet with standard P1000 pipette tip and transfer them to a 2 mL tubes.\nCritical: Isolated BM-Ads can remain stuck to the cell strainer or pipette tips. To limit this effect and avoid losing BM-Ads, rinse the cell strainer and the pipette tips with KRBHA before pouring or pipetting adipocytes. Moreover, as isolated adipocytes are fragile, the suspension must be poured on the filter and not pipetted through the filter with a culture pipet.\nWash and centrifuge BM-Ads. Even after cell dissociation with collagenase and separation of adipocytes by flotation, some contaminant cells remain attached to adipocytes. To purify adipocytes, it is important to wash and centrifuge the adipocyte suspension to pellet contaminant cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H)\nWash adipocytes by repeating the following steps 3 times.\nAdd 1 mL KRBHA and mix the suspension gently by tilting.\nWait until adipocyte rise again to form an upper layer, KRBHA being in the lower layer.\nUsing a 2 mL syringe with a 21G needle, aspirate the KRBHA and discard it.\nAdd 1 mL KRBHA and wait until adipocyte rise again to form an upper layer.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 200 g, 22°C. This step allows to pellet contaminant cells.\nTransfer floating adipocytes to a new tube. At this step, BM-Ads can be used for cell culture and functional experiments or can be frozen (step 8).",
    "Keep 30 μL of adipocytes in a separate 2 mL tube to validate the purity of the cell population (see steps 9–12).\nNote: Step 7 is essential to obtain pure adipocyte cell suspension but needs to be done as quickly as possible, as BM-Ads are fragile cells and can burst rapidly. Pipet gently the adipocytes to limit the lysis.\nPreparation of adipocytes for freezing. Freezing leads to adipocyte lysis. Thus, for functional assays, culture or imaging, adipocytes must be used directly after isolation and washing steps (step 7). For molecular analyses (RNA, protein, lipid content), we recommend freezing a known volume of adipocytes (without KRBHA) in liquid nitrogen and storing these samples at −80°C until use. Make several aliquots when possible.\nNote: For Western blotting, BSA must be removed to allow a correct protein quantification of the samples. To do this, wash cells 2 times with PBS before freezing (step 7a).\nValidation of adipocyte suspension purity\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step allows for verifying the quality and purity of the BM-Ad suspension. For each preparation, we recommend preparing fibrinogen gel containing BM-Ads to check the shape of BM-Ads (lipid staining) and the absence of contaminant cells attached to adipocytes (actin and nucleus staining) by confocal microscopy.\nEmbed BM-Ads in fibrinogen matrix (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4C)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/754-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Embed BM-Ads in fibrinogen matrix\nMix BM-Ads with fibrinogen (A) and then add thrombin (B) to obtain a fibrinogen matrix containing BM-Ads (C). After fixation and staining, place the gel on a coverslip for imaging (D–F). It is mandatory to handle the gel containing adipocytes carefully (D) to avoid any damage (F) that could affect sample quality.\nThaw fibrinogen and thrombin at 20°C–25°C.\nDilute thrombin ¼ with PBS 2 mM CaCl2.",
    "Gently mix the 30 μL of adipocytes kept from step 7e with 30 μL fibrinogen, then add 30 μL diluted thrombin and mix with up and down motions until the gel polymerizes (within seconds). Avoid forming bubbles.\nFixation.\nKeep the gel for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nUnder a chemical hood, add 400 μL 3.7% PFA. Incubate 20 min on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm.\nRemove PFA and wash 2 times with PBS.\nPause Point: At this step, samples can be stored in PBS at 4°C for up to 1 week until staining.\nStaining.\nRemove PBS.\nAdd staining solution containing 10 ng/mL BODIPY 493/503, 2 U/mL rhodamine-coupled phalloidin, and 2 μM of TO-PRO3 iodide 642/661 diluted in PBS.\nIncubate for 1 h on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm. Protect from light.\nRemove staining solution and wash 2 times with PBS.\nNote: BODIPY 493/503 stock solution must be dissolved in DMSO or ethanol at a concentration of 1 μg/mL as recommended by supplier. Aliquots in dark tubes can be stored at −20°C for several months. TO-PRO3 iodide 642/661 is ready to use but as it is unstable, it is mandatory to avoid freeze-thawing. It is highly recommended to make small aliquots of up to 10 μL in dark tubes.",
    "Alternatives: Fluorescent immunostaining can be performed. Saturation of non-specific antigen should be done using PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton ×100 for 1–2 hours at 20°C–25°C. Staining with primary antibodies should be done in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton ×100 for 16 hours at 4°C (antibody dilution should be determined by user for each antibody used). Wash gel 5 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 for 10 minutes each. Incubate the gel with secondary antibodies in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton ×100 for 2 hours at 20°C–25°C. Wash gel 5 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 for 10 min each. All incubations should be performed on an orbital shaking at 100 rpm or rotative shaker at 20 rpm. Alternative dyes can be used to stain nuclei including classical DNA intercalant such as DAPI or Hoechst33342 if UV or blue laser light are available on the used imaging system (see below).\nImaging.\nWith a curved clamp, handle the gel carefully and place it on a 150 μm coverslip. Do not pinch the gel firmly so as not to break it (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D–4F).\nPut the coverslip on an inverted confocal microscope.\nSet up confocal light path with correct excitation and emission wavelengths according to the dyes used for staining. If lipids are stained with BODIPY 493/503, excitation should be performed with a 488 nm blue laser and emission signals should be collected at 510 ± 15 nm. If the actin cytoskeleton is stained with rhodamine-coupled phalloidin, excitation should be performed with a 532 nm green laser and emission signals should be collected at 550 ± 15 nm. If nuclei are stained with TO-PRO3 iodide 642/661, excitation should be performed with a 635 nm red laser and emission signals should be collected around 660 ± 20 nm.",
    "Note: The cytoskeleton of adipocytes may have dim fluorescence due to the specific organization of adipocyte cytoplasm. The use of an objective lens with higher resolution and/or with a high numerical aperture can improve the quality of the signal collected for phalloidin staining."
