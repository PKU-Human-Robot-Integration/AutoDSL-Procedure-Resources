  "procedures": [
    "Notes: Procedures A-D are standard protocols for mRNA-seq library preparation using Tn5. Details on which steps can be paused or customized are also indicated as additional notes. Procedure E is for high-throughput RNA-seq library preparation. Users who are already familiar with all steps in Procedures A-D and confident with handling large amount of RNA-seq samples can start their library preparation from the Procedure E. For all steps here involving RNA or mRNA, please make sure all surfaces are clean (e.g., use RNaseZapTM RNase Decontamination Solution to clean the bench surface). All tubes and tips that will touch nucleic acids should be nuclease-free grade as indicated.Total RNA isolationHere we are using 5-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana plants growing under short-day (10-h light/14-h dark) at 22 °C as an example for demonstration.To harvest material, quickly and gently fold tissue into pre-labelled 2-ml tube containing 2 homogenization carbide beads, and snap freeze tissue in liquid nitrogen. Two fully-expanded leaves from each plant and 3 plants from each genotype and treatment (total of 6 leaves) were used as one sample (Ding et al., 2020).Notes:To reduce the sample size and working load, 2 leaves per sample was tested and also works well with this protocol. If working with younger Arabidopsis, approximately 2 seedlings or 20-100 mg (fresh weight) plant tissue per sample works well. All the following steps can be scaled up in proportion if more starting material is desired. Always use eye protection when working with liquid nitrogen.Grind tissue in Geno/Grinder blocks pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen: a single 30-s pulse at 30/s frequency is sufficient for leaf material. After getting the powder of the finely ground tissue, re-freeze in liquid nitrogen.Notes:It is helpful to keep blocks in liquid nitrogen while loading samples for grinding. Grinding conditions may vary depending on tissue. 0.",
    "5-1 min grinding at 25-30/s frequency is generally enough, but samples should be visually evaluated for homogenization to a fine powder.Add 800 ml pre-cooled TRI Reagent® solution into each tube, close the lid and quickly resuspend the tissue powder with a vortex mixer. Incubate the samples on ice for 3 min.Note: Take care when opening tubes to avoid explosions from expanding warming samples. Vortex samples again from slurry into a homogenized solution.Incubate all samples on ice for another 5 min. From this step onwards, work at room temperature.Note: If working with multiple samples, work with 3 to 4 samples in one turn for the two-step vortexing, to minimize RNA degradation. Spin all tubes at 10,000 × g in a benchtop centrifuge for 8 min.While waiting for the centrifugation, prepare the same number of fresh 2-ml tubes as in Step A1. Label and add 400 µl ≥ 99.8% EtOH into each tube.Take 400 µl supernatant from each tube into the corresponding new 2-ml tube prefilled with EtOH. Mix the samples by inverting the tubes gently for several times until all samples are homogenized.Notes: Left-over supernatant can be stored at -70 or -80 °C as backup samples. Volume of supernatant can be adjusted; volume of EtOH should be adjusted to remain equivalent to supernatant volume.Bind RNA: transfer the mixed solution to a Zymo-SpinTM IIC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.Wash the column: add 250 µl RNA Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.Remove genomic DNA (gDNA): for each sample to be treated, prepare DNase I Reaction Mix in an RNase-free tube. Mix well by gentle inversion.",
    "Transfer 80 µl mix onto each column, close the lids and incubate at room temperature (20-30 °C) for 15 min.table:",

    "Notes:If you have multiple tubes of RNA samples, make a master mix by multiplexing the standard DNase I Reaction Mix; make with 10% extra. If large amounts of gDNA contamination are consistently found after Procedure B (e.g., by PCR), TURBO DNase may be used for higher efficiency DNA removal, according to manufacturer’s protocol.Wash the column: Add 400 µl RNA Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 30 s. Skip the step of discarding the flow-through.Final wash: Add 200 µl RNA Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 2 min to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Transfer the column carefully into a 1.5-ml tube and discard the flow-through collection tube.RNA Elution: Add 50 µl DEPC-Treated Water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 30 s.Note: Alternatively, for highly concentrated RNA, use ≥ 25 µl Nuclease-free Water or DEPC-treated water. Measure RNA concentration with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.Notes: Eluted RNA should be kept on ice. Optional break point: RNA can be stored at -70~-80 °C for up to several weeks; Optional: whenever it is possible, the quality of total RNA can be assessed on high-sensitivity device with corresponding compatible RNA chips/reagents and program that is specifically designed for plant RNA, e.g., Bioanalyzer 2100 or TapeStation 4150 from Agilent. The RNA electropherogram results from Aglient machines provide an RNA integrity number (RIN). RNA with RIN greater than 6 are desirable for constructing high quality NGS libraries.mRNA isolation from total RNANote: Perform all steps on ice unless stated otherwise, particularly those affecting mRNA.Prepare Dynabeads® Oligo (dT)25: Resuspend Dynabeads® Oligo(dT)25 by pipetting or gentle vortexing, thoroughly before use.Note: No clumps of beads should be visible in base of container and solution should appear homogenous in pipet tip.",
    "From the storage container this should take several seconds of gentle mixing; for later steps with small volumes generally 5-10 complete cycles of pipetting up and down will result in complete bead resuspension. For each sample, transfer 10 µl well-suspended beads (suitable for 2-10 µg total Arabidopsis RNA, adjust volume if desired) to an RNase-free 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and place the tube on a magnet (e.g., MagnetoPURE).Note: This step can also be performed in PCR strips on a magnet that is compatible. After 30 s (or when the suspension is clear), remove the supernatant.Wash beads: Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend beads in 50-100 µl fresh Lysis/Binding Buffer provided by Dynabeads® Oligo (dT)25 kit. Place suspension back on magnet.After 30 s (or when the suspension is clear), remove the supernatant (Lysis/Binding Buffer) from the washed Dynabeads.Remove the microcentrifuge tube from the magnet.Add up to 10 µg isolated total RNA in 300 µl DEPC-Treated Water (up to 33 ng/µl) onto the bead pellet and resuspend beads completely by pipetting.Place tubes in a rotator mixer and incubate with continuous mixing for 3-5 min at room temperature to allow the polyA tail of the mRNA to hybridize to the oligo (dT)25 on the beads.Place the suspension back on the magnet for 2 min to collect beads/mRNA and remove the supernatant.Wash the beads/mRNA complex two times with 600 µl Washing Buffer A provided by Dynabeads® Oligo (dT)25 kit at room temperature. Resuspend beads completely and use the magnet to separate the beads from the solution for each washing step.Wash the beads/mRNA complex once with 300 µl Washing Buffer B provided by Dynabeads® Oligo (dT)25 kit. Resuspend beads completely and use the magnet to separate the beads from the solution.Elute mRNA: add 20 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.",
    "5 (Elution Buffer) and incubate at 65-80 °C (water bath or heat block) for 2 min. Immediately place the tube on the magnet, transfer the supernatant containing the mRNA to a new RNase-free tube and place this tube on ice. Do not discard the beads.Notes: In this step, the heat melts the mRNA from the Oligo(dT)25. If the sample cools down before transfer, the mRNA re-binds onto the Oligo(dT)25 and yield is reduced. It is possible to re-heat the sample to re-release the mRNA; At this step, usually the majority of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) will be removed. However, for the downstream cDNA library construction for NGS, any traceable amount of rRNA contamination should be avoided. The following steps ensure better purity of cDNA libraries for RNA-seq.Reuse of Dynabeads® Oligo(dT)25: wash the beads two times in Washing Buffer B (same as Step B11). Resuspend beads completely in each wash.Dilute eluted mRNA with 80 µl Lysis/Binding Buffer (4× volume). Start second mRNA purification: remove second wash of Washing Buffer B from the beads and add the diluted mRNA.Incubate with mixing at room temperature for 3-5 min.Repeat Steps B4 to B12, eluting RNA finally in 10 µl 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5.Notes:Optional break point: mRNA can be stored at -70~-80 °C for up to several weeks; Keep the other 10 µl of mRNA in the -70~-80 °C freezer as backups.Synthesis of double stranded (ds) cDNANote: Perform all steps on ice unless stated otherwise, particularly those affecting mRNA.Add the following components to a PCR strip as Mix I:table:",

Store the remainder at -20 °C as backup.Gently vortex AMPure XP to resuspend settled magnetic beads. Add 36 µl AMPure XP beads (1.8× volume of the input cDNA) to the cDNA. Note: AMPure XP beads bind nucleic acids size-selectively based on the concentration of the ABR buffer (that they are stored in), so following the volume ratios is crucial. Mix the AMPure XP and sample thoroughly by pipetting (mixing >10 times).Incubate at room temperature 5 min.Place the reaction tube onto a magnetic rack for 2 min to separate beads from the solution and remove the supernatant.Note: To avoid loss of cDNA bound on beads, leave 5 µl volume behind (e.g., remove 51 µl). EtOH wash: add 200 µl 70% EtOH on the magnet rack. Incubate at room temperature for 30 s, no need to resuspend beads. Fully remove and discard ethanol.Repeat for a total of two washes. Remove the tubes from the magnet rack.Elution: add ≥ 25 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (Elution Buffer), mix thoroughly by pipetting.Notes:Recommend pipetting up and down 20 times for complete mixing; Application of less than 25 µl of Elution Buffer may result in decreased efficiency of elution.Incubate at room temperature for 2 min.",

Note: Optional break point. purified ds cDNA can be stored at -20 °C for several months.Library preparation with cDNA tagmentationNotes:Keep all samples and products on ice all the time except when they are in the thermocycler. Protocol can be paused after each step in this section; store products at -20 °C. Dilute cDNA to desired concentrationNote: The tagmentation reaction has at least four parameters (starting cDNA, Tn5 amount, incubation time, and optional PEG in reaction) which can be optimized to obtain an acceptable range of library size with minimal PCR cycles. We present here two possibilities: one below (more labor-intensive to minimize amplification steps) and one for high-throughput library prep (Procedure E, generally acceptable yields with reduced time required per-library, Figure 1). These should provide reasonable starting points, but cannot fully replace optimization for desired conditions. For a more complete exploration of parameters see Picelli et al. (2014).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201018/20201018111207_1963.jpgFigure 1. Various reaction conditions can result in acceptable library size distributions. Shown are BioAnalyzer traces from two extremes of DNA concentration, (A) 0.1 ng or (B) 2 ng tagmented cDNA, with 16 or 10 cycles PCR, respectively. Each reaction was performed at 55 °C for 7 min with 0.1 μl Tn5. The reaction in (B) was performed in the presence of 8% PEG. The majority of libraries should be between 300-500 bp in size, as fragments larger than this do not sequence well and fragments smaller than this risk preferential sequencing.",

Load the reaction mix on a RT-qPCR machine with the program below. Based on the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) curves of each sample, draw a horizontal line at the 1/3 of maximum RFU, and at the cross-over draw a vertical line to cross the axis indicating cycle number (Figure 2, High-quality pre-amplification step).

(Optional break point)Analyse the quantity and quality of the libraries using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis, following the standard commercial protocol. Multiplex the cDNA libraries with equal molar ratio and similar size distribution and use appropriate amounts for NGS on desired Illumina sequencing platforms (following instructions from your sequencing facility).Alternative protocol for mRNA isolationWhen more than 24 samples are to be prepared, it is beneficial to use a multiplexed RNA extraction. The following protocol is adapted from the HT-Seq and BrAD-seq protocols (Kumar et al., 2012; Townsley et al., 2015) and can easily accommodate 48 samples from tissue preparation through ds cDNA synthesis in one day. Figure 2 provides a schematic guide to the mRNA extraction.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201018/20201018111142_0711.jpgFigure 2. Schematic view of library preparation with tagmentationHarvest tissue into 2-ml tubes containing grinding beads, snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Tissue recommendations are as in Procedure A.Note: Two to four 4-mm glass beads also work well for grinding. Prepare htLBB: allow approximately 1 ml htLBB per sample if using up to 50 mg tissue. Let htLBB warm to room temperature if prepared beforehand and add 5 µg/µl 2-mercaptoethanol before adding to sample–do not store htLBB with 2-mercaptoethanol.Grind in liquid nitrogen-cooled Geno/Grinder blocks: grinding conditions as in Procedure A.Re-grind samples with htLBB: add similar volume room-temperature htLBB to plant powder, move samples to a room temperature block and grind again for 1 min. Do not allow samples to freeze.Notes:For two Arabidopsis seedlings, add ~450 µl htLBB: excess htLBB is not a problem, but too little htLBB will interfere with mRNA extraction; If multiple sets of Geno/Grinder blocks are available, changing to a fresh set can help avoid sample freezing.Incubate at room temperature for approximately 5 min.",
    "Pellet plant debris in room temperature microcentrifuge, ~16,000 × g, 10 min. During spin, label five sets of 8-well PCR strips: two for lysate, one for magnetic beads, and two for sequential RNA elutions.Aliquot supernatant to PCR strips: 2× 200 µl. One set of strips will move forward, keep the second at -70 to -80 °C as backup.Note: Pellet is not completely solid: it’s recommended that the first, cleaner supernatant aliquot is for immediate use. Add 1 µl 12.5 µM biotinylated oligo-dT to active strips. Aliquot and store biotin-dT in a master PCR strip to facilitate using multi-channel pipette to dispense to sample tubes.Incubate 10 min at room temperature.During incubation, prepare strips (third set) with streptavidin magnetic beads. Dispense 20 µl streptavidin bead slurry to each tube and place on magnet. When beads have settled, remove bead storage buffer and resuspend fully in 100 µl htLBB.Notes: It is helpful to again use a master mix strip and multichannel pipette. Beads settle easily: resuspend stock by vortexing at moderate speed after every few tubes dispensed, and with pipet in individual tubes.When biotin incubation is complete, place htLBB-magnetic bead strips on magnet, remove the supernatant (htLBB), and add the 200 µl lysate-oligo dT mixture onto the beads.Incubate 10 min at room temperature with mixing.Note: For mixing a plate mixer is recommended, but plates can also be taped to a 1.5-ml tube incubator-mixer set at 1,400/min, or to a vortex at minimum speed. When mixing is complete, spin strips briefly to remove lysate/bead mixture from lids, place strips in magnetic rack and collect beads for 2 min.Remove supernatant and add 200 µl ice-cold WBA, pipetting well to resuspend beads completely.Notes:Supernatant may be discarded or kept for DNA extraction if desired.",
    "It may improve mRNA stability to keep wash buffers, dispensing reservoirs, and magnetic rack on ice, but this is not necessary.Place strips back in the magnetic rack to collect beads, remove supernatant (WBA), add 200 µl ice-cold WBB, and pipet well to resuspend beads completely.Place strips back in the magnetic rack to collect beads, remove supernatant (WBB), add 200 µl ice-cold LSB, and pipet well to resuspend beads completely.Place strips back in a magnetic rack to collect beads, remove supernatant (LSB), add 15.5 µl room temperature 10 mM Tris-HCl, and pipet well to resuspend beads completely.Incubate beads at 80 °C for 2 min.Note: During heating, warm magnetic rack, by placing in a warm water bath or under warm flowing water. Remove strips from the heating block, place on the magnetic rack, and immediately remove 15 µl to fresh strips (fourth set).Note: In this step, the heat melts the mRNA from the Oligo(dT)25. If the sample cools down before transfer, the mRNA re-binds onto the Oligo(dT)25 and yield is reduced. It is possible to re-heat the sample to re-release the mRNA. Resuspend beads in 100 µl WBB.Make DNase master mix:table:",

    "DNase I digestion: add 10 µl reaction mix to 15 µl mRNA, incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.Note: DNase incubation is not required for all tissues. When optimizing, consider skipping DNase incubation and testing for DNA contamination in RNA (e.g., through a PCR specific to gDNA). If no significant gDNA contamination is detected, DNase treatment may be skipped; a second round of purification is still recommended to remove rRNA contamination. DNase I inactivation: add 1.5 µl EDTA to each reaction, mix thoroughly by tapping, and incubate at 75 °C for 10 min.During DNase inactivation, discard WBB from beads (Step E20) and resuspend beads in fresh WBB.Transfer strips immediately to ice; incubate for at least 2 min.Add 175 µl htLBB to 25 µl DNase reaction.Discard second WBB wash and resuspend beads in 200 µl DNAse-treated RNA in htLBB.Repeat Steps E12-E19, performing final elution in 10 µl 10 mM Tris-HCl into the fifth set of labeled strips.Note: mRNA yield can be estimated by using nanodrop spectrophotometer. Yields should be 20-30 ng/µl, with clean peaks, 260/280 in the range of 2-2.2, 260/230 approximately 2. Testing has shown essentially no rRNA contamination, and gDNA contamination typically in the 0.1-1 ng range, with most samples closer to 0.1 ng. Remaining steps of library preparation (first and second strand cDNA synthesis, tagmentation) can proceed approximately as in Procedures C and D, with the adjustments shown below and in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201018/20201018111127_6648.jpgFigure 3. Schematic view of high-throughput mRNA isolationFirst and second strand cDNA synthesis can be performed multiplexed in PCR strips. Exonuclease and RNase A steps can be skipped as these contaminants will be largely removed through subsequent AMPure/Serapure cleanup steps.",
    "High-throughput dsDNA quantification: rather than ds cDNA quantification in Qubit, concentration can be estimated using SYBR green with a standard curve in a black 96-well plate using a standard plate reader (Leggate et al., 2006). Briefly: mix 1-2 µl ds cDNA with 1 µl 100x SYBR green in a 96-well plate. Incubate in the dark > 1 min, then excite at 485 nm and measure fluorescence at 535 nm. A standard curve from 0-10 ng/µl can be made from commercially available DNA preps with known concentration (e.g., DNA ladder, calf thymus DNA) and allows estimation of sample concentration.High-throughput AMPure cleanup: for earlier steps, AMPure can be replaced with homemade ‘Serapure’ (DeAngelis et al., 1995; Fisher et al., 2011; Lundin et al., 2010; Rohland and Reich, 2012).Note: ‘Serapure’ costs significantly less than AMPure but loses stability after about 1-2 weeks and is not recommended for final purification steps. To minimize PCR cycles needed for library amplification without optimizing for each library, increase starting amounts of ds cDNA, and add PEG to reaction mixture.table:",
