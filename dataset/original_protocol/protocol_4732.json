    "Experimental setupExperimental space should be quiet and dimly lit to avoid distraction from sounds and increased anxiety level from bright lights. The experimental area is surrounded by a back curtain with the experimenter outside of the curtain to avoid distraction from movements. A digital recording camera is mounted overhead and connected to a computer for recording the experiment.Social recognition experiments have two phases, a training phase and a recall phase. If the subject mouse does not spend at least 25 sec investigating the stimulus animal in the training phase the subject animal should be excluded for that experiment (Kogan et al., 2000). Insufficient exploration time in the training phase may lead to inconclusive or incorrect results.The subject mouse is said to be exploring the stimulus if the subject mouse is facing the stimulus and within 1 cm of the stimulus or following closely (≤ 1 cm) behind (Kogan et al., 2000).Social recognition in miceSocial recognition of a conspecific juvenile male, or a juvenile male of a different strainTraining phaseSubject mice (transgenic mice and their wildtype littermates) should be group housed (2-5 mice) for best results as single housing mouse can lead to decreased social recognition memory (Kogan et al., 2000). Place the subject mouse into a clean plastic cage identical to the home cage for 30 min prior to testing to allow the animal to habituate to the cage. Place a juvenile male mouse (the stimulus mouse) into the cage with the subject mouse for 5 min. Allow the mice to explore each other, but if the mice begin to fight they should be separated immediately to avoid injury. After 5 min, both mice are placed back into their home cage.Recall phaseFor the recall phase, split the subject mice into two groups.",
    "One group will be placed with a novel juvenile male and the second group will be placed with the same juvenile male as in the training phase. Place the subject mouse into a clean plastic cage identical to the home cage for 30 min prior to testing. Reusing the same cage can skew the result as the subject mouse may have left its scent in the bedding of the cage.Place the appropriate juvenile male stimulus mouse into the cage with the subject mouse for 5 min. Allow the subject mouse to explore the stimulus mouse, but if the mice begin to fight they should be separated immediately to avoid injury. After 5 min, both mice are placed back into their home cage.Social recognition of a conspecific femaleTraining phasePlace the female mouse into the round wire enclosure in a clean cage for ten min two times the day before testing to reduce stress and fear in the female mouse (for required equipment see Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160504/20160504183538_1904.jpgFigure 1. Experimental set-up for the female social recognition task. A. For the female social recognition task, a small wire enclosure and an empty clean mouse cage are used. B. This is an enlarged picture of the small wire enclosure used for the female mice.Place the subject mouse into a clean plastic cage identical to the home cage with the small wire enclosure for 30 min prior to testing to allow the animal to habituate to the cage and the wire enclosure. Briefly, lift the wire enclosure and place a female mouse into the wire enclosure, and allow the subject mouse to explore the wire enclosure containing the female mouse for 5 min. After 5 min, place both mice back into their home cage.Recall phaseFor the recall phase, split the subject mice into two groups.",
    "One group will be placed with a novel female and the second group will be placed with the same female as in the training phase. Place the subject mouse into a clean cage, identical to the home cage, with the wire enclosure in it, for 30 min prior to testing. Briefly, lift the wire enclosure and place the appropriate female mouse into the wire enclosure, and allow the subject mouse to explore the wire enclosure containing the female mouse for 5 min. After 5 min, both mice are placed back into their respective home cages.Social recognition of a mouse for a rodent of another speciesTraining phasePlace the rat into the wire mesh enclosure in a clean rat cage for ten minutes two times the day before testing to reduce stress and fear in the rat (for required equipment see Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160504/20160504183602_2768.jpgFigure 2. Experimental set-up for the rat social recognition task. A. For the rat social recognition task, a large wire enclosure and an empty clean rat cage are used. B. This is an enlarged picture of the large wire enclosure used for the rat.Place the subject mouse into a clean plastic rat cage with the wire mesh enclosure for 30 min prior to testing to allow the mouse to habituate to the cage and the wire enclosure. Place a rat securely into the wire mesh enclosure, and the enclosure into the cage with the adult mouse for 5 min. Monitor the rat and mouse pair to ensure that the rat is not able to escape the enclosure for the safety of the mouse.After 5 min, place the mouse and the rat back into their respective home cages.Recall phaseFor the recall phase, split the subject mice into two groups.",
    "One group will be placed with a novel rat (this is the control group) and the second group will be placed with the same rat as in the training phase (this is the experimental group). Place the subject mouse into a clean plastic rat cage with the wire enclosure in it, for 30 min prior to testing. Place the appropriate rat into the cage with the adult mouse for 5 min allowing the male mouse to explore the rat in its enclosure. After 5 min, both animals are placed back into their home cages.Habituation-dishabituation in miceThis paradigm mimics the short, frequent interactions that mice may experience traveling throughout the colony (Dantzer et al., 1987; Winslow and Camacho, 1995). It consists of five short exploration sessions each with a one minute duration. Place the subject mouse into a clean plastic cage identical to the home cage for 30 min prior to testing to allow the animal to habituate to the cage. Place a novel juvenile male conspecific into the cage with the subject mouse for 1 min. After one minute remove the stimulus mouse and place it into a holding cage.After a ten-minute delay, place the same stimulus mouse back into the cage with the subject mouse. Repeat this two more times for a total of 4 exploratory sessions. After the fourth ten-minute delay, the fifth exploratory session, place a novel juvenile conspecific into the cage with the subject mouse. After one minute remove the stimulus mouse from the cage.Data analysisUsing a stopwatch, record the amount of time that the subject mouse spends investigating the stimulus animal.",
    "Investigation of the stimulus animal is defined as the subject mouse being within one centimeter of the subject mouse with its head directed toward the other animal, touching or licking the other animal (Figure 3, Video 1). Recently, Arakawa et al. (2014) have also developed an automated software that can be used to detect social interaction patterns, if this method is preferred. The software was shown to produce similar results to human observation but may not be applicable in all instances (Arakawa et al., 2014). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160504/20160504183621_4805.jpgFigure 3. Data analysis for the social recognition task. This diagram illustrates the investigation criteria of the subject mouse. For both examples, the subject mouse must be within 1 cm of the stimulus animal with its face directed toward the stimulus. A. This panel illustrates an example of the subject mouse investigating the facial region of the stimulus mouse. B. This is a picture of the subject mouse investigating the facial region of the stimulus mouse. C. This panel illustrates an example of the subject mouse investigating the ano-genital region of the stimulus mouse. D. In this picture, the stimulus mouse is investigating the ano-genital region of the stimulus mouse.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Sample video clip for the social recognition task  Record the time in seconds.Group the animals according to the genotype, sex, or treatment.Average the exploration times and determine the standard error.Plot the data using the standard error measurements as the error bars. Differences between the training session and the recall session can be determined using a Student’s T-test. The animal is said to have formed a memory of the stimulus animal if there is a significant decrease in the amount of time spent investigating the familiar stimulus animal from the training session to the recall session.",
    "Differences among groups can be determined by an ANOVA."
