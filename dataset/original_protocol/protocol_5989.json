    "Preparation of preparatory culturesStreak desired B. subtilis cells onto LB agar, with selective antibiotic, when appropriate.Incubate plates at 37 °C overnight or RT for 2-3 days.In a 13 mm glass tube placed within an 18 mm glass tube, inoculate 1 ml of LB culture with a single colony of B. subtilis approximately 12 h before starting preculture and grow the cells overnight at RT (Figure 1).Note: This setup helps with transferring liquid cultures, as some pipettes may not reach the bottom of the 18 mm glass tube.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181128/20181128012019_3314.jpgFigure 1. Two possible ways to set up a 13 mm tube within an 18 mm tube. In setup 1, the end of a 1 ml pipette tip is cut off and inserted into the 18 mm tube, with the 13 mm tube set on top of the tip. In setup 2, two 13 mm glass tube caps are placed on top of each other and placed into the bottom of the 18 mm tube.Transformation assay setupGrow cells rolling at 37 °C for one hour.Note: Roller drum should be set to 9 RPM. Transfer 1 ml of each culture to a 1.7 ml microfuge tube.Harvest cells by centrifugation (6,200 x g; 2 min, room temperature). There should be a visible pellet at the bottom of the microfuge tube.Pipette to remove supernatant and discard.Resuspend cells in 1 ml of 1x PBS.Centrifuge again (6,200 x g; 2 min, room temperature).Pipette to remove supernatant and discard.Resuspend cells in 1 ml of 1x PBS.Centrifuge again (6,200 x g; 2 min, room temperature).Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 500 µl of freshly made 1x MC (see Recipes).Check OD600, using 150 µl of resuspended cells and 450 µl of 1x PBS (Blank with 150 µl of 1x MC and 450 µl of 1x PBS).Note: OD600 should be 0.2-1.2.",
    "Inoculate washed cells into a new 13 mm tube in an 18 mm tube and fill to 1 ml of 1x MC, so the culture has a starting OD600 of 0.01 to 0.05.Note: 1 µl of the selective antibiotic pertaining to the original strain resistance (not the donor DNA antibiotic marker) can be added to prevent any accidental contamination. Grow cells while rolling at 37 °C for 4.5 to 5 h.After 4.5 to 5 h, transfer 300 µl of each culture to a new 13 mm glass tube.Add 3 µl of genomic DNA (at a concentration of 100 ng/µl) and 3 µl of 1 M MgSO4 to each culture tube.Note: Include one culture without DNA added as a control for each experiment. Continue rolling cells at 37 °C for 2 h.Serial dilutions and platingRetrieve cultures from 37 °C.Create 1:10 serial dilutions of the cultures in 1x PBS to a 10-6 dilution.Plate 100 µl of desired dilutions onto LB (for CFU) and selective plates (for TFU) using glass beads (Figure 2).Note: A 10-6 dilution should yield 30-300 colonies for the wild-type TFU. For mutants, dilution plating is dependent on the type of defect present, so initial experiments are necessary to determine the range of dilutions required for plating.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181128/20181128012036_5473.jpgFigure 2. Representation of how the plating may look when comparing wild-type cells to mutants. In Row 1, the wild-type and ∆lacA strains are plated at a 10-2 dilution. The ∆comK and ∆ecsB strains are plated with undiluted culture. All plates in Row 1 contain the selectable antibiotic relevant to the marker present on the donor DNA. Row 2 is plated on LB plates with 10-6 dilutions. Each column is a different genotype.",
    "Column 1 is wild type, column 2 is ∆comK (a gene necessary for transformation), column 3 is ∆lacA (a gene not related to natural transformation), and column 4 is ∆ecsB (putatively involved with natural transformation). No colonies formed on the undiluted ∆comK selective plate, a few colonies are visible on the ∆ecsB selective plate, and colony formation was at the level of wild type for ∆lacA. CFU can also can be compared to wild type at this step.Place plates at 37 °C overnight, or leave at RT for 2-3 days.Note: TFU plates may need an extra day for colonies to grow due to selection. Count colonies on each plate. The colonies on each plate must be multiplied by their dilution factor to obtain CFUs and TFUs.Note: It may be helpful to count using a marker to mark colonies while using a tally counter to keep track of the number of colonies."
