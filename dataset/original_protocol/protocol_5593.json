    "Bacterial-fungal confrontation assay on solid mediaNote: All steps should be carried out in sterile conditions. Pick a Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA strain BRS1 sclerotium from approx. 2-week-old PDA plate using sterile toothpick/forceps, spot it at the center of fresh PDA plate (see Recipes) and incubate at 28 °C for a week. The R. solani sclerotium germinates to form mycelia which upon incubation produce plenty of black colored secondary sclerotia, the spore-like resting structures.Pick a single colony of B. gladioli strainNGJ1 from PDA plate and inoculate it in 10 ml PDB broth (see Recipes) and incubate it for 48 h at 28 °C at 200 rpm. The bacterial number is quantified using serial dilution plating and colony counting. Using sterile toothpick/forceps, place R. solani sclerotium at the center of PDA or CDA plate (see Recipes) and spot the B. gladioli strain NGJ1 culture (20 µl of 109 cells/ml) at four corners of the plate, equidistant from the center. Further, incubate the plate at 28 °C and routinely monitor for bacterial spread over fungal mycelia (Figure 1; Please note the NGJ1 spreads over fungal mycelia, induces cell death response and feed on them).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180117/20180117180935_0390.jpgFigure 1. B. gladioli strain NGJ1 demonstrates mycophagy on R. solani. A. Growth pattern of R. solani sclerotia on PDA plates. During 3 and 5 dpi of growth, the fungal mycelia spread over petri-plate and by 7 dpi, plenty of secondary sclerotia are produced. B. Growth pattern of B. gladioli strain NGJ1 on PDA plates. Even during 7 dpi of growth, the bacteria failed to cover the entire plate (C) Confrontation of NGJ1 with R. solani on PDA plates. Initially by 3 dpi, the bacteria show limited antifungal activity but during 5 dpi, the bacteria started spreading over fungal biomass and by 7 dpi, the bacteria spread over entire fungal biomass.",
    "Bacterial-fungal confrontation assay in liquid mediaCollect fresh sclerotia from one-week-old plate of R. solani AG1-IA strain BRS1 using sterile toothpick/forceps. Inoculate 5-10 sclerotia in 10 ml PDB/CDB broth (see Recipes) and allow them to grow for 48 h at 28 °C with constant shaking (200 rpm) to obtain mycelial mass.Pick a single colony of B. gladioli strain NGJ1 and inoculate it in 10 ml PDB/CDB broth at 28 °C for 48 h at 200 rpm. 100 µl of 109 cells/ml culture of B. gladioli strain NGJ1 was inoculated into 10 ml PDB/CDB media containing 48 h pre-grown fungal mycelial mass.Collect 100 µl of the bacterial solution at three different time points (24 h, 48 h and 72 h) of co-cultivation with pre-grown R. solani mycelia and upon serial dilution (105, 106, 107) plate 100 µl of bacterial solution on PDB/CDB plates. Use NGJ1 grown in absence of R. solani mycelia in PDB/CDB broth as a control.Incubate plates at 28 °C for 24 h and count the bacterial colonies appeared on the plate.Sclerotial growth prevention assayPick a single colony of B. gladioli strain NGJ1 and inoculate in 10 ml PDB broth and incubate at 28 °C for 48 h at 200 rpm. Prepare 10 ml of 109, 107, 105, and 103 cells/ml dilutions of bacterial culture using sterile PDB.Add 5-10 R. solani sclerotia in each of the diluted bacterial culture.Incubate for 4 h at 28 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm.After 4 h, take out the treated sclerotia and individually place each sclerotium on fresh PDA plates.For control, incubate the sclerotia for 4 h in PDB broth (without NGJ1).Further, incubate plates at 28 °C and routinely monitor for mycelial growth.Agar slide confrontation assayClean the microscopic glass slides with ethanol and autoclave them.",
    "Prepare 1% agar solution (autoclaved) and gently pour 4 ml of it drop wise on the sterile glass slide to obtain thin agar layered slides. Let the agar solidify for 30 min in laminar air flow.Place 2 freshly collected sclerotia on both ends of the thin agar layered slides, incubate the slides in a closed sterile Petri-plate having moist tissue paper (to maintain humid condition) and allow the sclerotia to germinate at 28 °C for 24 h.Using a pipette, spot 20 µl of pre-grown culture (109 cells/ml) of B. gladioli strain NGJ1 at the center of the agar slides containing pre-grown R. solani mycelia.Incubate at 28 °C under aseptic condition and using a light microscope, observe the slides (for bacterial spread and damage of mycelia) after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h of confrontation."
