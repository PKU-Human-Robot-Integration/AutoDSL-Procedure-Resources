    "Preparation of TIRFM flow cellsMount two 4 x 40 mm double-layer strips of Parafilm to the 24 x 60 mm cover glass tightly, leaving the gap for 3-4 mm.Place a 25 x 76 mm microscope slide on the cover glass perpendicularly to make the flow cell. Press gently.Heat the flow cell in an alcohol burner for 2-3 sec to ensure that the Parafilm sticks tightly to the cover glass and microscope slide. The chamber volume should be about 40 μl.See Figure 1 for how to make a flow cell.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170223/20170223103712_0818.jpgFigure 1. Cartoon for the preparation of flow cells for TIRFMPreparation of actin monomers100 μl OG labeled actin (about 20 μM) is taken out from -80 °C freezer and thawed in ice water. It is then subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 x g for 2 h, at 4 °C. Subsequently, 50 μl supernatant is pipetted out carefully after centrifugation and is kept on ice in the dark (see Note 1).Ten microliter supernatant is diluted into 490 μl buffer G for the determination of actin concentration, using buffer G as the control. Since not all actin monomers are labeled, the concentration of unlabeled or labeled actin is determined by the spectrophotometer associated with an Infinite 200 PRO multimode reader. To determine the concentration of total actin, the absorbance is measured at 290 nm and 491 nm using the extinction coefficient of 26,600 M-1 cm-1 at 290 nm for actin and 77,800 M-1 cm-1 at 491 nm for Oregon-green, respectively, and the concentration of total actin is calculated using the following equation: [total Actin] = (A290 - 0.16991 x A491) x 50 x 106/26,600 μM.",
    "Usually, one actin monomer is labeled by one Oregon-green molecule on Cys-374 (Kuhn and Pollard, 2005), so we can infer the concentration of labeled actin by calculating the concentration of Oregon-green molecules. The concentration of OG is calculated using the following equation: [OG] = A491 x 50 x 106/77, 800 μM. So [OG] is used as [OG-actin]. Usually the concentration of OG-actin is about 5 μM, and unlabeled actin is 1 to 2 μM.OG actin is mixed with unlabeled actin at equal molar ratio and 1/10 volume of 10x ME is subsequently added into the solution and is kept on ice in the dark.NEM-myosin is diluted to 20 nM in HS-TBS and 40 μl of diluted NEM-myosin is injected into the chamber, incubate 5 min at room temperature in the dark.The flow cell is washed with 40 μl HS-BSA, followed by washing with 40 μl LS-BSA immediately, and incubate for 2 min at room temperature in dark. A small piece of capillary paper is placed on the other side of the chamber by capillarity to help fluid flow out.The flow cell is washed with 40 μl 1x TIRFM buffer.Actin monomers (0.75 μM, 50% OG labeled) in 1x TIRFM buffer is injected into the chamber. The growth of single actin filaments is observed under an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a 100x oil objective by the TIRF illumination, and images are captured with MicroManager imaging software (Micro-Manager) at 2- or 3-sec intervals. OG is excited by a 488 nm Argon laser, and the time-lapse series images are taken using a Photometrics cascade II 512 CCD camera and saved as a tiff file. The file can be opened and further analyzed by ImageJ software.ExamplesExample 1. Formin5 (FH5) eliminates the inhibitory effect of Profilin5 (PRF5) on spontaneous actin nucleation.",
    "Various concentrations of proteins are pre-incubated with actin monomers for 5 min in the dark before being injected into the flow cell. See the example in Figure 2.Example 2. Determination of the effect of PRF4 and PRF5 on actin filament elongation.Step 1. Actin monomers at 0.75 μM in 1x TIRFM buffer is injected into the chamber. After the actin assembly reaction running for about 10 min, it will generate enough amount of actin filament ends to permit the filament elongation in step 2 (step 8b.ii). Actin filaments are observed under an Olympus IX81 microscope by TIRF illumination. Images are acquired with the sequential-acquire program, which is paused after 10 min. The last frame and time point are marked for further analysis.Step 2. Equal amount of actin monomers in 1x TIRFM buffer as in step 1 (step 8b.i) is injected into the chamber in the presence or absence of PRFs that are preincubated with actin for 5 min in the dark quickly and gently, in order to keep the position of slide. Normally, the injection can be done in one minute. The sequential-acquire program is then restarted to continue the image acquisition for another 10 min. The PRF-actin complex will add onto the ends of existing filaments to promote further elongation. The image series is saved as a tiff file. The time interval between two observations should be taken into consideration when analyzing image series. See the example in Figure 3."
