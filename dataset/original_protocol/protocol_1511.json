    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of hearts for enzymatic digestion via perfusion\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nIf possible, we recommend three investigators participate in this initial step of the protocol—two dissecting tissue and one handling the perfusion platform. The number of investigators is dependent on the competence and speed of technicians and the number of hearts being processed. For a detailed description of thoracotomy and externalization of the mouse heart, see Pinto et al. (2013)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nEuthanize four mice by CO2 asphyxiation and promptly pin in supine position—two per dissection board per investigator. Place freshly prepared Perfusion buffer with enzymes in 37°C water bath.\nNote: Alternatively, euthanasia can be performed by administration of ethical and pharmaceutically-appropriate drugs. Euthanasia by cervical dislocation is NOT recommended as an intact circulatory system is desired.\nCritical: During dissection, outlined in steps (steps 3–8), take care not to pierce any organs, especially the heart.\nSpray anterior thorax with 80% v/v ethanol solution to minimize fur dispersal.\nCut away a small 1–2 cm2 area of skin above the intersection of the septum and diaphragm.\nWhile holding the septum with forceps, slowly raise the ribcage and carefully make an incision in the abdominal cavity with surgical scissors, taking care to follow the lateral margins of the rib cage.\nNote: Septum is held with forceps from steps 4–7.\nWhile still holding the septum, if required, gently push away any exposed abdominal organs to reveal diaphragm. This can be achieved by closing the scissors (to minimize risk of damaging organs) and using them to push aside organs.\nWhile exposing the inferior cavity of the diaphragm, cut the diaphragm along the margin of where the diaphragm and rib cage intersect.\nWith care and without damaging the lungs; cut the ribcage upwards towards the arms from the left- and right-hand side.",
    "Pin the ribcage back adjacent to the left ear of the mouse and carefully remove the pericardium (if visible) from the heart gently.\nNote: Perform steps 2–8 per mouse on dissection board first. Follow the next steps (9–14) in this section 1 mouse at a time per scientist. Steps 9–14 typically requires <5 mins.\nLocate and cut the inferior vena cava and immediately perfuse the animal with 7 mL of ice-cold EDTA buffer in the pre-loaded syringes, through the right ventricle.\nPlace forceps below the heart and gently raise it, elevating it from other organs to expose the aorta.\nUsing a curved hemostat, clamp the aorta and secure firmly, taking care not to clamp the atria. For troubleshooting regarding atria clamping see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nWith the heart clamped, cut below the hemostat to isolate each mouse heart, and transfer the clamped heart to the perfusion platform.\nMagnetically secure the hemostat in place, with the ventricles pointing upward and place a 30G needle in the apex of the left ventricle (as shown in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G–1I). If difficulties are experienced in maintaining needle position, refer to problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] in troubleshooting.\nStart perfusion using the peristaltic pump at a rate of 1 mL/min/heart with EDTA buffer at 37°C and proceed from step 9 with the next heart. Ensure a waste reservoir is placed beneath the perfusing hearts to collect perfusate.\nNote: All perfusate (here and in subsequent steps) is collected in a waste reservoir beneath the hearts. As the waste reservoir fills, use a Pasteur pipette to periodically empty the contents into a waste beaker.\nDuring perfusion, ensure the surface of hearts remain moist by periodically basting the hearts using a Pasteur pipette with clean pre-warmed EDTA buffer. It is important to prevent tissue from drying out.",
    "Once all hearts are being simultaneously perfused with EDTA buffer, increase perfusion flow rate to 6 mL/min (1.25 mL/min/heart).\nTIP: When processing more than four hearts, multiple fluidic channels (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) can be used to process hearts in batches of four. Alternatively, individual fluidic channels can be closed using the stopcocks to process fewer hearts.\nEnzymatic digestion and cell isolation\nTiming: 1–2 h\nObservation: As EDTA buffer is perfusing through the heart, perfusate with blood will emerge from the heart. The perfusate will progressively clear as blood is removed from the tissue.\nAfter blood is no longer dripping into the waste reservoir (∼5 min after start of EDTA buffer perfusion), pause the peristaltic pump and switch buffers from EDTA buffer to Perfusion buffer with enzymes (which should be in the 37°C water bath – step 1) before resuming perfusion at 6 mL/min (1.25 mL/min/heart).\nDuring digestion:\nBaste hearts undergoing perfusion with the same pre-warmed Perfusion buffer with enzymes (at 37°C) until it appears slightly blanched, translucent, and dilated (∼30 min).\nNote: We have observed shorter perfusion times when agents such as sodium pentobarbitone are used for euthanasia. If uneven rates of digestion are observed, see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] in troubleshooting section. Further, as the hearts perfuse, the perfusate is accumulating in the waste reservoir – this is to be discarded.\nWhile waiting for hearts to digest, prepare the following per heart for the next steps and leave at RT:\nA 30 mm petri dish with 1 mL of Perfusion buffer with enzymes.\nA 50 mL tube with 2 mL of Perfusion buffer with enzymes.",
    "When digestion is complete (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H and 1I), hold the prepared 30 mm petri dish with buffer below the heart. Remove hypodermic needle from the heart. Indicating a well-digested heart, the tissue will appear soft. Ensuring the heart is held over the petri-dish (present at RT, prepared step – 18b.i), using the curved scissors, cut between the atria and the ventricles to collect the cardiac ventricles in the petri dish.\nRepeat for remaining hearts.\nAt ambient temperature, gently pull apart the tissue within each petri dish using forceps to release the cells and break up the tissue so that it may be aspirated by a 3 mL Pasteur pipette. If heart appears incompletely digested, refer to the troubleshooting section, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nUsing a 3 mL sterile Pasteur pipette, transfer the suspension into the 50 mL tube with RT Perfusion buffer and triturate gently 10 times using the same pipette.\nPlace 50 mL tube in the 37°C water bath with caps loosely tightened for 5 min, and afterward pipette mix as aforementioned using a Pasteur pipette 15 times.\nNote: If the objective of this protocol is to proceed with cell culture of cardiomyocytes, please follow alternative steps 31–37 “Alternative steps when isolating myocytes for cell culture” (instead of steps 24–30, which are primarily for isolation of non-myocytes). The alternative steps prevent the exposure of cardiomyocytes to low temperatures and help preserve their physiological characteristics. The key differences of the alternative steps are the temperatures at which cells are maintained. If downstream processing of cardiomyocytes requires preservation of nucleic acids, protein and other elements that are labile at RT, then we recommend steps 24–30. We routinely use the steps at lower temperature for isolation of cardiomyocyte nuclei for RNA sequencing.",
    "Place the 50 mL tube back in the 37°C water bath and incubate for another 5 min. During the incubation period, aliquot 5 mL of cold Stop buffer to a fresh 50 mL tube per heart and place on ice.\nAfter incubation, gently pipette-mix the cardiac cell suspension using a Pasteur pipette for another 15 times.\nFilter the cell suspension through 177 μm nylon mesh into the pre-prepared 50 mL tube containing Stop buffer and leave on ice, undisturbed, for 10 min.\nSeparation of myocytes from non-myocytes\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nNote: In this final step of the protocol, non-myocytes are separated from myocytes and prepared for down-stream applications.\nCentrifuge the cell suspensions at 50×g for 2 min at 4°C (with centrifuge breaks activated).\nPrepare 15 mL tubes with 7 mL of cold wash buffer per heart and place on ice.\nAfter centrifugation place tubes on ice. A loose pellet (primarily cardiomyocytes) and cloudy supernatant (primarily non-myocytes) will be present.\nSupernatant – non-myocytes:\nTransfer all but approximately 1 mL of supernatant to the 15 mL tubes (step 28) through 70 μm nylon mesh into the wash buffer and place on ice. Retain 50 mL tube for processing cardiomyocytes (step 29b, below).\nTop-up the volume of non-myocyte enriched samples to 15 mL with cold wash buffer and subsequently centrifuge at 200×g for 15 min at 4°C, with centrifuge breaks deactivated.\nRemove the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet (containing non-myocytes) in a desired buffer depending on subsequent application.\nPellet – Cardiomyocytes:\nAdd 5 mL of cold Stop buffer to the cardiomyocyte pellet in the 50 mL tube (after removing supernatant) and gently re-suspend the pellet.\nSpin down cardiomyocytes an additional time at 50×g for 2 min at 4°C (with centrifuge breaks activated).\nAspirate supernatant and re-suspend pellet in desired buffer.",
    "Note: Steps i and ii of step 29b may be repeated to decrease presence of non-myocytes\nUse isolated myocytes or non-myocytes in desired application.\nAlternative steps when isolating myocytes for cell culture\nFollow steps 31–37 when preparing cardiomyocytes for cell culture to minimize stress cardiomyocytes may experience due to rapid changes in temperature and preserve their physiological characteristics. Note, the non-myocyte fraction is preserved either way.\nPlace the 50 mL tube back in the 37°C water bath and incubate for another 5 min. During the incubation period, aliquot 5 mL of RT Stop buffer to a fresh 50 mL tube per heart and leave at RT\nAfter incubation, gently pipette-mix the cardiac cell suspension using a Pasteur pipette another 15 times.\nFilter the cell suspension through 177 μm nylon mesh into the pre-prepared 50 mL tube containing Stop buffer and at RT, undisturbed, for 10 min.\nSeparation of myocytes from non-myocytes (for cell culture)\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nNote: In this final step of the protocol, non-myocytes are separated from myocytes and prepared for down-stream applications.\nCentrifuge the cell suspensions at 50×g for 2 min at RT (with centrifuge breaks activated).\nPrepare 15 mL tubes with 7 mL of cold wash buffer per heart and place on ice.\nAfter centrifugation place tubes on ice. A loose pellet (primarily cardiomyocytes) and cloudy supernatant (primarily non-myocytes) will be present.\nSupernatant – non-myocytes:\nTransfer all but approximately 1 mL of supernatant to the 15 mL tubes (step 35) through 70 μm nylon mesh into the wash buffer and place on ice. Retain 50 mL tube for processing cardiomyocytes (step 36b, below).\nTop-up the volume of non-myocyte enriched samples to 15 mL with cold wash buffer and subsequently centrifuge at 200×g for 15 min at 4°C, with centrifuge breaks deactivated.",
    "Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet (containing non-myocytes) in a desired buffer depending on subsequent application.\nPellet – Cardiomyocytes:\nAdd 10 mL of RT Stop buffer to the cardiomyocyte pellet in the 50 mL tube (after removing supernatant) and gently re-suspend the pellet at RT\nSpin down cardiomyocytes an additional time at 20×g for 3 min at RT (with centrifuge breaks activated).\nAspirate supernatant and re-suspend in desired buffer.\nUse isolated myocytes or non-myocytes in desired application.\nOptional step: Preparation of myocytes for cell culture with Ca2+ reintroduction\nIf cardiomyocytes are to be used for applications such as cell culture, the following protocol is recommended to gradually restore physiological calcium levels prior to plating. The myocytes are sequentially incubated in Myocyte Wash Buffers containing increasing concentration of Ca2+ of 0.18, 0.45 and 1.08 mM (Myocyte Wash Buffer 1, 2 and 3, respectively) and are plated in Plating Media containing 1.26 mM Ca2+.\nNote: Cardiomyocytes are fragile. Avoid shocks/vibrations and pipette gently during cell resuspension steps. Further, handle tubes with care after centrifugation as the cardiomyocytes are loosely pelleted.\nAt step 36(b)iii, resuspend cardiomyocytes in 10 mL Myocyte Wash Buffer 1. Transfer cell suspension to a 70 mL specimen jar (to reduce cell clumping and to avoid ischemia) and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nPost incubation, transfer cells to a 14 mL round-bottomed tube and centrifuge at 20×g for 3 min at RT\nAspirate supernatant, leaving a small volume, ∼(50–100 μL) so as not to disturb the pellet, and resuspend cardiomyocytes in 8 mL Myocyte Wash Buffer 2, transfer to a 70 mL specimen jar and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nTransfer cells to a 14 mL round-bottomed tube and centrifuge at 20×g for 3 min at RT",
    "Aspirate supernatant, leaving a small volume (∼50–100 μL) so as not to disturb the pellet, and resuspend cardiomyocytes in 10 mL Myocyte Wash Buffer 3, transfer to a 70 mL specimen jar and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nTransfer cells to a 14 mL round-bottomed tube and centrifuge at 20×g for 3 min at RT\nAspirate supernatant and gently resuspend cardiomyocytes in desired volume of Plating media (e.g., 5 mL for a 60 mm tissue culture dish).\nImmediately aspirate laminin from cell culture plates, wash with sterile PBS without Ca2+ Mg2+ and gently add cardiomyocytes in Plating Media to dish.\nIncubate plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h to allow cells to adhere.\nAfter 1 h, replace Plating Media with Maintenance Media and incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for an additional 1.5–2 h prior to performing any treatments (e.g., stimulation with agonists for signaling studies)."
