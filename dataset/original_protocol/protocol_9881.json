    "NOTE: The following are the steps for screening drug-recognizing T7 phages using a QCM biosensor and recovering the screened phages via E. coli (BLT5615) infection. The protocols for the synthesis of a derivative of a small molecule that forms a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and for the construction of the T7 phage-displayed 15-mer random peptide library can be found elsewhere6,7.\n1. Preparation of the QCM sensor chip\nAttach a ceramic sensor chip on the oscillator of a 27-MHz QCM apparatus, and record the intrinsic frequency (Hz) in the air phase before small molecule immobilization.\nDetach the chip and drop 20 μL of a solution (1 mM in 70% ethanol) of a small molecule derivative that forms SAM onto the gold electrode of the sensor chip using a pipette.\n\tCAUTION: The sensor chip crystal where the gold electrode (Au, 0.1 mm thick, 2.5 mm i.d., 4.9 mm2) is located is extremely thin and may crack easily (SiO2, 0.06 mm thick, 9 mm i.d.). Hence, pipette carefully.\nLeave for 1 h at room temperature (around 20 °C) in a Petri dish with moistened tissue and shielded from room lights.\nWash the electrode surface gently with ultrapure water; then, remove the water drops by blowing air with a syringe or air duster.\nSet up the sensor chip for the QCM apparatus and record the reduction in frequency in the air phase to measure the amount of the small molecule that has been immobilized.\n\t​NOTE: At least, 100 Hz of intrinsic frequency is necessary for successful small molecule immobilization (1 Hz immobilizes 30 pg).\n2. Biopanning of the T7 phage library using a QCM biosensor (Figure 1)",
    "Set a cuvette with a dedicated magnetic stirrer on the QCM biosensor and pour 8 mL of the reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7-8) into the cuvette.\nAttach the QCM sensor chip to the oscillator and pull down the arm of oscillator to immerse the chip into the buffer being stirred at 1000 rpm.\nStart monitoring the QCM frequency on the personal computer (PC) and wait until the sensorgram equilibrates to around 3 Hz/min of the frequency drift.\nInject 8 μL of a T7 phage library (1—2 × 1010 pfu/mL) into the cuvette (final concentration: 1—2 × 107 pfu/mL) and mark the injection point on the sensor.\nMonitor the frequency reduction caused by the binding of T7 phages to the small molecule immobilized on the gold electrode surface for 10 min.\nStop the QCM frequency monitor, dislodge the sensor chip from the oscillator, and remove the buffer by blowing air and/or wicking away with wipes.\nPut the sensor chip into a humid Petri dish and drop the 20 μL of the suspension of E. coli (BLT5615) (OD600 = 0.5—1.0 after shaking at 37 °C by adding IPTG to 1 mM) host cells in the log phase onto the gold electrode.\nClose the lid of the dish and cover it with aluminum foil to block out light.\nIncubate the dish at 37 °C for 30 min on a 96-well microplate mixer (1000-1500 rpm) for enhancing the recovery of the bound T7 phages.\nRecover the 20 μL of the solution and suspend it into 200 μL of LB medium.\n\tNOTE: The samples obtained in this step can be preserved at 4 °C by one week.",
    "Prepare a dilution series of the phage solution for plaque isolation and DNA sequencing according to the general procedure described in the manufacturer's instructions8,9.\nWipe the gold electrode surface with a cotton swab soaked with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution.\nWash the gold surface with ultrapure water from the washing bottle and then remove water drops by blowing air with a syringe or air duster.\nDrop 5 μL of piranha solution (Conc. H2SO4: 30% H2O2 = 3:1) on the gold surface and leave for 5 min.\nWash the gold surface again with water and then dry by blowing air and/or wicking away with wipes.\nRepeat steps 2.14 and 2.15.\n\tCAUTION: Prepare the piranha solution immediately prior to use. Use this liquid carefully, as it is a very strong acid. Treatment for longer than 5 min erodes the sensor chip.\n3. Bioinformatics analysis using Receptor Ligand Contact (RELIC) program suite (Figure 2)10,11\nUnzip the stand-alone RELIC program on a PC with an MS Windows operating system.\nAlign the amino acid sequences of the 15-mer peptides affinity-selected using the drug or randomly selected from unscreened parent library in each text format file (name.txt).\nType the amino acid sequence of single or multiple protein(s) in each text file with FASTA format, or download the database text files in FASTA format from any protein database (e.g. UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/) or DrugBank (https://www.drugbank.ca/).\nPlace the text files (and PDB files for HETEROalign) in the folder necessary for running each RELIC program.\nClick the executable file (program.exe) for AADIV, INFO, MOTIF, MATCH, HETEROalign, FASTAcon, and FASTAskan in the independent folder to open the Personal Version of FTN95.\nType the appropriate filename, along with the extension (name.txt), in the command message to execute each program and obtain the required text format file.",
    "Export the resulting text file to a spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel) to generate a plot of information content (INFO) or cumulative similarity scores calculated using a BLOSUM62 (MATCH, HETEROalign).\n\tNOTE: The original RELIC server (http://relic.bio.anl.gov) is no longer available and some stand-alone type RELIC programs that work on PCs with a Windows platform can be obtained from the corresponding author (tkksg@rs.noda.tus.ac.jp)."
