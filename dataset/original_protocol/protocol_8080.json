    "1. Plant Material and Growth Conditions\nSeed one tobacco (cultivar Samsun) seed per 5 cm x 5 cm pot filled with standard pot medium. Place the pots on trays. Grow the plants in a growth room under long day conditions (16/8 h light/dark) at a constant temperature of 23 °C. Irrigate with tap water until water drains from the pot.\nAfter 50±5 days, start Fe treatments in the irrigation, according to the concentrations suitable for the experiment. For example, we used a range of iron concentrations from 0 to 6 mM, supplemented by a soluble Fe chelator (Fe EDDHA). Irrigate the plants with the appropriate solution every two days (to avoid dehydration) for 6-8 days.\n2. Preparing the Leaves for Iron Measurement\nNotes: All materials to be used must be iron-free so as to reduce the risk of iron contamination. Clean the mortar and pestle twice with 4% HCl solution and dry with filter paper each time before use. If any material is reused, clean it twice with 4% HCl solution and dry with filter paper.\nDetach the leaves from the stem by hand, using gloves (do not use any metal equipment). Use about 10 g of leaves (fresh weight) for each sample. Clean each leaf with double distilled water (DDW) using a spray bottle. This step is important to avoid Fe contamination.\nDry the leaves on a paper towel and put them in a paper bag. Transfer the paper bags to an oven at a constant temperature of 80 °C for 2-3 days.\nWhen dry, crush the leaves to powder using a mortar and pestle and transfer to sterile 15 mL plastic tubes.\n3. Burning the Leaves to Ash",
    "Notes: The use of a low pH (close to 0) solution of HCl is meant to increase iron solubility. The rock wool is used to prevent the gases from escaping the vial during burning.\nWeigh a new, sealed 20 mL scintillation vial without its lid. Note the value or set the value to zero using the tare button. Add the crushed dried leaves (sample) to the vial.\nWeigh the sample and container and note the value. Close the vial with rock wool.\nWeigh 3 additional vials without adding samples and note their values. These vials will be used as controls to evaluate the amount of rock wool that could have led to any increase in sample weight.\nPlace the sample and control vials in a furnace and start burning using the following temperature steps: room temperature, fast increase to 425 °C, and, finally, 425°C for 4 hours. By this time, the dry leaves will have turned to ash.\nLet the samples cool down to about 100 °C but not below this temperature for the following two steps to avoid humidity, which could affect the final weight of the sample. Using heavy gloves, remove the samples from the furnace with tweezers, holding the vial exteriorly.\nPlace the vials on a flat surface, remove the rock wool and close the vials with their original lids.\nWeigh the 3 control vials (see 3.3) and calculate their average weight gain. If weight gain is equal or above to 1% of the ash weight (see step 4.2), use this value as an estimate of the measurement error.\n4. Preparing the Ashes for Iron Measurement\nNotes: The final iron concentration in the initial sample is calculated as the weight of the ashes divided by the added volume of HCl.",
    "Prepare a 1 M HCl solution (4% HCl) by adding 12.5 mL of a 37% HCl stock solution to 87.5 mL of DDW (in a plastic or glass flask).\nWeigh a 15 mL plastic tube and note the value or set the value to zero using the tare button. Transfer the ashes to the tube, weigh, and note the value. This is the ash weight.\nAdd 5 mL of 1 M HCl to the ashes. Filter the ashes through a 22 µm filter and add an additional 5 mL of 1 M HCl through the same filter.\nThe final volume should be 10 mL. Note that part of the solution will be lost in the filter.\n\tNOTE: The samples are now ready for Fe measurement either by FAAS or by the Prussian Blue method.\nMake a calibration curve with the Fe concentration measured by atomic spectrometry and by the Prussian blue method (see Figure 4) for each plant species. Subsequently, Fe concentration can be measured by the Prussian blue method alone.\n5. Measuring Fe Concentration by FAAS\nRemove 4 mL from each sample for measurement by FAAS.\nDivide the results obtained from the FAAS measurement by the weight of the ashes. Divide the resulting value by 0.01 (because the ashes were solubilized in 10 mL). The resulting value is the iron concentration per gram ash (ppm).\n6. Preparing the Prussian Blue Staining Solution\nPrepare a 4% Prussian blue solution by adding 4 g of K4Fe(CN)6 to 100 mL DDW and vortex (other volumes and/or concentrations can be used for different demands). It should be noted that in this study, a less concentrated Prussian blue solution than previously reported (20%)14 was used.",
    "Keep the solution in the dark at 4 °C until use. The solution is stable for 6 months when stored at such conditions.\n7. Generating a Calibration Curve for the Prussian Blue Method Using FAAS Results\nNOTE: Calculate the iron concentration in the ashes using the following formula\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57408/57408eq1.jpg             Equation 1\nC: concentration, V: sample volume, W: ash weight (g).\nMix 0.50 mL of Prussian blue solution and 0.50 mL of 1 M HCl. This will serve as the blank solution.\nMix 0.5 mL of sample (ashes in 4% HCl, as described in section 3) and 0.5 mL of Prussian blue solution (step 6.1) by pipetting. Wait at least 1 minute but not more than 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, sedimentation in the samples will occur.\nTransfer the mix to a cuvette and measure the OD at 715 nm using a spectrophotometer. Note the value.\nDivide the OD value (step 7.3) by the ash weight (step 3.2) of the sample. The result represents OD per gram ash.\nPlot the linear regression between the iron concentrations obtained from the FAAS measurements (Y axis) and the OD values (X axis). Use the results obtained in steps 5.2 and 7.4. Calculate the regression formula, Y = a + bX, where Y represents iron concentration, a represents the absorbance intersect, b represents the absorbance slope and X represents the OD.\n8. Using the Prussian Blue Method for Determining Iron Levels in Other Samples from the Same Plant Type\nNotes: Since a calibration curve has already been established for this type of plant, iron concentration in any new samples from the same plant type can be directly calculated using the linear regression formula.\nPerform the steps in sections 3 and 4, followed by steps 7.1 to 7.4.",
