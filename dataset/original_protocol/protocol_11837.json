    "In this protocol, male C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from the Institute of Laboratory Animals of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.\n1. Monocular deprivation (MD) at postnatal day 28 in mice\nPut the surgical tools, the suture needle (0.25 mm diameter, string diameter 0.07 mm) and cotton swabs in an aluminum box and autoclave them at 120 °C for 0.5 h. Sterilize the hood with 75% ethanol. Dry the surgical tools in a drying oven.\nPrepare a 2% agarose solution, put it in a water bath at 75 °C to avoid solidifying.\nUse isoflurane mixed with oxygen to anesthetize the mouse (2% induction and 1.2–1.5% maintenance). Fix the mouse on the stereotaxic apparatus and use a heat regulating device to maintain the mouse body temperature at 37 °C and prevent hypothermia.\nApply a thin layer of petroleum-based eye ointment to both eyes.\nUnder the anatomical microscope with illumination, suture the eyelid on one eye. Make the needle pass though both sides of the eyelid 2x (Figure 1A) and make about four stitches.\nKnot the thread 2–3x and then trim the thread. Apply 3 μL of instant drying glue on the knot to increase its stability. Then cut the extra suturing thread.\nProvide an intraperitoneal injection of buprenorphine (1 mg/kg) to the mouse.\nTransfer the mouse onto a heating pad to maintain its body temperature at 37 °C and prevent hypothermia and monitor it until it regains consciousness.\nWhen the mouse is fully awake place it into a separate holding cage.\nCheck the eyelids daily to ensure that they remain shut and uninfected. Exclude the mouse if an eyelid opening is found.",
    "Before electrophysiological recording, use isoflurane mixed with oxygen to anesthetize the mouse (2% induction and 1.2–1.5% maintenance).\nRemove the stitches with eye scissors to expose the eyeball. Carefully trim the eye lids.\nFlush the eye with lens solution and check the eye under a microscope for clarity. Exclude mice with corneal opacities or signs of infection.\n2. Craniotomy in the mouse V1 binocular region after monocular deprivation on the 4th day\nAfter anesthetizing the mouse, check for the depth of anesthesia by the lack of response to a toe pinch.\nPlace and fix the mouse on the stereotaxic apparatus. Adjust the height of the ear bar and tooth rod to keep the brain flat and stable.\nUse a heating pad to maintain the body temperature.\nApply a petroleum-based eye ointment on the surface of the eyes to keep them moist.\nRemove the hair on the mouse's head to expose its skin. Rub the skin with alternating scrubs of iodine and 70% ethanol 3x.\nIncise an 8 x 8 mm area of the skin between the ears to expose the skull and remove the scalp tissue. Then remove the overlying connective tissue with 30% hydrogen peroxide.\nDrill a 1 x 1 mm hole in the skull above the cerebellum. Affix a small bone screw in the hole as a reference.\nPerform a small craniotomy of 1 mm in diameter in the V1 binocular region from the contralateral hemisphere to the deprived eye (Figure 1B, A-P: lambda -0.51–lambda +1.67 mm; M-L: -2.6– -3.0 mm; D-V: 0–1 mm). Carefully remove the skull fragment without hurting the brain.\nCover the exposed cortical surface with 75 μL of 2% agarose at 40 °C to prevent drying.",
    "Fix a tungsten electrode on the stereotaxic frame. Place the tungsten electrode vertically on the surface of the exposed cortex, the binocular region of V1, to make sure that the cells that are recorded react to both eyes.\nUse cotton swabs to remove the eye gel and apply silicon oil to the eye every 2 h.\n3. Visual stimulation and electrophysiological recording\nMask the one eye with nontransparent plastic plate. Position an LCD monitor 23 cm from the mouse's eye.\nReduce the anesthesia to 0.5–0.8% when the mouse is fully anesthetized.\nAdvance the microelectrode electrode slowly with an oil hydraulic micromanipulator. Stop it when a high signal-to-noise ratio is observed and the electrode is advanced to layer 4 (Figure 1C, approximately 250–450 μm in depth). Ensure that the amplification factor is set at 1,000, the filter at 300–100 Hz, and the sample rate at 40 Hz.\nPresent a full-field moving sinusoidal grating (Figure 1D, 12 directions, 100% contrast, 2 Hz of temporary frequency, 0.04 cycles per degree of spatial frequency) on the LED monitor.\nMeasure the cell's response by stimulating the ipsilateral and contralateral eye separately. Present 3–5x total.\nMeasure the responses of five to eight cells in each penetration. Perform four to six penetrations in each mouse.\nAfter the recording, adjust the isoflurane flow rate to 5% or greater, continue isoflurane exposure for 1 min, and then perform the cervical dislocation.\n\tNOTE: Separate penetrations were spaced at least 200 μm apart in the V1 binocular zone.\n4. Off-line spike sorting and data analysis\nDetect spikes when the raw signal crosses a threshold level. Align captured spikes on the first positive or negative peak. Use software to detect spikes from different cells.",
    "Set two cursors: one for positive and the other for negative deflection. Set the spike template (Figure 2A). Set the template area to that with the most significant variation between different classes of spikes.\nUse principal component analysis to separate them into clusters. Clustering methods can vary between different laboratories.\nClassify the spike of a boundary by using the K-means algorithm.\nCorrelate the orientation with the spike firing rate and plot the orientation tuning curves for the ipsilateral and contralateral eye.\nCalculate the OD index for the single unit, which represents the contralateral/ipsilateral response strength ratio:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60600/60600eq1a.jpg\n\twhere Rcontra and Ripsi are the cell's optimal response for the contralateral and ipsilateral eye, respectively, and Rspon is the cell's spontaneous activity.\nAssign OD scores to 1–7 as follows: − 1 to −0.75 = 1; −0.75 to −0.45 = 2; −0.45 to −0.15 = 3; −0.15 to 0.15 = 4; 0.15 to 0.45 = 5; 0.45 to 0.75 = 6; and 0.75 to 1 = 7.\nCalculate the contralateral bias index (CBI):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60600/60600eq2a.jpg\n\twhere N is the cell number, and nx equals the cell number with OD scores equal to x.\nSubscription Required.
