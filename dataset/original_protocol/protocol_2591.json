    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe whole protocol must be performed within 10 days to ensure the best staining. The fluorescence should be detectable at least for a month, but it loses intensity over time because dextran dyes degrade.\nBack labeling of motoneurons\nTiming: 16–24 h (for step 1)\nThis section describes how to retrogradely label motoneurons by injecting dextran dyes into zebrafish muscles.\nPrepare the injection pin.\nPlace some crystals (approx. 0.1 mg) of the fluorescent dextran dye on a clean glass slide.\nAdd 2 μL of distilled water to the dye, mix well and then let the mix dry for some minutes.\nDip the tungsten pin when the dye mix has the consistency of a paste. Avoid letting the mix desiccate and add some microliters of water if needed.\nPrepare the fish (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPrepare the anesthetic solution by diluting the MS-222 stock solution to a final concentration of 0.03% in fish tank water.\nPlace the fish in the anesthetic solution for about 30–60 s until deep anesthesia is reached.\nNote: In zebrafish, deep anesthesia is characterized by a lack of movement, few or no opercular movement, and a lack of response to a soft touch.\nPlace the fish laterally on a wet paper tissue under a stereo microscope.\nSecure the fish position by covering the head and the tail with similar paper tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Preparation of zebrafish for dextran injection, related to step 2\nInject the dye in selective muscle fibers (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nDry the surface of the fish and scrape away a few scales using forceps to gain better access to the targeted muscle.",
    "Inject the dye-soaked pin in the target muscle fibers (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D). If needed, soak the pins in the dye multiple times and repeat the injection.\nLet the fish recover from anesthesia in fresh fish tank water.\nKeep the animal in a regular fish tank for at least 2 h or overnight (14–20 h) to allow for retrograde transport of the tracer.\nRepeat the steps 1–3 on the desired number of fish depending on the experimental design.\nCritical: Commonly used dyes are rhodamine-dextran 3,000 MW (Thermo Fisher) or Alexa Fluor 488-dextran 10,000 MW (Thermo Fisher). Dextran dyes are retrogradely transported from the severed axon to the cell soma and the speed of their transport is related to their MW. Both 3,000 and 10,000 MW dextrans reach the MN soma after less than 2 h.\nCritical: Make sure to carry out the back labeling procedure within 5–10 min, since prolonged anesthesia may be lethal for the animal. For this reason, it is recommended to carry out the injections on one fish at a time. To help the recovery, fish water can be kept at a temperature of 26°C–28°C.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Injection of dextran rhodamine in anesthetized zebrafish, related to step 3\nTissue fixation and spinal cord isolation\nTiming: 2 days (for step 5)\nThis section describes how to fix and isolate zebrafish spinal cord.\nTissue fixation.\nDeeply anesthetize all the injected fish with 0.1% MS-222 solution.\nNote: High MS-222 concentration will keep the fish under deep anesthesia during dissection.\nPlace the fish on a paper towel for a few seconds to remove the excess of water.",
    "Glue the fish laterally on a glass Petri dish using superglue. Cover the head and the tail with the glue and immediately submerge the fish in 1× PBS.\nUsing surgical tools, remove internal organs, the skin first and then the muscles to expose the vertebrae (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2250-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Spinal cord dissection\n(A–C) Sequential phases of the dissection of zebrafish spinal cord (ns: neural spine, hs: hemal spine, c: centrum).\n(D) Isolated spinal cord positioned laterally.\n(E) Glass slide prepared with a parafilm frame.\n(F) Example showing three spinal cords positioned on a glass slide.\nDiscard the 1× PBS and add 4% PFA in the dish and keep it at 4°C 2–24 h to allow for optimal fixation.\nSpinal cord isolation.\nDiscard the 4% PFA, rinse once with 1× PBS and fill the dish with 1× PBS.\nPerform the spinal cord isolation using forceps under a stereomicroscope.\nRemove the neural spines (ns) and vertebrae arches to facilitate the dissection (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nRemove the hemal spines (hs) and the centrum (c) to expose the spinal cord (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Once the vertebrae are removed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D), the spinal cord can be transferred to a multiwell plate filled with 1× PBS and stored at 4°C until further processing. It is recommended to perform the next steps within 48 h to avoid degradation of dextran dyes.\nTissue labeling and mounting\nTiming: 4–5 days (for step 7)\nThis section describes the tissue immunolabeling (optional) and the spinal cord mounting on microscope slides.\nOptional: Immunohistochemistry. Researchers can combine retrograde labeling of MNs with immunohistochemistry, which can be carried out in a multiwell plate (48-well for example) as follows.\nWash the tissue extensively with 1× PBS (3 × 15 min).\nBlock non-specific binding sites with blocking solution for 30 minutes at room temperature (18°C–25°C).",
    "Incubate in primary antibody mix at 4°C for the appropriate amount of time. Wash extensively with 1× PBS (3 × 15 min).\nNote: Primary antibody incubation is variable. Overnight (14–20 h) is enough for highly expressed proteins (like reporters), but a range of 36–96 h works better for endogenous proteins.\nIncubate with secondary antibody mix at 4°C overnight (14–20 h). Wash extensively with 1× PBS (3 × 15 min).\nNote: The secondary antibody incubation can be shortened to 2–6 h at room temperature (18°C–25°C); however, this is not recommended.\nTissue mounting.\nCut a piece of parafilm to fit the microscope glass slide and cut out the middle of the parafilm where the spinal cord will be placed.\nPress the parafilm on the slide and warm it up gently on a heating plate to avoid that it detaches from the glass.\nNote: The parafilm frame on the glass slide is necessary to preserve the spinal cord shape and avoid compression of the tissue.\nLet the slide cool down before placing the spinal cord (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nPosition gently the spinal cord in the desired orientation on the slide using forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nAdd non-hardening mounting media. Coverslip the sample.\nNote: While most microscope mounting media are suitable, hardening media are not recommended because they will alter the shape of the tissue.\nConfocal microscopy\nTiming: 1–4 h (for step 9)\nThis section describe the image acquisition process at the confocal microscope.\nAcquisition of confocal images.\nPrepare the Zeiss LSM980-Airy2 confocal microscope equipped with a 20× (NA 1.1) objective.\nFocus on the spinal cord using the fluorescence or the bright field.\nMove to the acquisition mode and set up the desired channels.",
    "Acquire the part of the spinal cord where MNs were back labeled. If the protocol has been successful, images as those shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A should be obtained.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2250-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
