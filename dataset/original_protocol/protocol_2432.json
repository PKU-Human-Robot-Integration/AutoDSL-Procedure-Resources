    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe desensitization protocols consist in adding sequentially increasing doses of the allergen to eventually induce MC unresponsiveness to the given allergen. Clinically, a successful AIT protects allergic individuals from developing clinical symptoms upon allergen exposure. In vitro, it is observed a lack, or reduction, of MC activation/degranulation when challenging desensitized-MCs with a single-dose of allergen.\nBMMC desensitization step-by-step\nBMMC overnight sensitization with PN-allergic mice sera\nTiming: 30 min + 16 h\nThis part of the protocol allows PN-sIgEs, from sera of PN-allergic mice, to bind to the FcεRI expressed on the cell surface of MCs.\nBMMCs should be collected from a 100 mm × 20 mm cell culture dish into a Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 486 g modifying the default acceleration/deceleration settings to a medium acceleration (e.g., level 7 of 9) and low brake (e.g., level 3 of 9) for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: Low brake to avoid unspecific cell activation.\nDiscard supernatant.\nSuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of IMDM culture media.\nPerform cell counting and assess cell viability.\nNote: When using trypan blue testing, cell viability should be > 85%.\nPolyclonal sensitization is done at a cell density of 0.5–1 × 106 cells/mL, and 0.1 × 106 BMMCs per condition.\nIn a Falcon tube, suspend BMMCs in a total volume of complete IMDM to reach the adequate sensitization cellularity.\nAdd the murine polyclonal IgE sera at a concentration range of 1–10 ng/mL.\nSeed the cells in a 6- or 24-well cell culture plate, depending on the final volume obtained.\nNote: In this case, the desensitization protocol is optimized with a pool of sera from PN-allergic mice.",
    "Critical: To decrease variability between experiments, PN-sIgE levels (or at least total IgE levels) should be characterized before sensitizing BMMCs. In our settings, we measured PN-sIgE levels with an ELISA (Jimenez-Saiz et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), but other techniques can be employed. In this case, BMMCs were sensitized with a concentration range of 1–10 ng/mL PN-sIgEs (in our conditions, sera dilutions were made from 1:50 to 1:100) where BMMCs showed a robust activation upon a single-dose PN challenge.\nLeave BMMCs approximately 16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nBMMC desensitization\nTiming: 80–100 min\nThe desensitization is a sensitive part of the protocol. It needs accuracy in making the correct allergen dilutions to avoid activation during the procedure.\nCollect sensitized BMMCs and spin cells at 486 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C and discard supernatant.\nNote: It is important to perform this wash before starting the desensitization protocol to discard free IgE and other Igs contained in the sera that could interfere with the protocol.\nSuspend pelleted BMMCs in supplemented IMDM desensitization media to get a cellularity of 1.22 × 106 cells/mL.\nNote: To prevent unspecific activation during desensitization, cytokines should not be added to the culture media.\nCritical: The BMMC desensitization protocol is optimized for 100,000 cells in a final volume of 100 μL. In every step of the desensitization protocol 2 μL are added; the protocol includes 9 steps, so by the end of the protocol, a total volume of 18 μL is added. To maintain the final volume at 100 μL, 0.1 × 106 BMMC should be seeded in 82 μL (100 μL–18 μL = 82 μL).\nSeed 0.1 × 106 BMMCs in 82 μL in a U/V-bottom 96 well pate.",
    "Carry out the desensitization protocol adding 2 μL of PN solution at the corresponding concentration every 10 min (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nTable 1. Peanut (PN) in vitro desensitization (DS) protocol for bone-marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2067-Fx4.jpg\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]: if the concentration increase between steps is too high, MCs can be activated during the desensitization protocol. This situation can be solved attenuating the escalation between concentrations. In other words, adding more steps to the final desensitization protocol.\nLAD2 desensitization step-by-step\nLAD2 overnight sensitization with hIgE and sera from PN-allergic donors\nTiming: 30 min + 16 h\nAfter 5 days, spin cells at 486 g at maximal acceleration and low brake (e.g., level 3 of 9), for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard supernatant.\nSuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of StemPro-34 culture media and r-hIL4 at 10 ng/mL.\nPerform cell counting and assess cell viability.\nNote: Viability should be > 85%.\nPolyclonal sensitization is done at a cell density of 0.5 × 106 cells/mL, and 0.05 × 106 cells per condition:\nIn a Falcon tube, suspend LAD2 cells in supplemented StemPro-34 + r-hIL4 at 10 ng/mL to reach the adequate sensitization cellularity.\nAdd the specific volume of polyclonal sIgEs.\nFor hIgE, sensitize LAD2 cells with 100 ng/mL of hIgE.\nFor PN-allergic human sera, sensitize cells with the chosen concentration of PN-allergic donor sera.\nNote: The total number or LAD2 cells chosen for sensitizing will depend on the number of experimental conditions included in your experiment. For example, if you want to test LAD2 cells degranulation levels upon 10 increasing single-dose allergen challenges, you will need, at least 50,000 cells (the protocol is optimized for 50,000 cells) × 10 conditions = 0.5 × 106 cells will be required.\nSeed the cells in a 6- or 24-well plate depending on the final volume obtained.",
    "Critical: PN-sIgE levels may differ between allergic donors. To obtain reproducible results among experiments, it is highly recommended to test degranulation of LAD2 cells (by flow cytometry or β-hexosaminidase activity) sensitized with different PN-sIgE sera dilutions and to evaluate total PN-sIgE levels (kUA/mL). For optimizing this protocol, we have used two different donor sera diluted to a concentration of approximately 10 kUA/mL, which induced a maximal LAD2 degranulating response of 40%.\nLeave LAD2 cells 16 h approximately at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nLAD2 desensitization\nTiming: 80–100 min\nCollect sensitized LAD2 cells and spin at 486 g with maximal acceleration and low brake (e.g., level 3 of 9) for 5 min at 20°C–25°C. Discard supernatant.\nNote: it is important to perform this wash before starting the desensitization protocol to eliminate free IgE and other Igs present in the sera from PN-allergic donors.\nSuspend cells in supplemented StemPro-34 media.\nFor hIgE protocol, LAD2 cellularity is approximately 0.58 × 106 cells/mL.\nFor PN protocol, LAD2 cellularity is approximately 0.61 × 106 cells/mL.\nSeed 0.05 × 106 LAD2 cells in each well of a U/V-bottom 96 well pate in 86 μL or 82 μL, depending on the desensitization protocol performed.\nCritical: The LAD2 desensitization protocol is optimized for 50,000 cells in a final volume of 100 μL. The protocol has a different number of steps whether we are performing hIgE or PN protocol.\nCritical: The hIgE desensitization protocol entails 7 steps. In every step of the desensitization protocol 2 μL are added, so by the end of the protocol a total volume of 14 μL is added. To keep the final volume of 100 μL, 50,000 LAD2 should be seeded in 86 μL (100 μL–14 μL = 86 μL).",
    "Critical: The PN desensitization protocol has 9 steps. In every step of the desensitization protocol 2 μL are added, so by the end of the protocol a total volume of 18 μL is added.
