The macroscopic view of cell pellet in different conditions\n(A–E) The cell state in collection (A), NETN lysis (B), TurboNuclease digestion (C), Streptavidin agarose enrichment (D), and S-bead enrichment (E) are shown in Eppendorf tubes.\nNote: All the following steps are performed using 1 × 108 cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nLyse the cells in 5 mL of lysis buffer (NETN with aprotinin and pepstatin A) for 30 min on shaker in a cold room.\nNote: The lysis volume depends on how many cells you collect (normally 10 times the pellet volume).\nCritical: Please ensure that cells are lysed completely (clearly visible DNA precipitation but no gel-like solution) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: In this step, cells are collected using mechanical forces, such as with tips or cell scrapers, rather than trypsin digestion since residual trypsin may disturb the native protein complexes, resulting in the loss of interactions.\nPause point: If suspension is required, we recommend freezing the collected cells at −80°C rather than freezing the lysates to reduce protein loss.\nSpin down the 15 mL tubes at 2,500 ×g and 4°C for 20 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to fresh tubes (1), and add 1.5 mL of TurboNuclease buffer containing 2.5 μL of TurboNuclease to the pellets.\nHeat in a 37°C water bath and vortex for 10 s every 5 min till the solution turn white (this usually takes 30–40 min).\nSpin down the tubes at 2,500 ×g and 4°C for 20 min and collect the supernatant (2).\nCritical: Please ensure that the chromatin is interrupted and the precipitate is milky white (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Combine (1) and (2) and spin down at 2,500 ×g and 4°C for an additional 20 min.\nCritical: During all steps except TurboNuclease treatment, samples should be kept on ice or in a cold room (i.e., 4°C). Proteinase inhibitors should be added to the solutions to prevent protein degradation.\nNote: Combination of two supernatants is not necessary for studying chromatin or soluble protein interactions, separating these two parts for subsequent TAP.\nTandem affinity purification\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis step describes how the purification is accomplished using streptavidin-sepharose (also called SBP beads) and S beads.\nAdd streptavidin-sepharose to the combined solution (total 150 μL beads, depending upon how well your protein is expressed and how many plates are used). Incubate on a shaker in a cold room for 1 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCritical: Use scissors to remove the ends of tips to allow better pipetting of agarose beads.\nSpin down at 2,500 ×g and 4°C for 1 min and aspirate the buffer out of the tube without disturbing the beads.\nResuspend the beads in 0.8 mL of lysis buffer and transfer them into an Eppendorf tube.\nWash out the tube with 0.5 mL of lysis buffer, and transfer the buffer into the previous Eppendorf tube to recover the remaining beads.\nSpin and aspirate the supernatant.\nNote: The transfer of beads to a new tube prevents contamination by any proteins that may precipitate on the sidewall of the previous tube during incubation.\nWash beads twice with 1 mL of lysis buffer by centrifuging the Eppendorf tube at 1,500 ×g and 4°C for 1 min.\nRemove all remaining trapped lysis buffer by pipetting using a thin gel-loading tip firmly pressed to the bottom of the tube.",
    "Elute bound proteins with 0.9 mL of lysis buffer containing 2 mg/mL biotin with proteinase inhibitors.\nRotate the tube in a cold room for 30 min. Spin briefly to pellet the beads, and carefully transfer the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube without disturbing the beads.\nRepeat the elution step using 0.5 mL of lysis buffer containing biotin for another 30 min. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCritical: Prepare fresh biotin solution. Warm the solution at 37°C in a water bath to ensure that the biotin is dissolved, and then place it on ice.\nCombine both eluates. Spin at maximum speed, and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\nNote: Ensure that there are no streptavidin-sepharose beads remaining in the 2nd purification.\nAdd 30 μL of S beads to the eluates. Rotate the tube in a cold room for 1 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nSpin down the S beads at 1,500 ×g for 1 min, aspirate the supernatant, and wash the S beads 2–3 times with lysis buffer (1 mL each time).\nAdd 35 μL 2× SDS sample buffer to the S beads, briefly vortex the tube, and boil for 15 min.\nCritical: As a control, run the 1st elution and 5 μL of the final elution on a gel and perform Coomassie blue staining to ensure that the procedure worked. At the same time, collect the different control samples, and perform western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody to approximate the efficiency of elution and binding. If the purification fails, this check can be used to identify the step that it failed at.",
    "Note: Once you have performed this protocol a few times, you do not need to check by western blotting each time. Instead, run all of the control samples on a gel, and perform Coomassie blue staining for analysis. There should be a difference in band pattern between the eluate from streptavidin beads and that from S beads.\nSubject the protein sample to SDS–PAGE until it runs into the separation gel for a short distance (i.e., 1 cm). Stain the gel with clean Coomassie blue solution for 3–10 min. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: SDS–PAGE is performed until the dye runs less than 1 cm into the separation gel. The time of Coomassie blue staining is carefully controlled, and staining is not performed for more than 15 min.\nIn gel digestion\nTiming: 16–20 h\nDuring this step, the purified protein is digested by trypsin in gel and extracted for mass spectrometry detection.\nDestain the gel with Destain I solution for 30 min and repeat this step for several times (Figure 3A[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCut the gel band into two pieces from top to bottom and transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube for further complete destaining using Destain II solution. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nIncubate the gel pieces in water for 1 h twice.\nOptional: Reduction and Alkylation: Dehydrate the gel pieces with 100% acetonitrile (ACN) for 5 min. Soak the gel pieces with 50 μL of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) at 55°C for 45 min. Then alkylate the gel pieces with 50 μL of 100 mM iodoacetamide in 10 mM ABC at 25°C for 30 min in the dark. (The reduction and alkylation steps facilitate peptide identification, especially Cysteine-containing peptides. However, the reaction incompletion and side reactions may compromise the experimental results.).",
    "Dehydrate the gel pieces with 75% ACN for 1 h. Change the pH of the gel to basic pH with 50 mM ABC for 30 min twice. Remove the ABC solution and add 300 ng of trypsin (200 ng/μL, 1.5 μL) in 30 μL of 50 mM ABC solution to each tube, grind mildly, and incubate at 37°C 14–16 h.\nAcidify the digest by adding 30 μL of 2% formic acid (FA) for 5 min, extract the peptides from the gel pieces by adding 400 μL of 100% ACN, shake the solution on a rocker platform at 25°C for 15 min, centrifuge the tubes at 16,000 ×g for 1 min, and transfer the supernatant into new tubes.\nVacuum-dry the samples.\nLC-MS analysis\nTiming: 1–2 h/sample\nDuring this step, the extracted peptide is analyzed on mass spectrometer.\nSeparate the peptides by a 65 min gradient elution (from 1% to 40% buffer B) at a flow rate 0.3 μL/min with the Thermo EASY-nLC1200 integrated nano-HPLC system which is directly interfaced with the MS.\nThe analytical column was a home-made fused silica capillary column packed with C-18 resin.\nMobile phase A consists of 0.1% formic acid in water, and mobile phase B consists of 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid.\nAs the peptides are eluted, they are subjected to electrospray ionization and then analyzed by an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer.\nThe source is operated at 1.9 kV, with no sheath gas flow and with the ion transfer tube at 350°C.\nThe mass spectrometer is operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode using the Xcalibur 4.1 software and there is a single full-scan mass spectrum in the Orbitrap (350–1,500 m/z, 60,000 resolution at m/z 200) followed by 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans at 30% normalized collision energy.",
    "The selection window of the Quadrupole is 300–1,500 m/z.\nSet the AGC target as 5e4, and the maximum injection time is 50 ms.\nSet the intensity threshold at 1,000.\nMS2 spectra are acquired with a resolution of 15,000.\nThe peptides are detected, isolated, and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide.\nAnalyze each mass spectrum using the Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nDetermine peptide sequences (protein identity) by matching fragmentation patterns in the Swiss-Prot protein database (Homo sapiens) using the Mascot software program (Matrix Science, USA) in Proteome Discoverer 2.5 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) (Figure 3B)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nThe mass tolerance is set to 20 ppm for both precursor ions and fragment ions.\nEnzyme specificity is set to partially tryptic with two missed cleavages.\nNote: No fixed modification is set. The variable modifications included oxidation on Methionine, acetylation on peptide N-terminus, and Carbamidomethylation on Cysteine. Spectral matches are filtered to include a false-discovery rate of less than 1% at the peptide level.\nMS data analysis and bioinformatics analysis\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis step mainly focuses on the analysis and visualization of MS data.\nPerform a quality control step to ensure a reasonable number of prey proteins with correctly distributed cellular localization and high data reproducibility across the replicates (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1841-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Total numbers of peptides and proteins identified in the MS analysis are shown. A MUSE score greater than 0.85 was used as the cut-off to identify HCIPs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1841-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(B) HCIPs are defined by MUSE algorithm.\n(C) Validation of HCIPs utilizing knowledge databases, GO term enrichment analysis and visualization of protein–protein interaction networks composed of HCIP by Cytoscape.\n(D) Functional analysis of proteomic data by integrating with genomic or model organism data.\n(E) Establishing a functional PPI network.\nEvaluate the confidence scores of bait-prey binary interactions using computational models, such as CompPASS (Sowa et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib52]), SAINT (Choi et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) and MUSE (Li et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]) algorithms. Here, for example, we set the MUSE score > 0.85 as the cutoff for identifying high-confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nHigh-confidence interactions can be further validated by knowledge databases, including BioGRID (Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib54]), IntAct (Orchard et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib42]), MINT (Licata et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]), HI-union/HuRI/Lit-BM (Luck et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib40]) and HI-II-14 (Rolland et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib47]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: The results could also be obtained from the CRAPome database, a repository of prey frequently found in AP/MS experiments (Mellacheruvu et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib41]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nVisualize protein–protein interaction networks composed of HCIP in Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib51]) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1841-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Example interaction network identified in human Notch pathway established by TAP/MS\nThe interaction network was constructed using HCIPs identified in SFB-TAP/MS data of our human Notch pathway study.\nIn detail, the identified bait-prey interactions and their corresponding peptide-spectrum match (PSM) values are integrated into excel or .csv format and imported into Cytoscape software for interaction network visualization.\nNote: For better annotation of the interaction network, properties of each node and edge could be added via additional table format. Other “R”-based visualization methods are also available. The R framework (R-project.org[href=http://R-project.org]) and Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) are also frequently used for data analysis, clustering, and visualization. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].",
    "Perform GO/KEGG analysis, disease enrichment and other bioinformatic analyses for analyzing biological functions of HCIPs (Ashburner et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nPerform integrated analysis of proteomic data with genomic data, such as phenotypical data in model organisms, correlation with diseases, expression alterations and mutations in diseases, and correlation with survival and prognosis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nFor instance, the identified HCIPs can be used for the overlapping analyses with other regulators involved in the detailed biological process according to the users’ research purpose. Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15].\nConduct in-depth mechanistic studies for several potentially functionally relevant proteins to produce biologically meaningful results (Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]), and eventually establish a functional PPI network (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: For data validation, a co-IP assay using antibodies against endogenous proteins or epitope tags is the most frequently used approach (Couzens et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Hauri et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Kwon et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]; Wang et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib56]). Other approaches include two-hybrid- and flow cytometry-based interaction validations, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays (Fields and Song, 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Piehler, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib43]; Yan and Marriott, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib59])."
