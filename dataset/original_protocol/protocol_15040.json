    "All human studies described in this manuscript were carried out under protocols approved by Western University's Human Research Ethics Board. All Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, under protocols approved by the Western University Animal Use Subcommittee.\n1. Standard CTC Enumeration from Patient Blood Samples Using the CSS\n1. Human Blood Sample Collection and Preparation for Processing on the Preparation Instrument\nUsing standard aseptic phlebotomy techniques, draw a minimum of 8.0 ml of human blood into a 10 ml CellSave tube (hereafter referred to as the CTC preservative tube), which contains ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and a proprietary cellular preservative. Invert the tube 5x to prevent blood from clotting. Samples may be processed immediately or stored at room temperature for up to 96 hr.\nRemove CSS reagents from the fridge and allow them to warm to room temperature before using.\nUsing a disposable 10 ml pipette and automated pipettor, collect 7.5 ml of blood from the CTC preservative tube and slowly dispense blood into an appropriately labeled preparation instrument processing tube.\nAdd 6.5 ml of dilution buffer to each sample. Mix by inverting sample 5x. Centrifuge sample at 800 x g for 10 min with the brake in the \"off\" position. Follow the on-screen instructions on the preparation instrument to load all patient samples onto the system for processing. Samples must be processed within 1 hr of preparation.\n2. Control Preparation for Processing on the Preparation Instrument\nGently vortex the control vial and invert 5x to mix.",
    "Carefully remove the cap from the control vial and place an inverted preparation instrument processing tube on top of the uncapped vial. In one swift motion, invert the control vial, and pour the contents into the processing tube. While inverted, gently flick the sides of the control vial to release any remaining contents.\nCarefully remove the inverted control vial from the processing tube, ensuring that no liquid is lost and place aside. Using a 1,000 μl pipette, collect any remaining contents from the vial and lid and gently pipette into the processing tube.\nFollow the on-screen instructions on the preparation instrument to load the control onto the system for processing.\n3. Sample Scanning on the Analysis Instrument\nFollow the on-screen instructions on the preparation instrument to unload all samples from the system. Loosely cap each magnetic device cartridge and tap the magnetic device using hands or lab bench to release any bubbles that are stuck to the edges of the cartridge. Once all the bubbles have been removed, firmly cap the cartridge, lay the magnetic device flat, and incubate in the dark for at least 20 min at room temperature. Samples must be scanned within 24 hr of preparation.\nTurn on the analysis instrument and initialize the lamp. Once warmed (~15 min), load the system verification cartridge onto the analysis instrument and select the QC Test tab. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the necessary quality control measures.\nLoad a sample onto the analysis instrument and select the Patient Test tab. All saved information from the preparation instrument will be displayed. Click Start to initialize sample scanning. The system will perform a coarse focus and edge detection on the magnetic device cartridge.",
    "Adjust all edges as necessary using the directional keys. Select Accept. The system will perform a fine focus and begin sample scanning.\nFollowing control scanning the results should be validated using the defined criteria for cells spiked at high (CK+DAPI+CD45-APC+) and low (CK+DAPI+CD45-FITC+) concentrations. Following patient sample scanning the results should be reviewed for captured CTCs using the defined CTC criteria (CK+DAPI+CD45-).\n2. CTC Characterization for User-defined Markers using the CSS\n1. Preparation of User-defined Markers and Instrument Initialization\nDilute the antibody of interest using Bond Primary Antibody Diluent to the desired concentration in a marker reagent cup using the following formula, where the working concentration is the concentration of the antibody after addition to the sample and the stock concentration is the concentration of antibody in the reagent cup. For multiple samples, adjust the antibody volumes as described in Table 1. Place the marker reagent cup into position 1 in the reagent cartridge and load the cartridge onto CSS.Stock Concentration = (Working Concentration x 850 μl) / 150 μl\nCollect blood, prepare samples, and load the preparation instrument as described in the above Standard CTC Enumeration from Patient Blood Samples using the CSS protocol. To enable custom marker addition, select User Defined Assay when prompted by the preparation instrument. Input the marker name and select Save. As samples are loaded onto the instrument, the operator will be prompted to indicate which should receive custom marker by selecting Yes or No as necessary.\n2. Sample Scanning of User-Defined Markers on the Analysis Instrument\nTurn on the analysis instrument, initialize the lamp, and perform quality control and system verification as described in Section 3.2 of the Standard CTC Enumeration from Patient Blood Samples using the CSS protocol.",
    "Load a sample onto the analysis instrument and select the Setup tab. To initialize the FITC channel, select CellSearch CTC as the Kit ID under the Test Protocols section. From this menu, select CTC Research, click the Edit button and set the exposure time as desired. It is recommended that an exposure time of 1.0 sec not be exceeded when using the CSS CTC kit as this can increase bleed-through into other fluorescent channels utilized for CTC identification.\n3. Adaptation of the Standard CSSProtocol for use in Preclinical Mouse Models\n**Adapted from Veridex Mouse/Rat CellCapture Kit (no longer commercially available)\n1. Mouse Blood Collection and Storage\nPrior to blood collection, run ~30 μl of 0.5 M EDTA back and forth through a 22 G needle, leaving a small amount of EDTA in the hub.\nCollect a minimum of 50 μl of mouse blood from mice previously injected with human tumor cells via orthotopic, tail vein, or intracardiac routes. Collect blood from the saphenous vein (for serial CTC analysis) or by cardiac puncture (for terminal CTC analysis). Remove needle and dispense blood into a 1 ml EDTA microtainer blood collection tube. Mix by inversion or gently flick tube to prevent blood from clotting. Blood may be processed immediately or stored at room temperature for up to 48 hr following the addition of an equal volume of CytoChex cellular preservative.\n2. CTC Enrichment\nRemove CSS reagents from the fridge and allow them to warm to room temperature before using.",
    "Transfer the equivalent of 50 μl of whole blood to a 12 mm x 75 mm flow cytometry tube. Add 500 μl of dilution buffer to each sample, washing down any blood that remains on the sides of the tube. If necessary, a short centrifuge spin can be used to collect any remaining blood.\nGently vortex the anti-EpCAM ferrofluid and add 25 μl to each sample by placing the tip of the pipette directly into the sample. Add 25 μl of Capture Enhancement reagent and vortex gently to mix. Incubate samples at room temperature for 15 min.\nPlace sample tubes into the magnet and incubate for 10 min. While the sample tubes are still in the magnet, use a glass pipette to carefully aspirate the residual liquid without touching the wall of the tube next to the magnet and discard.\n3. CTC Staining\nRemove the sample tubes from the magnet and resuspend in 50 μl of Nucleic Acid Dye, 50 μl of Staining Reagent, 1.5 μl of anti-mouse CD45-APC, 5.0 μl of anti-human HLA-Alexa Fluor 488, and 100 μl of Permeabilization Reagent. For multiple samples, these reagents may be premixed and 206.5 μl of mixture may be added to each tube. Vortex gently to mix and incubate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAdd 500 μl of dilution buffer, vortex gently, place sample tubes into the magnet, and incubate for 10 min. While the sample tubes are still in the magnet, use a glass pipette to carefully aspirate the residual liquid without touching the wall of the tube next to the magnet and discard. Remove the sample tubes from the magnet and resuspend in 350 μl of dilution buffer. Vortex gently to mix.\n4. Magnetic Device Loading",
    "Using a gel loading tip, carefully transfer the entire volume from the sample tube into a cartridge in the magnetic device. Start at the bottom of the cartridge and slowly withdraw the tip as the sample is dispensed.\nOnce the entire sample has been transferred, loosely cap the magnetic device cartridge and tap the magnetic device using hands or lab bench to release any bubbles that are stuck to the edges of the cartridge as described in Section 3.1 of the Standard CTC Enumeration from Patient Blood Samples using the CSS.\nPop any bubbles using a sterile 22 G needle by trapping them between the bevel and the edge of the cartridge. Once all the bubbles have been removed, firmly cap the cartridge, lay the magnetic device flat, and incubate in the dark for at least 10 min. Samples must be scanned within 24 hr of preparation.\n5. Scanning of Manually Separated Samples on the Analysis Instrument\nTurn on the analysis instrument, initialize the lamp, and perform quality control and system verification as described in Section 3.2 of the Standard CTC Enumeration from Patient Blood Samples using the CSS protocol.\nLoad the sample onto the analysis instrument and select the Setup tab. Clear any existing data on the magnetic device data button by clicking the Format Sample button. Enable the FITC channel and set the exposure time to 1.0 sec as described in Section 2.2 of the CTC Characterization for User-Defined Markers using the CSS.\nClick on the Patient Test tab and select Edit to input the sample information. Select CellSearch CTC as the Kit ID and CTC Research as the Test Protocol. Input the remaining necessary information as indicated as the asterisk. Save the sample information and click Start.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
