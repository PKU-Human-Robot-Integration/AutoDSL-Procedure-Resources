    "1. Microfluidic Device Design\nNOTE: The device design has four basic functional regions: entry port, cell filter, constriction array, and exit port (Figure 1). The overall design can be applied to a wide array of cell types, with minor adjustments to dimensions. Provided here are a few basic design recommendations along with device parameters that are effective for a selection of both primary and immortalized cells.\nSelect the width of constriction array channels (Figure 1B) to be approximately 30-50% of the average cell diameter; this constriction-to-cell size ratio results in significant cell deformation but minimal clogging. Given a cell type that has not previously been tested, it is prudent to design a range of constriction widths from ~30-50% the cell diameter to find the optimum width. As with many types of microfluidic devices, over 120 device master molds can be patterned on a single 4 inch silicon wafer, enabling an array of different device designs to be fabricated in a single fabrication process.\nSelect the channel height to be at least 50% of the cell diameter; this ensures the cell is confined in 2 dimensions. To prevent channel collapse during bonding, ensure that the channel aspect ratio is no less than 1:10 (height:width) throughout the device. For channels that must exceed this aspect ratio, add support posts to prevent collapse. Space support posts at a distance that is at least twice the cell diameter as to not impede cell flow.\nInclude a filter at the entry ports to remove debris and disaggregate cell clusters (Figure 1B). Adjust the size and spacing of the filter posts so that the distance separating the posts is approximately equal to one cell diameter.",
    "NOTE: The lower limit of feature size is set by the resolution at which the lithography mask is printed. Ensure that all features are within the resolution limit specified by the mask supplier.\n2. Supplies and Preparation\nNOTE: Before commencing any experiment, the following items must be prepared. A schematic of the entire setup is given in Figure 1.\nFabricate the device master using standard techniques for lithographic micromachining14,15. Verify the height of the patterned features using a profilometer.\n\tNOTE: While masters can be easily fabricated in a cleanroom facility, some labs have developed inexpensive lithography methods for use in a semi-clean environment16,17.\nPrepare the air source for pressure-driven flow, using a tank of compressed air and sequence of air regulators and fittings (Figure 1A).\n\t\nSet up an air supply tank and manual regulator.\n\t\tNOTE: A composition of 5% CO2 in air maintains a similar environment as a typical cell culture incubator, but other gas mixtures can also be used.\nSet up an electronically controlled pressure regulator in-line with the manual regulator. Use an electro-pneumatic converter to regulate and maintain a stable pressure drop across the channels, with pressure fluctuations of less than 2 kPa. Use the simple code written in LabVIEW (Supplementary Information) to input the desired pressure.\n\t\tNOTE: The electro-pneumatic converter uses an internal feedback loop to adjust the valve outlet pressure to match the specified pressure across the microfluidic device.\nSet up a pressurized chamber to drive flow of the cell suspension. Assemble a cell suspension chamber out of a standard flow cytometer tube and a machined cap that creates a pressure-tight seal on the tube.",
    "NOTE: The pressure chamber cap contains two orifices: an inlet that connects to the compressed air tank, and an outlet through which cells flow from the pressurized chamber into the device (Figure 2).\nSet up an inverted microscope fitted with a camera that has an acquisition rate of at least 100 frames per sec to capture images of the cells flowing through the constriction array. Interface the camera with a video capture card and a computer.\nPrepare a stock surfactant solution of 10% w/w Pluronic F-127 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as adding a small amount of F127 to the cell media solution will help to minimize cell adhesion to the PDMS walls. To prepare the F127 solution, vortex and heat gently at 37 °C to dissolve the F127. Prior to use, pass the solution through a 0.2 µm syringe filter and store at room temperature. Prepare the surfactant solution in advance as vortexing and filtering will generate bubbles that will persist for more than 24 hr.\n3. Microfluidic Device Fabrication\nFabricate PDMS block with microfluidic channels.\n\t\nMix PDMS thoroughly at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w) curing agent to base.\nPour the mixture over the device master (Step 2.1). Degas in a bell jar with applied vacuum until the entrapped bubbles disappear, or for about 10-20 min.\n\t\tNOTE: After this time, there may still be bubbles at the air-PDMS interface, which is normal; these will typically dissipate during baking. It is most critical to ensure that there are no remaining bubbles adjacent to the channels.",
    "Bake the degassed device at 65 °C for 4 hr. To prevent channels from collapsing, bake the device overnight to further crosslink the PDMS for a device with a higher elastic modulus that is more resistant to channel collapse. However, note that extended baking also embrittles the PDMS and may lead to cracking when punching holes (Step 3.3).\nRemove microfluidic devices from the master mold. Cut individual microfluidic devices out of the PDMS block with a razor blade and remove the device from the master. Start by gently lifting off one corner of the device; slow and gentle peeling, as opposed to lifting the PDMS block straight up, reduces the stress on both the PDMS and the master.\nPunch holes in the PDMS device to create connection ports for access between tubing and microchannels. Create holes using a biopsy punch, and punch from the channel side through to the exterior side of the device.\n\tNOTE: A biopsy punch with a 0.75 mm bore size creates holes that interface perfectly with polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tubing (outer diameter = 1/32” or 0.79 mm) or polyethylene tubing (PE-20, outer diameter = 0.043” or 1.09 mm). Use a ring light to help visualize holes in devices with shallow channels18. Be sure the biopsy punch is sharp; after repeated use the cutting edge dulls and the biopsy punch should be discarded and replaced.\nRinse the PDMS device with isopropanol (HPLC grade) to remove dust and lodged chunks of PDMS. Make sure the punched holes are clear of debris by directing a steady stream of pure isopropanol from a squeeze bottle through the holes. Blow dry with filtered air. After cleaning, place PDMS blocks with channels face up in a clean Petri dish to maintain device cleanliness. If required, store devices in this form until bonding.",
    "Clean the glass substrate by rinsing with methanol (HPLC grade), blow dry with filtered air, and place on a 200 °C hotplate for 5-10 min to ensure the glass is completely clean and dry before plasma treatment.\n\tNOTE: The glass substrate forms the bottom of each channel. Typically a glass slide suffices, since a 10X or 20X objective is ideal for imaging multiple channels in parallel. For higher resolution imaging, bond the device to a coverslip (#1.5 thickness).\nBond the PDMS device to the glass substrate.\n\t\nOxygen plasma treat the channel side of the PDMS block and 1 side of a glass slide.\n\t\tNOTE: With a hand-held discharge unit, use a treatment time of 1 min, but optimize the treatment time for each oxygen plasma apparatus.\nPlace the channel side of the PDMS on top of the treated side of the glass immediately after treatment.\nHold together with light pressure for ~10 sec to promote bonding. Bake the entire device at an elevated temperature (60-80 °C) for at least 15 min to improve bond strength.\n4. Deforming Cells through Constricted Channels\nInspect the microfluidic device under a microscope. Ensure that the channels are not collapsed or broken and that both inlet and outlet holes connect directly into the device channels by using a low-power objective (10X). Designate defective devices by scoring the surface of the PDMS with a razor blade and do not use them for experiments.\nPrepare the cell culture samples to be assayed. Culture cells using standard conditions.\n\t\nFor example, culture HL-60 cells in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution and 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.",
    "For adherent cells, harvest them by trypsinization and resuspend in fresh growth medium. Use a standard trypsinization protocol; for example, add ~0.5 ml trypsin to a flask with 25 cm2 culture area, and resuspend in ~30 ml fresh medium. Differentiate HL-60 cells into neutrophil-type cells by all-trans retinoic (ATRA) at a final concentration of 5 µM per 1 x 105 cells/ml as previously described19,20.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 3 min, carefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells to the appropriate final density in fresh culture medium with 0.1% v/v F-127.\nCount the cells using a Coulter counter, hemacytometer, or flow cytometer. Adjust the cell suspension to a density of 1 x 106 to 5 x 106 cells/ml. Once the suspension density is set, supplement with approximately 0.1% v/v F-127.\n\tNOTE: The cell density and surfactant concentration may need to be modified depending on the particular cell systems; Table 1 provides a record of previously used concentrations of cells and F-127 for different cell types.\nPlace cell suspension in a flow cytometer tube and connect to the pressure cap. Before connecting the tubing to the microfluidic device, adjust the pressure to about 14-21 kPa and flush until the cell suspension emerges from the tip of the tubing. This will help to minimize air bubbles in the tubing and device.\nInsert the tip of the tubing containing the cell suspension into the device inlet. If the device is bonded to a coverslip, place the device on a flat, solid surface such as the microscope stage before connecting the tubing; the coverslip is fragile and may otherwise break.",
    "Insert a piece of tubing into the exit port and route it into an empty tube for waste collection such as an empty Falcon tube taped to the side of the microscope stage. For consistency in the overall fluidic resistance of the device between experiments, ensure that the inlet and outlet tubing is of the same diameter and approximately the same length for each experiment.\nGently ramp up the pressure to about 28 kPa or until cells flow through the channels. Position the device so that multiple channels are in the field of view and are perpendicular to the bottom of the screen. If the camera is limited by data size, acquire multiple videos to generate a sufficient number of independent data points. Adjust the frame rate as necessary for the desired data output. To capture changes in cell shape, use high speed imaging at 300 frames per sec (fps); to measure transit times of cells, use frame rates of approximately 100 fps.\n5. Data Analysis\nOpen the file Master_script.m (Downloadable Supplemental File) and run the program.\nSelect the first video to be analyzed from the Windows Explorer window that appears. Specify the frame rate for the selected video and press enter.\n\tNOTE: A figure will appear that prompts the user to select a rectangular cropping window for the first video.\nSelect a window that encompasses all the channels from left to right and intersects the channels just above the first bulb of the array of channels at the top and bottom (Figure 3).\nSelect the constriction regions from the cropped image. Pay special attention to maintain a fixed pixel distance between the top and bottom window boundary for every video selected.",
    "NOTE: The top window edge specifies the topmost constriction and bottom window edge specifies the bottommost constriction (Figure 4); intermediate constrictions are approximated from this user input. Next, the algorithm displays the segmentation of cells for the first 50 frames of each video (Figure 5).\nMonitor the top left image (Figure 5A) closely to determine if the algorithm is accurately locating cells; a binarized image is superimposed on the source video to demonstrate the location of identified cells.\n\tNOTE: The different windows, (Figures 5B-5D) are for code diagnosis and demonstrate the video frames after specific image processing operations.\nSelect the next video to be processed from the Windows Explorer window.\n\tNOTE: The algorithm will repeat steps 5.2-5.5 for each video selected.\nSelect cancel once all desired videos have been added via the Windows Explorer window to instruct the function that the video list is complete.\n\tNOTE: The algorithm will perform the remaining operations without user intervention. This will take approximately 1-2 hr depending on the number of videos processed and computer performance. Upon completion, the algorithm will produce a histogram of the transit time data and save the data in the directory as a MATLAB .mat file and a Microsoft Excel .xls file.\nSubscription Required.
