    "The protocol was examined and approved by the Veterinary Ethical Review Committee prior to the beginning of the study. The recommendations of the ARRIVE guidelines in animal research were also consulted and considered21-25.\n1. Dog Selection and Food Supplementation\nSelect 24 dogs of different breeds (mean age and weight ± SEM: 2.9 ± 0.3 years and 32.01 ± 1.17 kg; 14 males, 10 females) with evident clinical symptoms of behavioral disturbances, such as anxiety, diffidence, irregular biorhythm, reactivity, activation, irritability, alertness, and constant environmental exploration.\nRandomly divide the animals into two groups and place each into a 215,278 sq ft single box. Following the manufacturer's instructions, give the appropriate dose of standard diet (SD, n = 12) or nutraceutical diet (ND, n = 12) for 10 days, according to the weights of the animals (Table 1).\nComplete two veterinary inspections of the dogs before (T0) and 10 days after (T1) the treatment.\n2. Behavior Symptoms Acquiring and Scoring\nHave a certified veterinary behaviorist score the behavioral (marking, anxiety, diffidence, irregular biorhythm, reactivity, activation, irritability, alertness, environmental exploration and attention requirement) and clinical (dandruff, itchiness, flush, seborrhea, fur opacity, vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, lachrymation and anal sac repletion) conditions of each dog.\n\t\nFor each dog, gather a score before and after the 10-days evaluation as follows: 1 = absence of symptom; 2 = moderate presence of symptoms; 3 = marked presence of symptoms.\nAt the end of the evaluation summarize, for each symptom, the scores of the dogs of each group before and after 10 days. Plot the data on a statistical software.\n3. The Sensor",
    "Note: The sensor has a 3-axis accelerometer, allowing it to gather movement in each direction (x, y, z). It weighs 8 g and is extremely small (41 x 28 x 11 mm). Moreover, it is compatible with every mobile device that features a global wireless communication. It has a rechargeable battery that can last for 14 days after charging. The data output is calculated in points, which are the units of time spent active and at rest by each dog during the day.\nEnsure that the collar is not wider than 30 mm for the optimal fit of the sensor.\nUsing the procedure outlined in sections 3 and 4, evaluate the behavioral changes related to the time spent active and at rest before and after treatment with the specific diet.\n4. Sensor Setting\nOpen the micro USB cap on the bottom of the unit and use the cable provided to connect the sensor to the computer's USB 1x/2.0 port or to a Class 2/Limited power supply with a USB output. When an LED starts blinking, charge the sensor for at least 90 min.\nDownload and install the dedicated free mobile app from the web store.\n5. Activity Monitoring and Analysis\nInsert the plugs of a wireless router and the dedicated Wi-Fi base station into two different sockets. Wait until the router is ready and the Wi-Fi base station starts flashing.\nEnable Bluetooth on the mobile device and make sure that it is connected to the Internet.\nOpen the app and sign up. Then, tap on \"Add new dog\" and follow the steps below.\n\t\nTake a picture of the dog and provide its name.\nAppropriately set the gender, age, weight, neutering status, and location of the dog.\nSet the primary and the secondary breed of the dog.",
    "Select, if applicable, the presence of allergies (skin, ear, etc.), arthritis, brain aging, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or excessive weight.\nSelect one of the three available lifestyles, with their respective points, according to personal requirements (1. Average, 2. Active, or 3. Olympian).\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the age of the dog, the points of each lifestyle will change. Given that the aim of this evaluation was to decrease the hyperactivity and the stress of the dogs, the first lifestyle, \"Average,\" was set as the final goal to reach.\nTap on \"Wi-Fi base station\" and then on \"Pair a base station\" to connect the sensor to the Wi-Fi base station. Wait until the word \"FitBark\" appears below \"Pair a base station.\"\nClip a charged sensor to the collar of the dog.\nRepeat steps 4.3 to 4.4 for each dog.\n6. Bark Recording\nFix a digital voice recorder to the wall of each box at the beginning of the study.\nStart recording the bark activity.\n\t\nEvery day, before acquiring new data, connect the digital voice recorder to a computer by means of a retractable USB connector provided along with the recorder.\nDrag the folder with voice data from the device to the computer and rename it with the current date.\nRepeat steps 6.2.1 - 6.2.2 every day for 10 days.\nAt the end of the evaluation transform (in s) the bark time recorded. Summarize the bark time for each group before and after 10 days. Plot the data on a statistical software."
