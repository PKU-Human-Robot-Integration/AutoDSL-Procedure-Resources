    "The procedure for determining the PHB content of Synechocystis cells is described in Figure 2. It consists of four steps, including (A) the cultivation of cyanobacteria, (B) acid hydrolysis to convert PHB into crotonic acid, (C) HPLC sample preparation, and (D) determination of PHB content using HPLC.Two-step Synechocystis cultivation: grow cells under standard growth conditions to increase cell biomass and then transfer cells to nitrogen-deprived media to stimulate PHB accumulation Inoculate BG11 media (Rippka et al., 1979) (see Recipes) with Synechocystis in Erlenmeyer flasks using the initial cell density of OD730nm = 0.2 and a total volume of 100 mL. Then, cultivate cells at 28 °C under continuous white light at 50 μmol m-2·s-1 with an atmospheric CO2 supply via culture shaking at 160 rpm. Cultivate cells for 4–5 days to achieve the cell density of OD730nm = 0.6–0.8.Harvest cells by centrifugation at 4,000× g for 10 min at room temperature and wash cells twice with BG110 media (nitrogen-deprived medium) (see Recipes), followed by using the aforementioned centrifugation step. Remove supernatant medium in each washing step.Perform the second cultivation step by inoculating the harvested cells in BG110 medium, using the initial OD730nm = 0.4 and the total volume of 100 mL. Next, cultivate cells for 7–14 days to induce PHB accumulation at 28 °C under continuous white light at 50 μmol m-2·s-1 with an atmospheric CO2 supply via culture shaking at 160 rpm.Harvest cells from 40 mL of cell culture by centrifugation at 4,000× g for 10 min at room temperature. Next, resuspend fresh biomass in BG11 (total volume not exceeding 1.4 mL) and transfer the resuspended cell sample to the 1.5 mL tube. Then, centrifuge the tube, remove the liquid medium, and immediately dry cells at 60 °C in a hot oven until the weight of the sample stabilizes.",
    "Note: The wet cell pellets can be stored at -20 °C or dried at 60 °C immediately before being used. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230804/20230804092252_0451.jpgFigure 2. Overview of procedures for determining poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) content of Synechocystis. Cells are cultivated, harvested, and dried. Next, dry cells are hydrolyzed by acid to convert PHB into crotonic acid. Then, crotonic acid content is quantified using HPLC. Details of each step are described in the procedure.Acid hydrolysis to convert PHB into crotonic acid Note: This step uses a strong acid, thus it must be performed under the fume hood and while wearing personal protective equipment. Weigh approximately 5–10 mg of dry cells or 5 mg of the standard commercial PHB into 10 mL screw-capped glass tubes.Add 1 mL of 18.4 M sulfuric acid by using a glass pipette to dry cells; boil at 100 °C for 1 h in a hot water bath to break cells and hydrolyze PHB into crotonic acid (Figure 3). The typical percentage of mass conversion of PHB to crotonic acid is in the range of 83% ± 7% (w/w) (Singhon et al., 2021; Kaewbai-ngam et al., 2022).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4790/bioprotoc-13-16-4790-g003.jpgFigure 3. Depolymerization of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) by sulfuric acid to form crotonic acid. The reaction information is according to Koch et al. (2020).Cool sample until reaching room temperature; then, dilute the obtained total hydrolysate (1 mL) by adding 4 mL of distilled water and mix thoroughly by vortexing. The total volume of sample is 5 mL.Note: For safety reasons, assure that the hot samples after acid hydrolysis are cooled down before proceeding to the next step.",
    "For the commercial PHB sample (5 mg) that has been hydrolyzed and diluted to the total 5 mL in the step B3, make a 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, and 1:500 dilution in the total 5 mL volume to generate the standard PHB samples corresponding to the total PHB of 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 mg of PHB in the 5 mL total volume.HPLC sample preparation Prepare HPLC samples according to Table 1 and mix thoroughly by vortexing.Filter HPLC sample using a syringe and the polypropylene filter (0.22 μm); then, transfer the obtained filtrate to HPLC glass vials.Table 1.
