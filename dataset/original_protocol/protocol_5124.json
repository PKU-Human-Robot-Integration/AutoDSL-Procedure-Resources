    "In order to measure the galactanase activity of His6-GanB two different assays were applied: one using the natural substrate galactan is described in Procedure A and another using a dyed galactan substrate is described in Procedure B. The reaction of the galactanase enzyme on galactan for producing galacto-oligosaccharide is described in Procedure C. Galacto-oligosaccharides generated after the degradation of galactan were identified by two different chromatographic methods. First Thinlayer-chromatography (TLC) was used to identify the products qualitatively and is described in Procedure D. Quantitative analysis of individual galacto-oligosaccharides was performed using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) as described in Procedure E.Galactanase activity determination by measurement of the increase of the reducing power In order to calculate endo-β-galactanase activity in units, the reduced sugars released from the lupin galactan degradation were determined by an adapted 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay (Miller, 1959).Mix appropriate amounts of His6-GanB (maximal 0.5 µg) in 40 µl of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (KPP) pH 6.5 with 40 µl of 2% lupin galactan in an Eppendorf tube. Incubate the Eppendorf tube in a thermomixer at 37 °C for 15 min with agitation at 300 rpm.Stop the reaction by adding of 300 µl of DNS-reagent.Heat the Eppendorf tube for 20 min at 95 °C.Add 1 ml H2O to the reaction mixture and keep the Eppendorf tube on ice for 20 min.Measure the absorbance of the developed orange color at 540 nm (see Figure1)As the blank the reaction mixture ingredients without enzyme is used.For unit calculation, the absorption of 1 µmol galactose is determined from a calibration curve applying 1 to 10 mM galactose in the reaction mixture of the assay (1 µmol galactose is equivalent to 0.034 A540 units).",
    "One unit of galactanase enzyme was defined as the release of 1 µmol of reducing sugar, here galactose, per minute determined by the DNS-assay. Calculate units per milliliter from the formula (see also Data analysis):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327012859_6499.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327004626_1628.jpgFigure 1. DNS-assay for determination of the reducing power from the reaction of His6-GanB with galactan: Color development of different amounts of His6-GanB after step A5Colorimetric assay: Activity on the dyed substrate AZCL-galactan (Azurine-crosslinked-potato galactan) by measurement of the water soluble dyed fragments after degradation of the insoluble AZCL-galactan.Delude appropriate amounts of His6-GanB (e.g., 2 µl of 0.6 mg/ml; 2 µl of 0.12 mg/ml; 2 µl of 0.06 mg/ml) in 200 µl of 0.1 M KPP pH 6.5 and mix with 50 µl of a well mixed suspension of 1% AZCL-galactan in an Eppendorf tube. Incubate the Eppendorf tube in a thermomixer at 37 °C for 15 min with agitation at 300 rpm.Stop the reaction by adding of 250 µl of 0.4 M sodium borate.Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 5 min. Take 100 µl of the blue colored supernatant and dilute with 900 µl of H2O.Measure the absorbance at 595 nm (for 1.2 µg His6-GanB an OD595 of 0.43 was determined).As the blank the reaction mixture ingredients without enzyme was used. Figure 2 shows the development of blue color in step B3 (before centrifugation) from the degradation of the unsoluble AZCL-galactan suspension with different amounts of GanB-enzyme. Tube 1 represents the blank.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327004839_5588.jpgFigure 2. AZCL-galactan assay: Development of the blue color of different amounts of His6-GanB after step B3Note: The dyed substrate AZCL-galactan is used for semi-quantitatively activity determination as molar extinction coefficient ε595 of the blue dye was unknown.Enzymatic reaction for analysis of the generated galacto-oligosaccharidesMix appropriate amounts of His6-GanB (e.g., 1 µg) in 40 µl 0.1 M KPP pH 6.",
    "5 with 40 µl of 2% lupin-galactan in an Eppendorf tube and incubate the reaction at 37 °C with agitation at 300 rpm. Withdraw 10 µl of the reaction mixture at different times of reaction and put it in a new Eppendorf tubeStop the reaction by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 5 min. Use aliquots of the heat-denatured enzymatic reaction for analyzing the products by TLC (Procedure D step 1) or HPLC (Procedure E step 1).TLC-analysisSpot 4 µl of the heat-denatured enzymatic reaction, withdrawn at different reaction times from Procedure C, on a TLC-plate (Silica Gel 60 F254).As a control spot 2 µl of a solution of galactose (10 mg/ml) and 2 µl of 1% lupin-galactan on the plate.Separate the products with the mobile phase acetone-H2O (87:13) in a thin-layer-chamber till the migration front reach the top.Dry the TLC-plate with a blow-dryer approximately 5 min.Soak the TLC-plate in the developing reagent.Back the plates in an oven at 80 °C till blue spots are visible.Figure 3 shows the TLC-chromatogram after separation and visualization of the reaction products generated from lupin galactan degradation of GanB after different reaction times. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327005058_5634.jpgFigure 3. TLC-Chromatogram of the degradation products of lupin-galactan by His6-GanB (60 ng) withdrawn at reaction times of 30 min, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h from Procedure C. The reaction products were separated with the mobile phase acetone-H2O (87:13) and visualized by the developing reagent.HPAEC-analysisDilute samples of the enzymatic reaction from Procedure C 1:10 with H2O.Load 10 μl on the CarboPac PA1 column by injection in the HPLC apparatus and separate the products with an isocratic mobile phase of 0.22 N NaOH/0.02 M sodium acetate on a HPLC-System at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min.",
    "Detect the eluted carbohydrate by pulsed amperometry with an analytical cell (5040, ESA Coulochem II, Bischoff). Individual sugars like galactose and β-1,4 galactobiose were identified by comparing retention times with those of standards.A typical HPLC-profile is given in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327005233_3398.jpgFigure 4. HPLC-chromatogram of the degradation products of lupin-galactan by purified His6-GanB of the reaction of 1 µg His6-GanB in 40 µl 0.1 M KPP pH 6.5 and 40 µl 2% Galactan after incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The identity of the individual sugars were galactose (Gal); β1,4-galactobiose (Gal2), Galactotriose (Gal3) and Galactotetraose (Gal4).Note: Galactanase activity in U/ml could be only calculated from Procedure A. Procedure B is used for semi-quantitative activity determination. The chromatograms of Procedure D is only for a qualitative view of the products and with Procedure E the produced galacto-oligosaccharide were separated but due to the lack of standards of Gal3 and Gal4 it was not quantified."
