    "1. Fabrication of Cation Exchange Membrane-integrated Microfluidic Chips\nPreparation of silicon masters\nDesign two kinds of silicon masters: one for patterning a cation exchange resin and the other for building a microchannel with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).\n\t\tNOTE: The detail geometry will be described in the steps 1.3.1 and 1.4.1.\nFabricate the silicon masters by using either conventional photolithography or deep reactive ion etching27.\nSilanize the micropatterned silicon masters with trichlorosilane (~30 μL) in a vacuum jar for 30 min.\nCAUTION: Trichlorosilane is a pyrophoric liquid that is flammable and has an acute toxicity (inhalation, oral ingestion).\nPreparation of PDMS molds\nMix a silicone elastomer base with a curing agent at a 10:1 ratio and place the cup with this uncured PDMS (30-40 mL for replicating microstructures on a 4-in silicon wafer) in a vacuum jar for 30 min to remove the bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: The silicone base contains siloxane oligomers terminating with vinyl groups and a platinum-based catalyst. The curing agent contains crosslinking oligomers that have three silicon-hydride bonds28.\nPour the uncured PDMS on the silicon masters, remove the bubbles with a blower, and cure the PDMS at 80 °C for 2 h in a convection oven.\nDetach the cured PDMS from the silicon masters and properly shape the PDMS with a knife (squared shapes, as shown in Figure 2a-b, iv).\nPatterning the cation exchange membranes\nCut half of the PDMS mold perpendicularly to the two parallel microchannels and punch holes at the ends of the PDMS channels with a 2.0-mm biopsy punch.",
    "NOTE: The PDMS mold for patterning the cation selective membrane has two parallel microchannels (width: 100 µm; height: 50 µm; interchannel distance: 100 µm; Figure 1a). The original shape of the mold can be imagined by mirroring the sliced mold along the cutting line. L-shaped microchannels are recommended for punching the two holes without overlapping.\nClean a glass slide and the PDMS mold with tape and a blower and put the mold onto the glass slide to create reversible attachment between them.\nAccording to the microflow patterning technique29, release ~10 µL of a cation exchange resin at the open end of the channel that was sliced in step 1.3.1 (Figure 1b). Place the syringe head on the punched holes and pull the plunger (black arrows in Figure 1b); a gentle negative pressure will pull the cation exchange resin, and the resin will fill the two channels.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended that the height of the microchannel is greater than 15 µm, because the high viscosity of the resin requires high pressure to fill the channels. On the other hand, it is better that the height does not exceed 100 µm, because the patterned ion selective membrane will become thicker than 1 µm; such a thick membrane may create a gap between the membrane and the PDMS channel13.\nDetach the PDMS mold without touching the patterned resin and place the glass slide on the heater at 95 °C for 5 min to evaporate the solvent in the resin.",
    "NOTE: The thickness of the patterned membrane is usually less than < 1 µm. The mold is gently detached by hinging the mold to the open-ended side (dotted line and arrow in Figure 1b). It is best to detach the mold less than 1 min after filling the resin. If the mold is detached a few minutes later, thicker membranes could be obtained, but they would have a concave shape due to the capillary effect.\nPeel off the unnecessary part of the patterned membrane with a razor blade, making two separated line-patterns (Figure 1c).\n\t\tNOTE: The cation exchange material used here has perfluorinated groups, meaning the pattern is not strongly bonded to the glass. Therefore, the simple blading method can easily remove the unnecessary part of the membrane.\nIntegration of the microchannel and the membrane-patterned substrate\nPunch two holes at the ends of microchannels and another two holes where the membrane patterns will be located after bonding the PDMS channel to the membrane-patterned substrate fabricated in step 1.3.\n\t\tNote: The PDMS microchannel has one channel (width: 50-100 µm; height: 10 µm), but it is bonded to the ends of the neighboring channel (Figure 1d).\nBond the PDMS microchannel to the membrane-patterned substrate immediately after oxygen plasma treatment for 40 s at 100 W and 50 mTorr.\n\t\tNOTE: Place the patterned membrane perpendicularly on the middle of the microchannel.\n2. ICP Preconcentration\nPreparation for the experiment\nPrepare various test solutions, including 1-100 mM KCl, 1 mM NaCl (pH ~7), the mixture of 1 mM NaCl and 0.2 mM HCl (pH ~3.7), the mixture of 1 mM NaCl and 0.2 mM NaOH (pH ~10.3), and 1x phosphate-buffered saline.\nAdd a negatively charged fluorescent dye (~1.55 µM) to the test solutions.",
    "NOTE: The concentration of the added dye should be much lower than that of the salt ions (< 10 µM) so that the charged dyes do not contribute to an electrical current30,31.\nLoad the sample solution in one reservoir of the channel and apply negative pressure to the other reservoir to fill the channel with the solution. Connect the two reservoirs hydrodynamically by releasing a large droplet to eliminate the pressure gradient along the channel (Figure 2a).\nFill the two reservoirs, which are connected to the cation exchange patterns, with buffer solutions (1 M KCl or 1 M NaCl) using a syringe or a pipet to compensate for the ICP effect in the reservoirs.\nPlace the wires at the reservoirs, across the two patterned membranes (anode on the left reservoir and cathode on the right), and connect them with a source measurement unit (Figure 2a).\nVisualization of the ICP phenomenon and ICP preconcentration\nLoad the ICP device on an inverted epifluorescence microscope. Apply a voltage (0.5100 V) and measure the current response with a source measurement unit.\nCapture fluorescent images with a charge-coupled device camera and analyze the fluorescent intensity using imaging software32.\nSubscription Required.
