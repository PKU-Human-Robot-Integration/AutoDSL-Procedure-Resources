    "This experimental protocol has been approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office, Fribourg and the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, Switzerland (FR 2015/58).\nNOTE: Male NZW rabbits weighing between 2.8 to 3.2 kg were used. The animals were housed under conventional conditions (12 h light and dark cycle, provided ad libitum water and food). Prior to balloon denudation, animals were acclimated for 1 week during which they were fed with normal chow diet. After 1 week of acclimatization, rabbits were switched to atherogenic diet consisting of high fat (8.6%), and saturated fatty acids with 205 mg/kg cholesterol (1%) diet for the whole study duration. Balloon injury in the left iliac artery was performed 1 week after diet initiation and animals were sacrificed after 2 weeks or 4 weeks of balloon injury.\n1. Preoperative Procedures\nSterilize all surgical instruments before use with a glass bead sterilizer or other suitable instrument.\nPrepare and check the balloon catheter assembly.\n\t\nAttach a 1 mL luer lock syringe filled with normal saline to the luer-lock part of the balloon catheter. Carefully monitor for absence of trapped air. Check the leaks and ensure proper balloon inflation by pressing the plunger of the syringe.\nWeigh the rabbit and turn on the thermopad to 37 °C.\nUse a buprenorphine solution at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Inject a dose of 0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously.\nAnesthetize the rabbit with 5% isoflurane and 5 L/min O2 in an induction chamber for 10 - 15 min.\nPlace the anesthetized rabbit on the heating pad kept on the surgical platform. Place the patch and clips to monitor the temperature, respiration, and electrocardiogram.",
    "Attach the snout of the rabbit to a face mask connected to a suitable anaesthesia machine. Maintain the anaesthesia with isoflurane (4.0% with 2.5 L/min O2). Confirm proper anesthetization (indicated by lack of muscle tone and loss of gag and pinnae reflexes).\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent the corneas from drying. Drape the rabbit with a sterile surgical sheet with only the lower limb exposed.\n2. Surgical Protocol\nRemove the hair from the ventral area just below the knee joints using animal hair clippers.\nSwab the area with suitable disinfectant to clean the skin and remove loose hair.\nLocate the saphenous artery and make a small skin incision of about 1.5 cm in length using a scalpel.\nExpose a small portion of saphenous artery with small curved forceps without damaging the femoral vein and femoral nerve.\nPlace two loose ligature loops (5-0 silk) beneath the saphenous artery and tie one ligature loop towards the distal end of the artery. Place a microvascular clamp above the ligature to stop the blood flow from the iliac artery.\nTopically apply one drop of papaverine to dilate the artery and to prevent vasospasm.\nLift up the saphenous artery with the help of the tied ligature and make a small arteriotomy incision using a 24 gauge needle.\nElevate the incision flaps with fine forceps and slowly insert a vein pick or a guiding needle into the lumen of the artery.\nInsert a 2 French Fogarty arterial embolectomy catheter into the saphenous artery. Remove the vein pick and microvascular clamps.\nAdvance the catheter till the sixth mark (20 - 25 cm) corresponding to a position roughly 2-5 cm above the iliac bifurcation.",
    "Inflate the balloon with 0.1 mL normal saline using a 1 mL syringe or at a nominal pressure of 6 atm using a regulated manual inflator as described in 16,22.\nHold the balloon catheter with forceps and drag back by 6 cm through the iliac arterytoward the point of insertion, while rotating the catheter.\nDeflate the balloon by pulling back the plunger of the syringe.\nRepeat steps 2.10 to 2.13 three times to ensure complete endothelial denudation.\nRemove the catheter and immediately tie the ligature loop just above the arteriotomy site to stop bleeding.\nApply suitable antiseptic all around the periphery of the wound and swab away the blood clots. Close the skin incision with a 5-0 suture, and disinfect the surgery site with povidone-iodine solution.\nRepeat steps 2.1 to 2.16 on the contralateral iliac using a new catheter.\nSwab the ophthalmic ointment from eyes.\n3. Post-operative Care\nAdminister sulfadoxine 40 mg/kg and trimethoprim 8 mg/kg or any other suitable antibiotic immediately after the surgical procedure.\nDuring the anesthesia-recovery period, keep the rabbit over a heat pad placed in a clean autoclaved cage.\nRemove the monitoring patch and clips.\nAfter recovery, return the rabbits to their home cages. Inject subcutaneously buprenorphine 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg post -operatively every 6 - 12 h for 48 h. Continue atherogenic diet for another two weeks or four weeks.\n4. Tissue Harvesting and Analysis of Plaque Composition\nAfter two weeks (for early thin plaque) or three weeks of balloon injury, anesthetize the rabbit using isoflurane in a similar way as described above.\nOpen the thoracic cavity and euthanize the rabbits by intracardial exsanguination.\nIsolate the iliac arteries as described in 23.",
    "Briefly, open the abdomen and expose the retroperitoneum. Trace the aorta towards the iliac bifurcation and tie it above the bifurcation. Carefully remove the surrounding tissues to expose and isolate both iliac arteries.\nDissect out both iliac arteries and immerse them in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. Remove the clots with the help of forceps. Divide each iliac artery into 4 - 6 segments to characterise the thickness of the plaque throughout the artery.\nImmediately embed the arterial segments in a mold containing optimum cutting temperature compound, snap-freeze using liquid nitrogen and keep it at -70 °C. Prepare 5 µm thick sections using a cryostat as described in 24.\nPerform histology, immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining for morphometry, plaque lipid and cellular content as described in 10,25.\n\tNOTE: Briefly, rinse the arterial sections with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilize using 0.2 % Triton. Rinse the sections with PBS and block non specific sites with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Incubate the sections for 1 h at 37 °C with anti α-SM actin (1:200) or RAM11 antibody (1:200). Rinse the sections with PBS and incubate them with appropriate secondary antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. Wash again with PBS and add Hoechst (5 µg/mL) for 10 min to detect nuclei.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
