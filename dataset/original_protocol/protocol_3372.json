    "Note: Cells can be damaged by the small gauge of the insulin needle; however, insulin syringes provide a more accurate volume measurement. Keep syringes with cells on ice to avoid polymerization of the Matrigel.\nAnesthetizing the mice using isoflurane.\nNote: use isoflurane before the injection process should be less stressful for both, the mice and the researcher.\nShave the skin working area before starting to inject the cell into the left or right flank of the mice.\nOnce a small spot appears at the injection site of the mice measurements can be started.\nNote: about 10 days after cell injection depending on the number of cells injected.\nMeasurements should be carried out three times a week using a caliper.\nIn order to determine tumor volume, the greatest longitudinal diameter (length, D) and the greatest transverse diameter (width, d) were determined.\nTumor size was calculated using the formula:\nT\nu\nm\no\nr\nw\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\n(\nT\nW\n,\nm\ng\n)\n=\n(\nD\n×\nd\n2\n)\n2\n=\nm\nm\n3\nSacrifice mice and organs collection\nTiming: 30 min each animal\nThe following steps detail the essential information required to sacrifice and obtain all the collected organs. This procedure details how to obtain blood, xenograft tumor, bone marrow and spleen organ.\nNote: We recommend a direct cardiac puncture without opening the thorax for a quick and safe process.\nCritical: It requires practice and some prefer directly taking the blood from the visible heart, which particularly suits for smaller species.\nNote: Blood should be taken as soon as possible after the death of the animal as blood can coagulate rapidly.\nNote: Fix the needle to the 21G syringe and carefully loosen the needle cover. Expel the air from the syringe.",
    "Place the animal on its back, in a horizontal position. Clean the thoracic fur with ethanol.\nLocate the thoracic cage and xiphoid process (the lower part of the sternum) with one hand.\nNote: making sure that the animal is well positioned (i.e., the xiphoid process is well centered).\nWith the other hand, insert the needle under the xiphoid process at about 30 degrees to the left.\nWhile inserting the needle, gently pull the plunger to aspirate until the heart is perforated and blood begins to flow.\nAs soon as blood is flowing, continue pulling the plunger without moving the needle to avoid any more perforations in the heart, which will stop the flow.\nCritical: If no blood appears in the needle, the action should be repeated. If the flow stops rapidly, the heart may have been perforated on the back: slowly withdraw and adjust the needle to restore the flow.\nAs soon as enough blood is collected, release pressure on the plunger and withdraw the needle.\nSlowly expel the blood from the syringe into the Heparin/EDTA tubes.\nNote: To avoid damaging blood cells, we recommend disposing of the needle before expelling blood.\nOptional: A syringe previously soaked with heparin can be used. Then transfer the blood to a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge to obtain the plasma.\nTo carry out the dissection and collection of the organs of interest, put the animal ventral side up on the clean dissection board.\nClean the ventrum with ethanol to avoid introducing hairs in the body.\nPinch and raise the skin with dissecting forceps.\nCut through the body wall muscles just anterior to the genital opening and continue just to one side of the midline on the ventral side until the thoracic cavity.\nNote: Use blunt-end scissors to avoid damaging the organs.",
    "Collect the organs of interest and process them accordingly to generate single cell suspension. (To see the sample processing read the generation of single cell suspension[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.3] section).\nGeneration of single cell suspension\nSingle-cell suspension is the first step required for flow cytometry assays. Thus, the tissue samples require processing into single-cell suspension before flow cytometry analysis. This procedure details how to obtain a single cell suspension depending on the organ to be processed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nTumor tissue\nTiming: 30 min each tumor\nTake out the tumor tissue from the mice at the bench (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and wash tissue in 10 mL of PBS 1× one time.\nRemove the skin around the tumor tissue.\nCut a small piece (≈0.5 cm) with autoclaved surgical instruments.\nPut in a new plate (60 mm or 100 mm) with staining medium (See materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for its preparation).\nDisaggregate tumor tissue mechanically with the rough side of a microscope slide (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCritical: It is well disaggregated when a turbid solution with few aggregates is obtained.\nFilter the disaggregated tissue with a 40 μm strainer.\nWash the filter with staining medium to make sure it is well cleaned (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCritical: Use 50 mL sterile conical centrifuge tubes to fit the filter properly.\nPut the 50 mL tube on ice to maintain the cells alive at 4°C.\nOptional: A plunger can be used to improve cell filtration through the filter.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400–600 g for 5 min. After the centrifugation, decant off or aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells with 1 mL of staining medium on ice (4οC).\nCount total single cells with the counting chamber (Burker Camera) or using an alternative method (hemocytometer).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3139-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Note: A cytometer with 5 lasers will probably let you choose at least one fluorochrome for each laser, so a combination of 5 colors would be quite easy to achieve, while a 3-laser cytometer would let you choose just only 3 different fluorochromes minimum.\nFinal number of different fluorochromes will be determined by the number of detectors available for each laser.\nFinal number of different fluorochromes will be determined by the filter that sits in front of the detector.\nNote: All commercial cytometers have a tunable configuration that is usually set at the moment the cytometer is bought.\nNote: Sometimes some filters might be interchanged afterwards.\nYou need to be aware of these considerations and ask for this information to your flow cytometry technician to know exactly:\nHow many lasers the cytometer has.\nHow many detectors the cytometer has.\nWhich range of wavelengths is able to detect by cytometer.\nNote: Knowing all this information will allow you to be sure that the fluorochromes you have chosen will be excited and detected in your flow cytometer.\nKnow your cell type, antigens and fluorochromes\nEverything starts with understanding what the biological hypothesis is and which experiments need to be performed.\nNote: This will dictate what populations need to be identified, and what information needs to be extracted from the data.\nRank your antibodies based on cellular expression level and importance in answering the biological hypothesis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: For example, CD11b is a highly expressed antigen on monocyte population and is important in making primary gating decisions, while CD206 is a faintly expressed marker on cells undergoing activation and may be critical to answer the biological hypothesis\nSearch for the appropriate fluorochromes for each of the populations you want to determine.",
    "Note: This can be done by using a chart from different companies where fluorochromes are ranked from brightest to most dim.\nYou have to pair highly expressed antigens (such as CD11b or CD45) with dimmer fluorochromes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nYou have to pair lower expression antigens with brighter fluorochromes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPanel optimization\nOnce the fluorochromes have been selected for each of the study populations, the panel must be optimized and validated. Proper titration of antibodies, correct voltages and correcting for the spectral overlap are all part of a lengthy but very critical process to ensure that the panel works properly (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). To correct for this spectral overlap, a process of fluorescence compensation is used. This ensures that the fluorescence detected in a particular detector derives from the fluorochrome that is being measured.\nHere are some general steps for compensation and panel optimization (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nDetermine which fluorophores are involved in spectral overlap and select compensation controls.\nNote: Include an unstained sample to correct for autofluorescence inherent to cells.\nCritical: Compensation controls are samples stained with single-color antibodies that are conjugated to the same fluorophores as those used in the experiment. If sample availability is critical, consider using compensation beads instead of cells.\nCollect compensation controls and experimental samples on the flow cytometer using identical instrument settings.\nNote: Make sure that positive signal is as brighter as possible, at least as bright as your experimental sample positive signal.\nUse software to generate compensation matrices that describe the spectral overlap between the fluorophores.\nNote: These matrices are used to mathematically adjust the fluorescence signals in each channel to correct for the spectral overlap.\nApply the compensation matrices to the experimental data to correct for spectral overlap.\nAnalyze the data to identify the different cell populations.",
    "Critical: It is important to optimize the compensation settings to minimize compensation errors and to validate the compensation strategy using appropriate positive and negative controls. It is also important to note that over-compensation can lead to inaccurate measurements and should be avoided.\nControls and Fluorescent minus one (FMOs)\nSetting up the right controls is critical to determining how your cells are responding to treatment. It’s also important for correctly interpreting your data and drawing correct conclusions.\nNote: Without the proper controls, you would not be able to neither compensate your flow cytometry experiments nor to identify your cells of interest correctly (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: The Fluorescence Minus One Control (FMO) is a type of control used to properly interpret flow cytometry data. It is used to:\nIdentify and gate cells in the context of data spread due to the multiple fluorochromes in a given panel.\nUse a FMO control that contains all the fluorochromes in a panel, except the one that is being measured (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: The FMO control ensures that the any spread of the fluorochromes into the channel of interest is properly identified.\nEach day that an experiment is carried out, an unstained sample has to be run to determine the autofluorescence of the samples.\nImmune cell staining\nThe aim of this part is to accomplish identification of immune cells that infiltrate or surround the tumor cells.\nMembrane staining\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nThis section details the procedure of antibody staining of membrane antigen in single cell suspension.\nPrepare a single-cell suspension using the appropriate protocol (see Generation of single cell suspension protocol) and adjust the cell amount from 600.000 to 106 cells in staining medium in each tube.\nCentrifuge the single cell suspension 400–600 g during 5 min.",
    "Note: Prepare as many staining tubes as needed: unstained control, and individually sample for each antibody mixture panel.\nAdd the optimized dilution mixture of antibodies (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) to the respective tubes and incubate them 1 h at RT in the dark.\nCentrifuge the 1.5 mL tube at 400–600 g for 5 min.\nWash the cells once with ice-cold staining medium at 400–600 g for 5 min.\nResuspend with 100–200 μL FACS buffer.\nNote: You can repeat the washing step to better remove the antibodies before analyzing the cells in the cytometer.\nOptional: You can fix the cells with PFA 1%. If the samples are fixed, they can be stored at 4οC during 24 h before analysis, otherwise they must be analyzed the same day.\nAnalyze the stained cell preparation in the cytometer (See flow cytometry acquisition section).\nIntracellular staining\nTiming: 2 h–2 h 30 min\nThis section delineates the procedure of antibody staining of intracellular antigen in single cell suspension.\nPrepare a single cell suspension using a specific protocol depending on the tissue (See generation of single cell suspension[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.3] section).\nFirst, we have to perform the cell membrane staining protocol or cell surface markers (See membrane staining[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.14] section).\nAfter this staining, centrifuge de 1.5 mL tube at 400–600 g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 100 μL of staining medium to wash the cells.\nAfter the last wash, discard the supernatant and pulse vortex the sample to completely dissociate the pellet.\nCritical: You should obtain a good suspension of individual cells in order to have a good preparation. You can also pipette up and down the pellet to homogenize better.\nFix the cells by adding 200 μL of Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer (Invitrogen, cat. no. 00-5123-43) (1:3 dilution with Fixation/Permeabilization Diluent (Invitrogen, cat. no. 00-5223-56) to each 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Pipette up and down the pellet to homogenize better.\nIncubate 30–60 min at RT.\nNote: Protect from light.\nOptional: Samples can be incubated for up to 18 h at 2°C–8°C in the dark.\nCentrifuge samples at 400–600 g at room temperature for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL 1× Permeabilization Buffer (Invitrogen, cat. no. 00-8333-56) (1 part of 10× Permeabilization Buffer with 9 parts of Milli-Q water) to each tube.\nCentrifuge samples 400–600 g at room temperature for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRepeat Step 69.\nResuspend pellet in residual volume.\nOptional: Block with 2% normal mouse/rat serum by adding 2 μL directly to the cells. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nWithout washing, add the recommended amount of directly conjugated antibody for the detection of intracellular antigen(s)/markers (See Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nIncubate for at least 30 min at RT in the dark.\nCentrifuge samples at 400–600 g at room temperature for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of 1× Permeabilization Buffer to each 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge samples at 400–600 g at RT for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRepeat Step 73.\nResuspend stained cells in an appropriate volume of Flow Cytometry Buffer (100–200 μL of FACSFlow).\nAnalyze by flow cytometry (See flow cytometry acquisition and phenotyping section).\nFlow cytometry acquisition\nFlow cytometer setup and quality control\nTiming: 1 h\nSetting up a flow cytometer involves several steps. Here are some general steps that may vary slightly depending on the specific flow cytometer model.\nPower on the flow cytometer and the computer that controls it.\nCheck that the lasers are working correctly and calibrated according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\nSet up the appropriate filters and detectors for the fluorophores used in the experiment.",
    "Adjust the gain and voltage settings for the detectors to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio for each fluorescence channel.\nPerform a quality control check with calibration beads to ensure the flow cytometer is working correctly.\nRun compensation tubes to perform compensation and correct for the spectral overlap. Once voltage settings are properly set and compensation done, make sure that your experimental samples are recorded using the same settings.\nPrepare the sample and load it into the sample injection port or chamber.\nRun the sample through the flow cytometer and collect data.\nAnalyze the data using appropriate software such as FlowJo 8.7 (FlowJo Software, BD) or BD FACSDiva Software to generate scatter plots and histograms to identify the different cell populations.\nNote: It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for specific flow cytometer models and to maintain and clean the instrument regularly to ensure optimal performance.\nCollecting samples\nTiming: 1–4 h depending on the tubes\nThis step details the acquisition of our samples using the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer from our institution.\nNote: You might have to modify this step to accommodate to your institute’s instruments and guidelines (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nTransfer the samples to individual FACS tubes.\nNote: If your instrument has a plate reader attached follow your institute’s core facility’s guidelines.\nUse your unstained control to set the voltages of your FSC-A, SSC-A plot depending on the cell type (Blood, Bone Marrow, Spleen or Tumor cells (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D).\nIn the FSC-A and SSC-A plot, draw a gate around all cell events profile (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nIn the FSC-A and FSC-H plot, draw a gate around the diagonal to select only the single cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nDraw other dot plots showing the different fluorochromes combinations depending on each immune panel.",
    "Note: Use your FMO controls to set the proper gates in each dot plot.\nNote: These controls will allow you to identify data spread in your fluorochrome combinations (see controls and fluorescent minus one (FMOs)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.12] section).\nNote: Once spread has been identified, the gate will be correctly set to show real positivity/negativity for a given marker.\nAcquire all samples and ensure that record at least 10.000 events of your selected population.\nPerform the acquisition of the stained tubes using the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer.\nOnce acquisition is completed, export your data according to your institute’s core facility’s guidelines.\nNote: This procedure will be explained in detail in the next section.\nUsing BD FACSDiva (or the available acquisition software in your institute’s core facility) create a new data acquisition matrix."
