    "All animal care and experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (Permission No.: SYXK (Beijing) 2013-0023). The origin of apoE-/- mice is C57BL/6J9,10.\n1. Bilateral Ovariectomy via a Double Dorsal-lateral Incision in apoE-/- Mice\nAt weaning (age 28 days), anesthetize female apoE-/- C57BL/6J mice with avertin (tribromoethanol; 200 mg/kg; intraperitoneally).\nNOTE: 32 apoE-/- mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: SHAM, OVX, OVX/E2, and OVX/PPD group (n = 8 per group).\nPlace the animal in prone position on a heating pad. Apply eye lubricant for eye protection during anesthesia.\nMaintain body temperature within 36 ± 0.5 °C. Administer 5 mg/kg body weight of the analgesic carprofen subcutaneously to the lateral aspect of the mouse’s neck.\nShave a 3 x 5 cm2 mouse area cephalic from the iliac crest. Prior to covering the animal with a 3 x 5 cm2 aperture surgical sheet, clean the shaved area thoroughly with iodine and then 70% ethanol. Use sterile instruments and gloves during the experiment. \nUse scissors and forceps to make an incision 1 cm lateral to the midline and 1 cm lateral to the costal ribs.\nBluntly dissect the subcutaneous tissue using forceps.\nUse dissecting goggles (see Table of Materials) to identify the white adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity.\nUse microscissors and microforceps to make a 0.5-1 cm incision through the fascia until the abdominal cavity is reached.\nNOTE: For the sham-operated group, close the wounds directly. Suture the muscle layer and skin separately using a monofilament suture.",
    "When the white adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity can be seen, grab the adipose tissue using microforceps and gently pull it out. A pink mulberry-shaped ovary wrapped by adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity can be seen.\nLigate the 0.5-1 cm proximal vessel and the uterine horn using a monofilament suture. Remove the ovary using microscissors and place the remaining tissue back into the abdominal cavity.\nNOTE: The main adverse symptoms for the OVX operation is ureteral ligation which leads to high mortality in OVX-operated mice. This can be avoided by identifying the tissues using a dissecting goggle.\nClose the wounds. Suture the muscle layer and skin separately using a monofilament suture.\nUse scissors and forceps to make another incision 1 cm lateral to the midline and 1 cm lateral to the costal ribs on the other side. Repeat the above procedure (1.5 to 1.11).\nLet the animal wake from anesthesia. Separately keep the mouse on the first day after surgery.\nClean or replace the cage frequently during the recovery phase.\nApproximately 24 h after surgery, administer another 5 mg/kg body weight of the analgesic carprofen subcutaneously.\n2. Peroral Administration of 17β-estradiol or PPD via Hazelnut Spread\nThoroughly dissolve 17β-estradiol or PPD in sesame oil, and then mix the sesame oil with hazelnut spread (see Table of Materials). A daily portion for each 30 g mouse contains 3 μg of 17β-estradiol or 15 μg of PPD, 4 μL of sesame oil, and 60 mg of hazelnut spread. Prepare a placebo for each 30 g mouse contains 4 μL of sesame oil and 60 mg of hazelnut spread.\nNOTE: The daily administration portion of 17β-estradiol or PPD was based on previous studies6,11 and preliminary experiments.",
    "One week after OVX, feed the mice with a high-cholesterol diet (1.25% cholesterol, 0% cholate) for 12 weeks. A typical experimental treatment scheme, as used in this study, is illustrated in Figure 1.\n5 days before the peroral administration of hazelnut spread at week 4, train the mice to eat the placebo containing approximately 30 mg hazelnut spread for 2-5 mice for 5 days. Train the mice in groups in their home cages during the first 3 days. Place the mice in separate cages on the fourth and fifth days of training and serve the daily portion to resemble the experimental situation.\nDuring the last 9 weeks, place the mice in separate cages and then serve a daily portion the hazelnut spread portion for every feeding occasion.\nNOTE: Serve a daily portion containing 17β-estradiol (0.1 mg·kg-1) or PPD (0.5 mg·kg-1) via hazelnut spread in OVX/E2 and OVX/PPD group respectively; serve a daily portion containing hormone-free hazelnut spread in SHAM and OVX group.\n3. Determination of Intima-media Thickness and Cardiac Dysfunction Using a Microultrasound System\nUltrasonographic biomicroscopy\nOne day before termination, examine intima-media thickness and cardiac dysfunction using a microultrasound system (see Table of Materials) as previously described21.\nBefore examination, give each mouse a 200 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of avertin (tribromoethanol) as anesthesia (n = 8 mice per group).\nShave the neck hair of each mouse carefully. Apply warm ultrasound transmission gel liberally to ensure optimal image quality.\nObtain baseline ultrasonographic images of the aortic root and ascending aorta with the 30 MHz scan head at a 12.7 mm focus and a resolution of 40 μm.\nUse electrocardiography with a lead II configuration for monitoring.\nCapture right parasternal long-axis images of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and brachiocephalic artery branch in one plane in systole (Figure 3).",
    "Measurements of intima-media and maximal plaque thickness\nAdjust the distance between the transducer and the arterial site readily to obtain clear images.\nStore a 10 s cine loop digitally for offline examination on an image analysis system.\nChoose an optimal freeze-frame ultrasonographic image manually for further measurements. Check the images in the minor curvature of the ascending aorta. If plaque in the ascending aorta can be seen, measure the maximal plaque thickness. If plaque in the ascending aorta cannot be seen, measure the maximal IMT.\nMeasure the IMT (distance between the vascular luminal-intimal interface and the medial-adventitial interface). Measure the maximal plaque thickness (the thickest distance between the border of the vascular lumen and adventitial layer).\nAverage data from three lesion sites (Figure 3).\nDetermination of cardiac dysfunction using echocardiography\n\tNOTE: Examine cardiac function through echocardiography using a microultrasound system, as previously described22.\n\t\nDirect an ultrasound beam toward the heart, near the papillary muscles.\nAchieve two-dimensional electrocardiogram-based kilohertz visualization.\nPerform in vivo transthoracic echocardiography of the left ventricle using a 30 MHz scan head.\nMeasure parameters associated with cardiac function digitally from M-mode tracings.\nAverage the data from three to five cardiac cycles (Table 1).\nIntra- and interobserver variability\nFor validation of intraobserver variability, analyze the data by one operator on two different occasions.\nFor evaluation of interobserver variability, analyze the data by a different operator.\n4. Weekly Body Weight Measurement and Plasma Total Cholesterol (TC) and Triglyceride (TG) Determination\nWeekly body weight measurement\nMeasure body weights once a week from week -1 to week 12.\nNOTE: n = 8 mice per group.\nPlasma preparation",
    "Before collecting blood samples through intracardiac puncture, prepare syringes and tubes. Use EDTA as an anticoagulant. Add 10 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to each 2 mL syringe, and add 8 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to each 1.5 mL tube.\nAt week 12, after an overnight fast, anesthetize the mice with avertin (tribromoethanol; 200 mg/kg; intraperitoneally).\nNOTE: n = 3 mice per group.\nPrepare the ventral chest area with 70% ethanol.\nUse scissors and forceps to open the thoracic cavity and cut the ribs until the beating heart is exposed.\nInsert the 25 G needle into the right ventricle. Aspirate slowly until blood starts to flow into the syringe.\nNOTE: We use disposable syringes in sterile condition with 25 G needles (see Table of Materials).\nContinue to aspirate with steady, even pressure. If no blood is seen, reposition the needle and repeat aspiration.\nKeep mice deeply anesthetized before collecting the required blood volume. Normally, up to 1 mL of blood can be collected. Euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation under this deep anesthetic condition.\nPipette blood samples into 1.5 mL tubes and invert the blood thoroughly to ensure mixing EDTA into the blood. Then place blood samples on ice immediately.\nCentrifuge samples for 20 min at 400 x g at 4 °C within 30 min of collection.\nCollect the supernatant carefully. Aliquot and store plasma samples at -80 °C.\nConstruct standard curves for TC or TG content measurement",
    "For the TC standard curve, prepare various concentrations of cholesterol standards: 0 mmol/L, 0.52 mmol/L, 1.03 mmol/L, 2.07 mmol/L, 4.14 mmol/L, 6.20 mmol/L, 8.27 mmol/L and 10.34 mmol/L. Measure O.D. for each cholesterol standard. Set average O.D. for each cholesterol standard. As the vertical (Y) axis value, set concentration as the horizontal (X) axis value. Create a standard curve by using a statistical software.\nFor the TG standard curve, prepare various concentrations of TG standards: 0 mmol/L, 0.45 mmol/L, 0.90 mmol/L, 1.81 mmol/L, 3.62 mmol/L, 5.42 mmol/L, 7.23 mmol/L and 9.04 mmol/L. Measure O.D. for each TG standard. Set average O.D. for each TG standard as the vertical (Y) axis value; set concentration as the horizontal (X) axis value. Create a standard curve by using a statistical software.\nNOTE: A four-parameter Logistic curve fitting (4-pl) was used for the standard curve construction in the present study. Check the standard curve before measuring the plasma samples and ensure that r2 is greater than 0.995.\nTC content measurement\nLabel the bottle of color reagent (25 mL) from TC assay kit as “TC Working Solution”.\nVortex the refrigerated specimens briefly. Prepare dilutions: 20 μL of plasma in 80 μL of distilled water. Briefly vortex dilutions.\nAdd 2.5 μL of cholesterol standards (5.17 mmol/L) or 2.5 μL of diluted plasma or 2.5 μL of distilled water (blank) to the appropriate wells of a 96-well plate. Triplication is recommended.\nTo all wells, add 250 μL of the color reagent.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nTurn the microplate reader on and allow a 10 min warm up.\nRemove the plate(s) from the incubator and read the microplate reader at 510 nm. Ensure that no bubbles or dust are present in the microtiter wells or at the bottom of the plate, respectively.",
    "Calculate the TC concentration as follows:\n\t\t​TC cont. = cholesterol standards cont. × (plasma sample O.D.-blank O.D)/(cholesterol standards O.D.-blank O.D)\nTG content measurement\nLabel the bottle of color reagent (25 mL) from TG assay kit as “TG Working Solution”.\nVortex the refrigerated specimens briefly.\nAdd 2.5 μL of TG standards (2.26 mmol/L) to or 2.5 μL of diluted plasma or 2.5 μL of distilled water (blank) to the appropriate wells of a 96-well plate.

En Face Analysis of Aortic Atherosclerotic Lesions\nAorta isolation and excision\nAt week 12, after an overnight fast, anesthetize the mice with avertin (tribromoethanol; 200 mg/kg; intraperitoneally). Euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation under this deep anesthetic condition.\nNOTE: We used 3 mice per group.\nPrepare the ventral chest area with 70% ethanol. Use scissors and forceps to open the thoracic cavity and cut the ribs until the beating heart is exposed.\nFill a 50 mL syringe with phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4 (see Table of Materials). Insert a 25 G of needle into the left ventricle and cut the right atrium to avoid high pressure from perfusion.\nPerform in situ perfusion at a flow rate of 0.05-0.08 mL/min. Absorb perfusion fluid with tissues.",
    "Remove ribs and lungs in thoracic cavity with scissors and forceps. Then, open the abdominal cavity and remove the organs inside for a better view of the aorta.\nRemove the aorta by holding the heart with the microforceps and separating the aorta from spine dorsally with microscisssors until the iliac bifurcation.\nNOTE: When dissecting near the renal atrial branches, cut deeply using microscissors to avoid aorta damage.\nFix the heart and aorta for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. Store the aortas in saline at room temperature or at 2-8 °C for a few hours.\nNOTE: This procedure will facilitate cleaning.\nPreparation of aorta\nRemove the heart. Carefully remove the adventitial tissues from the aortas using microforceps and microscisssors under a stereomicroscope. Use saline to keep the tissue moist during cleaning.\nNOTE: Be careful to not tear or nick the aorta and some important branches, such as the innominate artery, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery.\nLeave 1 mm of the innominate and left common carotid arteries and cut off the entire left subclavian artery.\nCut open the outer curvature through the innominate artery, then to the left common carotid artery, and then to the left subclavian artery.\nCut open along the inner curvature of the ascending portion to the bottom of the abdominal portion.\nPin the aorta flat onto a black plastic sheet and apply saline to keep aortas from drying.\nImage of the intimal region of aorta\nTake pictures of en face aortas with a stereo microscope. Include a millimeter scale ruler in the images to calibrate measurements.\nInclude the arch and thoracic regions in the same image and the abdominal region in another. Save images as JPEG or TIFF.",
    "NOTE: The arch region is from the junction of the myocardium to 3 mm distal from the left subclavian artery, the thoracic region is 3 mm distal to the left subclavian artery to the last intercostal artery, and the abdominal region is the last intercostal artery to the iliac bifurcation.\nQuantification of atherosclerotic lesion-en face method\nCalibration\n\t\t\nOpen the image with image analysis software (see Table of Materials), go to Spatial Calibration and follow the instructions.\nChange reference units to mm by positioning the ruler over the line.\nMeasurement\n\t\t\nSet correct calibration for each image.\nMeasure 3 mm on the ruler.\nArch and thoracic region measurement: Outline the arch region from the junction of the myocardium to 3 mm distal from the left subclavian artery and the thoracic region from 3 mm distal to the left subclavian artery to the last intercostal artery. Trace lesions in the arch and thoracic region and look at the aorta through the microscope.\nAbdominal region measurement: Outline the abdominal region from the end of thoracic region to the iliac bifurcation. Trace lesions in the abdominal region and look at the aorta through the microscope.\nCalculate the lesion area relative to the inner surface of aorta.\nVerify quantification through a second observer who is blind to the study groups.\nSubscription Required.
