    "1. Preparing for the Procedure\nOne must first obtain and prepare the following items:\nThe cannula. For intubation of 20-35 g mice, we use a 1 or 1.5 inch long, 20 gauge IV catheter (BD Insylte, Sparks, MD or Jelco Optiva, Carlsbad, CA). A new sterile catheter can be used for each mouse, but catheters can also be reused after sterilization by soaking in 70% ethanol overnight.  Although neither the pharynx nor trachea of the mouse is sterile proper cleanliness procedures, including the use of sterile gloves and instruments, should be followed.",
    "The fiberoptic cable. We use ≈70 cm of 0.5 mm optical cable from Edmund Optics, but the length is not critical. It is important to make sure the fiber has its edge smoothed, since after cutting the cable to length with a razor, the edge is left relatively sharp, and it does not take much effort to pierce the tracheal wall. However, it is very easy to smooth this edge by holding the fiber about 2 cm from the end and then making small circles for a few seconds with the edges of the tip touching a piece of 1,000 grit emery paper (see demonstration in the video and Figure 1 of Macdonald, et al. 10). The other end is inserted through a rubber stopper. This is most easily accomplished by first pushing an 18-gauge needle through the stopper, inserting the optical fiber through the needle bore, then withdrawing the needle. The rubber stopper is connected to a 150 watt halogen light source (e.g. NCL-150, Volpi USA, or any other or light source, even less than 150 watts). It is important to make sure to use a stopper made of silicone rubber (or other heat resistant material), since ordinary rubber or cork may burn when located so close to the hot light source.\n2. Performing the Intubation",
    "See Figures 1 and 2. Insert fiber optic cable through a short piece of silicone rubber tubing (≈0.8 mm ID x 4 mm OD, Cole-Palmer, EW-96410-13). Tie this rubber tube fairly tight, while still allowing the fiber optic cable to be adjusted. Inserting the silicone tubing snugly in the Luer end of the cannula fixes the fiber optic cable's position inside the cannula. Adjust the position of the fiberoptic cable so that it extends through the cannula ≈4 mm in front of the cannula tip.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on a vertical support, suspended by its upper incisors (Figure 3). Most investigators find the best visualization with the ventral side of the mouse facing themselves. Very gently pull out the tongue and hold with thumb and forefinger. The middle finger is placed between the neck and plastic support. Traction on the tongue with the index finger and thumb is used to open the mouth, and to straighten the intubation path, the angle of the head is adjusted with the middle finger behind the neck shown in Figure 3.\nUsing the fiber optic cable as a light source and introducer, push it through the visualized vocal cords. If the cords are not visible, gently pull harder on the tongue using the middle finger as support. When inserted, advance the cannula ≈5 mm further. Then, being very careful not to move the cannula, withdraw the fiber optic cable. Lie the mouse down and secure the cannula with a piece of tape and support the cannula hub on a piece of Plasticine (modeling clay), as shown in Figure 4.",
    "The procedure in step 3 cannot be easily taught or even demonstrated, since it is a solo operation. However, by subtle adjustments of the traction on the tongue and the support behind the head nearly all who try this soon find the right way to position the mouse to visualize the vocal cords.\nSubscription Required.
