    "The administration instructions provided here are similar to those that have been approved previously by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Irvine.\n1. Equipment\nTest participants in a child-safe room that has an adult-sized table with three chairs (one for the researcher, one for the parent, and one for the child). Alternatively, test children in their homes at their own table or on a portable table provided by the researchers.\nUse a video camera placed on a tripod to record the child (audio and video) as he/she participates in the study. Place the video camera so that the recording clearly shows the participant and the object of his/her gaze as well as each of the completed target actions.\n2. Testing Procedures\nWarm-up\n\t\nSeat the child directly across from the researcher at the adult-sized table. Sit children younger than 13 months old on the lap of a parent. Sit older children on a booster seat that is attached to an adult-sized chair unless they request to sit on the parent's lap. If the child is seated in a booster seat, sit the parent at the table next to the child.\nEngage the child in play with age-appropriate toys unrelated to the study so as to establish comfort with the researcher and the testing environment. Next, show children younger than 13 months old how to put a shape into the top or the side of a commercially-available shape sorter toy while narrating the action by saying, \"Put it in.\"26,27,43-45 Give older children a plastic ball and Slinky. Roll the ball across the table while saying \"Roll it\" and then put the ball inside of the Slinky while saying, \"Put it in.\"\nConduct each demonstration twice in succession before allowing the child the opportunity to imitate.",
    "Proceed once the child has interacted and shared toys with the researcher.\nBaseline\n\t\nPut the sequence materials for the first event on the table; ensure that the same standardized order is used across participants.\nPush the props towards the child while providing a general verbal prompt to encourage interaction with the sequence materials, such as, \"What can you do with this stuff?\".\nProvide positive reinforcement as the child interacts with the props, both when he/she performs the target actions and when he/she is engaging with the sequence materials more generally. For example, say, \"Good job!\" or \"That's a neat idea!\" as the child explores the props. If the child does not interact with the first sequence at baseline, repeat Section 2.1.2.\nIf the child appears distracted, call his/her name or tap on the sequence materials in an attempt to redirect his/her attention to the task.28 Ensure that the props are not tapped in a manner that is suggestive of target actions or the order of their completion. Avoid use of phrases that suggest temporal order information, such as \"What do you do next?\" or \"Then what?\".\nAllow children younger than 13 months between 1½ and 2 minutes to interact with the props.26,27,43-45 Terminate the baseline period for older children when the child engages in repetitive or off-task behaviors such as mouthing the props, repeatedly banging them on the table, or dropping them on the floor.28,31,33,42 Model each sequence immediately after the baseline phase of testing for that sequence is terminated.\nSequence Modeling\n\t\nBring the sequence materials back to the researcher's side of the table.\nReturn the sequence materials to their original, standardized positions in the researcher's lap (so the child cannot see what the researcher is doing) and put them back on the table.",
    "Make eye contact with the child. Provide him/her with the name of the sequence using infant-directed speech. For example, for the event Make a Shaker, say, \"I can use this stuff to Make a Shaker. Watch how I Make a Shaker with this stuff.\"\nPerform each target action with narration. For the event Make a Shaker, put the block into one of the two nesting cups while saying, \"Put in the block.\" Cover one of the nesting cups with the other while saying, \"Cover it up.\" Shake the assembled apparatus while saying, \"Shake it!\".\nPut all of the props back on the table, make eye contact with the child, and say, \"That's how I Make a Shaker with this stuff!\".\nEnsure that the child watches the researcher complete each of the demonstrated actions. If the child appears distracted, see Section 2.2.4.\nReturn the sequence materials to their original positions as indicated in Section 2.3.2.\nRe-model the actions required to complete event sequence one more time (2 demonstrations total) as indicated in Sections 2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, and 2.3.6.\nIf immediate imitation is not permitted, repeat Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 for each of the remaining event sequences in turn.\nImmediate Imitation\n\t\nBring the sequence materials back to the researcher's side of the table.\nReturn the sequence materials to their original, standardized positions (so the child cannot see what the researcher is doing) and put them back on the table.\nPush the props towards the child while providing the name of the event sequence as a retrieval cue. For example, when testing immediate imitation for Make a Shaker, say, \"You can use this stuff to Make a Shaker. How do you Make a Shaker just like I did?\".",
    "Allow children younger than 13 months old between 1½ and 2 minutes to interact with the props.26,27,43,44 Terminate the imitation period for older children when the child engages in the repetitive or off-task behaviors listed in Section 2.2.5.28,31,33,42\nProvide positive reinforcement as the child interacts with the sequences as indicated in Section 2.2.3.\nRepeat Section 2.2.4 if the child appears distracted during the imitation period.\nIf immediate imitation is permitted, repeat Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 for each of the remaining event sequences in turn.\nAdditional Re-exposure Sessions (After Delays of Days to Weeks)\n\t\nComplete the warm-up procedure described in Section 2.1.2.\nRe-model the included event sequences as described in Section 2.3.\nIf immediate imitation is permitted, complete the immediate imitation procedure as described in Section 2.4. If immediate imitation is not permitted, allow the child to play with commercially-available distracter toys between sequence demonstrations so as to maintain his/her interest in the task.26,28,43,46\nRepeat Sections 2.5.2 and 2.5.3 for each of the remaining event sequences in turn.\nDelayed Recall\n\t\nComplete the warm-up procedure described in Section 2.1.2.\nPut the sequence materials for the first event on the table; ensure that the same standardized order is used across participants and sessions.\nPush the props towards the child while providing the name of the event sequence as a retrieval cue. For example, when testing delayed recall for Make a Shaker, say, \"You can use this stuff to Make a Shaker. How do you Make a Shaker with this stuff?\".",
    "Allow children younger than 13 months old between 1½ and 2 minutes to interact with the props.26,27,43-45 Terminate the imitation period for older children when the child engages in the repetitive or off-task behaviors listed in Section 2.2.5.28,31,33,42 Participants may or may not reproduce the demonstrated target actions during the delayed recall period.\nProvide positive reinforcement as the child interacts with the sequences as indicated in Section 2.2.3.\nRepeat Section 2.2.4 if the child appears distracted during the delayed recall period.\nRepeat Sections 2.6.2 through 2.6.6 for each of the remaining event sequences in turn.\nData Coding and Reduction\n\t\nCreate coding rules for each event. The coding rules sheet includes description of when the child receives credit for completing an action and when credit is not awarded. Award credit when the child achieves the action demonstrated by the researcher or when the child clearly attempts to complete the action (intention can be determined in part by watching the child's gaze). Importantly, in all cases, write coding rules so that the child can complete the target actions in any order.\nCreate a data coding sheet that lists each of the included event sequences and the possible steps for each event.\nHave research assistants code videos that have been previously coded by the principal investigator or a senior lab member.\nWhile watching the videos, circle each target action completed by the child in the temporal order in which the actions are produced.\nCompare the codes by assigning a plus to each agreement and a minus to each disagreement. Train research assistants up to a reliability criterion of at least 90% on three consecutive participants before allowing them to code the study data.",
    "Compute the overall reliability by dividing the total number of agreements to the total number of codes. More commonly, reliability is coded by counting only the first occurrence of each coded action so as to reduce the likelihood of receiving credit for actions performed by chance or trial-and-error.26-28,31,33,42-45\nHave the trained coder score the remaining videos or have the tester code the data as they are collected (recommended only when participants are 13 months or older29,31).\nReduce the data to determine the number of target actions and pairs of actions produced for each event at each phase of testing (for example, baseline, immediate imitation, and delayed recall). Only the first occurrence of each target action is commonly considered during data reduction so as to reduce the likelihood of awarding credit for actions produced by chance or trial-and-error.28 Count the number of unique target actions that were coded by sequence (for example, a participant would receive a score of 3 target actions if he/she produced the following sequence of actions: 3-1-2-3).\nCount the number of pairs of actions completed by sequence when considering only the first time each target action was completed (for example, a participant would receive a score of 1 pair of actions if he/she produced the following sequence of actions: 3-1-2-3; a participant would also receive a score of 1 pair of actions if he/she produced the following sequence of actions: 1-3-2-1).\n\t\tNote: The maximum number of target actions possible is the total number of steps in the sequence, whereas the maximum number of pairs of actions is the maximum number of target actions possible minus one.\nCreate averages indicating the number of target actions performed at each phase of testing (baseline, immediate imitation, and delayed recall, for example), and for each condition (if applicable).",
    "Note: The elicited imitation procedure is administered and scored in the same way whether researchers use sequences with enabling, mixed, or arbitrary associations.28\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53347/53347fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Sample Data Coding Sheet for the Three-step Enabling Event Sequence Make a Shaker. The three target actions (\"Put it in,\" \"Cover it up,\" and \"Shake it\") are shown multiple times for each of three phases of testing (baseline, immediate imitation, and delayed recall).
