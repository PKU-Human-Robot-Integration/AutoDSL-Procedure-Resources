    "Grow MΦs (in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator) in 75 cm2 culture flask in RPMI- complete media until 80% confluency (Note 1).    Change old media (remove old media by aspiration and add fresh RPMI-complete media) and detach Mϕs with a cell scraper.   Carefully pipette culture up and down until pellet is dissolved.   Centrifuge in 15 ml Falcon tubes at 1,200 rpm for 5 min (Note 2).   Remove supernatant and re-suspend pellet in the same volume of RPMI-Strep media (Note 3).    Count MΦs in the Neubauer cell counter with Trypan blue dye (use 10 μl of cell suspension with 10 μl of dye). Allow the dye to stain for approximately 5 to 15 min. If cells are exposed to extended period of time to this dye, viable cells, as well as nonviable cells, may begin to uptake dye.   Approximately 0.7-1.3 x 106 cells/ml activate with CpG-ODN at a final concentration of 2 µg/µl for 24 h in 10 cm2 flask (8 ml total volume) (Note 4).    Grow separately evolved E. coli - CFP (or YFP) and ancestral E. coli - YFP (or CFP) bacterial populations from the frozen stock in RPMI-Strep media (3 ml of the total volume for each well) in the 12-well plates for 24 h (for the evolved E. coli - CFP (or YFP) please see our other protocol “Evolution of Escherichia coli to Macrophage Cell Line[href=http://www.bio-protocol.org/e1227]” (Miskinyte and Gordo, 2014).   After 24 h repeat steps 2-6, but for the step 4 use 1,000 rpm instead of 1,200.    Seed 0.8-1.6 x 106 cells/ml in 12-well microtiter plates (3 ml total volume for each well).   Allow cells to attach in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h.   Mix E. coli - CFP (evolved) with E. coli - YFP (ancestral) at a ratio of 1 to 1.",
    "Count numbers of CFP (Nie) and YFP (Nia) bacteria before competition in the mixture by using 2 μm size beads in the flow cytometer (Note 5).    Wash MΦs with RPMI-Strep media (remove old media by aspiration and add fresh RPMI-Strep media).   Infect MΦs at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 to 1 (mixture of 106 bacteria/ml to 106 MΦs/ml).   After 24 h of infection, detach MΦs with a cell scraper and centrifuge culture at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. This procedure lyses MΦs and releases intracellular bacteria (Note 6).   Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 ml of PBS.   Dilute bacteria in PBS and count CFP (Nfe) and YFP (Nfa) bacterial numbers after competition in Flow cytometer.   Use Formula 1 to calculate relative fitness increase of the evolved bacteria over the ancestral.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140831/20140831235658_7973.jpg Formula 1. Selection coeficient, a measure of relative fitness increase. Scoef is the selective advantage of the evolved strain e over the ancestral strain a, Nfe and Nfa are the numbers of evolved (e) and ancestral (a) bacteria after competition and Nia and Nie are the initial numbers, before the competition."
