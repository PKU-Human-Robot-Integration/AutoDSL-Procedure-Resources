    "Preparing the cellsMaintain the cells in cell medium (see Recipes) in 75 cm2 T-flasks at 37°C under 5% CO2.Harvest the cells by washing the flask one time at RT with 5 ml of PBS at room temperature (RT), followed by incubation at 37°C with 2 ml of trypsin-EDTA for 5 min.Transfer the cells from the flask to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Centrifuge the cells at RT for 5 min at 1,200 × g.Remove the supernatant with a 1 ml pipette.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of cell medium at 37°C, by pipetting the solution up and down five times.Take a sample of 50 μl from the cell solution, and mix 1:1 with trypan blue in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Count the cells with a cytometer cell countess.Dilute as necessary by adding cell medium to reach a concentration of 800,000 cells/ml (stock for calibration curve). A total of 2 ml is necessary.If the cells to be quantified were cultured and grew in different media than the one described here, the exact same conditions should apply to cells for the calibration curve.Preparing the calibration curveAdd 1 ml of fresh medium to wells 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, and 5A of a 24-well plate.Place 2 ml of 800,000 cells/ml (stock for calibration curve, see A9) in well 6A.Take 1 ml from well 6A, and transfer it to the adjacent well (5A).Mix by gently pipetting five times with a 1 ml pipette.Take 1 ml from well 5A, and transfer it to the adjacent well (4A).Mix by gently pipetting five times with a 1 ml pipette.Take 1 ml from well 4A, and transfer it to the adjacent well (3A).Mix by gently pipetting five times with a 1 ml pipette.Take 1 ml from well 3A, and transfer it to the adjacent well (2A).",
    "Mix by gently pipetting five times with a 1 ml pipette.Take 1 ml from well 2A and dispose of it.Well 1A contains only 1 ml of fresh medium for negative control.Wells 2A-6A contain 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 400,000, and 800,000 cells, respectively (Figure 1).Use another 24-well plate if there are more than 18 samples. In that case, prepare another calibration curve in the new plate as described above.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4254/bioprotoc-11-23-4254-g001.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of the calibration curve. The cell stock was brought to 800,000 cells/ml, and 2 ml of it were added to well 6A in a 24 well plate. In the same row, 1 ml of culture medium was placed in the other five wells (1A-5A). A serial dilution was performed by taking 1 ml of 800,000 cell/ml from well A6 to the adjacent well (5A), and serially across the entire row so that wells contained 800,000, 400,000, 200,000, 100,000, and 50,000 cells. The last well in the row (1A) was left with 1 ml fresh medium as a blank control.Determining the number of cells on carrierAdd 1 ml of cell medium to all empty wells in rows B, C, and D in the plate.Place one carrier in a well containing 1ml of fresh medium.Add 100 µl of Alamar blue to all wells in the plate.Cover the plate with aluminum foil (protect from light).Incubate the plate for 1 h at 37°C.Read the plate in the SPARK plate reader, with Ex 550 nm, Em 580 nm filters."
