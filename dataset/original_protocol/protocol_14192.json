    "1. Preparation of Cell Plates\nNOTE: Prepare the cell plates 3–4 weeks before the measurement of drug effects.\nDay 0 of the experiment\nNOTE: For planning purposes, the test compound application can be performed on any day between days 22–28 of the experiment.\n\t\nTurn on the water bath at 37 °C and warm 40 mL of plating medium (as supplied by the manufacturer).\n\t\tNOTE: Use the cells with their supplier-provided matching culture and maintenance media.\nThaw the hiPSC-CM by placing the cryotubes containing frozen cells in the water bath for 2 min.\nTransfer the 1 mL cell suspensions carefully to a 50 mL conical tube.\nWash each cryotube with 1 mL of warm plating medium to retrieve the leftover cells and add the wash media to the same conical tube from step 1.1.3 containing cells.\nMix carefully another 8 mL of warm plating medium into the cell suspension.\nCount live cells using the trypan blue exclusion method and a hematocytometer8.\nNOTE: The requirement of 6 x 106 cells for one 384-well cell plate considers the possibility of up to 20% dead cells among the frozen cells, which is a maximum in our experience.\nAdjust the cell suspension to 5 x 105 live cells/mL with the warm plating medium.\nDistribute the cell suspension into two 384-well cell plates by adding 25 µL to each well (about 12,500 cells per well).\n\t\tNOTE: The cell plates do not need to be precoated with any matrix (see Discussion).\nMaintain the cell plates at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\nDay 1 of the experiment\n\t\nTurn on the water bath at 37 °C and warm 50 mL of maintenance medium supplemented with 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin solution.",
    "Replace the plating medium with 50 µL of warm maintenance medium in each well of the cell plates.\nDays 2–21 (up to day 27) of the experiment\nNOTE: The hiPSC-CMs do not need any passaging over this period, as they are non-dividing cells.\n\t\nRenew half of the maintenance medium every 2–3 days and renew it entirely on days 7, 14, and 21.\n\t\tNOTE: The fluorescence measurement can be performed between days 22 and 28 of the experiment. Longer durations have not been tried but may still be fine.\n2. Preparation of Instrument, Compound Plates, and Assay Plates\nNOTE: Prepare the instrument, compound plates, and assay plates on the day of the measurement of drug effects, between days 22 and 28 of the experiment. Use a fluorescent plate reader equipped with temperature control and an appropriate fluorescence filter kit and excitation light source. For example, use a Fluo-3/Fluo-4/Fluo-8 fluorescence filter kit (excitation: 472 nm; emission: 520–560 nm) and a 150 W excitation light source unit.\nAt least 2 h before the first cell plate is to be placed inside the plate reader for the measurement, turn on the reader and set the heating system at 37 °C.\nNOTE: This can also be done the evening before.\nPrepare the positive controls, forskolin, N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine, and E-4031 as stock solutions of 0.33 mM in DMSO, 10 mM in DMSO, and 3.33 mM in H2O, respectively.\nNOTE: Stock solutions will be diluted 333-fold by the time they are added to the cells, and the aim is to achieve final test concentrations of 1 µM forskolin, 30 µM N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine, and 10 µM E-4031, which produce reliable and reproducible effects.\nPrepare the 352 test compounds as DMSO stock solutions at 333-fold the planned test concentrations (e.g., 10 mM for a test at 30 µM).",
    "NOTE: The aim is to achieve a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v) DMSO in the cell plate after the compound application; this is the highest DMSO concentration that does not affect the rhythmic activity of the cardiomyocytes. The stock solutions can also be prepared the day before. A minimum of 5 µL of stock solution is required for each duplicate measurement.\nPrepare the compound plates.\n\t\nWarm 40 mL of maintenance medium supplemented with 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin solution to room temperature.\nDistribute into two 384-well compound plates by adding 1.5 µL of stock solution per well: i) the test compounds (two wells each), ii) the positive controls (forskolin, N6-cyclopentyl- adenosine, and E-4031, four wells each per compound plate), and iii) the negative control (DMSO, 20 wells per compound plate).\nCentrifuge the compound plates at 100 x g for 1 min.\nAdd 37 µL of maintenance medium at room temperature to each well (3.9% DMSO in 38.5 µL at that stage).\nCentrifuge the compound plates at 100 x g for 1 min.\nLoad the compound plates into the plate reader.\n\t\tNOTE: The next steps should be performed as soon as possible to minimize evaporation in the compound plates.\nPrepare the fluorescent dye.\n\t\nTurn on the water bath at 37 °C and warm 100 mL of maintenance medium supplemented with 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin solution.\nReconstitute the Ca-sensitive fluorescent dye and quencher with 10 mL of warm maintenance medium with antibiotics.\nNOTE: This stock fluorescence medium contains the Ca-sensitive fluorescent dye, usually Fluo-4, and a quencher, and any leftover can be stored at 4 °C for at least 5 days.\n3. Data Acquisition\nNOTE: Perform the data acquisition on the day of the measurement of drug effects. Perform steps 3.1–.10 entirely for the first cell plate, then repeat them for the second cell plate.",
    "Start the plate reader software (if needed) and load the pipet tips.\nAdjust the software settings to record a 2 min segment of Calcium waves with an acquisition frequency of at least 10 Hertz to define the baseline beating rate for each well.\nFor one cell plate, dilute 3 mL of stock fluorescence medium into 12 mL of warm maintenance medium with antibiotics to make the fluorescence medium.\nReplace 20 µL of medium in each well of the cell plate with 30 µL of fluorescence medium.\nPipette up and down 1x to mix.\nPlace the cell plate into the plate reader as quickly as possible to let the hiPSC-CM acclimatize to the temperature.\nWait for 60 min before starting the data acquisition.\nStart the data acquisition in the plate reader software to record a 2 min segment of Ca waves with an acquisition frequency of at least 10 Hz, to define the baseline beating rate for each well.\nNOTE: For each recording sequence, make sure the cell plate is not transferred automatically out of the device after the data acquisition. This prevents the cell plate from cooling at room temperature. With some versions of plate reader software, it may be necessary to stop each recording before it ends completely to achieve this.\nAdd the test and reference compounds with the plate reader robot by pipetting well-to-well 5 µL from the compound plate into the cell plate (after addition, the DMSO concentration is 0.3% [v/v]).\nStart the data acquisition in the plate reader software to record 2 min segments of Ca waves starting about 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after the compound addition (make sure each time that the cell plate stays in the device).\n4. Data Analysis",
    "NOTE: The data analysis can be performed any time after the measurement.\nExport the raw data for each recording period from the plate reader software as ASCII text files.\nImport the raw data into the data analysis software.\nFor each well and all time points, extract the primary beating frequency.\n\tNOTE: With the data analysis software listed in the Table of Materials, beating frequencies can be calculated with a custom analysis routine using the LombPeriodogram function, based on the Lomb–Scargle method of least-squares spectral analysis7. The periodogram should be calculated for a range of frequencies between 0.01 and 5 Hz. The primary frequency can be extracted from the periodogram using the PeakAutoFind routines. This analysis method provides more accurate measurements of beating frequencies than the method supplied as an option with the plate reader software. However, the latter can still be used if software customization is not an option.\nExport the primary beating frequencies for each recording period from the data analysis software as clipboard copies or as ASCII text files.\nImport the primary beating frequencies into a spreadsheet software by clipboard pasting or text file import.\nNOTE: Steps 4.5–4.9 can be performed in any modern spreadsheet software.\nFor each well, normalize to baseline the beating frequency at each time point after the drug application (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min) by dividing the primary beating frequency at that time point by the primary beating frequency at baseline.\nCalculate the mean DMSO effect at each time point after the drug application (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min) by averaging the normalized values for the 20 wells where DMSO was applied.\nFor each well and each time point after the drug application (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min), subtract the mean DMSO effect (time-matched) for the same plate.",
    "Average the duplicate measurements.\nNOTE: If a compound changes frequency or the software cannot find a primary frequency after the compound addition, a visual examination of the beating pattern can evaluate whether the compound produced arrhythmias."
