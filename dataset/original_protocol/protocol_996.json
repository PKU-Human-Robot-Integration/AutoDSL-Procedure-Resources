    "Prepare Polyphosphate\nPut Orthophosphate into the chemical resistant Beaker, e.x PTFE, keep it 210degrees Celsius at least 2 weeks.\nHydrothermal Synthesis\nPTFE High pressure reactor vessel, 25ml volume, put 0.5g of upper polyphosphate. add 0.6-0.7g Calcium oxide then mix them. add 12-14ml water, Tighten the vessel and put into electro Furness 200-240C. Keep it for 5-7days.\nYou can find mm size Hydroxyapatite crystals."
