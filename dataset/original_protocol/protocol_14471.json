    "The protocol follows the institutional guidelines of the human research ethics committee of the University of Zurich.\n1. Preparation for Surgery\nClean and prepare the surgical suite in a typical manner. To facilitate communication between the surgeon and the perfusionist, place the heart-lung machine to the left of the patient, opposite to the surgeon.\nPre-medicate the patient by the oral administration of 5 mg of midazolam, 30 - 60 min prior to the induction of anesthesia.\nLet the patient be monitored according to standard guidelines, with direct arterial and central venous pressure access by the anesthesiologists. Induce anesthesia using an initial intravenous injection of 0.5 - 1.5 mg/kg propofol, 1 - 2 µg/kg fentanyl, and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium.\nPerform tracheal intubation and maintain the anesthesia through the intravenous infusion of 100 - 150 µg/kg/min propofol, 0.015 - 0.03 µg/kg/min fentanyl, and 0.6 - 1.2 µg/kg/min rocuronium as needed.\nInstall the patient in a supine position and drape her/him in a sterile fashion, leaving the chest, the abdomen, and the groin free in the operative field.\n2. Surgery\nTo minimize crowding of the operative field by cannulas, establish the cardio-pulmonary bypass access outside the thorax.\n\t\nPerform a 6 cm-long incision 2 cm below and parallel to the right clavicle. Prepare the right subclavian artery, freeing it from the surrounding tissue. Give 300 I.U. of heparin/kg through the IV line.\nSide-clamp the right subclavian artery with a Cooley Derra clamp. Perform a 10 mm-long arteriotomy of the vessel parallel to its axis.\nSew an 8-mm Dacron graft end-to-end to the arteriotomy using a running 6/0 polypropylene monofilament suture (e.g., Prolene). Cannulate the graft with a 24 Fr elongated one-piece arterial cannula for arterial return to the patient.",
    "Under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance, cannulate the right femoral vein percutaneously over a guidewire for venous drainage.\nAccess the heart through a median sternotomy.\n\t\nIncise the skin longitudinally over 15 cm, starting 1 cm below the suprasternal notch. Take care to stay in the middle of the sternal width.\nSaw the sternum with an oscillatory saw. Take care to stay in the middle of the sternal width.\nIncise the pericardium over the aorta to uncover the massively dilated and tortuous right coronary artery.\n\t\t\nGrab the pericardium with Carpentier dissection forceps. Cut the pericardium with Metzenbaum scissors. Continue cutting the pericardium up to its reflection line over the ascending aorta using electrocautery.\nStart the extra-corporeal circulation and dissect the aorta circumferentially, freeing it from the surrounding tissue, including the pulmonary artery, taking care not to injure the anomalous left coronary artery.\n\t\t\nGently push the ascending aorta to the left using a lung retractor. Grab the soft tissue behind the ascending aorta with Carpentier dissection forceps.\nSeparate the posterior wall of the ascending aorta from the surrounding tissue using electrocautery. Continue caudally behind the ascending aorta. Make sure not to injure the right pulmonary artery behind the ascending aorta.\nGrab the main pulmonary artery with Carpentier dissection forceps and push it gently towards the left side. Separate the left lateral wall of the ascending aorta from the main pulmonary artery using electrocautery.\nDissect the main pulmonary artery free from the surrounding tissue.\n\t\t\nPull the ascending aorta towards the right side using a peanut gauze mounted on an Allis clamp.\nBluntly dissect the posterior wall of the main pulmonary artery with a second peanut gauze mounted on an Allis clamp. Make sure not to injure the main left coronary artery behind the main pulmonary artery.",
    "Pass a dissector under the main pulmonary artery. Gently open the dissector to prepare a tunnel for the passage of the vessel loop.\nBring down a vessel loop mounted on Carpentier dissection forceps and place it between the open jaws of the dissector. Close the jaws of the dissector to grab the vessel loop.\nGrab the adventitia of the ascending aorta and pull the vessel loop held by the dissector to encircle the main pulmonary artery.\nPlace a left ventricular vent.\n\t\t\nPlace a purse-string on the right upper pulmonary vein with a 4/0 polypropylene monofilament suture.\nGently push the superior vena cava towards the left side.\nMake a small cut in the middle of the purse-string on the right upper pulmonary vein with an 18-blade knife (see the Materials List).\nGently dilate the opening with a Leriche hemostatic clamp.\nInsert a vent through the right upper pulmonary vein and the mitral valve into the left ventricle to unload the left heart. Secure it with a braided polyester 2/0 ligature with polybutylene coating.\nPlace a retrograde cardioplegic cannula through the coronary sinus. Secure it with a braided polyester 2/0 ligature with a polybutylene coating.\nInstall the antegrade cardioplegic root.\n\t\t\nPlace a purse-string on the main pulmonary artery with a 4/0 polypropylene monofilament suture.\nMake a small cut in the middle of the purse-string on the main pulmonary artery with an 18-blade knife (see the Materials List).\nGently dilate the opening with a Leriche hemostatic clamp. Insert an antegrade cardioplegic cannula in the main pulmonary artery. Secure it with a braided polyester 2/0 ligature with polybutylene coating.\nPlace a purse-string on the ascending aorta with a 4/0 polypropylene monofilament suture.\nMake a small cut in the middle of the purse-string on the ascending aorta with an 18-blade knife.",
    "Gently dilate the opening with a Leriche hemostatic clamp.\nInsert an antegrade cardioplegic cannula into the ascending aorta. Secure it with a braided polyester 2/0 ligature with polybutylene coating. Cut the ligature with Metzenbaum scissors. Verify the correct placement of the antegrade cardioplegic cannulas in the main pulmonary artery and ascending aorta.\nPrepare to open the aorta.\n\t\nCross-clamp the aorta as distally as possible. Deliver the antegrade cold blood cardioplegia simultaneously through the aorta and the pulmonary artery.\nRemove the cannulas from the aorta and the pulmonary artery and repeat the cold blood cardioplegia retrogradely every 20 min.\nTransect the aorta.\n\t\t\nGrab the ascending aorta with Carpentier dissection forceps on each side of the opening left following the removal of the cardioplegic cannula. Enlarge the opening with an 18-blade knife.\nFinish the transection of the aorta with Metzenbaum scissors. Verify the absence of the left coronary ostium inside the aorta in the left sinus of Valsalva.\nTransect the main pulmonary artery.\n\t\t\nGrab the main pulmonary artery with Carpentier dissection forceps on each side of the opening left following the removal of the cardioplegic cannula. Enlarge the opening with an 18-blade knife.\nFinish the transection of the main pulmonary artery with Metzenbaum scissors. Confirm the presence of the left coronary ostium, originating from the right-facing sinus 110 of the pulmonary artery.\nDetach the left coronary ostium from the right-facing sinus 1 of the pulmonary artery.\n\t\t\nGrab the proximal main pulmonary artery with Carpentier dissection forceps. Using Metzenbaum scissors, separate the left coronary ostium from the right-facing sinus 1 of the pulmonary artery with a generous surrounding patch of the pulmonary root wall, taking care not to injure the pulmonary valve.\nMobilize the main left coronary artery up to its bifurcation.\nPrepare for the re-implantation of the left coronary ostium.",
    "Grab the proximal ascending aorta with Carpentier dissection forceps.\nUse a straight blade to create a neo-ostium in the left sinus 2 of the aorta. Leave a 10-mm margin of aortic root wall around the neo-ostium towards the commissure between the left sinus 2 and the right coronary sinus of the aorta, as well as towards the aortic annulus.\nConnect the main left coronary ostium end-to-end to the neo-ostium in the left sinus 2 of the aorta using a running 6/0 polypropylene monofilament suture. Start the anastomosis at the deepest point of the main left coronary ostium and allow it to come up on the right-hand side of the anastomosis. Complete the anastomosis by running the left-hand side of the suture to meet the other end.\nTo relieve tension on the tissue when pulling the sutures, bring the aorta and the main left coronary ostium together each time.\nRepair the defect in the pulmonary artery root.\n\t\nUse a non-treated autologous pericardial patch.\nConnect the autologous pericardial patch at the deepest point of the right-facing sinus 1 of the pulmonary artery using a running 6/0 polypropylene monofilament suture.\nFirst run up the left and then the right end of the suture to mid-height of the defect in the right-facing sinus 1 of the pulmonary artery. Leave the two ends of the suture under tension.\nReestablish the continuity of the great vessels.\n\t\nReconnect the proximal part of the aorta to its distal part with an end-to-end anastomosis using a running 5/0 polypropylene monofilament suture. Start the anastomosis at the deepest point, allowing it to come up on the right-hand side of the anastomosis. Complete the anastomosis by running the left-hand side of the suture to meet the other end.\nDe-air the aorta. Remove the aortic cross-clamp. Start rewarming the patient.",
    "To shorten the ischemic time, perform the reconnection of the proximal and distal parts of the pulmonary artery on the beating heart. Put the pump sucker into the distal pulmonary artery to improve the sight of the operative field.\nContinue in a running fashion the left end of the 6/0 polypropylene suture that had been stopped at mid-height of the defect in the right-facing sinus 1 of the pulmonary artery to complete the posterior and left aspects of the anastomose.\nContinue in a running fashion the right end of the 6/0 polypropylene suture that had been stopped at mid-height of the defect in the right-facing sinus 1 of the pulmonary artery to complete the posterior and right aspects of the anastomose. Tie the two ends of the suture to finish the connection.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
