Colonies obtained on the 7H11-OADC agar plates are selected for the genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation.\nProcure the Female Hartley guinea pigs (weight 300–500 gm) from the authorized animal facility. For each strain, three guinea pigs are euthanized on day one post-infection, and six or seven guinea pigs are euthanized 8-week post-infection.\nNote: Male guinea pigs can be used for performing infection experiments. Female guinea pigs are preferred because they are easy to handle.\nCritical: Guinea pigs should not be treated with any antibiotics.\nTransfer the guinea pigs randomly in the ventilated cages (n=2 per cage) in the aerosol challenge facility one week before infection to acclimatize them (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2111-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Guinea pig infection experiment setup in BSL3 facility.\n(A) Representative images of (A) the Madison chamber for aerosol infection.\n(B) The ventilated animal cages.\nThaw a glycerol stock of Mtb-H37Rv (laboratory strain of Mtb) and the mutant strain. Inoculate in 10 mL of 7H9-OADC medium. Grow the culture up to A600 ∼1.0 (generally takes seven days).\nInoculate both the strains independently in 20 mL of the 7H9-OADC medium at A600 ∼0.1 till A600 ∼0.8–1.0 (it takes ∼ 4 days, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Transfer the bacterial culture to a 50 mL Falcon tube. Pellet the bacterial cells at 3,220 × g for 10 min at 25°C and resuspend in 1 mL 1×-PBST80.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2111_9.csv\nMake up the volume to 20 mL after resuspension. Pellet the bacterial cells at 3,220 × g at 25°C and resuspend in 5 mL of Normal Saline.",
    "Pass the bacterial cell suspension ten times using a 5 mL syringe containing a 261/2-gauge needle.\nTake the A600 of the culture.\nCritical: Taking A600 of bacterial cells is crucial; therefore, it should be done carefully.\nTaking A600 of Mtb cells: Take three plastic cuvettes labeled them as Blank, Test and Confirm.\nTake 1 mL saline in the blank.\nTake 200 μL smooth culture+ 800 μL 1×-PBST80 in Test (i.e., culture is diluted 5×).\nMeasure the absorbance at A600 using a spectrophotometer.\nCalculate the number of cells in the smooth culture by using the formula: 0.6 A600 = 108 cells per mL. For example: if the A600 is 0.3. Since the culture is diluted 5 times, the A600 of smooth culture is 0.3 × 5= 1.5. 0.6 A600 = 108 cells therefore 1.5 A600= 2.5 × 108 cells. Hence 1 mL of smooth culture has 2.5 × 108 cells.\nTo confirm that the measured A600 and hence the number of cells calculated is correct, take that volume of cells in confirm cuvette that corresponds to 108 cells and make up the volume to 1 mL. Example: Since 1 mL = 2.5 × 108 cells. Therefore, 400 μL = 108 cells (100 million). Add 600 μL 1×-PBST80 to make a volume of 1 mL. The A600 of this sample in confirm cuvette should be 0.6.\nTake 100 million (108) bacterial cells for guinea pig infection in a 50 mL Falcon tube. Increase the volume to 15 mL using saline (the volume taken up by the nebulizer of the aerosol-generating machine is 15 mL).\nCritical: Similar absorbance measurements should be performed for every strain used for the infection.",
    "Randomly transfer the guinea pigs to the autoclaved aerosol cages (one cage per guinea pig) of the Madison Aerosol Exposure Chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Transfer the cell suspension (prepared in 8f) to the autoclaved nebulizer.\nFemale Hartley guinea pigs should be challenged via aerosol route for 20 min using the Madison chamber calibrated to implant 100 bacterial cells per guinea pig. (Chawla et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAfter the aerosol challenge, take out the guinea pigs and shift them to their respective cages. Label the cages properly.\nNote: Autoclave the aerosol cages and the nebulizer for the next round of infection with a different strain.\n24 h post-infection, randomly remove three guinea pigs (per strain) and euthanize them.\nBefore dissection, clean the whole guinea pig using 70% ethanol.\nTake out the lungs after dissection.\nTransfer the lungs to the saline-containing petri plates. Rinse the lungs properly in the saline to remove blood or other tissues.\nPlace the lungs containing petri plate next to a measurement scale and take a photograph. Transfer the lungs to the 50 mL Falcon tube containing 5 mL of saline.\nHomogenize the lungs for 2 min at 10 × g using the tissue homogenizer. Give 2 min rest after each cycle.\nRepeat step 15 until the sample is entirely homogenized.\nPlate 500 μL of the lung homogenate to the 7H11-OADC-PANTA-cycloheximide containing square petri plates (Dimension- 120 mm × 120 mm). Dry the plates and stack them in a plastic bag. Incubate the plates at 37°C for three weeks.\nNote: Homogenizer probe used for preparing lungs lysate should be autoclaved.\nAt 8 weeks post-infection, take out guinea pigs (n=6 or 7 per strain). Perform the dissection. Isolate guinea pig lungs and spleen (repeat steps 12 and 14).",
    "Take a photograph of the lungs and spleen along with a measurement scale (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2111-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative image of lungs and spleen isolated from guinea pigs 8-week post-infection\nWeigh lungs and spleen and note down their weight independently.\nNote: Uninfected control is required for determining the splenomegaly.\nAliquot 5 mL of formalin in the tissue preserving vials. Cut a piece of lung and spleen and transfer it to the vial. Store the tissue-containing vial in the 4°C for ten days.\nAfter 10 days, samples can be sent for H&E staining. The prepared slides can be sent to the expert for gross histopathology analysis.\nAfter preserving the part of lung tissue, immediately transfer the lungs in the 50 mL Falcon tube containing 1×-PBST80. Homogenize the lungs and prepare lung homogenate (repeat steps 15 and 16).\nTake 100 μL of the lung homogenate and prepare serial dilutions up to 10−4 in 1.5 mL sterile Eppendorf tube using 1×-PBST80.\nPlate 100 μL of 10−2, 10−3, and 10−4 dilutions on the 7H11-OADC-PANTA-cycloheximide-containing plates. Plates should be thoroughly dried to prevent any moisture. Stack the dried plates in a plastic bag and store them at 37°C for 3 weeks (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2111-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A schematic depicting the execution of the guinea pig infection experiment and the analysis of the mutation spectrum\nCritical: (a) The guinea pigs are not treated with anti-TB drugs before and after infection. (b) Fungal contamination is widespread in the lung’s homogenate-containing plates; therefore, it is recommended to add cycloheximide (final concentration, 40 μg/mL) in the 7H11-OADC-PANTA containing plates.",
    "Once the bacterial colonies of WT and mutant strains start appearing on the plates, select them randomly (bacterial colonies may differ in size) and streak them on fresh 7H11-OADC-PANTA-cycloheximide-containing plates (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). The number of bacterial colonies streaked on plates depends upon the experiment requirement. However, we suggest to streak at least ten bacterial colonies on 7H11-OADC-PANTA-cycloheximide-containing plates.\nThe number of bacterial colonies of each strain streaked on the 7H11-agar plates should be equally distributed amongst the guinea pigs. For example, if ten bacterial colonies are selected for the sequencing, it is recommended to streak at least two bacterial colonies from each guinea pig lung’s homogenate. This way, we maintain consistency and avoid bias.\nCritical: It is crucial to streak colonies on fresh 7H11-OADC-PANTA-cycloheximide-containing plates because at 37°C, most of the antibiotics start degrading, and the bacterial and fungal contamination increases significantly.\nNote: The number of colonies streaked on fresh 7H11-OADC-PANTA-cycloheximide plates depends on how many of them will be selected for sequencing. We recommend streaking at least 20 colonies for each strain.\nWhen the streaks grow on plates, inoculate them in the 10 mL of 7H9-OADC medium. Grow the culture up to A600 ∼0.8 (∼ 7 days).\nSubculture in fresh 30 mL 7H9- OADC medium at A600 ∼0.1. Grow the cultures to A600 ∼0.8–1.0 (∼4–5 days). Prepare two glycerol stocks of each strain in the strain storage medium. Preparation of glycerol stocks will be helpful when contamination occurs at the later stages, then, the glycerol stocks can be thawed and can be subsequently used for growing that particular colony.\nGrow the antibiotic-sensitive laboratory H37Rv strain (at least three independent colonies) in a 7H9-OADC medium. Follow steps 28 and 29.",
    "Note: The passage number of all the strains used for sequencing should be the same to avoid accumulating other mutations that may arise due to the difference in the passage number.\nCritical: Keep monitoring the cultures for any contamination. Fungi contamination is widespread in the guinea pig lung homogenate. Fungi may start growing in the culture; if such culture is used to isolate genomic DNA, then the fungal genomic DNA contamination would significantly decrease the number of bacterial genome reads. In case of the fungi contamination discard the culture. Start with the new colony or the glycerol stock (steps 28 and 29).\nGenomic DNA isolation\nTiming: 6 h\nThis method describes the gDNA isolation of the colonies obtained from guinea pig lungs for WGS.\nIsolate gDNA using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & tissue kit.\nPellet cells at 3,220 × g for 10 min at 25°C (step 23) and discard the supernatant. Wash the pellet with the 1× PBST80. Pellet the cells at 3,220 × g for 10 min at 25°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in the 200 μL gDNA lysis buffer and transfer it to the 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nIncubate the sample at 37°C for 30 min. Add 25 μL of Proteinase K and 200 μL of AL lysis buffer (provided with the gDNA isolation kit). Incubate at 56°C for 30 min.\nAdd 200 μL of 100% ethanol and vortex for 10 s to ensure proper mixing. Do not heat the samples at 95°C; it will significantly increase the gDNA degradation.\nPellet the sample at 6,400 × g for 3 min to remove the cell debris.\nCritical: If one transfers the sample without performing step 35, the debris will stick to the column, and you will face difficulty during the washing steps.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to the spin column provided with the kit and centrifuge at 4,830 × g for 1 min.\nDiscard the flow-through and add 500 μL of AW1 wash buffer. Centrifuge at 4,830 × g for 1 min. Add 500 μL of AW2 wash buffer and centrifuge at 4,830 × g for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and give a dry spin for 3 min at 6,400 × g.\nTransfer the spin column to sterile Eppendorf and add 60 μL of elution buffer (Tris-Cl, pH=8). Incubate for 2 min and centrifuge at 6,400 × g for 2 min.\nCritical: It is essential to heat the elution buffer at 70°C before adding it to the spin column. Heating the elution buffer to 70°C increases the yield of gDNA.\nAliquot 5 μL of the sample in a separate Eppendorf tube and freeze the rest of the sample at −20°C.\nEstimate the sample concentration using the HS dsDNA Qubit estimation kit. Follow the steps as given in the manufacturer’s protocol.\nAfter estimating gDNA using a qubit, check the DNA integrity on an agarose gel. Load 100 ng of genomic DNA on the 0.7% agarose gel to check the quality (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2111-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Agarose gel showing the good and poor quality of gDNA\nPause point: Isolated gDNA samples can be stored at −20°C until gDNA library preparation.\nPreparation of the genomic DNA library\nTiming: 8 h\nThis method describes the preparation of gDNA library for WGS.\nQiagen QIAseq FX DNA library kit is used for gDNA library preparation.\nThe gDNA library preparation protocol is divided into three steps:\nfragmentation, End-repair, and A- addition,\nadapter ligation, and,\nPCR amplification of the library.",
    "Take 100 ng of the genomic DNA in a PCR tube, and add 10 μL FX enzyme mix and 5 μL of FX buffer (provided with the kit) to make up the sample volume to 40 μL using nuclease-free water.\nIncubate the reaction mix at 4°C for 1 min, 32°C for 6 min, 65°C for 30 min, and keep at 4°C for hold (perform this step in PCR machine, which is pre-heated lid at 70°C).\nAdd 5 μL of the DNA adapter to the fresh Eppendorf tube for adapter ligation.\nNote: Adapters are provided in the 96 well plate. Spinning the 96 well plate before taking the adapter DNA is advisable.\nTransfer the sample to 5 μL adapter DNA containing an Eppendorf tube. Prepare ligation master mix by adding 20 μL ligase buffer, 10 μL DNA ligase, and 15 μL of nuclease-free water and add in the Eppendorf tube containing adapter DNA.\nIncubate the mixture at 20°C for 15 min in a water bath. Immediately after the ligation, perform clean-up using Agencourt AMPure XP beads.\nAdd 80 μL of beads to the reaction mix, resuspend well using a 200 μL pipette tip, and incubate at RT for 5 min. Pellet beads on a magnetic stand, and discard the supernatant.\nWash beads thrice with 80% ethanol, and every time pellet on the magnetic stand (clean-up step).\nDry beads and elute the DNA library in 55 μL of elution buffer. Perform the second clean-up (as described in steps 50 and 51).\nFinally, elute the DNA library in 23.5 μL of elution buffer.\nPerform PCR amplification by mixing the library DNA (23.5 μL), primer mix (1.5 μL), and HiFi PCR master mix (25 μL) at cycling conditions,\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2111_10.csv\nAfter performing PCR, clean up the library (described in steps 50 and 51).",

Estimate the library using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Follow the guidelines as per the manufacturer’s protocol.\nThe virtual image obtained from the bioanalyzer represents the ladder ranging from 35 to 10,380 bp. The prepared library should come under this ladder range. The electrophoresis file run summary shows the virtual gel image of 11 samples, which suggests that all the libraries are in the same ladder range (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2111-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

We have observed that peritoneal macrophages show better results; therefore, we prefer performing experiments using peritoneal macrophages. However, these experiments can be performed in any other cell line such as THP1 or RAW 264.7. Since peritoneal macrophages are the primary cells, they can be used only up to 120 h post-infection. After 120 h post-infection, cells undergo apoptosis. It is crucial to have a continuous supply of peritoneal macrophages from the mouse during the reinfection stage.\nIsolation of peritoneal macrophages: Inject 1 mL of thioglycollate in the peritoneal cavity of Balb/c mice, and on the 5th day, isolate peritoneal macrophages. One can obtain approximately 8–10 × 106 peritoneal macrophages per mouse (Zhang et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nAliquot 20 mL, 1× PBS (cell culture grade) in a Falcon tube. Euthanize mice and isolate peritoneal macrophages from the peritoneal cavity.\nNote: Both 1×-PBS and RPMI-1640 can be used to isolate the peritoneal macrophages. We prefer using 1× PBS (cell-culture grade for the isolation) as we can easily see the turbidity of cell suspension in the Falcon tubes compared to the RPMI-1640.\nPellet the peritoneal macrophages at 966 × g for 8 min.",
    "Resuspend peritoneal macrophages in the RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum and 1× Pen-strep (complete medium). The resuspension volume depends on the number of mice used for the isolation of peritoneal macrophages. Generally, it is recommended to resuspend cells in 5 mL of complete medium if peritoneal macrophages are isolated from one mouse.\nTake 10 μL of the cell suspension and count the number of cells using a hemocytometer. Count the peritoneal macrophages in all four quadrants and take an average. Example: No. of peritoneal macrophages per quadrant= 100, Therefore, total number = 100 × 104 per mL.\nDilute the peritoneal macrophages in a complete medium such that each well contains 2.5 × 105 cells in 500 μL complete medium per well.\nSeed the peritoneal macrophages in 24 well cell culture plates and keep them in a cell culture incubator at 37°C. After 4 h, wash the peritoneal macrophages with 1× PBS to remove clumps and unadhered cells or tissue. Add 1 mL complete medium, incubate peritoneal macrophages at 37°C and perform infection the next day.\nThe next day an hour before performing infection, wash the seeded peritoneal macrophages with 1× PBS to remove the complete medium and add 500 μL of RPMI-1640 medium containing heat-inactivated 10% FBS.\nNote: This experiment requires the continuous passage of the strains in peritoneal macrophages. At every stage of reinfection, freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages are required.\nPreparation of bacterial cell suspension: Grow the WT and mutant bacterial strain independently in 20 mL of 7H9-ADC medium up to A600 ∼0.8 (steps 3 and 4).\nNote: It is recommended to have different antibiotic markers for strains that are used for competition experiments.",

Add 250 μL of 0.05% SDS in 4 wells, and in other wells, add complete medium.\nNote: 0.05% SDS is used for the lysis of the infected peritoneal macrophages; however, it cannot lyse the bacterial cells.\nAfter 10 min incubation, take out 250 μL of 0.05% SDS in a sterile Eppendorf tube and prepare dilutions up to 10−5 in an Eppendorf tube. Take 100 μL of 10−3, 10−4, and 10−5 dilution and plate on a plain 7H11-OADC agar plate.\nAfter drying the agar CFU plates, incubate them at 37°C for three weeks.\nAt 36 h post-infection, lyse the infected peritoneal macrophages and prepare dilutions using 50 μL infected peritoneal macrophages lysate as described in steps 24 and 25. Take 100 μL of 10−3, 10−4, and 10−5 dilution and plate on a plain 7H11-OADC agar plate. After drying the plates, incubate them at 37°C for three weeks.\nTake 200 μL of remaining cell lysate obtained in step 91. Transfer it in a sterile 15 mL Falcon tube and add 10 mL of sterile 1× PBS. Pellet the bacterial cells at 3,220 × g for 20 min and decant the supernatant. Repeat the process twice to completely remove the traces of 0.05% SDS.\nFinally, resuspend the bacterial cells in 100 μL of complete medium and add to freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages (see steps 90–95).\nRepeat steps 90–95 twice.\nAt the final step, lyse the infected peritoneal macrophages in 50 μL of 0.05% SDS and plate 100 μL of 10−1 and 10−2 dilutions on a 7H11-OADC-containing plate. Incubate the plates at 37°C for three weeks.",
    "Once bacterial colonies start growing on the plates, randomly select 100 bacterial colonies and spot them on different antibiotic-containing 7H11-OADC plates.\nExample: If the hygromycin resistance marker is in strain 1 and the kanamycin marker in strain 2, spot them on both the plates.\nResuspend the bacterial colony (step 99) in 60 μL of 7H9-medium in an Eppendorf tube. Spot 30 μL each in hygromycin and kanamycin containing 7H11-OADC containing plates.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C for three weeks.\nCount the number of bacterial colonies on both the plates and plot the data as percent survival (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2111_12.csv"
