    "1. Plasmid construction\nInsert DNA encoding SpyCatcher sequence (Supplementary File 1) into an ampicillin-resistant pThioHisA-ClyA plasmid (see Table of Materials) between the BamH I and Sal I sites to construct the plasmid pThioHisA ClyA-SC following a previously published report20.\nLigate the synthesized SpyTag-RBD-Histag fusion gene (Supplementary File 1) into a pcDNA3.1 plasmid (see Table of Materials) between the BamH I and EcoR I sites to construct the plasmid pcDNA3.1 RBD-ST following a previously published report19.\n2. OMV-SC preparation\nPerform ClyA-SC transformation following the steps below.\n\t\nAdd 5 µL of pThioHisA ClyA-SC plasmid solution (50 ng/µL) to 50 µL of BL21 competent strain, gently blow, and let cool on ice for 30 min.\nPlace the solution for 90 s in the water bath at 42 °C, and then immediately put the mixed solution on ice for 3 min.\nAdd 500 µL of LB medium to the bacterial suspension and, after mixing, culture at 220 rpm at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPlate all the transformation onto an LB agar plate containing ampicillin (100 µg/mL, see Table of Materials) and culture overnight at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: In subsequent experiments, the ampicillin was kept at the same concentration in the medium. If not, this may cause loss of plasmids in the bacteria.\nFor OMV-SC production, perform the steps below.\n\t\nIsolate a single colony from the plate (step 2.1.4.) to 20 mL of LB (ampicillin-resistant) medium and culture overnight at 220 rpm at 37 °C.\nInoculate the bacterial solution (from step 2.2.1.) into 2 L medium, culture at 220 rpm, 37 °C for 5 h until the logarithmic growth stage (the OD600nm is between 0.6 to 0.8).",
    "When the OD at 600 nm of the bacterial solution reaches 0.6-0.8, add isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, see Table of Materials) to make the final concentration of the bacterial solution to be 0.5 mM, and then culture overnight at 220 rpm at 25 °C.\nPerform OMV-SC purification.\n\t\nCentrifuge the bacterial solution at 7,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min.\nFilter the supernatant with a 0.22 µm membrane filter, then concentrate it using a 100 kD ultrafiltration membrane or hollow fiber column (see Table of Materials).\nFilter the concentrate through a 0.22 µm membrane filter, then centrifuge it at 150,000 x g at 4 °C for 2 h using an ultracentrifuge (see Table of Materials), and discard the supernatant with a pipette.\nResuspend the precipitation with PBS and store it at −80 °C. The solution can maintain long-term stability at −80 °C.\n3. RBD-ST preparation\nPerform RBD-ST transfection following the steps below.\n\t\nSelect an appropriate eukaryotic expression system (e.g., HEK293F) and culture the cells overnight at 130 rpm at 37 °C after recovery.\nAdd 20 µL of HEK293F cell solution into the automated cell counter (see Table of Materials), record the number of cells, adjust the concentration to 1 x 106 cells/mL, and then culture the cells at 130 rpm at 37 °C for 4 h.\nFilter RBD-ST plasmid through a 0.22 µm membrane filter, and add 300 µg of plasmids into the cell culture medium (see Table of Materials) until the final volume is 10 mL; shake for 10 s.\nHeat PEI (1 mg/mL, see Table of Materials) to 65 °C in the water bath, mix 0.7 mL of PEI with 9.3 mL of cell culture medium, and shake intermittently for 10 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not shake the solution vigorously. Otherwise, the resulting bubbles may affect the transfection efficiency.",
    "Add plasmid solution to the PEI solution, shake the mixture intermittently for 10 s, and incubate it at 37 °C for 15 min.\nAdd the mixture to 280 mL of cell culture medium and culture at 130 rpm at 37 °C for 5 days.\nPerform RBD-ST purification.\n\t\nCentrifuge the cells at 6,000 x g at 25 °C for 20 min and use a pipette to collect the supernatant.\nFill the column with 2 mL of Ni-NTA agarose (see Table of Materials) and wash it 3x with 3x PBS.\nAdd imidazole (see Table of Materials) into the cell supernatant to make the final concentration of 20 mM, and load the cell supernatant 2x.\nAdd 3 column volumes (CV) of PBS containing 20 mM of imidazole for washing, and collect the washing fraction.\nGradient elute with 3 CV of PBS containing low to high concentrations (e.g., 0.3 M, 0.4 M, 0.5 M) of imidazole; elute 2x for each concentration.\nUse SDS-PAGE21 to identify the RBD-ST in different concentration gradients.\n4. OMV-RBD bioconjugation and purification\nDetermine the protein concentration by the BCA method (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nSerially dilute the standard BSA protein solution from 2 mg/mL to 0.0625 mg/mL, dilute the purified OMV-SC and RBD-ST 10x, then mix BCA working solutions A and B (provided in the assay kit) at a ratio of 50:1 (v/v).\nAdd diluted protein solution (25 µL/well) and mix with BCA working solution (200 µL/well); incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nMeasure the absorbance (OD) at 562 nm of each well and calculate the protein concentration from the standard curve22.\nPerform bioconjugation of OMV-SC and RBD-ST following the steps below.\n\t\nMix OMV-SC and RBD-ST in PBS at a 40:1 (w/w) ratio.\nVertically rotate to blend the mixture overnight at 15 rpm at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Different antigens may react in different proportions. One could try different reaction ratios based on the characteristics of the antigen.\nVerify the reaction efficiency.\n\t\nPrepare 10 µL of OMV-SC, RBD-ST, and the reaction product (step 4.2.). Add 2.5 µL of 5x loading buffer (see Table of Materials), and heat the samples at 100 °C for 5 min. Load the samples into the gel (10 µL/well). Perform electrophoresis at 60 V for 20 min and change the condition to 120 V for 1 h.\nTransfer the protein from the gel to PVDF western blotting membranes (see Table of Materials) at 100 V for 70 min.\nPut the membrane into 5% non-fat powdered milk/TBST and shake for 1 h. Then, wash 3x with TBST for 5 min per wash with shaking.\nPut the membrane into 0.1% His-Tag antibody/TBST (see Table of Materials) and shake for 1 h, then wash 3x with TBST for 5 min per wash with shaking.\nPut the membrane into 0.02% anti-mouse IgG1 antibody (HRP)/TBST (see Table of Materials) and shake for 40 min, then wash 3x with TBST for 5 min per wash with shaking.\nAdd enhanced chemiluminescence solution (see Table of Materials) and expose the membrane.\nPerform purification of OMV-RBD.\n\t\nDilute 1 mL of reacted OMV-RBD solution to 10 mL, and centrifuge the dilution at 150,000 x g at 4 °C for 2 h.\nUse a pipette to discard the supernatant and suspend the residue with 10 mL of PBS. Centrifuge the suspension at 150,000 x g at 4 °C for 2 h.\nDiscard the supernatant and suspend the residue with 1 mL of PBS.\n\t\t​NOTE: If the solubility of the antigen is much lower, the same separation effect can be achieved by size-exclusion chromatography19.\n5. Characterization\nPerform dynamic light scattering (DLS).",
    "Dilute the samples to a 100 µg/mL concentration and add 1 mL of sample into the sample cell.\nChoose \"Size\" for \"Measurement type\", \"Protein\" for \"Sample material\", \"Water\" for \"Dispersant\", \"25 °C\" for \"Temperature\", and then load samples and measure automatically23.\nCapture images using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\n\t\nDilute the samples to 100 µg/mL. Take a 200-mesh copper grid, add 20 µL of sample to it, and allow it to get absorbed for 10 min.\nUse filter paper to wick off the solution, add 20 µL of 3% uranyl acetate to the support film, and stain for 30 s.\nWick off the uranyl acetate and dry the film naturally at room temperature for 1 h.\nLoad the samples to the TEM system (see Table of Materials) and capture images at 80 kV.\nSubscription Required.
