    "1. Mammalian cell culture\nGeneral considerations\nFollow the aseptic techniques for mammalian cell culture previously reviewed38.\nMaintain all cell lines in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cell culture conditions vary for each cell type. It is important to maintain appropriate culture conditions for each cell line used, as variations of these procedures will lead to aberrant phenotypes and failure of the cell culture.\nEnsure acquaintance with the cell line of interest, and follow the protocols provided for each cell type selected for specific experiments (see some examples below).\nGeneral procedure for trypsinization and passing of adherent cells\nRemove the cell culture media from the culture plate by aspiration.\nWash the cells gently using PBS without calcium and magnesium (5 mL per 10 cm2 culture surface area). Add the wash solution to the side of the plate to avoid detaching cell monolayer; swirl the plate to maximize coverage of the solution. For epithelial cells, it is necessary to incubate the cells for 10 to 15 min in the incubator at 37 °C in PBS to facilitate the dissociation of cells in the following steps.\nRemove the washing solution by aspiration.\nAdd enough dissociation reagent (0.25% trypsin) to the plate (approximately 0.7 mL per 10 cm2). Gently swirl the plate to get complete coverage of the cell monolayer.\nIncubate the culture at room temperature for 2 to 5 min. The actual incubation time varies with the cell line used, in the case of epithelial cells is recommended to incubate for 10 to 15 min in the incubator at 37 °C. Observe the cells under the microscope for cell detachment.",
    "When most of the cells have detached, recover the cell suspension in 5 mL of the pre-warmed plating or growth medium (see below for some examples). Mechanically dissociate cell clumps by pipetting over the cell monolayer several times.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge them at 1,000 x g for 2 to 5 min. The centrifugation speed and time vary based on the cell type. Remove the media by gentle aspiration, being careful not to touch the cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 to 10 mL of the appropriate pre-warmed growth medium and remove a sample for counting using a hemocytometer or an automatic cell counter.\nUtilize the appropriate volume of the cell suspension to seed the recommended density for each specific cell line (see below for some examples). Supplement with the adequate volume of culture media according to the size of the culture dish and place the cells back into the incubator.\nPrimary myoblasts derived from mouse satellite cells\nBefore starting, prepare collagen-coated plates for primary myoblast growth. A solution containing 0.02% collagen, and 0.05 M acetic acid in deionized water must be sterilized by filtration with a 0.22 µm sterile filter device. Incubate the culture plates with the collagen solution overnight at 37 °C.\nOn the next day, aspirate the collagen solution, allow the plates to air dry in the sterile cabinet and store at 4 °C until use.\n\t\tNOTE: The minimal volumes of collagen are: for 35 mm = 1 mL; 60 mm = 2 mL; 10 cm = 5 mL.",
    "Seed primary myoblasts at 1 x 104 cells/cm2 in 55 cm2 collagen-coated culture plates. The proliferation media is Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)/Ham’s F12 nutrient mixture culture media containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 25 ng/mL of recombinant basic fibroblastic growth factor (FGF), and 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin.\n\t\tNOTE: Proliferating and stock cells should be maintained under 50% of confluency. Cell contact induces commitment of the cells to myogenic differentiation and impairs the growth capabilities of the culture.\nFor differentiating the primary myoblasts, allow the cells to reach 80% to 100% confluency, which normally occurs after 48 h of plating. Then, change to differentiation media (DMEM, 2% horse serum, 1% insulin, transferrin, selenium A supplement, and 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin). Refresh the media daily until harvest.\nMurine neuroblastoma (N2A)\nPlate N2A cells at a density of 2 x 104 cells/cm2 in growth media, containing a mixture of reduced-serum medium/DMEM containing high glucose and L-glutamine (1:1, v:v), supplement with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin. Maintain the stock culture under 50% confluency.\nInduce differentiation of N2A cells once confluency reached 25% to 40%. Change to differentiation media containing a mixture of reduced-serum medium/DMEM, 1% FBS, and 20 µM retinoic acid for 7 to 10 days. Refresh the media every other day until cell harvest.\n\t\tNOTE: As N2A cells differentiate, some cells become round, detach easily, and may undergo apoptosis. Be careful when aspirating and adding the culture media to the plates.\n3T3 L1 murine pre-adipocytes\nMaintain mouse 3T3/L1 cells in DMEM with high glucose, supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin. The adipogenic process is dependent in the confluence of the cells; therefore, do not let the stock culture grow over 50% confluency, as higher confluence will impair the ability of the cells to differentiate.",
    "Plate the cells at 2 x 104 cells/cm2. At this density, the cells will reach confluence in 3 days.\nInduce adipogenic differentiation two days after the cells reach 100% confluency. Induction media consists of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 10 μg/mL insulin, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyxanthine, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 10 μM troglitazone.\nReplace the induction media after 48 h incubation to differentiation media (DMEM containing 10% FBS, and 5 μg/mL insulin). Refresh the media every other day until harvest. Representative samples of full differentiation are normally collected between 7 and 10 days after adipogenic induction.\n\t\tNOTE: As adipogenesis progresses, the cells become round and tend to detach easily. Be careful when aspirating and adding the culture media to the plates.\nMCF10A cells\nPlate MCF10A cells in DMEM/F12 (1:1, v:v), supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone, 10 µg/mL insulin, and 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF). Recommended seeding density is 1 x 105 cells/cm2. Under these conditions, the cells will reach 100% confluency within 4 days. Refresh the media every 2 to 3 days until harvest.\n\t\tNOTE: MCF10A cells are difficult to detach. It is recommended to incubate the cells for 10 to 15 min at 37 °C in PBS free of calcium with 0.5 mM EDTA prior to trypsinization.\nMadin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK)\nPlate MDCK cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin. Recommended seeding density is 1 x 105 cells/cm2, where the cells will reach 100% confluency within 3 days. Refresh the media every 2 days until harvest.",
    "NOTE: MDCK cells are difficult to detach. It is recommended to incubate the cells for 5 to 10 min at 37 °C in PBS free of calcium and magnesium prior to trypsinization. To prevent cell clumping do not agitate the plates by hitting or shaking the flask while waiting for the cells to detach.\n2. Mammalian cell culture sample preparation for AAS: whole cell and subcellular fractionation\nCulture the cells of interest in 55 cm2 plates. The use of smaller culture plates may yield samples with levels of metals under the detection limits of the GF-AAS.\nWhole cell extract\n\t\nAspirate the culture media using a vacuum trap. Be sure to remove all traces of media. Rinse the cells from the desired time points or culture conditions three times with ice-cold PBS free of calcium and magnesium.\nImmediately scrape the cells from the plate using a new plastic cell scraper in 1 mL of PBS free of calcium and magnesium. Transfer the sample to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 2,000 x g and aspirate the supernatant. The protocol can be paused here. Store pellet samples at -20 °C or proceed to step 2.4.\nSubcellular fractionation\n\t\nAspirate the culture media using a vacuum trap. Be sure to remove all traces of media. Rinse the cells from the desired time points or culture conditions three times with ice-cold PBS free of calcium and magnesium. Scrape the cells off the plate with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS free of calcium and magnesium.",
    "Transfer the samples to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice. Centrifuge for 10 s at 10,000 x g. Continue rapid isolation of nuclei if metal analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions is desired. This procedure will minimize the potential loss of metals due to cell extraction39,40.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration and resuspend the cell pellet in 400 μL of ice-cold PBS free of calcium and magnesium, containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), a non-ionic detergent. Transfer 100 μL to a new microcentrifuge tube and consider it as the whole cell sample. This aliquot represents 25% of the sample.\nIsolate nuclei by pipetting the cell suspension 5 to 10 times on ice with a P1000 micropipette tip. Nuclei isolation of epithelial cells requires a concentration of 0.5 % NP-40. Achieve cell dissociation by passing the cell suspension through a 26 ¾ G needle 10 to 15 times, followed by 10 to 15 passages through a 30 ½ G needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Verify the nuclei integrity by light microscopy using a 40x objective.\nCentrifuge the remaining cell lysate suspension (300 μL) for 10 s at 10,000 x g. The supernatant will contain the cytosolic fraction. Transfer the 300 μL to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nRinse the pellet containing the nuclear fraction in 500 μL PBS free of calcium and magnesium, containing 0.1% NP-40, then centrifuge for 10 s at 10,000 x g. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet containing the nuclei in 100 μL of the same solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Samples can be stored at -20 °C.\nLyse the cells by three sonication cycles (30 s on/30 s off, at 50 kHz, 200 W) for 5 min. Quantify total protein content in the sample by Bradford41.",
    "Perform quality control of the purity of the fractions by western blot using antibodies specific for either the nuclear (histones, chromatin remodelers, nuclear matrix proteins) or cytosolic fractions (β-tubulin, β-actin) (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Do not use sonicators with a metal tip. These can contaminate the sample with metals.\n3. Zn content analysis of whole cell and subcellular fractions of mammalian cell cultures by atomic absorbance spectroscopy\nMineralize the cell culture samples (whole cell or nuclear fractions) by acid digestion using an equal volume of concentrated HNO3 trace metal grade (CAUTION) for 1 h at 80 °C, then overnight at 20 °C.\nStop the reaction by adding 30% of the reaction volume of H2O2. Bring the sample volume to 500 μL with 18 MΩ purified water.\n\tNOTE: HNO3 handling should be done wearing chemical safety glasses, a face shield for splash protection, gloves, and an approved vapor respirator if adequate ventilation (fume hood) is not available. The protocol can be paused here. Samples can be stored at room temperature (RT).\nPrepare standard solutions and experimental samples for Zn measurements by AAS equipped with a graphite furnace.\n\t\nUse 2% (v/v) HNO3 solution in deionized water, coming from the same batch used for the standard curve as the blank solution for calibration throughout. Use analytical grade standards diluted in 18 MΩ purified water.\nPrepare a standard of 1,000 ppb of Zn from a commercially available 1,000 ppm Zn stock solution with 2% (v/v) HNO3 solution in deionized water. Prepare working standard solutions from the 100 ppb standard by diluting it to 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 25 ppb directly with 2% (v/v) HNO3 solution in deionized water. Prepare the Zn standards and the blank with a 0.1% (1 g/L) Mg(NO3)2 matrix modifier.",
    "NOTE: The LOD of Zn is 0.01 ppb (µg/L). By increasing the concentration of the standards, the limit of linearity of Zn was determined to be 20 ppb (Figure 3).\nMeasure standard and samples under the same optimized conditions: flow rate of introduction of 250 mL/min, injection temperature of 20 °C, and GF temperature of 1,800 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The GF temperature was increased to 2450 °C for cleanout steps, prior to the injection of a new sample or standard.\nOptimize the lamp (C-HCL) to a current of 20 A, wavelength of 213.9 nm, and slit of 0.7 nm.\nMeasure the mineralized samples using the Zn standard curve to determine metal content. As small volumes are measured, the samples can evaporate if the measurements take long periods of time. Therefore, it is recommended to add water to the samples. Dilute the samples with 18 MΩ purified water treated with 0.01% HNO3 (analytical grade) if the data obtained is beyond the LOD.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, samples are diluted to a volume of 500 µL, placed in the automated autosampler of the AAS to be measured right after the standard curve is established. The required volume should be determined by the user and should consider final calculations of concentrations. Finishing the Zn determinations by AAS of a complete experiment in one attempt is recommended. Pausing the measurements may lead to large experimental variations and inconsistencies.\nConvert the ppb measurements to molarity as obtained from Zn measured via AAS. Consider the mass of Zn ‎(65.39 amu). Divide the amount of ppb obtained by AAS by 63,390,000. In cells, the Zn concentrations range from units of pmol to µmol.",
    "Divide the concentration of Zn (pmol or µmol) by the initial mass of protein in the sample determined by Bradford (step 2.4). This calculation will render the amount of metal (pmol or µmol Zn) contained per mg of protein of the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to consider the dilution factors utilized during the metal determinations.\nSubscription Required.
