    "Drying phospholipidsIf working with lipid powders, create a lipid stock solution.Measure 50-150 mg of lipids into a glass vial with a screw cap.Add 5-15 ml of 3:2 chloroform:methanol as needed to maintain concentration at 10 mg/ml for ease of usage.Note: Cover the vial using PTFE lined caps; otherwise, the chloroform may dissolve plastics and contaminate the sample. Measure the appropriate amount of lipids (10 mg will be enough for approximately 30 reactions) into a glass tube.Note: Liposomes can be made of single lipid forms [e.g., 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) (POPG), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)] or their combinations. For example, the Ni2+-chelating lipid, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid) succinyl] (nickel salt) or (DGS-NTA(Ni)), can attach His-tagged proteins to the membranes (Sun et al., 2007 and 2008; Jacquez et al., 2014). The new liposome developed for measuring the MPA of EsxAB is composed of POPC to POPG at a 4:1 molar ratio. Use a clamp stand to hold the vial in place.Using a second clamp, position a Pasteur pipette approximately 2-5 mm away from the liquid in the tube.Connect the tubing to the end of the Pasteur pipette and open the valve to allow gentle airflow.Evaporate the chloroform from the vial until there is no liquid visible.Remove the vial from the stand and place it inside a vacuum chamber at room temperature for at least 3 h or overnight.Store the dry lipids at -20 °C. Lipids may be stored under these conditions for up to a month.Preparing column and FPLC for desaltingA 5-ml desalting column is needed for removing the excess ANTS/DPX and for buffer exchange. If necessary, two desalting columns can be connected in tandem to improve desalting results.",
    "Pass at least 5 column volumes (CV) or, in this case, 50 ml of water through the column to remove the ethanol from the column.Pass at least 5 CV (50 ml) of gel filtration buffer through the column.Prepare the machine for desalting by passing 50 ml of water through the machine at 5 ml/min.Pass 50 ml of gel filtration buffer through the machine at 5 ml/min.Connect the column to the machine and pass an additional 100 ml of gel filtration buffer.Clean the injection valve by injecting 1 ml of gel filtration buffer.Repeat Step B7 at least two more times.Preparing the lipid-ANTS/DPX solutionPrepare a freezing solution in a beaker by adding dry ice to > 95% ethanol. The freezing solution is used to flash freeze the lipids containing ANTS/DPX. Alternatively, liquid nitrogen can be used to flash freeze. It is ideal to keep the freezing solution below -50 °C.Fill another beaker with lukewarm water for thawing the lipids.Re-suspend lipids in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 ml for every 10 mg of lipids.Vortex until the solution is well suspended.Measure the solution volume and add 50 mM of ANTS and DPX into the tube.Mix by pipetting up and down and cover the tube with aluminum foil.Place the tube into the freezing solution and allow it to freeze.Move the tube into warm water to thaw the lipids.Repeat Steps C7-C8 for five more freeze/thaw cycles.Note: Six freeze/thaw cycles are usually sufficient to solubilize the lipids. If problems occur during the extrusion, such as difficulties in passing the liquid through the membranes, perform more freeze/thaw cycles. Producing liposomes via extrusionAssemble the extruder according to the manufacturer’s specifications.",
    "Draw up 1 ml of gel filtration buffer using one of the syringes and pass the buffer through the extruder until the liquid has been transferred to the other syringe.Note: You should feel a little bit of resistance. If there is no resistance, it is possible the membrane has moved during assembly or has torn. Remove the buffer from the syringe.Draw up to 1 ml of liposomes into one of the syringes.Pass the liposomes through the membrane until the liquid has been transferred from one syringe to the other.Repeat Step D5 for a total of 20 times.Inspect the fluid after extrusion; it should have changed from an opaque to a transparent, yellow-tinged liquid (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4025/bioprotoc-11-10-4025-g001.jpgFigure 1. Comparison of the lipid solution before and after extrusion. A. The lipid solution before extrusion has an opaque color. B. The lipid solution becomes more transparent after extrusion.Dispense the lipids into a clean glass tube.Removal of excess fluorescent dyes via desalting chromatographyAfter pre-equilibration of the column and machine and cleaning the injection loop, inject the liposomes into the injection loop.Run the desalting program at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate, using gel filtration buffer, and collect 0.5 ml per fraction.Allow 50 ml of buffer to pass through the column.The liposomes will be eluted out of the column after approximately 2 ml have passed through.Collect fractions containing the liposomes, usually in six tubes for a total 3 ml of liposomes (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4025/bioprotoc-11-10-4025-g002.jpgFigure 2. Most lipids will elute after flowing approximately 2 ml of buffer through the column. A typical yield of 3 ml is expected using this procedure. The blue line represents mAu, and the brown line represents conductance.Combine all liposome samples, cover with aluminum foil, and store at 4 °C.Liposomes at this stage can be stored for approximately 1-3 weeks.",
    "Liposomes prepared with this procedure are usually consistent in concentration. However, technical replicates with the same batch of lipids are needed for every biological replicate to obtain consistent results.Clean the column by passing at least 5 CV + 30 ml (the volume of the machine) of water through the machine.Pass at least five CV in addition to 30 ml of 20% ethanol through the machine for column storage.Liposome leakage assayThe quality of the liposomes should be tested before analyzing the protein of interest by adding 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, which completely lyses the liposomes, quickly revealing a strong fluorescence signal.Set fluorometer excitation to 350 nm and record emissions at 520 nm and continue to measure at 1-second intervals for 5-10 min.Cross polarizers are applied at the excitation and emission paths to reduce background. If necessary, apply a 515 nm long-pass filter at the emission path to reduce background scatter.If available, connect a water bath to the water inlet and outlet of the sample chamber to maintain a constant temperature. This is especially important with proteins that interact at the physiological temperature, as is the case with EsxAB.To a UV cuvette, add 1.15 ml of gel filtration buffer, 150 µl of 1 M NaAc buffer (pH 4), and 100 µl of liposomes.Place the sample cuvette inside the sample chamber and close the lid.After approximately 30 s, use a gel loading pipette tip to inject 100 µl of 2% Triton X-100 into the cuvette through the hole on the cover lid. The ANTS fluorescence should increase at least 5-fold (Figure 3). This will serve as a positive control.The fluorescence intensity will drop for a second or two due to the dilution of the mix inside the cuvette, but it will begin to rise shortly after.",
    "A negative control consists of the sample prepared with liposomes and the gel filtration buffer.Continue experimenting by testing cytolytic proteins; prepare the cuvette as in Step F5 (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4025/bioprotoc-11-10-4025-g003.jpgFigure 3. Raw plots of an ANTS/DPX assay. The background fluorescence intensity is approximately 100,000 units. The fluorescence intensity increased 5-fold after adding 2% Triton X-100. With EsxA, a protein known to have MPA, we observed a gradual increase in fluorescence. EsxB, a protein without MPA, did not increase fluorescence intensity. The negative control consisting of the only gel filtration buffer did not increase fluorescence intensity.Place the UV cuvette in the sample chamber and close the lid.After about 30 s, use a gel loading pipette tip to add 100 µl of protein into the cuvette.Protein concentrations can vary, but a total of 100 µg is usually used in our experiments.Depending on the nature of the experiment, the protein can be loaded into the cuvette instead of the pH 4 buffer. Then, after 30 s, adding the pH 4 buffer will cause EsxAB to lyse the membrane."
