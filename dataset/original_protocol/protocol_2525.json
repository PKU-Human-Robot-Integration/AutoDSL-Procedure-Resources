    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPurification of protein-RNA complexes\nTiming: 2 days\nThe experimental pipeline has two major steps. This first step allows to purify protein-RNA complexes, constituted by the protein(s) of interest and bound fragmented RNAs from crosslinked cell lysates.\nCritical: Always keep samples, buffers and reagents on ice. Frequently spray surfaces/tools/gloves with 70% ethanol and RNAse Away Reagent for decontamination.\nDay 1\nCell lysis.\nPrepare Lysis Mix: to 10 mL Lysis Buffer, add 400 μL Proteinase Inhibitor Cocktail (1 tablet dissolved in 400 μL H2O) and 20 μL SUPERase⋅In™ RNase Inhibitor.\nThaw crosslinked cell pellets on ice. Resuspend each pellet in 1.2 mL Lysis Mix.\nBead preparation (Dynabeads™ Protein G).\nVortex Protein G beads, supplied in a solution containing sodium azide as preservative, for 30 s to obtain a homogeneous suspension.\nPer each sample, transfer 50 μL of bead suspension to a labeled Low Binding tube.\nNote: The volume of Protein G beads can be scaled up or down according to the experimental conditions. Standard iCLIP-seq and eCLIP-seq suggest to use 100–125 μL beads/sample (König et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Van Nostrand et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nPlace Low Binding tubes on the magnetic rack, which will collect beads on the side of the tubes.\nWait 30 s until the solution is clear.\nKeeping the tubes on the magnet, remove the supernatant without disturbing beads.\nWash Protein G beads 2× with 500 μL Lysis Mix.\nRemove the tubes from the magnetic rack.\nResuspend beads in 500 μL Lysis Mix.\nReplace tubes onto magnetic rack.\nWait 30 s until the solution is clear and discard supernatant.\nRepeat for a second time.\nResuspend beads in 500 μL Lysis Mix.\nAdd 12 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (12 μL of 1 mg/mL stock stored at −20°C) to the bead slurry.",
    "Note: The amount of antibody depends on the antibody quality, purity, binding strength, and specificity. This should be optimized in preliminary experiments following manufacturer’s instructions for IP application.\nRotate tubes at 23°C for 60 min. In the meantime, go to 3. Partial RNA digestion.\nWhen cell lysates are ready at the end of step 2, wash Protein G beads with bound antibody 2× with 500 μL Lysis Mix.\nResuspend beads in 500 μL Lysis Mix and keep on ice.\nPartial RNA digestion.\nOptional: Sonicate samples (not required for cytoplasmic fraction as indicated in Brugiolo et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]):\nClean sonicator tip with RNAse Away Reagent before using it.\nTransfer each lysate to a 15 mL tube and place the tube in an ice beaker.\nCritical: Avoid foaming. Keep the probe approximately 0.5 cm from the bottom of the tube without touching tube sides.\nSonicate with 6 pulses each 10 s at 30% amplitude, 20 s pause.\nNote: We use the Branson Digital Sonifier 450. Sonication conditions may need to be converted to suit another instrument.\nTransfer 1.2 mL lysate to Low Binding tube.\nSpin down at 16,000 × g, 4°C, 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatant into a fresh Low Binding tube (leave some to prevent carryover).\nPrepare a dilution of RNAse I at 1:30 in H2O [Low RNase].\nNote: Several RNAse dilutions should be initially tested with the help of P32-labeling in step 9 (Huppertz et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). With a 1:50 High RNase dilution, immunoprecipitated proteins are bound to short RNAs migrating as a less diffuse band ∼5 kD above the expected molecular weight of the protein (this also helps in determining the actual protein size). With Low RNase conditions the band shifts up and becomes more diffuse.",
    "Add 10 μL of diluted RNAse I and 5 μL of TURBO™ DNase to each lysate.\nIncubate at 37°C exactly for 3 min while shaking at 1,100 rpm.\nPlace immediately on ice for at least 3 min.\nImmunoprecipitation.\nFor each cell lysate, save 24 μL (2%) as pre-IP input sample for library preparation, and other 24 μL as pre-IP control for western blot. Store at 4°C.\nNote: Paired pre-IP input samples are sequenced to allow normalization for background signal and potential differences in transcript abundances between conditions.\nMagnetically remove the Lysis Mix from the Protein G beads with bound antibody.\nAdd the remaining cell lysate to the beads.\nRotate beads/lysate mix for 1 h at 4°C in the cold room.\nWash beads with bound protein-RNA complexes 3× with 800 μL High-salt Wash Buffer.\nShort spin and magnetic separation (let sit for 2 min in the cold room).\nDiscard supernatant.\nAdd 800 μL High-salt Wash Buffer, vortex for few seconds until the beads are fully resuspended, 2 min rotation in the cold room.\nRepeat for other 2 times.\nWash 1× with 800 μL PNK Wash Buffer for 2 min rotation in the cold room as in 4.e.\nWash 1× with 800 μL 1× FastAP Buffer for 2 min rotation in the cold room as in 4.e.

Keep on ice.\nOptional: P32-labeling.",
    "Note: We usually perform radiolabeling because it helps with visualization and purification of cross-linked protein-RNA complexes after SDS-PAGE and membrane transfer, in the optimization of RNA digestion conditions and in the identification of potential non-specific signal. However, as reported in Van Nostrand et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], this is not a mandatory step.\nTake out another 100 μL beads of the remaining 900 μL beads in PNK Wash Buffer. Prepare PNK Master Mix for n+1 samples as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2158_16.csv\nDiscard the buffer from the beads, add 3.6 μL/sample.\nAdd 0.4 μL γ-32P-ATP (corresponding to 4 μCi).\nCritical: The half-life of γ-32P-ATP is 14.3 days. Adjust γ-32P-ATP and H2O volumes accordingly (e.g., if the use date is 2 weeks after the calibration date, double γ-32P-ATP volume using 0.8 μL and reduce H2O to 2.6 μL https://www.perkinelmer.com/tools/calculatorrad/product[href=https://www.perkinelmer.com/tools/calculatorrad/product]).\nMix well by pipetting up and down and incubate in Thermomixer at 1,100 rpm, 37°C, 5 min.\nPerform short spin and magnetic separation.\nDiscard the buffer after magnetic separation and resuspend radioactive beads in 20 μL 1.5× NuPAGE™ Buffer.\nRemove the buffer from the remaining cold beads (800 μL).\nCollect NuPAGE™ Buffer + radioactive beads and combine with corresponding cold beads.\nPrepare samples for gel loading.\nDenature experimental samples and pre-/post-IP controls for western blot in Thermomixer at 70°C, 10 min, without shaking.\nCollect eluates and keep on ice. Store controls for western blot at −80°C.\nSDS-PAGE and membrane transfer.\nHave ready the prepared 1× SDS Running Buffer and 1× Transfer Buffer.\nUse 10-well NuPAGE™ 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels. Peel off the tape and place the gel cassette into the electrophoresis tank with the lower cassette side facing you.",
    "Note: We use the Thermo Fisher Scientific Mini Gel Tank that can allocate up to 2 gels per run. Remove the cassette clamp from the unused chamber to run only one gel. See manufacturer’s instructions available here: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A25977[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A25977].\nFill the tank with 1× SDS Running Buffer.\nLoad 20 μL eluted samples and 6 μL pre-stained protein ladder.\nCritical: Leave one lane free for cutting (max 4 samples/gel). Immediately before loading, use a pipette or syringe to rinse the wells 3 times with 1× SDS Running Buffer.\nRun at 180 V, 55 min.\nAfter the gel run, cut off wells and dye front (after P32-labeling, it contains free radioactive ATP).\nSoak sponge pads and filter papers in pre-cold 1× Transfer Buffer.\nUse 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes.\nNote: Nitrocellulose membranes can represent a source of bacterial contamination (Van Nostrand et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Rosenberg et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Using Bio-Rad membranes (Cat#1620115) we consistently obtained mapping rates between 80%–90%. If low mapping rates are encountered, consider changing membranes.\nAssemble the transfer stack as follows: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2158-Fx5.jpg\nCritical: Use a roller to remove air bubbles trapped in the stack!\nNote: We use the Thermo Fisher Scientific XCell II™ Blot Module in the XCell SureLock system. See manufacturer’s instructions available here: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/EI9051[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/EI9051].\nFill the blot module with 1× Transfer Buffer.\nTransfer at 30 V, 90 min.\nAfter the transfer, rinse the membrane in 1× PBS and wrap it in plastic wrap.\nPause point: Store the membrane at −80°C for 12–16 h.\nOptional: If you performed P32-labeling: Tape the wrapped membrane to the cassette with intensifying screen (we use Kodak BioMax Cassette with BioMax MS Intensifying Screen). Use luminescent stickers to help aligning the developed film after exposure to the membrane.\nPause point: Expose the membrane to X-ray film for 12–16 h.\nFractionation and library preparation",
    "Timing: 3 days\nThis second major step of the experimental pipeline extracts RNAs from protein-RNA complexes and converts isolated RNAs into cDNA high-throughput sequencing libraries.\nDay 3\nMembrane cutting (with or without fractionation).\nOptional if you performed P32-labeling: after exposure for 12–16 h, proceed with autoradiographic visualization. Use the signal on the developed film as a mask for cutting out regions of interest. Remember that you are working with radioactive RNA!\nNote: In case of experimental samples with absent or faint signal, see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nCut each sample (and each fraction) with a fresh sterile scalpel blade.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2158-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Note: The average molecular weight of 70 nt long RNA is ∼20 kD. The 3′ RNA linker is 34 nt long, ∼10 kD. Cut the membrane considering the size of the protein with the crosslinked fragmented RNA (Huppertz et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Van Nostrand et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). For U2AF1 freCLIP-seq (Biancon et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), we cut a “light fraction” between 37 kD (U2AF1 size) and 65 kD, containing U2AF1 monomer plus bound RNA, and a “heavy fraction” between 65 kD (U2AF2 size) and 110 kD, containing U2AF2 and U2AF heterodimer plus bound RNA (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] top panel). To apply our pipeline without membrane size fractionation, cut a lane from the protein size to approximately 80 kD above it. For AGO2 eCLIP-seq (Griffin et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), according to our western blot results and to the signal on the developed film, we cut a lane starting between 75-100 kD (AGO2 size is 97 kD) and ending approximately at 250 kD (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] bottom panel).\nNote: Control samples should show absent or significantly reduced signal in comparison to experimental samples (Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2158-Mmc1.pdf]), resulting in insufficient material for library preparation and sequencing and therefore confirming insignificant non-specific binding.\nPlace each membrane region on a fresh glass slide and slice it into 1–2 mm pieces.

(2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], 18 cycles will yield ∼30%–50% PCR duplicate reads.\nSPRI cleanup of amplified libraries (AMPure XP beads).\nVortex AMPure XP beads for 30 s.\nAdd 90 μL beads to 50 μL PCR products, mix well and incubate at 23°C, 10 min (mix 2× during incubation).\nMagnetically separate and remove supernatant.\nWash beads 2× with 75% EtOH (let sit 30 s).\nShort spin and magnetic separation to remove residual liquid.\nAir-dry 5 min (do not over-dry!).\nResuspend beads in 20 μL H2O, let sit 5 min.\nMagnetically separate, transfer 18 μL supernatant to a new Low Binding tube (post-AMP libraries).\nPause point: Store at −80°C for up to one month before sequencing.\nOptional: Library visualization by TBE-Urea gel.\nHave ready the prepared 1× TBE Running Buffer.\nTake out 6 μL purified post-AMP libraries and mix with 1 μL 6× loading dye.\nRun libraries on 6% TBE-Urea gel at 180 V, 40 min.\nStain gel with GelStar™ (3 μL GelStar™ in 50 mL 1× TBE Running Buffer). Gentle shaking at 23°C, 10 min.",
    "Visualize gel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Library size should be between 175–350 bp.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2158-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Quality control of representative U2AF1 freCLIP-seq libraries before sequencing\n(A) Visualization by TBE-Urea gel. Yellow lines mark the expected library size.\n(B) Visualization by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Peak size is reported. Lower and upper marker peaks are indicated, respectively, in green and purple. These libraries are ready for sequencing: 175–350 bp range (yellow box), good concentration, no adapter dimers (<10%), primer excess can be ignored.\nCritical: Adapter dimers around 150 bp negatively affect sequencing. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nNote: Primer excess (<100 bp) does not affect sequencing because these short fragments cannot bind to the flow cell. Consider buying new AMPure XP beads!"
