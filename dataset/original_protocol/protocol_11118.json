    "The present protocol received approval from the Italian Ministry of Health with the authorization number 843/2020-PR. In order to ensure aseptic conditions, the animals were maintained inside the barrier room of the research animal vivarium (Ce.S.A.L.) of the University of Florence. All procedures were performed in the same space where the mice were housed at the LIGeMA facility of the University of Florence (Italy).\n1. Cell preparation\nCulture PCa cells from the PCa cell line in a 100 mm Petri dish containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2% L-glutamine and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS).\nIncubate the cells in normoxia at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nDetach the cells with trypsin. Count, and resuspend 1 x 106 cells in 20 µL of PBS, 1 h before inoculation.\n2. Mouse preparation for ultrasound-guided injection (US-GI)\nNOTE: Following steps were performed under sterile conditions. The entire procedure of US-guided injection, from the beginning of the anesthesia until the mouse is removed from the animal platform, takes around 10-12 min plus 5 min for complete mouse recovery.\nJust before the intervention, administer carprofen (NSAID) subcutaneously (s.c.) at a final dose of 5 mg/kg or tramadol at a final dose of 5 mg/kg using a tuberculin syringe with a 27 G needle.\n\tNOTE: For the present protocol, 20 Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu female mice were used. The mice were 8 weeks old and weighed 20-22 g.\nTurn on the imager and select Mouse (Small) Abdominal on the application menu from the transducer panel. Ensure that the B-Mode (Brightness Mode) imaging window appears, and the system is ready to acquire B-Mode data.",
    "NOTE: B-Mode is the system's default imaging mode. The system displays echoes in a two-dimensional (2D) view by assigning a brightness level based on the echo signal amplitude. B-Mode is the most effective mode for locating anatomical structures.\n\t\nGo to the Study Browser.\nSelect New Study and type the study name and information, i.e., date of the study, etc.\nFill in all the necessary information in the Series Name, i.e., animal strain, ID, date of birth, etc.\nTap Done; the program is ready for B-mode imaging.\nAnesthetize the mouse in the anesthesia induction chamber using 4% isoflurane with a gas flow of 2 L/min of O2.\n\tNOTE: Approximately 4 min are sufficient for proper anesthesia (breathing around 50-60 breaths per min).\nOnce the mouse is anesthetized, change the connection of the anesthetic machine to direct the isoflurane toward the mouse handling table.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on its right flank onto the handling table (heated at 37 °C) with its snout in a nose cone to ensure that the mouse is anesthetized using 2% isoflurane with a gas flow of 0.8 L/min of O2 (Figure 1A).\nApply a drop of artificial tears on the mouse's eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nTape the right hand, right foot, and tail firmly onto the electrode pads on the animal platform with adhesive gauze.\n\tNOTE: The mouse's respiration rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) are recorded through the electrode pads.\n3. Injection of PANC1 cells in the pancreas by US-GI method\nSanitize the mouse skin with 70% ethanol and keep the skin of the left flank stretched using adhesive gauze.\n\tNOTE: Keeping the skin stretched is important to reduce resistance to the insertion of the needle and to prevent needle deformations.",
    "Apply ultrasound gel on the abdomen and left flank of the mouse using a 20 mL syringe (without the needle).\nUsing the height control knob of the US transducer, lower the transducer to touch the left flank of the mouse and place it transversely to the body of the animal.\nMove the transducer to visualize the pancreas on the transducer display using B-Mode imaging (Figure 1B).\nPrepare a 50 µL Hamilton syringe, containing 1 x 106 PANC1 cells suspended in 20 µL of PBS, with a 30 mm 28 G needle and place the syringe on the appropriate holder (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: Before using, sanitize the syringe needle with 70% ethanol for a period of 5-10 minutes.\nUsing the holder micromanipulator, lower the syringe to the mouse skin, with the needle bevel face up and in the same plane as the ultrasound transducer, forming an angle of 45° with the transducer (Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: From this step onward, proceed by monitoring the US image on the display.\nUsing the micromanipulator, perforate the skin and insert the syringe needle into the pancreas and observe the US image on the display, to follow its trajectory (Figure 1E).\n\tNOTE: Before injection, take the tail of the pancreas as a reference which is located behind the spleen and close to the left kidney.\nOnce the needle is inserted into the pancreas, inject a 20 µL bolus containing the cells directly into the pancreas by applying constant pressure on the syringe plunger (Figure 1F).\n\tNOTE: The correct injection procedure is checked by the presence of a small bubble in the pancreas and the flow of hypoechogenic fluid, which is barely visible from the needle tip.\nLeave the needle in place for 5-10 s after the whole bolus is injected, and then slowly retract it.",
    "Remove the US transducer, clean the gel from the flank, and place the mouse alone in a new cage. Observe the animal until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n4. 3D US imaging for monitoring pancreatic tumors in mice\nNOTE: The evaluation of tumor development was performed starting 8 days after the cell injection, using the same instrument used for the US-guided injection (listed in Table of Materials). Hence, some procedures, such as the system ignition (step 2.2.), anesthesia (steps 2.3. - 2.6.), and mouse placement on the animal platform (step 2.7.), fully match what was described above in the protocol.\nBefore starting the US imaging, set up the workstation as shown in Figure 2A.\nFix the transducer on the 3D motor system (Figure 2A).\nTurn on the imager and select New Study on the Study Browser.\nPlace the mouse in the anesthesia induction chamber (4% isoflurane).\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on its right flank onto the handling table heated at 37 °C with its snout in the anesthetic tube and reduce isoflurane to 2% (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: It is important that the mouse is placed in the same position as the US-guided injection, to maintain the same anatomical references.\nApply a drop of vet ointment on the mouse's eyes.\nApply a layer of ultrasound gel on the mouse's abdomen and left flank.\nPosition the 55 MHz transducer in the transverse orientation to touch the left flank skin such that the pancreas is approximately centered (Figure 2C).\nUse the 3D motor to acquire images of the whole pancreas in the transverse orientation, ideally gathering 90-100 frames per acquisition (number of frames may vary depending on personal choice).\n\t\nSelect the 3D Motor Position on the imager touchpad.",
    "Indicate the scanning distance by moving the cursor to acquire images of the whole pancreas from both extremities.\nSelect Scan Frames and begin 3D acquisition.\nOnce 3D imaging is done, remove the transducer, clean the gel from the skin, and place the mouse alone in a new cage for recovery. Observe the animal until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
