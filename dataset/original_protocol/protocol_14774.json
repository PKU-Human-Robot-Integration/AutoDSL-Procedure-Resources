    "This study was approved by the local institutional review boards at all participating centers. All subjects in the multicenter trial provided written informed consent to participate in eTRIS at their respective institutions.\n1. Image Acquisition\nPerform the MR imaging on a 1.5 T or 3 T whole body scanner using specialized phased-array coils for MRV such as a peripheral vascular coil, body matrix coils or run-off coils. Use these coils in conjunction with other body matrix coils or spine coils. If no suitable specialized coils are available, use the body coil instead.\n\tNOTE: Use commercially available scanners such as Siemens Symphony, Sonata, etc.\nScreen subject, and review MRI safety questionnaire prior to scan. Have subject change into a gown.\nPlace an intravenous line in the antecubital vein of subject for the injection of the contrast agent. Follow standard safety procedures for injecting a gadolinium-based contrast agent.\nPlace subject in supine, feet first position in the MRI machine and position appropriate coils on regions to be scanned. Secure coils using Velcro straps as needed.\n\t\nFasten subject’s legs/feet to prevent motion artifacts during the MRI scan.\nTurn on the centering laser and move the table until the laser crossbeams are located just below the subject’s knees (patella). Accept this position for the iso-center of the scan and move the patient table to the center position of the scanner bore.",
    "Measure the creatinine clearance (CrCL) and determine the dose of the contrast agent to be used for the subject based on body weight. If CrCL <30 ml/min, subject is excluded from the study. For individuals with CrCL >30 ml/min but less than 45 ml/min, 0.01 mmol/kg of contrast agent is used. For individuals with CrCL >45 ml/min but <60 ml/min, 0.02 mmol/kg of gadofosveset is injected. For individuals with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >60 ml/min), a dose of 0.03 mmol/kg (0.12 ml/kg) gadofosveset trisodium is used. An MRI compatible power injector is used to inject the contrast agent.\nPerform bilateral imaging of both legs and lower pelvis in a single examination session lasting approximately 60 min as shown in Table 1 and described in MRI protocol section.\n\tNOTE: Anonymize patient data prior to transfer of images to a central core laboratory for analysis.\n2. MRI Protocol\nExecute the imaging protocol from the scanner console by selecting each protocol step from the protocol window and dragging it to the execution list. Once ready, run the sequence by pressing Scan/Execute or equivalent button.\nAcquire 2D gradient echo based sequences using sequence parameters in Table 1, in the three orthogonal axes to image from mid-calf to above the iliac crest and use as localizers/scouts.\nPerform time of flight (TOF) angiography scans in each segment as specified in Table 1\n\tNOTE: These scans are also used as localizers to help differentiate arteries from veins as a long circulating contrast agent is used in steady state in this protocol. This view of the arterial tree is quite limited and only serves to help the image analyst differentiate the arteries from the venous vasculature and does not serve as a full-fledged angiogram.",
    "To avoid acquiring poor quality images at the inferior and superior extent of the imaging volume, acquire three coronal 40 cm segments in the foot to head direction overlapping by 10 cm during the 3D T1-weighted Gradient Echo scans.\n\tNOTE: These three segments encompass: a) mid-calf to above knee b) above knee to thigh/lower pelvis, and c) thigh/pelvis to abdomen. Figure 1 shows sample images with the three acquisition locations illustrated.\nTo distinguish between acute and chronic venous thrombosis, acquire T1W direct thrombus imaging (DTHI) and 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequences using parameters in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: These 3 scans also serve as the pre-contrast scan for the MRV acquisition. The extent of the coverage of these acquisitions is the same as the initial localizers acquired in the three locations illustrated in Figure 1. GRE sequence is also easily implementable on various scanning platforms and across imaging field strengths.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52761/52761fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Sample images showing acquisition locations for the 3 stations used for imaging.

Let the contrast agent circulate for 5 min to ensure a steady state in the blood pool.",
    "Acquire MRV images; post contrast 3D gradient echo sequences at 3 locations described previously. See the sequence parameters in Table 1 and Table 2. Use these images to determine the locations and size of the thrombi.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52761/52761table1.jpg\nTable 1: Lower extremity MR venography protocol with the contrast agent, gadofosveset trisodium, including direct thrombus imaging.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52761/52761table2.jpg\nTable 2: The specific imaging parameter for each sequence acquired in the protocol.\nAfter scan is completed, remove subject from the MRI scanner and take out the intravenous line. Ask the subject to change out of gown and exit the facility.\n3. Image Analysis\nPerform image analysis on a dedicated image analysis workstation running FDA-approved open source image processing software such as OsiriX MD20, by 2 trained image analysts. Ensure the analysts have a minimum of 3 years experience each.\nTemporarily blind all images before transfer to the image analyst workstation for analysis.\nEnsure that a radiologist assesses each MRI scan for the presence and location of thrombi. Provide the radiologist’s assessment to the image analyst to be used as a guideline throughout the analysis.\nLoad all DICOM images from both MRI visits of a subject into the image processing software by selecting “import”, and compare the two imaging time-points of the MRV series for each subject to ensure adequate spatial coverage and registration across time points.\n\t\nSelect the “3D MPR” tool in viewer to provide simultaneous browsing of image data in 3 orthogonal views (axial, coronal, and sagittal).\n\t\tNOTE: The image processing software’s 3D MPR mode enables the viewing of the vessels of interest.",
    "Analyze the following vessels if DVT is present: external iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial I & II, gastrocnemius I & II, and peroneal I & II veins. All analysis is restricted to regions of the vessels that are present in images from both time-points.\nAssess the quality of the image for each vein with known DVT as indicated by the radiologist’s assessment on a 0-5 scale, with 0-2 being unanalyzable and 3-5 being analyzable for both the DTHI and MRV sequences. For the breakdown of scoring system see Figure 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52761/52761fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: The breakdown of the scoring system used for assessing the quality of images for each vein of interest with known DVT.\nFor MRV analysis, analyze each vessel individually. After 3D curved multiplanar reconstruction, use contours following the centerline of each vein, traced by the analyst, to generate curved path for each vein and save to file.\n\t\nEstablish the position of the thrombus in the three dimensional space. From the Curved MPR plane, a 3D Bezier path will be displayed.\nDelineate the centerline of the vein by selecting of the “Contour Path” tool in “Creation Mode”.\nPlace points repeatedly on any of the orthogonal MPR view to straighten the entire vessel of interest.\nMake adjustments when necessary to ensure that the vessel is entirely straightened in “Editing Mode”\nWhen the contour path is accurately delineated at centerline of vessel, save by selecting the “curved path” icon to export the file\nGenerate 1 mm axial slices perpendicular to the curved path and save as DICOM files (Figure 3). Observe the the curved path, straightened vessel, and corresponding axial images for quantifying DVT from MRV images.",
    "NOTE: The images rendered in the 3D Curved MPR viewer must then be exported in DICOM format and added to the database as a new series of images.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52761/52761fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Sample DVT shown on MRV sequence. (i, left panel) Curved path (yellow line) illustrates the contour followed by the vein being analyzed.

Calculate total thrombus volume in each subject by adding the thrombus volumes in each vessel.\nFor DTHI analysis, identify fresh thrombus as bright regions on pre-contrast T1W 3D gradient echo scans13 within the DVT regions segmented by the MRV.",
    "On axial pre-contrast images, compute the volume of fresh thrombus by drawing regions of interest (ROI) manually as shown in Figure 5. In Figure 6, sample images indicating DVT measured by DTHI in conjunction with the MRV images are depicted.\nOpen the pre-contrast and post-contrast sequences alongside each other. Select “axial” view and delineate bright regions along the vessel of interest using the “closed polygon ROI Tool”.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52761/52761fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Sample DVT shown on DTHI imaging sequence. (a) coronal image, (b) axial image, and (c) axial image showing region of interest (green) traced around fresh thrombus (blue arrows) on pre-contrast images. The DTHI images are acquired prior to the injection of contrast agent and rely on met-hemoglobin content of thrombus to produce bright signal.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52761/52761fig6.jpg\nFigure 6: Sample DVT shown on DTHI imaging sequence.
