    "Note: All procedures are performed in the standard laboratory settings. All chemicals used are of analytical grade. Serum preparationHuman and animal sera were prepared in-house from freshly collected blood. For human, blood was collected into glass bottles, clotted at room temperature (RT) for 1 h, and then placed on ice for 2 h for clot retraction prior to centrifugation (2,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C) and harvesting of serum. For mouse, blood was collected into Eppendorf tubes by tail bleeding, placed on ice immediately after harvest and clotted for 2 h on ice prior to serum harvest. Sera were filtered (via 0.22 µm filter) and stored in aliquots (100 or 500 µl) at -80°C.Preparation of HBS bufferHEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 135 µM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, final pH 7.4) prepared as previously described (Zelek et al., 2018).Preparation of Antibody-Sensitized Sheep Erythrocytes for Classical Pathway Assay (ShEA)Pipette 400 μl of the settled ShE pellet (see Materials #18), and add to 20 ml HBS with gentle mixing.Wash the ShE three times in 20 ml HBS by centrifugation (1,500 × g, 10 min, 4°C) and resuspension in 20 ml fresh HBS with gentle mixing. The supernatant, red in first wash, should be clear by the final wash, confirming that the cells are viable for use.Resuspend the final pellet in 10 ml HBS containing Amboceptor (usually 1:2,000 dilution, although working dilution should be titrated for each new batch to optimally sensitise without causing agglutination) at 37°C; add the solution slowly with mixing. Incubate the mixture for 30 min at 37°C, shaking in a water bath.Wash the sensitised ShE (ShEA) as above and resuspend the final pellet in 20 ml HBS.",
    "ShEA can be stored at 4°C for up to one week or in igloo in a cold room (0°C equivalent) for up to two weeks with ice replaced as necessary.Calculating concentration of ShEAAliquot the ShEA suspension into wells of a 96-well U-bottomed plate (50 μl/well), and add 100 μl/well of ddH2O (in triplicate).Centrifuge plate (1,500 × g, 3 min, 4°C).Transfer 100 μl of the supernatant into an F-bottom plate. The supernatant contains ddH2O and haemoglobin (red in colour) released from the ShEA. All cells should be lysed; ghost cells are not visible to the naked eye.Measure the absorbance of the supernatants at 405 nm using the plate reader (lysed cells release haemoglobin, which creates a measurable red colour readout); the absorbance of OD1 equates to 8.5 × 107/ml original concentration.Testing ShEA for sensitivity to lysis by human serumIn 96-well U-bottomed plate, prepare NHS serial dilutions (in triplicate; 10-0%) in HBS (50 μl/well), and add 50 μl of 2% ShEA (prepared as described above, see section C) and 50 μl of HBS (total volume per well = 150 µl) into each well.Prepare controls (in triplicate):0% lysis: 50 μl ShEA + 100 µl of HBS100% lysis: 50 μl ShEA + 100 µl of ddH2OSeal the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.Centrifuge plate (1,500 × g, 3 min, 4°C).Transfer 100 μl of supernatant into an F-bottom plate.Measure the absorbance of the supernatants at 405 nm using the plate reader. Optimally sensitised ShEA will be fully lysed (100% compared to controls) by NHS at 10% and above, under these conditions.Further sensitisation of ShEA for mouse classical Pathway Assay (ShEA-m)Take 5 ml of the 2% ShEA in HBS.",
    "Pellet the cells (centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 10 min, 4°C)Add pre-warmed (at 37°C in the water bath) mouse anti-rabbit IgG at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml in 5 ml of HBS and resuspend the cells.Incubate at 37°C in the shaking water bath for 30 min.Wash the cells three times (in 20 ml HBS by centrifugation; 1,500 × g, 10 min at 4°C) to remove excess antibody, resuspend in 5 ml HBS; ShEA-m can be stored on ice for up to two weeks.Test the ShEA-m for sensitivity to lysis by mouse serum using dilutions of NMS from 100 to 0% (100% equates to a final dilution of 33% in the assay). In a 96-well U-bottomed plate, prepare serial dilutions (in triplicate) between 100 and 0% NMS (50 µl/ well) in HBS and add 50 μl of 2% ShEA-m and 50 μl of HBS (total volume per well = 150 µl) into each well.Prepare controls (in triplicate):0% lysis: 50 μl ShEA-m + 100 µl of HBS100% lysis: 50 μl ShEA-m + 100 µl of ddH2OSeal the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.Centrifuge plate (1,500 × g, 3 min, 4°C).Transfer 100 μl of supernatant into an F-bottom plate.Measure the absorbance of the supernatants at 405 nm using the plate reader. Optimally sensitised ShEA-m will be fully lysed (100% compared to controls) by NMS at 100% under these conditions.Assay method – modified mouse CP CH50 assayIn a U-bottom plate, prepare a serial dilution series (in triplicate) of NMS (100-0%; 50 μl/well). Add 50 μl of 2% ShEA-m, followed by 50 μl of HBS (total volume per well, 150 μl; final serum concentration, 33-0%).",
