    "All methods described have been performed in compliance with all institutional, national, and international guidelines for human welfare. Research was approved by the Institution Review Board (IRB) at The George Washington University.\nNOTE: Donor human hearts were acquired from Washington Regional Transplant Community as deidentified discarded tissue with approval from the George Washington University IRB. Explanted hearts are cardioplegically arrested by flushing the heart with a solution of ice-cold cardioplegia (the blood was cleared from the heart in this process) and transferred to the lab under standard organ transplant conditions.\n1. Preparation of solutions\nFor each heart, make 4 L of cardioplegic solution (110 mM NaCl, 16 mM KCl, 16 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM CaCl2; pH = 7.4). Store 3 L at 4 °C and the remaining 1 L at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: This solution can be made up to several days in advance.\nFreshly prepare 1 L each of Tyrode’s slicing solution (140 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime [BDM]; pH = 7.4) and Tyrode’s recovery solution (140 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM BDM; pH = 7.4).\n\tNOTE: Both the slicing and recovery solutions should be made the day of the experiment and can be stored at 4 °C.\nPrepare stock solutions of the fluorescent dyes. Reconstitute the voltage-sensitive dye RH237 at 1.25 mg/mL in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and store it in 30 µL aliquots at 4 °C. Reconstitute the calcium indicator Rhod-2AM at 1 mg/mL in DMSO. Store in 30 µL aliquots at -20 °C.",
    "NOTE: Di-4-ANEPPS (stock solution at 1.25 mg/mL in DMSO) can be used in experiments for single camera imaging of the transmembrane potential alone.\n\t\nBefore the start of the experiment, sonicate the dyes using an ultrasound sonicator for at least 10 min and dilute each aliquot of fluorescent dyes in 1 mL of the recovery solution. Add Pluronic F-127 (Table of Materials) to Rhod-2AM at a 1:1 ratio before dilution in recovery solution.\nPrepare a stock solution of the excitation-contraction uncoupler blebbistatin at 2 mg/mL solution in DMSO. Store in aliquots at -20 °C. During optical mapping experiments, dilute the stock solution of blebbistatin to a working concentration of 5−10 μM in the Tyrode’s recovery solution.\nMake fresh culture medium by supplementing medium 199 with 2% penicillin-streptomycin, 1x insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) liquid media supplement, and 10 mM BDM. Filter the medium using a 0.2 µm sterile filter.\n\tNOTE: For pharmacological perturbation studies, drugs can be added directly to the culture medium. The culture medium can be stored at 37 °C.\nMake a 4% agarose gel for tissue mounting by dissolving low-melting point agarose in distilled water and heating the mixture in a microwave until fully dissolved. Cure the agarose in a Petri dish at a thickness of 5 mm and store at 4 °C.\n2. Equipment setup\nVibrating microtome setup\n\t\nCalibrate the vibrating microtome prior to each experiment.\n\t\t\nUsing a high precision vibrating microtome (Table of Materials), load a ceramic cutting blade into the holder and attach the calibrating device provided with the vibrating microtome. Choose the blade adjustment option from the menu and select ceramic for type of blade.",
    "Select the vibrate option, check for Z axis value. If this value is <1 μm, exit the calibration menu. If not, finely adjust the calibration screw attached to the top of the vibrating head and select the vibrate option. Repeat as many times as needed to set the Z axis to <1 μm.\nSet the vibratome settings to 400 μm cutting thickness, 0.02 mm/s advance speed for atrial tissue and 0.04 mm/s advance speed for ventricular tissue, 2 mm horizontal vibration amplitude, and 80 Hz vibration frequency.\n\t\tNOTE: While 400 μm is the recommended thickness to compensate for cell damage on the cut surfaces of the slice, thinner slices can also be prepared. Given that the oxygen diffusion limit is around 150 μm, slices around 300 μm are often used14,17,18,24.\nFill the bath of the vibrating microtome with slicing solution at 4 °C and maintain the temperature by surrounding the outside of the bath with ice, replenishing as needed throughout the slicing protocol. Continuously oxygenate the slicing solution in the bath by bubbling with 100% oxygen during slicing.\nSet up a second dish with as many 100 μm nylon mesh cell strainers and meshed washers as needed (one cell strainer per slice). Fill this dish with recovery solution and oxygenate it by bubbling with 100% oxygen at room temperature (RT).\n\t\tNOTE: This solution is maintained at RT during the experiment.\nOptical mapping setup\n\tNOTE: A more detailed description of the optical mapping system is provided in previous publications16,25,26.",
    "Attach a tissue bath with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gel layer at the bottom (to pin the slices) to a perfusion system. Circulate 1 L of the recovery solution at 37 °C and oxygenate with 100% oxygen, through the perfusion system at a flow rate fast enough to maintain the temperature and clear accumulation of bath perfusate.\nAdjust the focus and alignment of the two CMOS cameras (Table of Materials) using a target.\n\t\tNOTE: More details on alignment can be found in previous studies26.\nUse a green LED light source with a wavelength of 520 ± 5 nm to excite the voltage-sensitive and calcium indicator dyes simultaneously.\n\t\tNOTE: The excitation light source is attached to the excitation filter cube of the optical mapping system and is reflected off a 550 nm dichroic mirror for epicentric illumination. The emitted light is collected by a 1x lens and split by a second dichroic mirror at 630 nm into voltage and calcium components before it is filtered by 690 ± 50 nm and 590 ± 33 nm filters, respectively, and recorded by the two cameras.\n3. Slicing protocol\nWhen ready for tissue dissection and experimentation, prepare a bath of ice-cold cardioplegia by mixing frozen and liquid cardioplegia. Keep the heart submerged in the cardioplegia bath until tissue collection for slicing (Figure 1A).\nGlue the premade agarose gel to the back of the metal tissue holders of the vibratome.\nIdentify the left ventricular free wall and cut 1 cm3 cubes of tissue in cold cardioplegic solution. Then, quickly mount the tissue blocks onto the metal tissue holders with the endocardial surfaces facing up and attach them to the agarose gel using topical skin adhesive (Figure 1B).",
    "NOTE: The selected tissue region should be away from large blood vessels to avoid holes in the slices. The plane of sectioning is approximately parallel to the fiber orientation in the endocardial layer (Figure 1E) and the plane of sectioning could be at a slight angle due to rotational anisotropy in a deeper layer of the LV wall. To increase throughput, up to two tissue blocks can be mounted side by side on the same holder.\nTransfer the metal holders into the vibratome bath filled with the ice-cold oxygenated slicing solution. Ensure that the tissue cubes are completely submerged.\nMove the blade to the front edge of the tissue and turn on the vibratome to begin slicing with the preset parameters. Discard the first several slices until the blade reaches beyond the trabeculae into the smooth endocardial tissue.\nOnce each slice is cut, carefully transfer the slice to an oxygenated (100% O2) bath of Tyrode’s recovery solution at RT. Gently place each slice in individual 100 µm nylon mesh cell strainers and cover with meshed washers to keep the tissue slices from curling (Figure 1C). Keep slices in the recovery solution for at least 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Slices can be kept in the bath under these conditions for up to 3−4 h without detrimental electrophysiological effects.\n4. Slice culturing under static conditions\nNOTE: To minimize the chance of contamination, sterilize the forceps using a bead sterilizer before each transfer step.\nWhen ready to culture, carefully transfer each slice to the individual wells of a 6 well plate filled with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Gently rock the well plate to rinse the slices of recovery solution.",
    "NOTE: From this point forward, the slices should only be exposed in a BSL2 laminar flow culture hood, and sterile forceps should be used to handle the tissue.\nTransfer the slices to wells of fresh PBS to thoroughly rinse and sterilize the slices for culture. Perform this wash step 3x to ensure complete removal of recovery solution from the slices.\nTransfer the slices to individual wells of a 6 well plate filled with 3 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) culture medium (with or without drugs, Figure 1D). Place plates onto an orbital shaker at 20 rpm in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 30% O2 and 5% CO2. Aspirate and replace culture medium every 48 h.\n5. Functional characterization―optical mapping\nFor optical mapping studies either immediately following slicing or after culturing, carefully transfer the slice of interest to the tissue bath of the perfusion system at 37 °C with 100% O2 in Tyrode’s recovery solution, and pin down the four corners to the PDMS gel layer while applying minimal stretch (i.e., just enough to keep the slice from easily moving under flow conditions). Allow the slices to rest in this bath with circulating recovery solution for approximately 10 min.\nAdd 0.3−0.5 mL of the diluted blebbistatin to the reservoir containing the recovery solution. Let the slice incubate with blebbistatin for approximately 10 min.\nReconstitute 30 µL of the stock voltage-sensitive dye, RH237, in 1 mL of recovery solution at 37 °C. Turn off the pumps and slowly load 0.2−0.3 mL of working dye solution onto the surface of the slice over a period of 30 s. Allow the slice to incubate in the dye with the pumps off for a period up to 90 s, then turn the pumps on again to allow any excess dye to wash out.",
    "NOTE: Care should be taken to apply the dye evenly all over the slice. Additionally, very slow dye application is crucial to prevent the dye from floating away from the slice.\nRepeat step 5.3 to reconstitute the stock calcium indicator Rhod-2AM and load it onto slice.\nFocus the cameras onto the slice by adjusting the distance of the slice from the lens.\nPosition a bipolar platinum-iridium pacing electrode such that its tip is in contact with the middle of the slice and apply pacing stimuli of increasing amplitude to determine the minimum pacing threshold required to elicit an electrical response. Pace the slice at 1 Hz with a 2 ms pulse width duration at 1.5x the amplitude of the predetermined pacing threshold. Place a coverslip over the tissue slice.\nIlluminate the slice using a 520 ± 5 nm LED excitation light source. Record the emitted voltage and calcium signals with the two CMOS cameras at 1,000 frames/s.\nCheck the recording for good signal quality and suppressed motion artifacts (Figure 1F). Add more blebbistatin to the reservoir in steps of 0.1 mL until the motion no longer produces artifacts in the optical signals. Add more dye, if needed, to improve the signal quality.\n\tNOTE: Good signal quality refers to qualitatively assessed large signal amplitude and low background noise in the recorded optical signals.\n6. Data processing with RHYTHM1.2\nNOTE: RHYTHM1.2 is a MATLAB based user interface that is used to display, condition, and analyze optical mapping data acquired by single or dual camera optical mapping systems (Figure 3). It is used in conjunction with the imaging system.\nLoading data files\n\t\nLoad the data files into RHYTHM1.2 by selecting any one of the four display windows on the screen and using the Select Directory and Load buttons.",
    "The program will prompt the user to select Camera 1 or Camera 2 data for the dual voltage and calcium recordings. Select Camera 1 for the voltage signal.\nRepeat the process to load the calcium signal (Camera 2) to one of the adjacent display windows.\nSelect the Dual Data Linking checkbox between the two selected display windows to link the two display windows, since the two data sets are recorded from the same region on the slice.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, if the same field of view is maintained, this function can be used to link two images that were obtained at separate time points to see the time-response in electrophysiology of the drug being investigated. Double clicking any one display window allows for that one window to be maximized to allow for ease of analysis.\nSignal conditioning\n\t\nSelect Data Analysis | Condition Parameters to condition the voltage and calcium optical mapping data prior to further analysis.\nUse the “Remove Background” function to remove pixels that do not contain any signal based on a fluorescent intensity threshold (background [BG] threshold) and degree of pixel clustering (excitation [EX] threshold).\nPerform spatial averaging of the optical mapping data using the “Bin” function to improve signal quality.\nFilter the optical mapping data using a band pass filter with the “Filter” function.\nUse the “Drift” function to remove the baseline drift in the optical mapping signal.\nUsing the “Normalize” function, normalize the optical mapping data from each pixel to have a maximal amplitude of 1.\nUse the “Inverse Signal” function to invert the calcium traces for further analysis.\nClick Display Wave to select the conditioned trace from any given spot in the display window and plot it in the Waveform window. Adjust the signal conditioning parameters to obtain optimal action potential and calcium transient traces.",
    "Conduction velocity (CV) calculation\n\tNOTE: The activation time is defined as the time of maximum derivative of the optical signal (dF/dtmax).\n\t\nSelect Data Analysis | Activation Map and enter a Start Time and End Time to encompass a single action potential in the trace. Press Calculate and select the region of interest (ROI) to display the activation map of the selected region (Figure 1G).\nSelect Data Analysis | CV Map and similarly, choose the Start Time and End Time. Enter the interpixel resolution values based on the setup.\n\t\tNOTE: For 1x magnification systems, interpixel resolution is 0.1 mm in the X and Y direction.\nPress the Generate Vec. Map button to select an ROI and display CV vectors within that region. The mean, median, standard deviation, and number of vectors included in the analysis as well as the average angle of propagation of the CV vectors in the selected region is calculated and displayed in the Statistics section.\nClick the Draw Line button to draw a line along a given direction of propagation. All CV vectors in that direction will be selected. Click Calculate CV to use only those selected CV vectors to calculate the statistics that will be displayed in the Statistics section.\nAction potential duration (APD) and calcium transient duration (CaTD) calculation\n\tNOTE: The APD is another fundamental parameter of the cardiac electrophysiology. APD maps can be generated by determining the time difference between activation and a specified percentage of repolarization of each optical action potential. APD heterogeneity or APD prolongation and shortening can be used to predict arrhythmia susceptibility.\n\t\nTo calculate APD in RHYTHM1.2, select Data Analysis | APD/CaT Map.",
    "Select the Start Time and End Time to encompass one full action potential. Set a minimum and maximum value of APD/CaTD to remove any outliers (for example, 0 and 1,000 ms, respectively). Enter the percent repolarization that will determine the APD, for example, 0.8 for APD80/CaTD80 or 0.5 for APD50/CaTD50.\nClick Regional APD Calc to select an ROI and generate the APD map. The mean, median, standard deviation, and number of pixels included in the analysis will be displayed in the Statistics section.\nRise time\n\tNOTE: The rise time is another electrophysiological parameter that can be measured from optical signals of voltage and calcium transient traces. It provides an estimate for how long it takes for the depolarizing ion channels to trigger an action potential, or how long it takes for calcium to be released into the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Optical rise time is not a perfect substitute for rise times measured by microelectrodes and may not be as sensitive to changes in depolarization, because optical action potentials are an average of the transmembrane potential of many cells. Spatial and temporal resolution of the system can also affect optical rise time values. However, it can still be used to predict large changes in depolarization27.\n\t\nTo determine the rise time, select Data Analysis | Rise Time.\nSelect Start Time and End Time to select the upstroke of one single action potential or calcium transient. Enter the values of Start% and End% (typically 10–90% is recommended for non-noisy signals), which allows the user to select just the portions of the signal without including noise in the case of noisy signals.\nClick Calculate to select the ROI and determine the mean, median, standard deviation, and number of pixels included in the analysis of rise time.\nCalcium decay",
    "NOTE: For calcium traces, the time constant of the decay of the calcium transient can be determined. This allows for the analysis of changes in the removal of calcium ions from the cytoplasm back into the SR.\n\t\nSelect Data Analysis | Calcium Decay and enter the start time and end time to encompass the entire decay portion of a single calcium transient signal.\nClick Calculate Tau to select the ROI and determine the mean, median, standard deviation, and number of pixels included in the analysis of calcium decay time constant.\nSubscription Required.
