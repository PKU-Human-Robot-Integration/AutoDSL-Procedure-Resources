    "Animal manipulations were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University.\n1. Solution Preparation\nPrepare HEPES-Tyrode solution (H-T) using 137.0 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2∙6H2O, 5.6 mM D-glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3-7.4.\nPrepare HEPES-Tyrode solution without calcium (Ca2+-free H-T) using 140.6 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2∙6H2O, 5.6 mM D-glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3-7.4.\nPrepare HEPES-Tyrode solution using 124 mM KCl (High K+) using 15.7 mM NaCl, 124.0 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2∙6H2O, 5.6 mM D-glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3-7.4.\n2. Experiment Preparation\nPreheat H-T and High-K+ solutions using a 37 °C water bath.\nTurn on the myograph system, data acquisition hardware and computer.\nCarefully fill all myograph chambers with 5 mL of H-T solution each.\nFill two Petri dishes with 20 mL of 4 °C H-T and Ca2+-free H-T solutions, respectively, and store on ice.\nFill a 10-cm coated Petri dish with 20 mL of H-T solution, and maintain it at room temperature.\n3. Mouse Mesenteric Artery Dissection\nEuthanize an 8-12-week-old C57BL/6J female or male mouse by cervical dislocation. Pin the mouse down with its abdomen facing up.\nMoisten the abdomen with 70% ethanol. Then, cut the skin with scissors along the ventral midline from the groin, and make incisions from the start of the first incision downwards to the legs on both sides. Pull the skin back on both sides; make similar incisions to open the peritoneum.\nUsing scissors, cut the oesophagus, the colon and other connective tissues to completely isolate the gastrointestinal tract with feeding vasculature from the body.",
    "With forceps, move the isolated segment into the dish containing the cold H-T prepared in step 2.4, and gently rinse the tissue in H-T solution several times to wash off the blood.\nTransfer the isolated segment into the coated Petri dish prepared in step 2.5, and perform mesenteric artery dissection at room temperature.\nSmooth out the stomach, jejunum, ileum and caecum in a clockwise direction, and pin the stomach and caecum on the left and right-hand side, respectively.\nStretch the mesenteric vasculature bed and fix the intestine with pins to expose the dissected mesenteric arteries.\n\tNote: Under these conditions, the arteries are on top of the veins.\nTurn on the transmission light source of a stereoscopic microscope, and dissect arteries under the microscope. Make sure that the entire tissue is immersed in the solution.\nClamp the adipose tissues around the arteries with forceps, and isolate the arteries by cutting off all the connective tissues with dissection scissors. Avoid injuring the arteries.\n4. Arterial Mounting\nTransfer and immerse the mesenteric artery tree into the cold Ca2+-free H-T solution (prepared in step 2.4) by clamping the excess arteries with forceps.\nCut off a 1.4-mm portion of the artery proximal to intestinal wall of a mesenteric arcade, and use two forceps to open both sides of this artery segment carefully.\nPrepare two segments of stainless steel wire 2.5 cm in length, and place them into the same dish.\nGently clamp one end of the artery using forceps, and carefully insert two wires into the lumen of the artery one by one with help of another forceps. Ensure that the wires are kept straight and do not touch the endothelium.",
    "Using two forceps, clamp the two steel wires outside of the threaded vessel simultaneously, and carefully transfer the vessel from the Petri dish to a myograph chamber previously filled with H-T solution (step 2.3).\nScrew the jaws apart to make space for mounting. Clamp both sides of one of the two inserted wires using two forceps, and place the vessel in the jaw gap (Figure 1A).\nWrap both sides of the clamped wire around screws of the jaw connected to the micrometer (Figure 1B).\nFix the left-hand screw by twisting clockwise. Straighten the wire using right-hand forceps, then fix the right-hand screw by twisting clockwise (Figure 1C). Make sure that the vessel is always inside the jaw gap, but do not touch the jaw to avoid damage.\nClose the two jaws using the micrometer (Figure 1D). Make sure the two jaws are close enough but that they do not touch each other and that the unfixed wire is on the top of the fixed wire.\nUsing the right-hand forceps, carefully fold the unscrewed wire at the corner of the jaw connected to force transducer, and wrap it clockwise around the right-side screw (Figure 1E). Then, fix the screw. Repeat this step on the left side of the wire and fix the left-side screw (Figure 1F).\nMove the jaws slightly apart by carefully rotating the micrometer (Figure 1G). Avoid stretching the vessel. Use forceps to move the wire at the micrometer side to the horizontal plane of the wire at the transducer side. Carefully rotate the micrometer so that the gap between the two jaws can just accommodate the two wires.",
    "Repeat Steps 4.2 – 4.11 to mount arteries onto the other chambers. Connect all the chambers to the equipment, cover the chambers, attach the 100% oxygen supply and a temperature probe, and start heating to 37 °C. Open the charting software and press the Start button on the Chart View window to start recording.\nEquilibrate for about 20 min.\n5. Normalization\nNote: In order to standardize the experimental conditions and to obtain reliable physiological responsiveness of vessels, a normalization procedure is necessary15. According to the relationship between the active force and internal circumference of the vessel, the wire myograph system has a standard normalization program to assess the internal circumference (IC) of the mounted vessel5,8,9. Briefly, to calculate IC (µm), read the micrometer and input the value as the X value and the transducer output force, i.e., resting wall tension (mN/mm), as the Y value. The program will return a fitted curve of (X, Y) and calculate the IC corresponding to a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg (IC100). The vessel is set to the normalized internal circumference (IC1) when the active responsiveness is maximal.\nSet forces to zero for all channels on the device, and equilibrate for another 1-2 min.\nSelect Normalization settings from the “DMT menu, and set up the parameters as follows:\n\tEyepiece calibration (mm/div): 0.36; Target pressure (kPa): 13.3; IC1/IC100: 0.9; Online averaging time (seconds): 2; Delay time (seconds): 60. Click the OK button to close the DMT Normalization Settings window.\nSelect the channel of interest from the DMT menu to open a DMT normalization window for the corresponding channel. Enter the constant values into the window as follows: Tissue end-points a1: 0.1; Tissue end-points a2: 4; Wire diameter (µm): 40. The window displays the calculated vessel length as 1.40 mm.",
    "Read the micrometer of the appropriate tissue chamber. Enter the value into the Micrometer reading box, and click Add Point button. This value is the initial value of X (X0). After a 60 s delay time, the window displays the force and the effective pressure (ERTP) corresponding to this micrometer value. Simultaneously, the Micrometer reading box becomes active.\nStretch the vessel being normalized by turning the micrometer in a counter-clockwise direction. Enter the micrometer value into the Micrometer reading box, and click Add Point button. Wait for a delay time of 60 s again.\nRepeat step 5.5, continue to stretch the vessel, and add micrometer values until the window displays the value of “Micrometer X1”, which is the calculated micrometer setting required to stretch the vessel to its IC1.\nSet the micrometer to X1 value.\n\tNote: The normalized tension is usually 1-2 mN.\n6. Artery Contraction Recording\nNote: All the solutions, including H-T and High-K+ solution used in this section, were prepared in step 2.1.\nAfter normalization, equilibrate the vessel in the chamber for 15-20 min.\n\tNote: These is no need to change the solution in this step.\nChallenge the vessel with High-K+ solution twice.\n\t\nTo challenge the vessel, replace H-T solution with 5 mL of High-K+ solution to induce contraction for 10 min, followed by washing with 5 mL of H-T solution 3-4 times.\n\t\tNote: Typical contraction has a maximal force over 3 mN and a constant sustained force around 2.5 mN12. If the first challenge generates a maximal force below 2.5 mN or the sustained force decreases with time or the second challenge generates a much lower force than the first-time dose, the vessel is discarded and will not be used for further investigation.",
    "Challenge the vessel with 5 mL of High-K+ solution to induce contraction. After 5 min, add 0.5 µL of the neoliensinine stock solution (10 mM in DMSO)14 into the chamber to relax the vessel at a final concentration of 1 µM neoliensinine.\nWhen the force is stable (this usually takes several minutes), add another 0.5 µL of neoliensinine stock solution into the chamber to increase the concentration to 2 µM. Add 1 µL of the stock solution each time to increase the concentration to 4, 6, 8 and 10 µM to generate the dose-response curve.\n\tNote: The stock and working concentrations vary among drugs.\nSubscription Required.
