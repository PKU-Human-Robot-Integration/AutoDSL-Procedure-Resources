  "procedures": [
    "All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of BeiGene and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. All procedures performed in studies involving animals were approved by the Internal Review Board at BeiGene. This protocol has been specifically adjusted for the evaluation of BGB-A317 (Tislelizumab) in humanized NOD/SCID mice.\n1. Establishment of human PBMC-based model\nMyeloablation of NOD/SCID mice using cyclophosphamide: determination of optimal doses\nPurchase female NOD/SCID mice (6-8 weeks).\nNOTE: All mice involved in this study were female.\nPrepare cyclophosphamide (CP) at different doses (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg) in saline. Prepare disulfiram (DS) in 0.8% Tween-80 in saline at 125 mg/kg.\n\t\tNOTE: Different concentrations of CP were prepared to enable administration of equal volumes of drug solution to mice getting different doses of CP.\nTreat the animals with CP (i.p.) and DS (p.o.) once a day for 2 days. Give DS (p.o.) 2 h after each dose of CP.\nNOTE:  DS decreases the urotoxicity of CP in mice, and CP combined with DS has been suggested to have longer-lasting neutropenia than animals treated with CP alone10 The dose regimen of CP might need to be pre-determined prior to actual studies and was found to vary slightly between different immunodeficient mouse strains.\nCollect blood samples from the orbital venous sinus and transfer to EDTA-K coated tubes on ice on day 0 (1 h before the 1st dose), day 2 (24 h after the 2nd dose) and day 4 (72 h after the 2nd dose).",
    "Examine the myeloablation effect after CP and DS treatment by FACS. Use rat anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70), rat anti-mouse Ly6C (HK1.4, ) and rat anti-mouse Ly6G (1A8)  for gating CD11b+ Ly6Ghigh as neutrophils, CD11b+Ly6Chigh as monocytes11,12.\nRecord body weight and health conditions of the mice daily for one week. The optimal dose of CP and DS is determined as the regimen that results in maximum depletion of neutrophils and monocytes without causing severe toxicity to mice.\nHuman PBMC transplantation and tumor engraftment: model set-up\nIsolate human PBMCs from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPre-treat the mice with CP and DS as indicated by step 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 to increase transplantation efficiency.\n20 to 24 h after the second dose of CP and DS, inject human tumor cell line such as A431 cells (ATCC, 2.5 x 106) and 5 x 106 isolated PBMCs (mixed in a total of 200 μL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50% Matrigel), or tumor fragments (3 x 3 x 3 mm3, in a total volume of 200 μL PBS containing 50% Matrigel) and 200 μL of 5 x 106 PBMCs (100 μL each to the left and right side of engrafted tumor fragment) (s.c.) subcutaneously in the right flank of the animals.\nMeasure primary tumor volume and record twice a week for 4-6 weeks.\nNOTE: The mice will be euthanized once their body weights lose over 20% or their tumor volume reaches 2,000 mm3 or the tumor is ulcerated.\nEuthanize the mice in gas chambers with carbon dioxide. Collect the whole tumor tissues in sacrificed mice with ophthalmic scissors and process them for histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. Examine the Human CD8, PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions in these tissues. See protocol step 4.\n2. PBMC Donor Screen",
    "Screen a panel of PBMC donors due to the anticipated variations resulted from PBMCs collected from individuals. Use A431 cells co-injecting with PBMCs from different donors according to the procedures as indicated by step 1.2.\nNOTE: Over 50 healthy PBMC donors were screened in the study in order to obtain enough number of suitable donors. Researchers who would like to adopt this protocol might decide on their own how many healthy PBMC donors to be screened, based on the design of the planned studies.\nMonitor tumor volume twice a week by measuring with a caliper.\nNOTE: Tumor growth rate may vary with PBMC from different donors.\nCollect the tumor tissues at an average volume of 200-500 mm3 and process them for histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. Examine human CD8, PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions. See step 4 for detailed protocol.\nSelect PBMC donors that result in moderate tumor growth (tumor volume > 200 mm3 14 days post inoculation) and relatively high PD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 expressions (mean IHC scores > 2). See step 4 for detailed IHC scoring protocol.\n3. Human Cancer Cell Line and PDX Screen\nScreen cell lines and PDXs according to the procedures stated in step 1.2, to evaluate tumor growth rate, human PD-L1 expression of the tumors and immune cell infiltrations.\nNOTE: Over 30 human cancer cell lines and over 20 PDXs of different cancer types were screened by the authors. Data of selected tumor models were shown in the results section.\n4. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nHarvest as indicated by step 1.2.5 and fix tumor tissues by immersing in formalin. Dehydrate and embed fixed tissues in paraffin. Section the fixed tissues at 3 μm and place them on polylysine-coated slides.",
    "Deparaffinize in xylenes three times 7 min each. Hydrate the sections through graded alcohols: 100% ethanol twice for 3 min each, followed by 90%, 80% and 70% ethanol in turn for 3 min each. Rinse by deionized H2O three times and remove excess liquid from the slides.\nPerform antigen retrieval by placing the slides in a container and cover with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0), or Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0). Heat the slides container by microwave for 3 min. Boil in a water bath at 95 °C for 30 min and then cool down to room temperature. Rinse by deionized H2O three times and aspirate excess liquid from the slides.\nBlock the sections by 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and 0.3% H2O2 solution in PBS for 10 min. Stain by antibodies against human CD8 (EP334), PD-1 (NAT105,) and PD-L1 (E1L3N) at 4 °C overnight, and HRP conjugated 2nd antibodies at RT for 1 h. Drop the substrate DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) onto the slides and control the reaction time (seconds to minutes) by monitoring the brown color from microscope.\nCover the slides with neutral balsam after immersing the slides in 0.5% hydrochloric acid alcohol and 0.5% ammonia water in turn for 5 s each, then in 80%, 90% and 100% ethanol in sequence for 3 min each, and finally in xylenes using three changes for 5 min each. Detect the antibodies by observing the brown color of DAB using microscope.",
    "NOTE: Human CD8 and PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating leucocytes (TIL) were assessed by assigning an expression score on a 5-point scale (IHC score, range 0-4) at high objective magnification (20x, 40x). 0, absent; 1, weak intensity/ less than 20% cells; 2, weak-to-moderate intensity/ 20%-50% cells; 3, moderate-to-strong intensity/ 50%-80% cells; 4, strong intensity/ more than 80% cells. Human PD-L1 staining within tumor cells was scored using an adjusted scoring system on a 5-point scale (IHC score, range 0-4) because of its relatively diffused signal. 0, absent; 1, weak intensity/ less than 10% cells; 2, weak-to-moderate intensity/10%-30% cells; 3, moderate/ 30%-50% cells; 4, strong intensity/ more than 50% cells.\n5. In Vivo efficacy and Pharmacodynamics Studies in Humanized PBMC-NOD/SCID Xenograft Models\nPre-treat NOD/SCID mice as indicated by step 1.1.3. In brief, treat the mice with 100 mg/kg CP (i.p.) and 125 mg/kg DS (p.o.) once a day for 2 days.\n20 to 24 h after the second dose, inject subcutaneously (s.c.) with indicated number of human cancer cells and 2.5-5 x 106 PBMCs (a total of 200 μL cell mixture in 50% Matrigel) in the right front flank of animals.\nNOTE: The number of PBMC used for any individual mouse in one single study should be the same. However, due to variations in the availability of total isolated PBMC at the time of each study, the authors have chosen to use 2.5 x 106, 4 x 106, or 5 x 106 PBMC at different studies. Although this 2-fold difference in the administered amount of PBMCs might affect the degree of humanization, the authors do not observe significant differences in evaluating anti-tumor efficacies of the tested immunotherapies.",
    "For PDXs engraftment, inject subcutaneously tumor fragments (3 x 3 x 3 mm3) in the right front flank of animals. Inject subcutaneously 200 μL of 5 x 106 PBMCs (100 μL each side) to the left and right of engrafted tumor fragment.\nNOTE: PDX tumor tissues were administered in a Matrigel solution, same as described for the cell line models.\nOn the day of cell inoculation, randomly group the animals and treat as the planned study protocol.  Assess the anti-tumor activity of candidate drugs, BGB-A317 (QW, i.p.) in this case, at the indicated doses in various tumor models.\nNOTE: The three human cancer cell lines (i.e., A431 (epidemoid carcinoma), SKOV3 (ovarian cancer) and SK-MES-1 (lung cancer)), as well as two PDX models (i.e., BCLU-054 (lung cancer) and BCCO-028 (colon cancer)), are considered good tumor models for I-O therapy evaluation in this humanized mouse model.\nMeasure primary tumor volume twice every week, using a caliper.\nNOTE: Gand body weights loss were observed around 4-6 weeks post PBMC engraftment in our studies, allowing a 1-2 months window for therapeutic efficacy evaluations.\nFor the pharmacodynamics analysis of tumor infiltrated immune cells, cut the tumor tissues into small pieces and digest them with collagenase type I (1 mg/mL) and DNase I (100 μg/mL) in RPMI1640 plus 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Pass the digested tissues through 40 μm cell strainers to obtain single cell suspensions.",
    "Wash the cells and adjust cell number to a concentration of 1 x 107 cells/mL in ice cold FACS Buffer (PBS, 1% FBS) in 96-well round bottom plates. Wash the cells by centrifuging and block them by adding 20 μg/mL human IgG for 30 min, followed by staining with anti-human CD3 (HIT3a), CD8 (OKT8) and PD-1 (MIH4) antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min. Then subject the stained samples to flow cytometry and analyze using guavaSoft 3.1.1. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
