RNA-PLA\nFixed, permeabilized cells plated on coverslips are subjected to in situ hybridization with PLA probes possessing a tripartite structure: i.) a 40–50 nt sequence complementary to a target RNA of interest ii.) a polyA linker iii.) and an assay-specific, non-targeting oligonucleotide sequence designated “Priming” or “Non-priming” by the addition of three methylated-uridines at the 3′ end (marked by a black circle). Following hybridization, two PLA Connectors are introduced which can complement with the PLA sequence of the PLA probes (region (iii)). If the PLA Connectors are in close proximity to each other, the addition of T4 DNA ligase will result in circularization of the PLA Connectors. This circle then serves as a template for rolling circle amplification (RCA) driven by the priming PLA probe which generates a single-stranded, contiguous PCR product which can be detected using a Cy5-conjugated antisense DNA oligonucleotide probe coupled with confocal microscopy.\nTo permeabilize cells, add 500 μL of PLA Permeabilization Buffer to each well containing a coverslip and incubate for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate PLA Permeabilization Buffer.\nBlock cells using 500 μL of PLA Blocking Buffer per well containing a coverslip at 37°C for 1 h.\nPrepare PLA probe mixture:\nPrepare probe working solutions:\nIn an RNase-free, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, dilute an aliquot of the probe stock solution (50 μM) to 5 μM using RNase-free H2O.\nFor each coverslip, add 1 μL of Priming probe and 1 μL Non-Priming probe to 48 μL of PLA Blocking Buffer.\nMix the probe mixture well by pipetting gently up and down.",
    "Note: Working solutions of 5 μM can be stored at −20°C and freeze-thawed multiple times without loss of PLA reactivity.\nBuild a hybridization chamber.\nFold a clean paper towel into a square such that it fits within a 10 cm2 tissue culture dish.\nSoak the paper towel thoroughly with dH2O and place inside a 10 cm2 tissue culture dish.\nCut a piece of parafilm such that it fits within the paper towel square.\nNote: The parafilm square should be smaller than the paper towel such that the edges of the paper towel are exposed and form a border around the parafilm.\nPipette the prepared 50 μL PLA probe mixture onto the parafilm (it will form a contained droplet).\nUsing a 200 μL pipette tip, lift the coverslip off the bottom of the well.\nGently grasp the coverslip at the edges with forceps.\nNote: Flat rather than pointed forceps are better for this step.\nPlace the coverslip onto the PLA probe mixture such that the cells are in contact with the liquid.\nSeal the chamber with parafilm.\nIncubate at 37°C for 12–18 h.\nPLA connector and linker ligation\nTiming: 30 m\nTwo PLA Connectors are introduced into the cells after PLA probe hybridization. These Connectors can complement and bind the PLA probes. After binding, if the PLA Connectors are in close proximity to each other (suggesting that the PLA probe-bound target RNAs are also in close proximity) they can be circularized by T4 DNA ligase (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nUsing forceps, remove the coverslip from the hybridization chamber and place it in a 24-well plate with the cells facing up.",
    "Note: The same 24-well plate used for storage, permeabilization, and blocking, can also be used for the remainder of this protocol. The previous contact with buffer can help in the following steps to spread the ligation mixture evenly across the coverslip. Wash the wells 3× with 1X DPBS prior to replacing the coverslip.\nNote: Add 500 μL 1X DPBS to the wells prior to adding the coverslip.\nNote: Make sure the coverslip is securely placed on the bottom of the well and is not floating in the 1X DPBS.\nWash 3× with 1X DPBS with gentle rocking agitation for 5 min for each wash.\nPrepare ligation master mix in the following order:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2194_4.csv\nCritical: Prepare the ligation master mix IMMEDIATELY before placing it onto the coverslip. If prepared too far in advance, the enzyme will begin ligating the PLA Connectors in the tube, resulting in non-specific PLA signal downstream.\nMix ligation master mix quickly by inverting the tube 3–4 times and/or pipetting up and down.\nAdd 200 μL of ligation master mix to each coverslip.\nCritical: Pipette the master mix in a dropwise fashion across the coverslip to help the liquid spread. The master mix may pool in certain areas within the well, leaving regions of the coverslip dry. Draw up the mixture and pipette it along dry areas until you achieve full coverage of the coverslip. This may take a few repetitions.\nReplace plate lid and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nRolling circle amplification (RCA)\nTiming: 2 h\nAfter PLA Connector ligation, the resultant circle serves as a template for phi29 polymerase-mediated rolling circle amplification (RCA) driven by the Priming PLA probe. This will generate a single-stranded, processive PCR amplicon which can be detected downstream.\nAspirate ligation master mix and discard.",
    "Wash coverslips 3× with 1X DPBS with gentle rocking agitation for 5 min for each wash.\nPrepare rolling circle amplification (RCA) mix in the following order:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2194_5.csv\nMix master mix by inverting 3–4 times and/or pipetting up and down.\nAdd 250 μL of RCA master mix to each coverslip.\nReplace plate lid and cover with aluminum foil to protect from light.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h 40 min.\nPLA signal detection\nTiming: 2–6 h\nIn the previous step, a Cy5-conjugated, antisense DNA oligonucleotide probe complementary to the RCA amplicon was introduced as part of the phi29 master mix. Here, we visualize the Cy5-conjugated probe bound to the RCA amplicon using confocal microscopy (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: All incubations should be done protected from light from this point forward.\nAspirate RCA master mix and discard.\nPrepare Hoechst working solution:\nDilute 5 mg/mL Hoechst stock 1:1000 in 500 μL 1X DPBS/coverslip.\nAdd 500 μL Hoechst working solution to each coverslip.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C with gentle rocking agitation for 15 min.\nAspirate Hoechst and discard.\nWash 3× with 1X DPBS with gentle rocking agitation at 20°C–25°C for 5 min each wash.\nMount the coverslip onto a microscope slide.\nPipette approximately 10 μL of Vectashield mounting media per coverslip onto the slide(s).\nUsing a 200 μL pipette tip, lift the coverslip from the bottom of the well.\nGrasp the coverslip at the edges using forceps.\nGently dab the bottom edge of the coverslip onto a Kim-Wipe to remove excess 1X DPBS.\nPlace the coverslip at a 45° angle such that the cells are facing towards the Vectashield.\nWith a swift motion, allow the coverslip to drop onto the Vectashield.\n(Optional) Seal coverslips with clear nail polish.\nLet slides cure at 20°C–25°C for 2 h.",
    "Note: Slides can be imaged after as little as 15 min however, we have observed better quality images following a longer cure.\nPause point: Slides can also be stored at −20°C for one day. We do not recommend storing slides for longer than three days as the Cy5 signal will begin to fade.\nImage using a Leica DM5500 or equivalent confocal microscope.\nNote: We use a 63× oil immersion objective to image RNA-PLA samples.\nNote: We recommend collecting images along the outer third of the coverslip circumference where cells are better distributed, rather than in the center. Furthermore, the ligation and RCA mixes tend to pool around the edges due to surface tension, resulting in more robust signal. We collect images for 40–50 cells throughout all four quadrants of the coverslip to prevent bias as much as possible."
