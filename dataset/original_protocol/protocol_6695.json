    "Retinal dissection and fixationDark adapt animals for at least 3 h prior to dissecting retinas.Note: Dark adaptation is crucial to separate neural retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. However, this step can be omitted when staining synaptic components, as dark adaptation can induce rapid changes in synaptic structure. In dark room under red illumination, sacrifice fish by immersion in ice cold water and cervical transection.Using stereomicroscope, microscissors and tweezers, carefully insert microscissors into the back of the globe to visualize optic nerve (Figure 1, arrows). Cut the optic nerve, gently remove the globe, and place it on paper towel (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g001.jpgFigure 1. Enucleating the eye globe imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g002.jpgFigure 2. Front and back views of dissected globe Note: For better separation of neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium, avoid bright lights. Dim illumination is acceptable. Using 30 G ½ Injection needle, make a small hole ventrally at the choroid fissure (Figure 3, red circle).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g003.jpgFigure 3. Globe with ventral hole  Note: If the choroid fissure is not visible, use other anatomical landmarks to distinguish the dorsal-ventral axis. The dorsal aspect of the eye has a greater amount of melanin/black pigments and fewer iridophores/shiny, silvery pigments, which are enriched ventrally (Figure 2).  With microscissors, extend the ventral hole about 5 mm toward the optic nerve head for orientation.Cut circumferentially at the junction of the cornea and iris (Figure 4 left, red dashed line) with microscissors. Remove the entire anterior segment of the eye and lens (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g004.jpgFigure 4. Removal of the anterior segment Place the eye cup into PBS and gently separate the neural retina from retinal pigment epithelium by inserting micro tweezers between two layers. The neural retina is faintly pink and contrasts with the underlying retinal pigmented epithelium (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g005.jpgFigure 5.",
    "Lateral view of the eye cup in PBS Using microsurgical blade, make short relaxation cuts from the margin toward the center of the retina at the nasal, temporal and dorsal quadrants (Figure 6). These cuts help to flatten retinas during mounting on the glass slides.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g006.jpgFigure 6. Dissected retina Place individual retinas in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M Phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 5% sucrose, and fix overnight at 4 °C on rotator (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g007.jpgFigure 7. Fixation of retinas The next day, rinse retinas with 1 ml of 5% sucrose in 0.1 M Phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) 3 times for 20 min each on rotator at room temperature.Epitope retrieval (optional) Note: This procedure is necessary if your antibody recognizes membrane-associated proteins, such as Zonula Occludens (Figure 13; Nagashima et al., 2020) and N-Cadherin (Nagashima et al., 2017).  Using hot plate, prepare a boiling water bath.Exchange 5% sucrose in 0.1 M Phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 500 μl of Sodium Citrate buffer.Immerse centrifuge tubes in boiling water bath for 5 to 10 min (Figure 8).Note: Install a LidLock on each microcentrifuge tube and use a floating rack. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g008.jpgFigure 8. Epitope retrieval Remove beaker from hot plate and let it cool down for 5 min. Do not remove microcentrifuge tubes from the beaker.After 5 min, remove microcentrifuge tubes from the beaker and rinse retinas with 1 ml of PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min on rotator.ImmunohistochemistryRemove buffer from the microcentrifuge tubes and add 500 μl of Whole-mount IHC blocking buffer. Incubate retinas with Whole-mount IHC blocking buffer at room temperature for 2 h on rotator.Dilute antibodies with Whole-mount IHC dilution buffer into optimized dilution (if unknown, start with 1:200). Make sure to centrifuge for 30 s before use.",
    "Note: If you need double or triple labeling, mix all primary antibodies together. If your sample has transgenes, such as GFP or mCherry, we recommend using anti-GFP, anti-dsRed or anti-mCherry antibodies to amplify signals. Optimal dilutions for anti-GFP, anti-dsRed or anti-mCherry vary depending on the type of transgene, cell types transgenes are expressed, and the expression level. We recommend starting with 1:200 if optimized dilution is unknown. Anti-GFP, anti-dsRed, or anti-Cherry is necessary for retinas following epitope retrieval. Incubate retinas with primary antibodies at room temperature overnight (NO agitation).Note: Add at least 100 μl of dilution buffer containing desired antibodies. Rinse retinas with 1 ml of Whole-mount IHC washing buffer 20 min three times at room temperature.Incubate retinas with secondary antibodies at room temperature overnight in the dark.Note: Add at least 100 μl of dilution buffer containing desired antibodies with optimized dilution (if unknown, start with 1:200). If you need double or triple labeling, mix all secondary antibodies together. If possible, avoid green-fluorescent conjugate, such as Alexa Fluor 488, since green channel often shows higher background, especially after antigen retrieval. Rinse retinas with 1 ml of Whole-mount IHC washing buffer 20 min three times at room temperature.Mounting on slide glassUsing transfer pipette, transfer retina on a slide glass (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g009.jpgFigure 9. Transferred retina on a slide glass Remove excess buffer with Kimwipe (DO NOT let retinas completely dry).Using tweezer, clean up and orient retinas in photoreceptor side down. A large ventral cut (see Step A8) serves as a landmark for orientating the retina. Add 1 to 2 drops of Prolong Gold onto cover glass. Gently place the cover glass on the retina for mounting (Figure 10).Note: Cure at least for 1 week at room temperature in the dark. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3848/bioprotoc-10-24-3848-g010.jpgFigure 10.
