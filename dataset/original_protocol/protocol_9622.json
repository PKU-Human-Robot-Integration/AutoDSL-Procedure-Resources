    "1. Fabricating the master wafer\nTake a 4 in (10 cm) diameter clean silicon wafer (see Table of Materials). Clean it further using pressurized air to remove any dust particles.\nMount the wafer on a spin coater, and gently dispense ~5 mL of a negative photoresist (see Table of Materials) in the center of the wafer. Try to avoid air bubbles, as they might interfere with the downstream printing process of the wafer.\nTo obtain a 10 µm thick photoresist layer, spin-coat the wafer at 500 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 100 rpm/s for initial spreading, followed by a 60 s spin at 3,000 rpm with an acceleration of 500 rpm/s. In case a different thickness is desired, change the spinning parameters according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nBake the wafer on a heating plate for 2 min at 65 °C and then for 5 min at 95 °C.\nOnce the wafer cools down, mount the wafer in the printing chamber of the direct-write optical lithography machine (see Table of Materials), and feed the OLA design (Figure 2A, Supplementary Coding File 1) into the software.\n\tNOTE: The OLA design essentially consists of two OA channels, two LO channels, and one IA channel, which merge to form a six-way junction that continues as a post-production channel and ends up in the experimental well (EW).\nPrint the OLA design(s) on the coated wafer using a UV laser (see Table of Materials) with a dose of 300 mJ/cm2.\nOnce the design is printed, bake the wafer at 65 °C for 1 min, followed by 95 °C for 3 min.",
    "At this point, ensure that the outline of the printed device appears on the wafer and is visible to the naked eye. To wash off the uncured photoresist, dip the wafer in a glass beaker containing the developer solution (see Table of Materials) until the uncured photoresist is fully removed.\n\tNOTE: Excess developer treatment can affect the design resolution.\nWash the wafer with acetone, isopropanol, and deionized (DI) water in sequence, and finally, with pressurized air/N2 using a blow gun.\nHard-bake the wafer at 150 °C for 30 min to ensure that the printed design is firmly attached to the wafer surface and does not come off in the downstream fabrication process. The master wafer is then ready for further use (Figure 2B).\n2. Preparing the microfluidic device\nPlace the master wafer on a square piece of aluminum, and wrap the aluminum foil around the wafer, forming a well-like structure (Figure 2C).\nMeasure 40 g of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and 4 g of curing agent (10:1, weight ratio, see Table of Materials) in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and mix vigorously using a spatula or a pipette tip for 2-3 min.\nThe vigorous mixing of the PDMS and curing agent traps air bubbles inside the mixture. Spin the tube at 100 x g for 2-3 min to remove majority of large air bubbles.\nPour approximately 15-20 g of the mixture prepared in step 2.3 over the master wafer, and de-gas using a desiccator. Save the excess mixture to make PDMS-coated glass slides (step 3).\nIncubate the assembly in an oven at 70 °C for at least 2 h.",
    "Take the master wafer out of the oven and let it cool down. To remove the solidified PDMS block, remove the aluminum foil, and carefully peel off the PDMS block from the edge of the wafer.\n\tNOTE: The wafer is fragile and might break, so it is important to do this process carefully.\nOnce the PDMS block is removed, keep the patterned structure facing upward, and using a sharp blade or a scalpel, cut individual PDMS blocks, each containing a single microfluidic device.\nPlace the PDMS block on a dark surface, and adjust the light direction (a table lamp comes in handy for this) so that the engraved channels are shiny and, as a result, visible. Make holes in the inlets and the exit channel using biopsy punches of 0.5 mm and 3 mm diameter (see Table of Materials), respectively.\n\tNOTE: Use a sharp biopsy punch to avoid cracks in the PDMS, which can cause leakage later. Gently push the biopsy punch through the PDMS block, and ensure it passes completely through it. To remove the biopsy punch, gently retract it while rotating it in alternate directions. The PDMS block with the engraved OLA design is now ready to bind to a PDMS-coated glass slide.\n3. Making the PDMS-coated glass slide\nTake a transparent glass coverslip, pour approximately 0.5 mL of PDMS (prepared in excess in step 2.4) onto the center of the glass slide, and spread it across the coverslip by gently tilting the glass slide, ensuring total coverage of the glass slide with PDMS.",
    "Mount the glass slide on the spin coater, ensure its centrally placed (so that the middle of the slide overlaps with the center of the pressure shaft), and spin the glass slide at 500 rpm for 15 s (at an increment of 100 rpm/s) and then at 1,000 rpm for 30 s (at an increment of 500 rpm/s).\nPlace the PDMS-coated glass slide (coated side facing upward) on a raised platform like a block of PDMS (1 cm x 1 cm) in a covered Petri dish, and bake it at 70 °C for 2 h.\n4. Bonding of the microfluidic device\nClean the PDMS block (prepared in step 2) by sticking and removing commercially available scotch tape (see Table of Materials) twice. Ensure to keep the cleaned side facing up until use.\nClean the PDMS-coated glass slide with pressurized air/N2 using a blow gun, and keep the clean side facing up.\nPlace the PDMS block (engraved channels facing up) and the PDMS-coated glass slide (coated side facing up) in the vacuum chamber of the plasma cleaner (see Table of Materials).\nSwitch on the vacuum, and expose the contents to air plasma at a radio frequency of 12 MHz (RF mode high) for 15 s to activate the surfaces. Oxygen plasma can be seen in the form of a pinkish hue.\nImmediately after the plasma treatment, place the PDMS-coated glass slide on a clean surface with the PDMS side facing upward. Gently place the PDMS block with the microfluidic pattern now facing toward the PDMS-coated glass slide, allowing them to bond (Figure 2D).\n\tNOTE: Removing the air trapped in the device is crucial to ensure thorough bonding.\nBake the bonded devices at 70 °C for 2 h.\n5. Surface functionalization of the microfluidic device",
    "NOTE: Prior to surface functionalization, it is important to calibrate the pressure pump as per the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials) and assemble the tubing to connect it to the microfluidic device.\nConnecting the microfluidic device to the pressure pumps\n\t\nConnect the pressure-driven flow controller to an external pressure source (up to 6 bars). At least four independent air pressure channels are required: three individual modules of 0-2 bar, and one module of −0.9-4 bar.\nCalibrate the pressure pump according to the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials).\nCut the tubing (1/16 in OD x 0.02 in ID) into four equal-sized pieces approximately 20 cm in length.\nInsert 23 G stainless steel 90° bent connectors (see Table of Materials) at one end of each piece. This end is later inserted into the three inlets (OA, LO, and IA) of the microfluidic device and the fourth one is used to remove excess solution (step 5.2.5).\nInsert the other end of the tubing into the microfluidic reservoir stand, and seal it using microfluidic fittings, ensuring the tubing is long enough to touch the bottom of the reservoir (1.5 mL tubes, see Table of Materials). This prevents unwanted air bubbles from entering the microfluidic device during the PVA treatment/liposome production.\nPVA treatment of the exit channel",
    "NOTE: Prior to liposome generation, it is crucial to render the device partially hydrophilic downstream of the production junction. This is done by treating these channels with 5% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. The PVA solution is prepared by dissolving the PVA powder (see Table of Materials) in water at 80 °C for 3 h with constant stirring using a magnetic stirrer. Filter the solution prior to using it for surface treatment. Immediately after the bonding of the device, the microfluidic channels are hydrophilic due to the plasma-induced surface activation, and they will gradually become hydrophobic again. It is recommended to wait for 2 h after the baking (step 4.6) before starting the PVA treatment.\n\t\nDispense 200 µL of 5% w/v PVA solution into a 1.5 mL tube, and connect it to the microfluidic reservoir stand. Insert the tubing (the one mentioned in step 5.1.3) such that one end is submerged in the PVA solution and the other end is connected to the inlet of the OA channel of the microfluidic device.\n\t\tNOTE: A lower PVA concentration can lead to sub-standard surface functionalization.\nRepeat the above step without PVA (empty 1.5 mL tube), and connect it to the LO and IA channels.\nIncrease the pressure of the OA phase to 100 mbar to flow the PVA solution in the OA channels. Increase the pressures of the IA and LO phases to 120 mbar in order to prevent the backflow of PVA solution inside these channels (Figure 2E).\n\t\tNOTE: If needed, adjust the pressures of the individual channels in order to keep the meniscus steady at the production junction.\nFlow the PVA solution in this manner for approximately 5 min, ensuring complete functionalization of the exit channel.",
    "To remove the PVA solution, detach the tubing from the OA inlet, and immediately increase the pressure in the LO and IA channels to 2 bar. Simultaneously, use a tubing connected to a negative pressure channel (−900 mbar) remove excess PVA first from the exit channel and then from the OA inlet (Figure 2F).\nBake the device at 120 °C for 15 min, and let it cool down before use. The device can be stored under ambient conditions for at least 1 month.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to wait for 1 day (at room temperature) before proceeding with OLA to ensure the untreated PDMS regains its hydrophobicity after the plasma treatment.\n6. Octanol-assisted liposome assembly (OLA)\nPreparing the lipid stock\n\tNOTE: Here, a mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (Liss Rhod PE) lipids (see Table of Materials) are used as an example; users should prepare the lipid composition they need in a similar manner.\n\t\nDispense 76 µL of DOPC (25 mg/mL) and 16.6 µL of Liss Rhod PE (1 mg/mL) into a round-bottom flask using separate glass syringes.\nKeep the round-bottom flask upright, and use a compressed N2 blow gun to give a gentle stream of nitrogen to evaporate the chloroform and form a dried lipid film at the bottom of the flask.\nPlace the flask in the desiccator for at least 2 h under a continuous vacuum to remove any remaining chloroform.\nAdd 100 µL of ethanol into the round-bottom flask, followed by gentle pipetting or shaking to ensure the lipids are dissolved to form a 10% (w/v) lipid stock.\n\t\tNOTE: In case a particular lipid composition is not completely soluble in ethanol, use an ethanol/chloroform mixture, keeping the volume of chloroform as small as possible.",
    "Pipette the solution into a dark glass vial. Gently flush the vial with nitrogen using a blow gun to replace the air with an inert atmosphere. Seal the lid with paraffin film, and store at −20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The stock solution can be used for up to a few months. Each time the vial is opened, gently replace the air with nitrogen, and reseal with lid with paraffin film.\nPreparing the OLA solutions\n\t\nMake stock solutions of the indispensable components: 20 mM dextran (Mw 6,000); 60% (v/v) glycerol; a buffer of choice. In this case, 5x phosphate-buffered saline (0.68 M NaCl, 13.5 mM KCl, 50 mM Na2HPO4, 9 mM KH2PO4; pH 7.4) was prepared (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: As pure glycerol is highly viscous, it is recommended to cut out a small piece at the end of the pipette tip in a slanted manner for effective pipetting.\nPrepare 100 µL of IA, OA, and exit solution (ES, the desired solution to fill the EW) samples. For ease of visualization, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was added to the IA solution in this particular case. Check the osmotic balance between the IA and OA by calculating the osmolarity of the encapsulated components and adding an appropriate amount of sugar or salt into the OA if needed. This is done in order to prevent the bursting or shrinking of the liposomes during production.\n\t\tNOTE: The final compositions of the three phases are as follows:\n\t\tIA: 15% glycerol, 5 mM dextran (Mw 6,000), 5.4 µM YFP, 1x PBS\n\t\tOA: 15% glycerol, 5% F68 surfactant, 1x PBS\n\t\t​ES: 15% glycerol, 1x PBS\n\t\tA lower concentration of F68 surfactant negatively affects the generation of double emulsions.",
    "Prepare 80 µL of the LO phase by pipetting 4 µL of stock lipid into 76 µL of 1-octanol (see Table of Materials). The final concentration of DOPC is 5 mg/mL.\nCentrifuge the samples at 700 x g for 60 s to remove any large aggregates before proceeding with the microfluidic experiments. This prevents any obvious clogging factors from entering the microfluidic chip.\nLiposome production\n\t\nDispense the solutions (IA, LO, OA) into three 1.5 mL tubes, assemble them (as mentioned in step 5.1), and connect them to the PVA-treated microfluidic chip (step 5.2.6).\nApply a positive pressure on the three channels: ~100 mbar on the IA and LO channels and ~200 mbar on the OA channel.\n\t\tNOTE: Since the OA pressure is higher than the others, the OA solution will be the first to arrive at EW; this is highly recommended.\nOnce the OA solution reaches EW, decrease the OA pressure to 100 mbar and increase the LO to 200 mbar.  The LO solution arriving at the production junction will likely result in air bubbles because of air being displaced from the LO channels. Once the air bubbles are dispensed into the EW, adjust the LO pressure to 100 mbar. Lastly, increase the IA pressure to 200 mbar, and wait until all the air in the IA channel is removed. The ideal sequence of arrival at the junction of the three phases is, thus, OA, LO, and IA.",
    "After removing the air from the three channels, adjust all the channel pressures to 50 mbar and pipette 10 µL of ES into the exit chamber. After pipetting the ES, put a cover slide on the exit hole to avoid evaporation. In case the LO is pushed back, gradually increase the LO pressure in 1 mbar increments until it starts to flow to the junction.\nOnce all three phases start co-flowing at the junction, ensure double emulsion production begins, and adjust according to its quality (Figure 3A-C). Change the pressures gradually (steps of 0.1-1 mbar) rather than abruptly unless the pressure is being changed to eliminate an unwanted clog in the channel.\n\t\tNOTE: The channels to adjust depends on what is happening at the junction. For example, the IA needs to be decreased if the emulsions are too big; the OA needs to be increased if double emulsions form but burst instead of getting pinched off; and the LO needs to be decreased if the octanol pocket is too big.\nCheck that the double-emulsion droplets flow downstream to EW. As they flow, octanol pockets become more and more prominent and finally get pinched off, forming liposomes (Figure 3D-F). Ensure that the post-production channel is long enough and that the migration of the double emulsions is slow enough for dewetting.\n\t\tNOTE: Within minutes after decent production, liposomes and octanol droplets will exit the post-production channel and go into the EW. As a result, being less dense than water, the octanol droplets float to the surface of the ES. Due to the addition of dextran in the IA, the liposomes are heavier than their surroundings and go to the bottom of the chamber ready for observation and further manipulation.\nSubscription Required.
