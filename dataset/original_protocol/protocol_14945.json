    "1. Experimental Animals\nObtain a Local Ethics Committee approval for all experiments which will be performed, in accordance with the animal protection FELASA guidelines (K 40, 17/99).\nUse male Lewis rats available to purchase from any commercial breeder (e.g., Charles River Wiga GmbH, Sulzfeld, Germany). Here, 224 animals (112 donors, 112 recipients) were used to perform 112 transplantations. The recipients were sacrificed at 6 weeks postoperatively. At the time of operation, the animals should weigh 250-350 g.\nKeep the animals in climate-controlled rooms with free access to food and water.\n2. Anesthesia and Operative Preparation\nPlace the rat in a plexiglas box connected to the anesthesia machine with an oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min, and an isofluorane vaporizer with 5 % anesthetic gas to induce anesthesia. Maintain anesthesia at 1.5 % isofluorane.\nPlace the rats in supine position on a warming plate.\nRemove the fur of the abdomen with a depilation cream.\nPrepare a sterile surgical field as following: Use a disinfectant to clean the benchtop. For the disinfection of the incision site use Chlorhexidine first, alcohol second and, finally, a scrub solution (e.g., Chlorhexidine and 70% isopropyl alcohol). Wear a disposable surgical gown and surgical gloves.\nUse sterile microsurgery instruments.\nUse an operation microscope in 12-20-fold magnification.\n3. Surgical Procedure\nDonor operation\nPreparation\nPerform a median laparotomy and resect the left lateral lobe and the median lobe of the graft as described by Higgins.14",
    "Then prepare the hepatoduodenal ligament. First ligate the bile duct in order to induce congestion and dilation of the small bile duct. Then ligate and transect the gastroduodenal vein and artery. Afterwards, isolate the celiac trunk and the common hepatic artery and transect the left gastric artery and the splenic artery. Incise the congested bile duct, and introduce a 20-G stent into it. The positioning of the stent must ensure the drainage of the entire hilar bile duct system. Transect the bile duct distally to the stent.\nIsolate the infrahepatic segment of the caval vein right above the right renal vein.\nPerfusion\nAfter ligation of the aorta above the celiac trunk, clamp the portal vein and incise it. Introduce the perfusion catheter (14 G) into the portal vein, and perform the perfusion with 30 ml of histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK)-solution (12 cm H2O, 4°C).\nCut the diaphragm and the suprahepatic caval vein to allow the perfusate to flow out.\nExcise the celiac trunk along with an aortic patch and rinse it with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution.\nExplantation\nTransect the infrahepatic caval vein right above the right renal vein.\nThen, place a stent with a diameter of 0.3 mm in the portal vein and fix it with a ligature. During the following operation, the portal vein is arterialized via the right renal artery. Transect the portal vein distally to the stent.\nAfter ligation of the suprahepatic caval vein, transect it together with a cuff of diaphragm.\nExplant the graft and store it in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK)-solution at 4 ° Celsius in a plastic bag on ice. Place corner sutures (8-0 Ethilon) in the infrahepatic caval vein.\nRecipient operation",
    "Perform a median laparotomy and prepare the infrahepatic caval vein. Then isolate the right renal artery and the ureter, ligate the ureter and transect it. Clamp the right renal artery at its origin, then ligate the right renal vein. Then after transection of both renal vessels, perform the nephrectomy. Subsequently, shorten the right renal artery, rinse it with heparin saline solution (40 UI heparin/ml saline solution).\nTransect the right renal vein proximally to the ligature after proximal and distal clamping of the infrahepatic caval vein to create an oval lumen in the infrahepatic caval vein. Rinse the caval vein with heparin saline solution. Implant the graft in the right renal region of the recipient’s abdomen.\nAnastomose the donor’s infrahepatic caval vein end-to-side to the recipient`s caval vein with a 8-0 Ethilon running suture.\nAfter rinsing with heparin/saline solution, introduce the stent in the portal vein into the right renal artery (Figure 3). Connect the portal vein and renal artery with 2 stitches (8-0 Ethilon). Fix the linking stent in the renal artery with a ligature (braided silk black 7-0).\nTo allow reperfusion, first remove the arterial clamp, then both venous clamps (Figure 4).\nPrepare the infrarenal aorta, then place a proximal and distal microclamp and incise the aorta right between both clamps. Perform an end-to-side anastomosis between the aorta and the donor’s celiac trunk, using an aortic patch, with a 10-0 Ethilon running suture.\nInsert the bile duct into the duodenum: Apply a pursestring suture in the duodenal wall, make a small incision in the duodenal wall right in the middle of the pursestring. Introduce the stented bile duct into the duodenum, and tighten the pursestring suture. Finally, hold the duodenum and the bile duct tightly together with two stitches (Ethilon 8-0) (Figure 5).",
    "Then perform a subtotal resection of the native liver, first described by Emond et al. to mimic acute hepatic failure.7\nFix the suprahepatic caval vein of the graft, together with a cuff of diaphragm, to the lateral abdominal wall of the recipient with 4-0 Vicryl suture. Rinse the abdomen with saline solution (Figure 6).\nFor the muscular layer use a 4-0 Vicryl running suture and for the cutaneous a 3-0 Vicryl running suture.\n4. Recovery and Postoperative Management\nLet the animals recover from anesthesia under an infrared warming lamp.\nInject Buprenorphine at a dose of 0.03-0.05 mg/kg B.W. sc every 8-12 hr for 2 days.\nExamine the animals concerning the general condition and signs of illness or infections.\n5. Calculation of the Initial Native Liver Weight\nCalculate the initial native liver weight in the following manner: subtract the weight of the resected liver lobes from the complete liver weight (2.66% of body weight (this value with a standard deviation of +/- 0.49% was determined in previous experiments with n=80 animals of the same strain and age)).15Subscription Required.
