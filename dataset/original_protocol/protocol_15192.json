    "1.\tHow to Make the Probe Holder (Single Site or Multi-site)\nThe materials required are natural rubber, small plastic tubes and a metal stylet. The probe holder can be customized to the size of the animal, the number and size of the Laser Doppler probes, and the cerebral vascular territory which needs to be monitored.    \nCut the natural rubber of the needed size (approximately 10 mm x 10 mm for  a 300 g rat). \nMark the positions of the probe(s) and the bregma on the natural rubber, according to the desired stereotaxic coordinates; for middle cerebral artery occlusion, the typical coordinates for the ischemic core are expected at bregma -1 mm, 5 mm lateral to the midline; for a peripheral ischemic borderzone territory, the expected coordinates can be at bregma +2 mm, 2 mm lateral to the midline. \nMark very clearly the position of the bregma with an X, this is the landmark for attaching the probe holder to the skull. \nInsert the stylet into a small plastic tube (its size needs to match the size of the probe).\nInsert the stylet into the natural rubber at the point where the probe has to be positioned; push the stylet into the rubber until the plastic tube has been inserted into the rubber too. \nWithdraw the stylet. \nIf multiple probes are needed, repeat steps 1.5-1.7 for other probe positions. \nOptional for multiple probes: wrap a tape around the plastic tubes to ensure a better stabilization of the probes.\nOptional: perform chemical sterilization of several probe holders for future uses. \n2.\tPresurgical Preparation\nMCAO stroke model is usually performed as a survival surgery. In this case, as shown in our video (survival time 24 hr post-surgery), the surgeon uses an aseptic technique with sterilized instruments and supplies.",
    "Anesthetize the rat with isoflurane (3% induction phase, 1.5% maintenance).\nPlace the rat in prone position on the operating table. \nGently shave the head of the rat. \nApply an antiseptic solution to a gauze pad and disinfect the skin.    \nAdminister Lidocaine 2% 5 mg/kg subcutaneously in the cranial area. \n3.\tProbe Positioning and Securing Over the Intact Skull\nMake a right paramedian skin incision (for right MCAO) and dissect the subcutaneous tissue to reach the cranial fascia (galea aponeurotica).\nMake a right paramedian incision in the cranial fascia and perform blunt dissection to reach the skull bone; prepare a skull bone area which is large enough for the application of the probe holder.\nPlease note: no need for drilling or bone thinning. \nApply Merbromin solution to disinfect and dry the skull surface. \nUse a hair dryer (set for cold air) to accelerate drying the skull surface. \nAt this point, the cranial sutures and the bregma are clearly visible.\nCustomize the probe holder by cutting the edges with sterile scissors. \nApply a small quantity of surgical glue (Cyanoacrylate, veterinary-approved) to the surface underneath the probe holder, carefully avoiding the inferior opening of the plastic tubes (please note: if a significant amount of glue remains between the optical surface of the probe and the skull, this may produce a low-signal and may damage the probe after multiple uses).\nApply the probe holder to the skull surface, carefully matching the bregma with the X landmark. Apply gentle pressure over the probe holder. \nUse a hair dryer (set for cold air) to accelerate drying the surgical glue. \nSecure the probe holder by tying a surgical thread around the probe holder and the head of the animal; be careful to position the surgical thread over the mandibula, avoiding the submandibular region and the neck.",
    "Optional: fill the plastic tube(s) of the probe holder with an optical gel (e.g. a common ultrasound or electrocardiography gel); this will increase the quality of the LD signal.\nPlace the probe(s) in the probe holder and verify the actual reading of the LD flowmeter. Use the LD flowmeter according to manufacturer's instructions. \nSecure the probe(s) tying them around head of the animal; be careful to position the surgical thread over the mandibula, avoiding the submandibular region and the neck. \n4.\tCerebral Perfusion Monitoring During MCAO \nPlace the rat in the supine position, carefully avoiding tractional forces on the probe(s) or probe holder.  \nStart cerebral perfusion monitoring during MCAO. \n5.\tRemoval of the Probe(s) and Probe Holder\nCut the sutures around the probe(s), the probe holder and the head of the animal.\nGently blunt dissect cranial soft tissues and skin around the natural rubber base of the probe holder. \nRemove the probe holder. \nApply an antiseptic solution to the skull surface. \nSuture the cranial skin. \n6.\tPost-operative Care\nAdminister 2.5 ml of saline solution subcutaneously to prevent dehydration and keep the animal warm using a heating pad after stopping gaseous anesthesia.    \nFor survival surgery: provide preemptive analgesia with Ketoprofen 4 mg/kg subcutaneously and repeat the same dose at 12 hr post-operatively \nUnder our experimental conditions, euthanasia was performed at 24 hr post-surgery by CO2 inhalation."
