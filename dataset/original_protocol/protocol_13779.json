  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The methods described here are those used at UCLA for performing FLA of the prostate. The research project, including the protocol, were approved by the UCLA institutional review board (IRB). All patients have had targeted biopsy of the prostate, in which the MRI has been interpreted by an experienced uro-radiologist. Lesions visible on MRI were biopsied within the region of interest (ROI) and outside the ROI using a systematic template. The positive biopsies and MRI region of interest are used to plan treatment with laser ablation in order to treat the index lesion and create a margin of treated tissue around the tumor, given that MRI underestimates the size of the tumor.21 Only patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer (GG2-3 PSA < 20, Stage < T2), a single index ROI and no contralateral clinically significant prostate cancer are considered eligible for treatment. Patients with bleeding diathesis or inability to tolerate treatment without sedation are considered ineligible.\n1. Treatment Planning\nPrior to treatment, plan ablations targets using input from the MRI and biopsy coordinates.\nPerform treatment planning with the provided software.\n2. Procedural Room Preparation\nDisplay a laser warning sign outside of the procedure room.\nPosition the workstation for comfortable access.\nPower on the workstation, fusion device and transrectal ultrasound.\nEnter login credential and select the desired patient from the default work list containing unexecuted plans.\n\t​NOTE: New treatment plans can be added via a USB or internet connection as detailed in the user manual.\nHang a bag of saline from the designated hook on the workstation; a waste saline return bag is also attached.\nPrime the saline tubing by allowing gravity flow of fluid prior to locking the tubing. The saline is then connected to the peristaltic pump and hung for later use during the procedure.",
    "3. TRUS probe preparation\nApply ultrasound jelly directly to a clean TRUS probe.\n\tNOTE: At UCLA, all TRUS probes are disinfected via an automated system with vaporized hydrogen peroxide solution.\nFit a condom over the ultrasound jelly onto the TRUS probe and secure it at the base using a rubber band.\n\tNOTE: Per standard practice attempt to remove air bubbles trapped under the condom.\nPlace a multi-channel guide over the condom and lock it in place using the metal clamp. A second condom with internal ultrasound jelly can be placed over the multi-channel guide to augment patient comfort.\n4. Patient preparation\nDirect the patient to cleanse their rectal vault with and enema on the morning of the biopsy.\nEnsure that the patient has obtained prophylactic antibiotics 60 minutes prior to the procedure22.\n\tNOTE: At UCLA, 1 g of Ertapenem is administered intramuscularly 60 minutes prior to the procedure. This decision was made based on the UCLA antibiogram and had prevented post-biopsy septic episodes over the last 1500 transrectal biopsies.23 Given this success, we elected to also use it for transrectal laser ablation.\nProvide patients with Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO, Ketorolac 30 mg IM, and optionally but recommended Diazepam 10 mg PO, 60 minutes prior to the procedure.\n\tNOTE: Patients may experience a moderate desire to void or pressure in the penis during the procedure. In our experience, no narcotics are beneficial.\nPatients may find it useful to bring personal music and headphones as an additional anxiolytic.\nPlace the patient in the left lateral decubitus position as for transrectal biopsy.\nRecord patient vital signs prior to beginning the procedure and at 30-minute intervals.\n5. Administration of prostatic nerve block\nInsert the lubricated TRUS probe until the center of the prostate is clearly visible.",
    "Optimize the ultrasound gain, time gain compensation (TGC sliders on the right of most ultrasounds), depth and focus so that the prostate is centered within the ultrasound viewing monitor.\n\tNOTE: The optimal gain results in a medium-gray image within the peripheral zone. The TGC sliders are best set at a gradually sloping angle to compensate for wave attenuation of distant tissues. The ultrasound depth and focus will depend on prostate size. The focus should be set to the peripheral zone to optimize visualization of acoustic markers on the laser catheter.\nActivate the on-screen biopsy guide and place a 22 gauge spinal needle through the center of the multichannel guide to anesthetize the prostate.\n\t​NOTE: At UCLA we anesthetize the prostate in the sagittal plane by placing 10-20 mL of Lidocaine/Marcaine at the junction of the prostate and seminal vesicles. Correct infiltration will cause a separation of the seminal vesicles and prostate from the rectal wall.\n6. MRI-US fusion\nPosition the imaging fusion system and workstation close enough to the patient in order to visualize the workstation screens while also observing the patient.\nIf using the Artemis, use a technique for docking and image registration previously described.24\n7. Target acquisition\nNavigate the ultrasound to the center of the first ablation site using digital targets supplied by the fusion device. This process is similar to guiding the ultrasound to a MRI region of interest during fusion biopsy.\n\tNOTE: Each ablation site is determined from the MRI region of interest and positive biopsy cores (Figure 1). The patient's treatment plan should be transferred to the workstation and fusion device during procedure room preparation described above.\nSelect the current ablation zone.\n8. Placement of laser catheter and temperature probe\nPlace the 14-gauge laser catheter into the center chamber of the multichannel guide.",
    "NOTE: The multichannel guide is curved to provide slight friction thus preventing treatment elements from slipping backwards during ablation. Overcome this friction by rotating back and forth while advancing the laser catheter into the prostate.\nAdvance the laser catheter until four echogenic bands are visualized and aligned with the on-screen depth marker. For a peripheral zone ablation, the markers will be several mm outside the prostate capsule (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: In the case of a fibrous posterior capsule, the laser catheter may deflect rather than traversing the prostate capsule. Any deflection will be visible on the ultrasound during the insertion. Should deflection occur, remove the laser catheter and insert a leader, such as the sturdy thermal probe, to create a pilot opening in the capsule. The laser catheter can then be advanced as planned.\nInsert the thermal probe to the left or right of the laser catheter depending on the treatment plan. At the correct depth, the thermal probe interlocks with the laser catheter handle, allowing it align in the correct orientation.\n\tNOTE: After placement, check that the slot on the thermal probe seated into the handle of the laser catheter. The thermal probe will magnetically lock in place and prevent rotation during treatment.\nConnect primed intravenous tubing from the saline bag to the proximal inflow port on the laser catheter.\nConnect the returning saline from the distal outflow port to a clear drainage bag so that returning fluid can be visualized.\n\t​NOTE: Circulating saline around the laser catheter will cool the fiber during treatment\n9. Perform the Safety Checklist\nWhile on the treatment monitoring screen, select the desired ablation site. Once the appropriate ablation is selected, press 'CONFIRM SELECTION.' A safety checklist will now occupy the left side of the workstation monitor.",
    "NOTE: This step will begin circulating saline through the laser catheter. Small bubbles introduced when connecting the intravenous tubes are initially visible on ultrasound around the laser. This can act as an additional check for the laser catheter position.\nFollow the safety checklist, ticking off the boxes once complete.\nEnsure that all individuals in the room don laser safety goggles including the patient.\nThe workstation computer system will automatically check the thermal probe to ensure that all thermocouples are reading uniform body temperatures between 30 - 40 °C.\nConfirm that the laser catheters' four echogenic bands are located at the prostate capsule, as placement of the thermal probe may push the prostate away from the laser catheter.\n\t​NOTE: The ablation zone begins 5 mm distal to the echogenic markers and extends another 27 mm in length and 18 mm in diameter (maximal).\n10. Performing the Laser Tissue Ablation\nOnce the safety checklist is complete press 'START LASER' to begin the ablation.\nMonitor treatment progress in real-time using temperature readings, timer, and damage map.\n\tNOTE: Evaluate tissue temperature utilizing the multi-line graph to the left of the prostate model. The rectal temperature is marked in white and should not exceed 42 °C. Temperature at the tip of the laser catheter is marked in blue (Figure 3). The laser will automatically shut off if the laser tip exceeds 75 °C or the rectal wall exceeds 42°C.\n\tNOTE: Once the laser is active, monitor treatment time at each ablation site using the red bar at the top of the screen. A damage map gives a 3D representation of treated tissue based on temperature and time.",
    "NOTE: Note changes on B-mode ultrasound. Prostate tissue usually does not change in appearance during laser ablation. With serial treatments the tissue may take on a hypoechoic appearance, but US visualization primarily serves for positioning of the laser.\n\tNOTE: Monitor for concerning ultrasound features as follows:\n\t\nSwirling micro bubbles forming beyond the echogenic laser catheter bands may indicate a leak in circulating saline due to super-heating. While this has no safety impact, treatment progress may be slowed.\nAn increase in hyperechoic nature or 'whitening' of the rectal fat may occur if the laser catheter is inadvertently pulled back, causing heating of the perirectal fat.\nIf either of these ultrasound findings are observed laser treatment should be stopped.\nThe laser automatically stops once the timer runs out, but a practitioner can elect to end the ablation manually by pressing 'STOP THE LASER.' Saline will continue to flow, cooling the laser tip.\n\tNOTE: Consider stopping the ablation early if temperatures plateau above 55 °C for greater than 60 seconds.\nKeep the laser catheter and thermal probe in place until the temperature of the laser catheter has dropped below 42 °C, thus preventing rectal wall heating during withdrawal of the laser catheter.\n11. Subsequent ablations\nPosition the ultrasound at the next ablation site using the digital targets supplied by the fusion device.\nAssess whether the live ultrasound images remain registered to the prostate MRI, and perform a motion compensation if needed.\n\t​NOTE: If using the Artemis, the technique for motion compensation is described in the previously referenced video.24\nOn the treatment monitoring screen, the initial ablation site will now be greyed out; however it can be treated again if deemed necessary.\nSelect the next ablation site from the left side of the screen and repeat the process described in steps 8 - 10.",
    "12. Conclude Treatment Session\nOnce all ablation sites have been treated, a 'FINISH TREATMENT' button will appear. Pressing this button will display a treatment review screen that displays quantitative metrics for the treatment session.\nRemove the TRUS probe from the patient's rectum. Manual pressure may be applied to the rectal wall overlying the prostate to facilitate hemostasis."
