C1\n      and V1 are the initial concentration and volume, respectively,\n      and C2 and V2 are the final concentration and\n      volume, respectively.\n    \n        Resuspend the accurate number of cells in high serum medium and plate\n        2 mL of cell suspension in each well of 6-well plates to obtain the\n        final density of 100,000 cells per well.",
    "Move the plate back and forth and sideways and allow cells to settle\n        evenly in 6-well plates for around 20 min outside the incubator to avoid\n        cell aggregation at the center of the well.\n      \n        Incubate cell culture plates at standard cell culture conditions until\n        the desired cell confluency is obtained (50%–60% for transfection and\n        90% for serum switching to low serum medium).\n      \n        Continue to part 2 to analyze the effect of a GFP-variant tagged gene of\n        interest. For analysis of non-transfected cells continue to part 3 (no\n        drug treatment) or part 4 (with drug treatment).\n      \n      Part 2. Cell transfection with a GFP-variant tagged gene of interest\n    \nTiming: 30 min\n      This part is optional and can be applied to investigate the impact of\n      disease variant genes of interest and the gene dose on C2C12 cell\n      differentiation. It can be combined with drug treatments to furthermore\n      assess a drug’s effect on the transiently genetically altered C2C12 cells\n      (part 4). C2C12 cell transfection with a GFP-variant tagged gene of\n      interest can be performed once the cells have reached 50%–60% confluency.\n      Alternatively, a construct coexpressing a GFP-variant using an\n      IRES-element or P2A-autocleavage sequence may be employed, however, this\n      approach may require additional validations (see Expected outcomes\n      section).\n    \n      The following volumes are optimized for the transfection of cells cultured\n      in a 6-well plate, using jetPRIME transfection reagent according to the\n      manufacturer’s instructions (http://tinyurl.com/5ejcwmst[href=http://tinyurl.com/5ejcwmst]). Other transfection reagents such as Lipofectamine 2000 can be used\n      instead of jetPRIME. All handling should be carried out under sterile\n      conditions inside a laminar flow hood.\n    \n        Dilute 2 μg plasmid DNA into 200 μL jetPRIME buffer and mix by\n        vortexing.\n      \nVortex jetPRIME reagent for 5 s and spin down shortly before use.\n        Add 4 μL of jetPRIME reagent to the transfection solution containing\n        DNA, mix by vortexing and spin down shortly.",
    "Incubate the transfection mix for 10 min at 22°C–25°C.\n        Add 200 μL of transfection mix dropwise per well with 2 mL medium and\n        distribute evenly.\n      \n        Replace medium 4 h after transfection with fresh high serum medium.\n      \n        For the analysis of cells transfected with a mEGFP-tagged gene of\n        interest continue to part 3 (no drug treatment) or part 4 (with drug\n        treatment).\n      \nCritical: Incubating cells with\n      transfection mix for longer times may result in toxicity. Other\n      GFP-variants than mEGFP may be employed, such as EGFP or even EYFP.\n      However, in that case, all control and target samples need to carry this\n      GFP-variant.\n    \nPart 3. Cell differentiation without drug treatment\nTiming: ∼10 min each day for 3 days\n    \n      In part 3 we describe the C2C12 cell differentiation after switching to\n      low serum culture conditions. Switching to low serum medium should be\n      carried out once the cells have reached 90% confluency (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). For drug treatments during cell differentiation, please refer to the\n      next part 4.\n    \n        One day after transfection (optional) replace high serum medium with\n        prewarmed low serum medium.\n      \n        Add fresh low serum medium every day for 3 days to allow cells to\n        differentiate into myotubes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Continue to\n        part 5.\n      \nPart 4. Cell differentiation with drug treatment\nTiming: ∼30 min each day for 3 days\n    \n      This part describes the essential steps to evaluate the effect of drug\n      treatment on differentiation.\n    \n      Equilibrate the stock of the drug, here AMG 510/ sotorasib, at 22°C–25°C.\n      Any other drug or experimental compound can be tested in the same way.\n    \n        Prepare working solutions of the desired final drug concentrations in\n        prewarmed low serum medium.\n      \n        One day after transfection (optional), replace high serum medium with\n        2 mL of working solution to each well.\n      \n        Add fresh working solution every day for 3 days. Continue to part 5.",
    "Critical: The final DMSO concentration\n      must be ≤0.2% to avoid effects on differentiation. For other solvents, the\n      concentration that does not impact on differentiation has to be determined\n      essentially using the procedure described here in part 4.\n    \n      Part 5. Cell fixation, permeabilization and MyHC-immunolabeling\n    \nTiming: 2–3 h\n      This section provides details on performing antibody labeling for the\n      samples.\n    \n        Remove the low serum medium, add 750 μL 0.05% trypsin EDTA and incubate\n        at 37°C for 2 min and immediately start pipetting and detaching the\n        cells.\n      \n        Resuspend cells in 750 μL low serum medium and pipette carefully\n        up-and-down to separate cells.\n      \n        Transfer each cell suspension into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and\n        centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\n      \nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cells once with 500 μL PBS.\n        After another round of centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min,\n        discard the supernatant and fix with 500 μL 4% PFA. Incubate for 10 min\n        on a shaker at 22°C–25°C.\n      \n        Centrifuge the samples at 500 × g for 5 min, discard the\n        supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 500 μL PBS. Samples can be\n        stored at this stage for up to 1 week at 4°C.\n      \n        Centrifuge the samples at 500 × g for 5 min, discard the\n        supernatant and permeabilize the cells with 500 μL 0.5% Triton X-100 in\n        PBS for 10 min on a shaker.\n      \n        Wash the samples with 500 μL PBS-T to remove excess of Triton X-100 and\n        centrifuge them at 500 × g for 5 min.\n      \n        Immunolabel the cells with 50–100 μL of Myosin 4 Monoclonal Antibody\n        (MF20) conjugated to eFluor 660, which detects MyHC protein, at a\n        dilution of 1:100 in PBS-T for 30 min at 4°C.\n      \nCritical: Cover the samples with",
    "aluminum foil to prevent any light-induced bleaching during the incubation\n      period.\n    \n        Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min and\n        discard the supernatant.\n      \n        Resuspend the cells in 500 μL of PBS for flow cytometry analysis.\n        Acquire all samples on Guava easyCyte 6HT 2L flow cytometer.\n      \n      Part 6. Channel settings and sample acquisition on a flow cytometer\n    \nTiming: ∼2 h\n      Steps for calibration of the flow cytometer and setting up of channels are\n      described here.\n    \n      Include in each experiment controls for adjusting instrument settings that\n      are required for the manual (part 7) or our automated gating and\n      differentiation data analysis procedures (part 8).\n    \n        The ‘double-negative control’ (MyHC-/GFP-) sample where C2C12 cells were\n        not transfected, cultured under high serum conditions and immunolabeled\n        with Myosin 4 monoclonal antibody (MF20) conjugated to eFluor 660.\n      \n        The ‘GFP+ control’ is a C2C12 cell sample that expresses only a\n        construct with mEGFP that is not genetically fused to another protein;\n        required if GFP-variant constructs are investigated (part 2).\n      \n        The ‘MyHC+ control’ is a 3-day differentiated C2C12 cell sample without\n        GFP-construct expression labeled with Myosin 4 monoclonal antibody\n        (MF20) conjugated to eFluor 660.\n      \nNote: As there is no spectral overlap\n      between GFP and eFluor 660, no compensation was performed in our examples.\n      The Guava 6HT-2L flow cytometer can acquire samples contained either in\n      1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes or 96-well plates. To simplify acquisition of\n      multiple samples and to conserve sample volume, we describe in this\n      protocol only the acquisition of samples using the 96-well sampler of the\n      instrument.\n    \n        Then in addition to these controls, prepare any number of target samples\n        that contain GFP+ and MyHC+ subpopulations for differentiation analysis.\n      \n        Run the Guava Clean and then easyCheck quality control procedure by\n        preparing a 1:20 dilution of Guava easyCheck Beads.\n      \nNote: The Guava Clean procedure is",
    "instrument specific and done as described by the manufacturer to clean and\n      unclog the instrument microfluidics before use. The easyCheck procedure\n      calibrates the system and tests sensitivity of the optical components\n      (lasers and detectors). Optimum system performance is validated if the\n      fluorescence intensities in all channels and the beads count generated\n      during this procedure fall within the range specified by the manufacturer.\n      When using other flow cytometers prepare the instrument correspondingly.\n    \n        Once the device is ready to use, set the number of events to be acquired\n        to 30,000 and if needed the time of acquisition per well to 150 s. The\n        acquisition time can be adjusted depending on the cell concentration.\n      \n        Dispense 200–250 μL of each control sample and target sample into\n        different wells of a 96-well plate.\n      \nNote: Check sample concentration and\n      dilute to obtain less than 500 events/ μL in order to avoid clogging of\n      the microcapillaries.\n    \n        Always start the acquisition from the double-negative control.

Samples used to adjust channel\n              settings are double-negative cells (C), MyHC+ control cells (D) or\n              GFP+ control cells (E).\n            \n              (F) Finally, target samples contain a differentiated subpopulation\n              with MyHC+/GFP+ cells in Q2.\n            \nCritical: Maintain all here\n      established instrument settings for detection channels and gates for all\n      subsequent target sample acquisitions.\n    \n        From this mixed population comprising myoblasts and myotubes, the",
    "doublets were then excluded using forward scatter height (FSC-H) and\n        area (FSC-A) plotted on a linear scale (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\n      \nNote: This is step is optional.\n    \n        By applying these basic gates, singlet cells were visualized on a dot\n        plot using the Green-B channel versus the Red-R channel in four\n        quadrants (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n      \nNote: In GuavaSoft, quadrants cannot be\n      set up during acquisition but only during analysis as in step 54. The\n      double-negative control cells in quadrant 3 (Q3) have background\n      MyHC-expression and do not express a GFP-variant construct, thus also in\n      the Green-B channel showing only background autofluorescence of cells.\n    \n        From the menu bar open the gain control panel and adjust the laser power\n        for the 488 nm and 642 nm lasers as well as the gain for Green-B and\n        Red-R channels.\n      \nCritical: The gains must be set to\n      display the cluster of double-negative cells in Q3, approximately around\n      the level of ∼101 relative fluorescence units (RFU) in both\n      channels. This will allow the user to perform the analysis by considering\n      all the events in Q3 as double-negative cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n    \n        Proceed by verifying that both the MyHC+ control and GFP+ control, are\n        observed as expected i.e., MyHC+ cells along the vertical axis in the\n        Red-R channel in Q1 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) and GFP+ cells along\n        the horizontal axis in the Green-B channel in Q4 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\n      \n        Once all the controls are set, proceed with the acquisition of target\n        samples, containing a subpopulation that is positive for GFP and MyHC in\n        Q2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\n      \nFor manual analysis of differentiation continue to part 7.\n        Alternatively, we recommend moving to part 8 for automated analysis of\n        GFP-variant construct expressing cells using the FlowFate analysis\n        software programmed in R.\n      \n      Part 7. Manual differentiation analysis on GuavaSoft 4.0 software\n    \nTiming: ∼1 h",
    "In this part, we describe how to perform the manual analysis of the\n      acquired flow cytometry data using the GuavaSoft 4.0 Software to quantify\n      the percentage of differentiated cells in target samples. For GFP-variant\n      expressing cells, we established an alternative automated analysis for\n      this quantification as described in the subsequent part 8.\n    \n        After implementing the basic gate settings from part 6 (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B), draw four analysis quadrants, by opening the ‘QuadStat\n        Marker’ window.\n      \n        Add a ‘New Stat’ using the ‘Count’ metric as in\n        Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C. Thus, cells in four different quadrants\n        can be quantified (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n      \nNote: Procedures to visualize cells in dot\n      plots and to quantify them within four quadrants or regions of interest\n      can be found in all commercial flow cytometry analysis software.\n    \n        Aided by the double-negative sample, position the QuadStat Marker at\n        ∼101 on both axes as the cluster of cells below ∼101\n        in Q3 corresponds to double-negative cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3044-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3. Gene dose dependent analysis of GFP-variant tagged\n              constructs in three different GFP-expression bins\n            \n              (A–C) Plots of MyHC-labeled and GFP-variant tagged construct\n              expressing cells from target samples.

Cells exhibiting lowest GFP fluorescence between 101\n        and 102 RFU in the Green-B channel are assigned to the\n        ‘GFP-low’ bin or window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\n      \n        Cells from this bin are considered MyHC+ if the signal in the Red-R\n        channel was above ∼101 threshold that was set up using the\n        QuadStat marker.\n      \n        Optionally, if a gene-dose dependent analysis is desired for the\n        GFP-construct, draw additional bins.\n      \n        Define between 102 and 103 RFU of the Green-B\n        channel as ‘GFP-medium’ bin (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and between",

Automated differentiation analysis with the custom-written\n      FlowFate software in RStudio\n    \nTiming: ∼15 min for first time users;\n      ∼5 min thereafter\n    \n      We developed here FlowFate as a free, interactive R-based analysis\n      software program that automates the quantitation of GFP-variant expressing\n      C2C12 cell differentiation data as obtained by flow cytometry. Thus, it\n      may be suitable for medium-throughput screening.",
    "FlowFate can read flow cytometry data stored in flow cytometry standard\n      (FCS) 3.0 format that originate from either single tube or 96-well plate\n      acquisitions. Samples collected from a standard 96-well plate will be\n      displayed by default with the corresponding well number. Prior to\n      analysis, users should take note of the well numbers for each sample e.g.,\n      well A01 for double-negative sample etc.\n    \n      FlowFate was developed by combining existing R packages (flowCore and\n      flowWorkspace for FCS file import, data manipulation and gating, and\n      ggcyto for visualization) into a customized workflow tailored to the\n      analysis of differentiation data. FlowFate can quantify differentiated\n      cells in up to three GFP-expression bins, thus enabling analysis of the\n      gene dose-dependent effect of GFP-variant tagged/ coexpressing genes of\n      interest. In the following, we employ as such a GFP-variant mEGFP.\n    \n      First, the user has to perform the instrument set up essentially as\n      described in part 6.\n    \n      In FlowFate we have then eliminated manual gating steps by using\n      pre-defined settings to exclude debris (Figure S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3044-Mmc1.pdf]B) and identify GFP+ cells during the ‘Curate’ step. GFP-thresholding is\n      achieved by utilizing the ‘quantile gate’ from openCyto. Quantile gates\n      are used to determine a threshold below which 99% of cells are found. This\n      GFP-threshold value is obtained by averaging the GFP-channel data from the\n      double-negative and MyHC+ control samples analogous to what was described\n      in part 6, as depicted in\n      Figure S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3044-Mmc1.pdf]C. The GFP-threshold is then applied to all samples during the ‘curation’\n      step to analyze only GFP+ events. It also sets the lower limit of the\n      GFP-low bin. To examine the gene dose-dependent effect of the GFP-variant\n      tagged/ coexpressing gene of interest, up to three GFP-expression bins can\n      be defined (GFP-low, -medium and -high).\n    \n      The ‘Split peaks’ command automatically plots histograms of the",
    "MyHC-channel within each user-specified GFP-bin for every sample. We use a\n      ‘peak-splitting’ algorithm from openCyto, which determines the\n      intersection point between two population peaks and automatically creates\n      a gate including intensities above this cutpoint (the cutpoint is depicted\n      as a red line in\n      Figure S5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3044-Mmc1.pdf]D). The two distinct subpopulations are MyHC- (intensity peak on the left\n      of the red line) and MyHC+ (intensity peak on the right of the red line)\n      (Figure S5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3044-Mmc1.pdf]D). The latter population represents differentiated C2C12 myocytes.\n    \n        One time installation of RStudio and FlowFate.\n        \n            To run the app in R, install R and RStudio from:\n            https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/[href=https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/].
