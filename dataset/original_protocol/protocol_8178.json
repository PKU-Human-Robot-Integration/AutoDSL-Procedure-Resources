    "The activities shown in the video and described herein fall within a greater-than-minimal-risk IRB at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\n1. Recruitment\nEstablish a high through-put program for pre-operative cognitive and MRI-based assessment to catch patients from all referring providers in a timely and efficient manner. Involve the administrative and clinical staff in the broader effort.\n\tNOTE: A concrete step that has proved effective was the establishment of a group email list that is automatically sent by the attending surgeon (or someone on their support staff) when a new patient presents to clinic who may be a candidate for recruitment into the Brain Mapping Program.\n2. Pre-Operative MRI mapping\nAcquire MRI data on a 3T MRI scanner with a 64-channel head coil at the Center for Advanced Brain Imaging and Neurophysiology (formally known as the 'Rochester Center for Brain Imaging') at the University of Rochester Medical School. Use standard sequences for BOLD MRI and DTI allowing full brain imaging, as described in prior publications7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.\nMonitor fixation, and record respiration and heart rate collected during all fMRI for regression of noise confounds26,27.\n\tNOTE: Over the past 10 years, we have developed a library of functional MRI experiments to map language (spoken, auditory, single words, whole sentences), motor function (from intransitive finger, tongue and foot movements to high level transitive actions), music ability, mathematics and number knowledge, and basic sensory function (e.g., retinotopic mapping to map of low level visual processing11,14,24). All experiments, materials, and analysis scripts are available at www.openbrainproject.org.\n3. Neuropsychological testing\nTake care during all cognitive testing to ensure that patients are comfortable, ensured using an ergonomically optimized setup (Figure 1) and by building frequent breaks (every 8 min) into the structure of all tests.",
    "Have all low grade tumor patients complete the following tests 1 month before surgery, 1 month after surgery, and 6 months after surgery (tests 12 and 13 are completed only at the pre-operative and 6 months post-operative time points)28,29,30,31,32.\n\t\nSpontaneous Speech (Cookie Theft Picture33, Cinderella Story34,35,36).\nCategory Fluency (actions, semantic categories, words starting with F, A, S).\nWord Reading and Repetition (nouns, verbs, adjectives, non-words, matched on length and frequency).\nSnodgrass Object Naming (n = 26037).\nAuditory Naming (n = 6038).\nHigh-Cloze Sentence Completion (30 min).\nBirmingham Object Recognition Battery (BORB, including Length | Size | Orientation | Gap Matching | Overlapping Figures | Foreshortened Views | Object Reality Decision39).\nAuditory Minimal Pair Discrimination (e.g., pa vs. da, ga vs. ta31,40).\nSentence Picture Matching (including reversible passives40).\nColor Naming and Farnsworth Munsell Hue Sorting41.\nCambridge Face Test30,42.\nCalifornia Verbal Learning Test (43)\nWeshler IQ (44,45,46). The key measures to evaluate language outcome are tests 4-6; characterizing broader abilities ensures impairments on naming tests are not due to general performance decline47.\n\t\tNOTE: In the past, we have used a combination of software presentation platforms to control stimulus presentation and response recording during pre- and post-operative testing. We are currently designing a single plug-and-play platform to support all cognitive testing (pre, intra- and post-operative testing) as well as stimulus presentation and response recording during functional MRI (see below for description of StrongViewTM). StrongView, together with built-in neuropsychological tests, will be available for download (open license) at www.openbrainproject.org.\n4. Neuroanesthesia and ergonomics of intraoperative language mapping\nUse anesthetic techniques for awake craniotomies48,49,50; at the University of Rochester, awake craniotomies are typically performed using an asleep-awake-asleep approach.\nAvoid premedications such as anticonvulsants and anxiolytics as they can impair cognitive function and contribute to emergence delirium.",
    "Apply standard monitors (EKG, NIBP, pulse oximetry) and induce general anesthesia with intravenous fentanyl (0.5 mg/kg), lidocaine (1-1.5 mg/kg) and propofol (1-2 mg/kg).\nUse a supraglottic airway for mechanical ventilation.\nPosition the patient laterally or semi-laterally with the head secured in a pinned frame; as described in the video, patient positioning depends on the location of the lesion and the planned craniotomy window, while also taking into consideration that types of cognitive testing the patient will be asked to perform once awake during the surgery.\nApply analgesia at the pin and incision site (30 mL of 0.5% Lidocaine, 30 mL of 0.5% Sensorcaine plain, 6 mL of sodium bicarbonate). During this period, position the testing equipment (small monitor, video cameras, directional mics).\nDetermine the size of the craniotomy window by multiple factors, which vary in their weighting according to the results of pre-operative clinical mapping of the patient's brain, functional brain mapping studies, and the plan for intra-operative mapping. In the case described in the video, the attending surgeon (Dr. Pilcher) chose a large craniotomy in order to have full access to map positive language and motor sites in the dominant hemisphere.\nAt the beginning of the awake-phase, discontinue sedation (local analgesics are applied prior to incision).\nRemove the supraglottic airway once the patient regains consciousness. There is no or minimal sedation during the awake phase.\nUse electrocorticography (ECoG) to monitor after-discharges (subclinical epileptiform discharges induced by cortical stimulation) to ensure that DES levels are set at just below the after-discharge threshold. The DES mapping procedure initiates by finding the after-discharge threshold, and adjusting stimulation amplitude (in steps of .5 milliamp).",
    "Adjust stimulation amplitude throughout the mapping session (2 to 15 mA) at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Patients view stimuli on a monitor and can speak and move their forearms and hands.\n5. Procedures for acquiring research-grade data during intraoperative direct electrical stimulation mapping\nRun all intraoperative cognitive testing on a custom-built hardware/software system called 'StrongView',Â available at www.openbrainproject.org. The hardware footprint is self-contained on a small cart, and is outfitted with an independent backup battery power source, speakers, keyboard and touch display. The person charged with running the cognitive testing can start, stop and pause stimulus presentation, while continuously recording (audio and video) during the case.\nUse an audio system on the cart such that a directional microphone that is trained on the patient's mouth, which feeds through a splitter. One channel coming out of the splitter goes through an amplifier and directly to a speaker. This allows surgeons and researchers to easily hear the patient's responses against the background noise of the operating room with zero perceptible delay (i.e., eliminating 'echo' effects). The second channel from the splitter goes to the PC on the mobile cart, where it is time-stamped, recorded and stored (these files are used for offline analysis). StrongView also has a separate (stand-alone) audio system that consists of a second directional microphone also trained on the patient, a directional microphone trained on the surgeons, and a 'noise' microphone in a corner of the operating room to sample room tone for subtraction from the main audio files. Those three audio channels feed to a MIDI, and to a second computer which records each channel separately. This second audio system provides redundancy should the primary system fail, all verbal responses of the patient will be available for offline analysis.",
    "Attach a commercially available ether screen L-bracket to the operating room (OR) table using an OR table clamp. Attach articulating arms (e.g., Manfrotto 244 Variable Friction Magic Arms) to the ether screen L-bracket, and those articulating arms support the patient monitor, directional microphones, video camera trained on the patient's face, and an auxiliary monitor to allow a research team member or operating room nurse to easily see what the patient sees while interacting with the patient.\nRun all necessary cables for the screens, microphones, and camera along the arm and protect by plastic tubing secured with Velcro.\n\tNOTE: None of this equipment needs to be sterilized as it is (only ever) on the non-sterile side of the field (Figure 1). This manner of supporting stimulus presentation and response recording equipment provides maximal flexibility to take into account the differing ergonomics of cognitive testing according to patient positioning which varies case by case, yet provides a reliable and stable platform on which to attach equipment. Also, and importantly, because all monitors, microphones and cameras are attached to the OR table via single device (ether screen L-bracket), if the positioning of the table is adjusted during the case this does not affect the testing setup. (Note that the setup shown in Figure 1 is from an earlier generation setup in which a floor-mounted stand supported the patient screen, microphone and video camera; that floor mounted stand has been replaced since 2018 with the ether screen L-bracket). Also, and importantly for patient safety, the entire setup for cognitive testing can be broken down in less than 20 seconds during the case should an emergent situation present itself that mandates full and unobstructed access to the patient (e.g., to the patient's airway).",
    "The heart of StrongView is a flexible software system for i) presenting stimuli (visual, auditory) to patients and recording patient responses (verbal, button response, video), ii) temporally registering all experimentally-relevant events and measures (stimulus on, ECoG, contact with brain of direct electrical stimulator probe, patient responses); iii) and communication with cranial navigation systems to obtain the 3 dimensional coordinate for each application of direct electrical stimulation. StrongView allows on-line re-calibration of experimental variables such as stimulus duration, inter-stimulus-intervals, randomization, number of repetitions or blocks of stimuli, and control of the patient video and audio channels. StrongView streams the patient video camera, the online ECoG data, and the stimulus that the patient is currently seeing/hearing to a desktop display, which is also mirrored on a large monitor that is in the line of sight of the surgeon.\nAttach a photodiode to the patient monitor and feed into an open channel on the ECoG amplifier. This provides a temporal sync between presentation of each stimulus and ECoG for offline analysis.\nUse cranial navigation hardware and software (at the University of Rochester, BrainLab Inc., Munich, Germany) in all cases by the surgical team for intra-operative cranial navigation based on pre-operative MRI. This is an optical system consisting of a set of cameras that view the operating field and register the patient's head via a fixed registration star that is affixed to the operating table (see Figure 1).\n\t\nSpecifically, after the patient is set in the headholder, but before draping, use the facial physiognomy of the patient to register the patient's head to the preoperative MRI. This allows pre-operative MRI (functional and structural) to be brought into direct alignment with the patient's brain on the operating table.",
    "Attach a second (much smaller) registration star to the bipolar stimulator (see Figure 1) and use to register the stimulator's length and position in the field. This enables the research team to acquire the precise location of each point of stimulation as well as the margins of the resection, relative to pre-operative MRI. As noted above, StrongView is connected with the cranial navigation system (at University of Rochester, BrainLab, connection via IGT link) to allow for real time streaming (and time stamping) of the coordinates of direct electrical stimulation mapping. StrongView is currently being developed to interface with other cranial navigation systems (e.g., Stryker).\n\t\tNOTE: Aspects of StrongView that support administration and data collection during cognitive and fMRI experiments, together with a library of tests, will be available (open access) at OpenBrainProject.org. Beta versions are available prior to the full release by contacting the corresponding author. The entire StrongView suite, which includes hardware systems to integrate with Electrocorticography and cranial navigation software, is available to clinicians and scientists by contacting the corresponding author. These data acquisition tools will be confluent with a post-processing pipeline and open data consortium, to be launched in 2020 at OpenBrainProject.org."
