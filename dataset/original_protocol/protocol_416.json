    "**A. Construct Preparation**\n1. A tandem affinity protein \\(TAP) tagged HYR construct was made in pUC19 assembling the fragments of CaMV35S promoter<sup>8</sup> at XbaI and BamHI sites, gateway cassette \\(for cloning gene of interest) is cloned between BamHI/KpnI sites, coding sequence for six His repeat \\(6xHis), a 9x-myc peptide, a 3C protease cleavage site and two copies of the IgG binding domain \\(2xIgG-BD) together known as TAP tag were amplified using pCTAPa \\(CD3-679) as template at KpnI/ SacI sites<sup>3,4</sup> and the NOS terminator at KpnI/EcoRI sites. \n  2. The entire cassette was cloned between the Xba1-EcoR1 sites of pMOG22 \\(Zeneca-Mogen), which contains a chimeric CaMV 35S hygromycin phosphotransferase-tNos for selection during rice transformation. \n  \n**B. Promoter Analysis**\n1. To identify potential cis-acting regulatory elements \\(CAREs) involved in HYR \\(target genes of interest) regulation of gene expression \\(Fig. 1a), use FIRE <sup>9</sup> for de novo discovery of short DNA motifs specific to genes differentially regulated upon HYR \\(target genes of interest) expression by comparing the motif content of 1 Kb upstream sequences of these genes to that of the rest of the genome, followed by comparison to known cis-elements<sup>10</sup>. \n  2. To identify the potential candidate genes regulated by HYR \\(target genes of interest) for experimental validation, identify genes \\(in HYR lines or transgenic or mutant plants with target genes of interest) that were also differentially expressed under drought<sup>11</sup> or high temperature<sup>12</sup> \\(condition of interest). Analyze the promoter sequences \\(1.0 kb) for these genes using Place database<sup>10</sup> and Plant Care<sup>13</sup> to look for the presence of cis elements.",
