The main purpose of this process is to increase the contrast in the sample.\nDay 2\nTiming: Step 1–4: 4–5 h\nTiming: Step 5: 1.5 h\nWash the fixed samples 3 times for 5 min each with 0.1M Na-Cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) at RT on a rotor (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPost-fix with 1% Osmium Tetroxide in 0.1M Na-Cacodylate buffer (pH7.2) for 3–4 h on ice. Agitate gently from time to time or use a rotor.\nNote: Perform the preparation inside a chemical fume hood wearing appropriate PPE.\nWash 3 times in succession with 0.1M Na-Cacodylate buffer (pH7.2).\nWash 4 times for 5 min each with 0.05M Maleate buffer (pH5.2).\nNote: The use of Maleate buffer in this step is critical to avoid precipitation of UA in the presence of trace amounts of Na-Cacodylate.\nEn bloc staining/fixation with Uranyl Acetate (UA). Stain the samples with UA (1% UA in 0.05M Maleate buffer pH5.2) for 1.5 h at RT in the dark.\nNote: Follow the Recipes for common reagents and Recipes for skin sample preparation sections under materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nSkin sample: dehydration\nThe following dehydration steps helps to remove water from the sample and preserve the morphology of the specimen.\nDay 2\nTiming: 45 min\nDuring dehydration, it is recommended to fill at least half the scintillation vial volume with dehydration solvent. Make sure to gently invert the vial a couple of times to remove any sample and water that could be stuck to the lid.\nThe following will describe the dehydration of the samples in a scintillation vial in a stepwise manner.\n30% Ethanol, 15 min with rotation at 4°C.\n50% Ethanol, 15 min with rotation at 4°C.",
    "70% Ethanol, 15 min with rotation at 4°C.\nPause point: If necessary, the samples can be kept overnight at Step 6c at 4°C.\nDay 3\nTiming: 1.5 h\n95% Ethanol, 15 min with rotation at RT.\n100% Ethanol, 3 times for 10 min each with rotation at RT\nNote: Store the ethanol with molecular sieves to prevent moisture buildup.\nPropylene oxide, 3 times for 15 min each with rotation at RT.\nNote: Propylene Oxide is very toxic and volatile. Always work under the chemical hood with proper PPE.\nSkin sample: embedding\nThe following section describes the steps for the embedding of skin sections using Epon-Araldite mixture.\nDay 3\nTiming: 12 h\nAfter dehydration, infiltrate the samples with EPON resin embedding solution. Prepare the EPON resin as described in Recipes for skin sample preparation section under materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. Incubate the sample with 100% Propylene oxide: EPON resin (2:1) for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation in a scintillation vial.\nNote: For agitation, a rotor can be used.\nNext, remove the sample and incubate it in a vial containing 100% Propylene oxide: EPON resin (1:1) for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation.\nRemove the sample from the 1:1 mixture and incubate it in a new vial containing 100% Propylene oxide: EPON resin (1:2) for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation.\nRemove the sample from the 1:2 mixture and incubate it in a new vial containing 100% EPON resin for 6 h at RT with gentle agitation.\nNote: At step 12, the samples can also be incubated overnight at RT\nDay 4\nTiming: 6 h\nAfter 6 h of incubation (Step 10), continue the incubation with fresh 100% EPON resin for at least another 6 h with agitation.\nDay 3\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Next embed the sample in silicone molds. For proper orientation and to prevent the sample from sinking to the bottom, fill half the mold with resin and cure it at 60°C in the oven overnight (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/943-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Avoid bubbles and be careful not to disturb the position of the sample. Leave the EPON resin to polymerize for 48 h at 60°C (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C).\nSkin sample: sectioning of EPON resin block",
    "The following section describes the steps to obtain ultrathin sections using the RMC Ultramicrotome Powertome PTPC (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) with a glass/diamond knife from EPON resin molds containing the skin section.\nDay 7\nTiming: Step 15–20: 1 h\nTiming: Step 21–24: 45 min\nTiming: Step 25–35: 3–4 h per sample\nTiming: Step 36–39: 30 min\nPlace the flat resin molds containing the back skin sample onto the chuck (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nIf the skin sample is not embedded at the edge of the mold, first trim away the excess surface resin using a single-edge razor from the top until the sample can be seen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nNote: Maintain a flat surface while trimming the excess resin away.\nUse a razor blade to trim the top of the mold into a trapezium block shape with sloping sides. From top view: Make sure the top and bottom of the trapezium shape are parallel to each other with the bottom being longer than the top (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nMake final adjustments to the trapezoid by trimming away as much excess resin as possible. The final trapezoid should be as small as possible and mostly contain only the Region of Interest (ROI) of the skin sample (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nNote: The trapezoid shape is advantageous as it makes the orienting of the block to the knife easier, minimizing the compressive forces on the samples while sectioning.\nPlace and secure the chuck containing the trimmed resin onto the cantilever arm of the ultramicrotome (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nPlace a freshly prepared glass knife onto the knife holder (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).",
    "Note: 2 knives are prepared from one glass square using a Leica EM KMR3 glass knife maker (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). One knife will be of higher quality than the other. The knives can be stored in a knife holder box to prevent dust from collecting on its edge.\nOrient the EPON resin block/glass knife such that the longer side of the trapezoid is parallel to the knife-edge (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/943-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Test to ensure that the seal does not leak using water (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: After testing it for leakage, dry the set up for at least 30 minutes before usage.\nReplace the existing glass knife with the freshly prepared glass knife/plastic boat or a diamond knife suitable for semi thin sections.\nNote: While changing the knife, move the block away from the knife-edge to protect the block surface and the knife-edge from any form of damage.\nSet the clearance angle for the knife on the ultramicrotome. This is usually at 6°.",
    "Using a 1 mL syringe, fill the boat with deionized water and adjust the water level to the knife-edge such that the knife-edge is also wet.\nNote: Achieving a correct water level will create a uniform silvery surface near the knife-edge\nCritical: Continuously check the water level to ensure that it does not evaporate to below its original level. It is important to maintain the correct water level as it will be crucial for determining the thickness of the sections.\nOrient the EPON resin block/glass knife again such that the longer side of the trapezoid is parallel to the knife-edge (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: These alignments can be achieved by aligning the shadow cast by the knife-edge to the longer side of the trapezoid using the binoculars of the ultramicrotome (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCarefully bring the block to the knife-edge, leaving a gap of 3–4 mm between the block and the knife-edge.\nMake finer adjustments to the alignment between the longer side of the trapezoid and the knife-edge by a) Specimen rotation alignment b) Knife lateral alignment c) Knife tilt alignment d) Specimen tilt alignment (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: These adjustments rely on observing the shadow cast by the knife-edge on the block face using the binoculars.\nFrom the block face, section 500 nm–1 μm sections, stain with toluidine blue and examine under a light microscope.\nNote: This step is crucial to determine the quality of sample preparation and to select the area of interest.\nFor ultrathin sections, trim the block face even smaller which contains only the ROI and switch to a diamond knife or a freshly prepared glass knife for further sectioning after performing all the necessary adjustments (Step 23–31).",
    "On an automated ultramicrotome, set the cutting window by defining the top position (specimen block 1 cm above the knife-edge) and the bottom position (specimen block 1 cm below the knife-edge) (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSet the sectioning speed from 0.5 mm/s to 1.0 mm/s.\nNote: When using a diamond knife, use the speed as recommended by the manufacturer.\nSet the section thickness from semi-thin (100nm–120 nm) to ultra-thin (60 nm) depending on the desired imaging technique (SEM vs TEM).\nNote: Stain with toluidine blue to focus on the correct ROI and sample orientation.\nSection thickness can be determined with the help of an interference card that provides a color spectrum that reflects its respective section thickness. For example, for semi-thin to ultra-thin sections, the color of the sections will vary from a gold to silver color (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nWith the aid of an eyelash brush, the sections can be detached from the knife-edge. To ease the collection of the sections, the brush can also be used to guide the sections towards the end of the boat.\nBefore collection, flatten the section with the isopropanol vapors.\nNote: One can use a cotton wick soaked in isopropanol to flatten the section.\nScoop the sections from water with the help of a loop and place them on the front side of a silicon wafer. Representation of the front side of silicon wafer and sections attached on the wafer is shown in (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/943-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

After the purging cycles, the exchange fluids are replaced with liquid CO2 and a heating process is initiated at 28°C to generate supercritical CO2.\nSubsequently the supercritical CO2 is converted to a gaseous state by maintaining a constant temperature of 31°C. Finally, the pressure in the chamber is reduced by slowly purging the gas in the chamber at a speed of 20% (Gas-Out phase). This entire program runs for 3 h, 8 min and 21 s.
