    "This study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, at Schepens Eye Research Institute (Boston, MA) and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (Boston, MA). Informed consent was obtained from all the participants. The study was approved by the local institutional review boards of Mass Eye and Ear (Boston, MA).\nNOTE: Patient inclusion criteria were prior diagnosis of horizontal strabismus (constant or intermittent exotropia or esotropia) and no other visual impairments. This study was a part of a larger one reported previously12. Data for 14 patients recruited in the US in the larger study12 are reported here with permission. An optometrist specialized in vision rehabilitation who routinely evaluate strabismus in clinic performed prism and alternate cover test, following by measurement with the app to prevent bias of the cover test results by the objective app measurement.\n1. Prepare the test\nNOTE: Testing can be performed in any environment; however, the following controls are likely to aid in successful testing.\nConduct the test in a well-lit environment. Let the patients face in a direction such that corneal reflections from windows and ceiling lights are not located in the center of the eyes. Try to avoid strong background light, such as windows.",
    "NOTE: Usually it helps to have a ceiling light right above the head, or a window on one side of the patient. Sometimes, asking the patient to hold their hand above their brow or using a visor can help shield the eyes from strong light sources which create additional reflections on the cornea, as needed. Turning off point light sources such as canister lights or gooseneck lamps will decrease the intensity of extra corneal reflections, making it easier for the software to detect the reflection from the camera flash as intended. If point light source is needed it may be diffused by pointing it at the wall or using a diffuser (i.e., lamp shade).\n2. Measure tropia (manifest strabismus) with single snapshot−near fixation\nLaunch the app and set the mode to No Cover (button at upper right corner).\nSelect near fixation (button at lower right corner).\nHold the phone in landscape orientation about 40 cm from the patient at eye level with the rear-camera facing the patient to be measured.\n\tNOTE: The distance does not have to be accurately controlled. The app can automatically compensate for different distances.\nInstruct the patient to fixate on the flash light, which is off at this point. For tests requiring precise accommodation such as when screening for accommodative esotropia, paste a fixation target (such as a letter) on the back of the phone, directly below or above the flashlight.\nWhile the patient confirms he/she is fixating, press the round button to take a snapshot, which will be analyzed by the app.",
    "When the analysis is completed, the app will show detected eye features: limbus (iris outer) boundary indicated by a large circle (green), the center of the eye indicated by a cross (green), and the location of the corneal reflection indicated by a small circle (red). Verify these features are detected without obvious errors (such as incorrect limbus fitting, or incorrect location or missing corneal reflection).\nOn the same screen, under the captured picture, the app will show the measurements related to the eye alignment. If satisfied with the results, press the save button to save the current test in the phone. Otherwise, press the back-arrow button to retest.\n3. Measure tropia (manifest strabismus) with snapshot−far fixation\nNOTE: To measure tropia for far fixation, the angle kappa for each eye needs to be measured at least once. The app will automatically choose the latest measurement of angle kappa in the history. If it is not available for either eye, the app will give a reminder to first obtain this measurement (see section 6 for details of angle kappa measurement).\nLaunch the app and set the mode to No Cover (button at upper right corner).\nSelect far fixation mode (button at lower right corner).\nHold the phone in landscape orientation about 40 cm from the patient at eye level with the rear face of the phone facing the patient.\n\tNOTE: The distance does not have to be accurately controlled. The app can automatically compensate for different distances.\nPlace the phone slightly below two eyes so that the patient can look above the phone and fixate a target in the distance (typically 5 m away). Make sure the camera is in approximately between the two eyes, not too far to the side of either eye.",
    "While making sure the patient is fixating properly, press the round button to take a snapshot.\nWhen the analysis is completed, the app will show detected eye features: limbus boundary indicated by a large circle (green), the center of the eye indicated by a cross (green), and the location of the corneal reflection indicated by a small circle (red). Verify these features are detected without obvious errors (such as incorrect limbus fitting, or incorrect location or missing corneal reflection).\nUnder the picture there are measurement outcomes for eye alignment including prism diopters. If satisfied with the results, press the save button to save the test in the phone. Otherwise, press the back-arrow button to retest.\n4. Measure intermittent strabismus or phoria with cover test−near fixation\nLaunch the app and toggle on the cover test mode (button at upper right corner), and select near fixation (button at lower right corner).\nHold the phone in landscape orientation about 40 cm from the patient.\n\tNOTE: The distance does not have to be accurately controlled. The app can automatically compensate for different distances.\nInstruct the patient to fixate the flash light, which is turned off at this point. For tests requiring precise accommodation, paste a fixation target on the back of the phone, directly below or above the flashlight.\nUse an occluder to cover one of the eyes.\nPress the round button. The app will start to monitor the status of the two eyes (whether one eye is covered).\nWhile making sure the patient is fixating properly, remove the occluder quickly (i.e., cover-uncover test), or first move the occluder between the two eyes to perform alternate covering a few times and then take the occluder away quickly. The app will automatically take a picture as soon as the occlude is taken away from eyes.",
    "When the analysis is completed, the app will show detected eye features: iris indicated by a large green circle, the center of the eye indicated by a green cross, and corneal reflection from flash indicated by a small red circle. Verify these features are detected without obvious errors.\nUnder the picture there are measurement outcomes for eye alignment in prism diopters. If satisfied with the results, press the save button to save the test in the phone. Otherwise, press the back-arrow button to retest.\n5. Measure intermittent strabismus or phoria with cover test−far fixation\nNOTE: To measure intermittent ocular misalignment for far fixation, the angle kappa for each eye needs to be measured at least once. The app will automatically choose the latest angle kappa measure. If it is not available for either eye, the app will give a reminder to first obtain this measurement (see section 6 for details of angle kappa measurement).\nLaunch the app and set the mode to cover test (button at upper right corner).\nSelect far fixation (button at lower right corner).\nHold the phone in landscape orientation about 40 cm from the patient at eye level.\n\tNOTE: The distance does not have to be accurately controlled. The app can automatically compensate for different distances. It is best if the flash light/camera is between the eyes. Since the camera and flash are off to one corner in most phone models, this means the phone display itself will be slightly off-center.\nInstruct the patient to look just above the phone and to fixate the target in distance (typically 6 m away).\nUse an occluder to cover an eye.\nPress the round button. The app will start to detect the uncovering of the eye.",

Measure angle kappa\nLaunch the app.\nSelect Measure angle kappa.\nHold the phone in landscape orientation about 40 cm from the patient at eye level.\n\tNOTE: The distance does not have to be accurately controlled. The app can automatically compensate for different distances.\nInstruct the patient to use the eye to be tested (either eye) to fixate on the flash light, which is off at this point. Have the other covered by hand or an occluder.\nWhile making sure the patient is fixating properly, tap the round button to take a snapshot, which will be analyzed by the app.",
