    "Culture synchronization (adapted from Stiernagle, 2006)Begin the procedure with C. elegans plates containing nearly 500 gravid hermaphrodites. Add 5 ml of M9 buffer to the plate and gently stir the liquid with a pipette to dislodge the worms from the agar.Using a pipette, transfer the worms to a 15 ml sterile Falcon tube, centrifuge at 800 x g for 1 min. The worm pellet must be suspended in 3.5 ml total volume.Add 1.5 ml of lysing solution to the tube. Shake the tube gently for 5 min, manually, looking under a microscope to check if worms have disintegrated or not. Most of the worm bodies have dissolved, centrifuge at 800 x g for 1 min.Remove most of lysing solution without disturbing the egg pellet.Then, suspend the pellet in 5 ml of M9 buffer, centrifuge 1,000 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant, add fresh M9 and repeat these steps 2 more times.The eggs obtained can be conducted in three different procedures in parallel.I, The eggs can be incubated with the drugs directly for 15 h at 20 °C. II, The eggs can be incubated at 20 °C for 15 h to produce larvae, which can be incubated at maximum for 24 h with the drugs, to avoid development in advanced stages. III, The eggs can be incubated at 20 °C for 3 days to produce adults. Adults can be incubated, at maximum, for 3 days with the drugs to avoid new adult generations. Figure 1 summarizes the culture synchronization and the use of the three different life stages of C. elegans – embryonic eggs, larvae and adults (steps B, C and D) to evaluate anthelmintic activity of drugs.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170116/20170116170341_2230.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Scheme summarizing the culture synchronization procedure and the use of, embryonic eggs, larvae and the adults (steps B, C and D) of Caenorhabditis elegans to evaluate anthelmintic activity of drugsEgg hatch assayAfter the synchronization procedure, transfer the eggs to a 96-well plate with a pipette.Add approximately 30 eggs per well in 200 µl of S medium.Count and identify the embryonic stages inside the eggs with an inverted microscope to observe the larval development. Note: The presence of the gastrula form is important to determine the initial pattern before treatment with the drugs and to verify if the lysing solution affected or not the eggs. The gastrula form can be identified according to Figure 2B. Add the different concentrations of drugs and incubate for 15 h at 20 °C in a BOD incubator.At the end of the incubation, the percentage of hatched and unhatched eggs and the L1 larvae will be determined for each of the different drug concentrations by light microscopy. Triplicates of six independent experiments should be performed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170116/20170116170626_3025.jpgFigure 2.

Egg with a larva inside (the 3-fold stage indicates the complete larval development); E. L1 stage; F. Hermaphrodite, the vulva (v) can be observed; G. Vulva (v) and numerous eggs (e) in higher magnification; H. The hermaphrodite gonad (g) can be observed.Larval development assayAfter the synchronization procedure, put the eggs in microtubes containing S medium and E. coli under gentle agitation, for 15 h at 20 °C at the BOD incubator.After this time, collect the larvae at the first stages (L1/L2) (Figure 2E). Alternatively, the eggs can hatch in the absence of food as development will be arrested and larvae will stay as L1.",
    "Adjust the concentration of larvae to 20 larvae/50 μl in S medium.Incubate for 24 h at 20 °C in a 96- well plates containing S medium supplemented with E. coli and the different concentrations of the drugs to be analyzed. Triplicates of six independent experiments should be performed.Assays using adultsAfter the synchronization procedure, transfer the eggs to NGM (Nematode growth medium) plates seeded with E. coli with a pipette. The eggs were incubated at 20 °C for three days in the BOD incubator to obtain most of the adult nematodes at the same age.Collect the adult worms with a transfer pipette by washing the NGM plates with 5 ml of M9 to dislodge the worms and centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min in a Falcon tube. Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet in the same buffer (three times).Place thirty nematodes per well in a 96-well plate containing S medium 200 µl supplemented with E. coli. The bacteria can be autoclaved to avoid excessive growth during the period of incubation. We suggest 2 x 103 bacteria/ml approximately.Add the different concentrations of the drugs to be screened in the study. The drugs must be omitted in the wells used as negative controls.Incubate at 20 °C for 3 days in the BOD incubator. Three days should be the maximum period of incubation to avoid the presence of new generations of adults.After this period, the survival was evaluated by counting the live and dead worms by light microscopy considering the motility and the paralysis of the pharyngeal bulb and the total loss of motility with the occurrence of straight bodies as shown in Video 1. Use an inverted microscope to make these observations. Triplicates of six independent experiments should be performed.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.",
