    "1. Cell culture with patterned grid culture dish and cell transfection with SCO1-APEX2 and HRP-KDEL plasmid vector\nSeed 1 x 105 HEK293T cells by placing them into 35-mm glass grid-bottomed culture dishes in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin.\nThe day after seeding the cells, when they have grown to 50%-60% confluency, introduce the SCO1-APEX210 and HRP-KDEL12 plasmid to the cells using transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (SCO1-APEX2 cDNA 0.5 µg + HRP-KDEL plasmid DNA 0.5 µg per 3 µL transfection reagent).\n2. Light microscopy of cells growing on patterned culture dishes and DAB staining for APEX2 and HRP\nAt 16-24 h after transfection, remove all the culture media and immediately add 250 µL of warm (30-37 °C) fixation solution (Table 1) by gentle pipetting. Immediately remove the fixation solution and replace it with 1.5 mL of fresh fixation solution. Incubate on ice for 60 min, and then wash three times for 10 min each in 1 mL of ice-cold 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (Table 1).\n\tCAUTION: Aldehyde fumes are extremely toxic. Perform all work under a ventilated fume hood.\nAdd 1 mL of cold (0-4 °C) 20 mM glycine solution and incubate for 10 min on ice followed by three washes of 5 min each in 1 mL of cold 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer.\nPrepare a fresh 1x DAB solution (3.33 mL of 0.3 M cacodylate solution + 10 µL of 30% H2O2 + 5.67 mL of cold water + 1 mL 10x DAB solution).",
    "Add 500 µL of the freshly prepared 1x DAB solution (step 2.3) and incubate on ice for approximately 5-45 min until a light brown stain is visible under an inverted light microscope (Figure 1A).\nGently remove the DAB solution and rinse three times with 1 mL of cold 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 10 min each.\nUse a phase-contrast inverted microscope (or a bright-field light microscope) to visualize the DAB staining at a magnification of 100x or higher. Use a marker pen to mark the bottom of the glass where the region of interest (ROI) is located (Figure 1B,C).\n3. Sample preparation for the EM block\nPerform cell culture and DAB staining as described in steps 2.1-2.6.\nPost-fix the samples with 1 mL of 2% reduced OsO4 for 1 h at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: OsO4 fumes are highly toxic. Perform all work under a ventilated fume hood.\nPrepare a new TCH solution (Table 1) during step 3.2 and pass through a 0.22-µm filter.\n\tCAUTION: TCH fumes are highly toxic. Perform all work under a ventilated fume hood.\nRemove the fixative and rinse three times with 1 mL of distilled water for 5 min each at room temperature (RT).\nPlace the cells in 1 mL of previously prepared and filtered TCH solution for 20 min at RT.\nRinse the cells three times with 1 mL of distilled water for 5 min each at RT.\nExpose the cells a second time to 1 mL of 2% osmium tetroxide in distilled water for 30 min at RT.\nRemove the fixative and rinse three times with 1 mL of distilled water for 5 min each at RT. Add 1 mL of 1% uranyl acetate (aqueous), and leave overnight at 4 °C in the dark.",
    "Wash the cells three times in 1 mL of distilled water for 5 min each at RT.\nPre-warm Walton’s lead aspartate solution (Table 1) in an oven at 60 °C for 30 min.\nStain the cells with Walton’s lead aspartate solution by adding 1 mL of the pre-warmed lead aspartate solution, and then place in an oven for 30 min at 60 °C.\nRinse the cells three times with 1 mL of distilled water for 5 min each at RT.\nIncubate in a graded series of 2-mL ethanol aliquots (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 100%) for 20 min each at RT.\nDecant the ethanol and incubate for 30 min in 1 mL of 3:1 ethanol:low-viscosity embedding mixture medium at RT.\nRemove the medium and add 1 mL of 1:1 ethanol:low-viscosity embedding mixture medium. Incubate for 30 min at RT.\nRemove the medium and add 1 mL of 1:3 ethanol:low-viscosity embedding mixture medium. Incubate for 30 min at RT.\nRemove the medium and add 1 mL of 100% low-viscosity embedding medium and incubate overnight.\nEmbed the sample in 100% low-viscosity embedding mixture and incubate for 24 h at 60 °C.\nPrepare 90-nm thick sections using an ultramicrotome.\nObserve the grid under TEM at 200 kV.\n4. Serial sectioning and mounting on indium-tin-oxide coated coverslips for SEM imaging\nSubstrate preparation\nClean indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass coverslips (22 mm x 22 mm) by gentle agitation in isopropanol for 30-60 s.\nRemove the coverslips, drain off the excess isopropanol, and leave in a dust-free environment until dry.\nTreat the ITO-coated glass coverslips by glow discharge using a plasma coater for 1 min.",
    "NOTE: Plasma activating confers a hydrophilic property on the substrate surface. It creates a very thin film of water on the substrate to prevent wrinkle formation in the sections when the section is attached to the substrate.\nInsert the ITO-coated glass coverslips into the substrate holder, and place into the knife boat.\nTrimming of the sample block and serial sectioning\nInsert the sample block into the sample holder of the ultramicrotome and set into the trimming block.\nUse a razor blade to trim away all excess resin around the target position (identified in step 2.6, Figure 1D-G). The shape of the block face should be trapezoid or rectangular. The leading edge and trailing edge must be absolutely parallel (Figure 1H,I).\nInsert the sample holder on the arm of the ultramicrotome and place the diamond knife in the knife holder. Insert the ITO glass coverslips into the ribbon carrier and clamp the carrier with the handle (Figure 1J). Set the ribbon carrier into the knife boat and fill the knife boat with filtered distilled water (Figure 1K).\nAdjust the carrier position with the slide of the knife by carefully pushing the handle of the holder to set the edge of the ITO glass close to the knife (Figure 1L).\nAfter cutting the section, stop the sectioning process, and slowly open the clamping screw of the tube and drain the water boat (flow rate of one drop of water per second).\nAfter completing the ribbon-collection process, remove the substrate with the handle of the clamping device and dry the ribbon (Figure 1M).\n5. Imaging in the SEM and alignment of the SEM image stack",
    "Mount the ITO-coated coverslip on aluminum stubs with sticky carbon tape. Seal the glass surface and the surface in the stub with sticky carbon tape, and then coat with a 10-nm thick carbon layer (Figure 1N).\nObserve the ITO-coated coverslip in a field emission SEM at a low acceleration voltage of 5 kV and a suitable working distance for the efficient collection of BSEs.\nImport the serial images into the Image J software (Fiji)13 using the virtual stack option. Open a new TrakEM14, and import the image stack into TrakEM. Click the right-mouse button and choose the align menu.\nThen select the image range (from the first image to the last image). Finish the auto-alignment, save the aligned dataset, and choose export to compile a flat image from the selected image range (from the first image to the last image). Finally, save the flat image data in AVI format in the Image J main menu.\n\tNOTE: Supplemental Movie 1 and Supplemental Movie 2 show the SEM image stack and cropped image stack, respectively.\n6. Segmentation of mitochondria and ER from serial images\nStart the 3dmod in IMOD15 software and open image files.\nIn the ZaP window, draw the contour of the mitochondria and ER using middle-mouse button.\nTo visualize the segmented volume, open the Model View window (Supplemental Movie 3).\nSubscription Required.
