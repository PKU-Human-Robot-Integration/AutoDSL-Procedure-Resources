    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPlasmid preparation\nTiming: 3 days\n3rd generation lentiviral vectors are made of 4 independent plasmids coding for the transfer vector, the packaging constructs and the envelope. The following steps ensure transfection-grade production of plasmid constructs.\nTransform different vials of One Shot™ Stbl3™ Chemically Competent E. coli cells with 10 ng of pCG-HΔ24, pCG-FΔ30, pMDLg/RRE, pRSV-Rev, p-MND-eGFP-eCD4-Ig (or the transfer vector of interest) following the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Foneshot_stbl3_man.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Foneshot_stbl3_man.pdf]).\nNote: This E. coli strain is recommended for use when working with sequences containing direct repeats, including lentiviral transfer vector DNA.\n16 h later, pick up a single colony from each transformation plate and inoculate into a 250 mL ampLB medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) in a 1 L flask. Cover the top of the flask with foil and create small holes with a 20 or 200 uL pipet tip. Incubate the flask at 37°C with constant shaking (300 rpm) for 16 h overnight.\nCritical: The concentration and quality of plasmid DNA are very critical parameters to achieve high transfection efficiencies, especially in a protocol that requires the co-transfection of 5 independent plasmids. Yield and quality of plasmid DNA depend, amongst other parameters, on the bacterial host strain and on the growth conditions. Low bacterial growth will inevitably lead to low plasmid yield, while culture overgrowing can lead to a higher percentage of dead or starving cells, resulting in potentially degraded or contaminated plasmid DNA. Create holes on the surface of each flask and use 1L flasks (four times the volume of the culture) to maintain LB saturated with oxygen.\n16 h later collect and load the culture in a centrifuge tube. Spin at 4,000×g for 30 min at 4°C.",
    "Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 12 mL of Resuspension Buffer RES+RNase A by pipetting the cells up and down and vortex to ensure sample homogeneity.\nAdd 12 mL of lysis buffer, LYS (ensure that lysis buffer is not precipitated), to the bacterial lysate and mix by gently inverting the tube 5 times. Incubate at room temperature (RT=22°C–24°C) for 5 min.\nCritical: Ensure gentle mixing of the culture to prevent membrane shear that can result to bacterial chromosomal DNA release contaminating the plasmid DNA suspension.\nMeanwhile apply 12 mL of equilibration buffer EQU onto the rim of the NucleoBond® Xtra Column Filter to ensure high yield.\nNeutralize the lysis buffer by adding 12 mL of buffer NEU. Mix thoroughly until the lysate is colorless. Load lysate on the NucleoBond® Xtra Column Filter.\nAdd 10 mL of Wash Buffer EQU. Once this step is complete, discard the Column Filter and perform another wash step by adding 12 mL of EQU buffer.\nPlace the column in a sterile 50 mL falcon tube. Elute plasmid DNA with 5 mL of pre-warmed Elution buffer ELU.\nPrecipitate eluted plasmid DNA with 3.5 mL of isopropanol and thorough mixing. Centrifuge at 4,500 × g for 1 h. Alternatively, add the isopropanol to the elution column, to simultaneously increase the yield of plasmid DNA.\nDecant supernatant and add 10 mL of 70% ethanol. Wash the pellet by resuspending it in 70% ethanol and ultracentrifuge as above. Remove supernatant and allow pellet to air dry at RT for 10 min.\nCritical: Resuspend the pellet in ethanol and run an hour long precipitation step to increase the quality for transfection grade plasmid DNA.",
    "Dissolve DNA pellet in 500 μL of sterile water. Quantify and qualify plasmid DNA with UV spectrometry and evaluate by restriction digests, respectively. Aliquot plasmid DNA to avoid multiple rounds of freeze-thawing and store in −20°C up to 2 years.\nCritical: Ensure the quality of plasmid DNA by measuring the 260/230 ratio. Generally, a ratio close to 2.0 is considered pure. Following this protocol the expected yield is ≥2 μg/mL. High plasmid concentrations and plasmid supercoiling are important parameters to achieve high transfection efficiency. Do not proceed if your concentration is less than ∼1.5 μg/mL.\nMV pseudotyped lentiviral vector production\nTiming: 4 days\nThe following section details the steps required to produce high titer MV-LV, including transfection of CD46KO 293T cells with the use of plasmids generated as described above as well as viral vector supernatant collection and purification.\nDay 1\nPrepare 10 cm2 tissue culture plates with sterile 0.01% poly-L-lysine solution using a laminar flow tissue culture hood to ensure a sterile working space.\nPlates are usually prepared by pipetting ∼2 mL of solution into one plate, then tipping and swirling until a visible thin layer covers the entire bottom of the plate.\nThe remaining solution is then pipetted and added to the next plate and the process is repeated as before.\nAspirate any remaining solution from plates and let them completely dry (∼2 h) inside the tissue culture hood.\nProceed to seeding CD46KO 293T cells without washing off the poly-L-lysine coated plates.",
    "Note: The transfection conditions described below refer to a single 10 cm2 plate to ensure high transfection efficiency; a major challenge in producing high titer MV-LV. Attempts to increase scalability of MV-LV production led to decreased transfection efficiency and therefore lower viral titers. Given the problems of scalability, perform plasmid transfections in single 10 cm2 plates and then proceed to collating and mixing the viral supernatant from 3 independent 10 cm2 transfection plates for purification and subsequent use for transduction of human primary B cells. This will allow sufficient MV-LV supernatant to be produced for the successful transduction of 3 technical replicates for each B cell experimental condition of interest.\n2 h later, split and count CD46KO 293T cells. CD46KO 293T cells were split using the TrypLE dissociating enzyme. TrypLE was preferred over other dissociating agents due to its recombinant, animal origin-free nature. Seed 5 × 106 cells per poly-L-lysine coated plate in 10 mL of cDMEM. Incubate cells for 16 h in a 37°C, humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\nDay 2\n16 h later, remove cDMEM medium from the CD46KO 293T cell containing plates and replace with 10 mL of fresh cDMEM. Meanwhile allow the reagents from the Profection® Mammalian transfection system to thaw in RT for approximately 2 h.\nCritical: CD46KO 293T cells need to be 90% confluent on the day of plasmid transfection. Lower confluency is associated with lower MV-LV viral titers. Higher confluency will lead to a higher cell death rate which will also result in reduced viral titers in addition to reduced prep purity.",
    "Calculate the volume of each plasmid required per transfection reaction per 10 cm2 plate of CD46KO 293T cells, as shown below. Plasmid DNA mass was calculated using the following dsDNA copy number calculator formula: number of copies = (amount ∗ 6.022 × 1023) / (length ∗ 1 × 109 ∗ 650) (http://cels.uri.edu/gsc/cndna.htmL[href=http://cels.uri.edu/gsc/cndna.htmL]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1482_8.csv\nAdd the required plasmid DNA mass in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Add 62 μL of 2.5 M CaCl2 per transfection to the DNA mixture and pipette up and down gently until mixed. Add sterile water to a total volume of 500 μL. Vortex mix and briefly spin the contents of the tube.\nAdd 500 μL of 2× Hepes Buffer Solution (HBS) pH 7.0 (reagent is part of the Profection® Mammalian transfection system kit that is listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) in a 15 mL polystyrene conical tube.\nCritical: The reaction is pH dependent. Ensure that the pH of the Hepes Buffer is 7.0. Any deviation from this suggested pH value will negatively affect transfection efficiency and functional titers.\nBubble filtered (sterile) air through the 500 μL of 2× HBS with the use of a 1 mL serological pipette attached to a pipette aid while adding the CaCl2-DNA solution drop-wise. Let the mix sit at RT for 30 min. You should be able to see the development of a cloudy solution due to the formation of the precipitate.",
    "Critical: It is important that you add the 500 μl CaCl2-DNA solution to the 500 μl HBS solution (1:1 ratio) dropwise while introducing turbulence to the mix. For the successful creation of a single vector particle, copies of all 5 plasmids need to enter the nucleus simultaneously. Therefore, the solution needs to be homogenous. Constant turbulence will prevent saturation of the mix and will create smaller precipitates. Bigger precipitates will reduce the viability of the culture.\n2 h after medium exchange of the plates containing the CD46KO 293T cells, pipette the prepared DNA/CaPO4 suspension up and down multiple times and then slowly add the 1 mL precipitate to each plate. Rock back and forth to evenly distribute precipitate. Incubate cells for 16 h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\nDay 3\nApproximately 16 h later, carefully remove all the medium/transfectant from the cells and discard. Add 5 mL of 3% FBS-DMEM to cells and incubate for 24 h. The use of lower serum concentrations and the absence of antibiotics in the culture medium have been associated with improved lentiviral vector purity and higher viral titers after downstream processing.\nDay 4\nCollect and filter MV-LV containing supernatant from 3 x 10 cm2 plates through a 0.22 μm PES filter to remove cell debris. Transfer the 15 mL of purified MV-LV containing supernatant into ultracentrifuge tubes.\nNote: Increased purity is required for transduction of primary cells therefore viral vector should be layered onto a 5 mL of filter-sterilized 20% (w/v) sucrose/HBSS cushion.",
    "Critical: Perform only one harvest on day 4. Other protocols suggest refrigeration of harvested supernatant on day 4 with the addition of harvested supernatant from day 5. Direct comparisons of MV-LV titers produced from 1 harvest on day 4, two harvests on days 4 and 5, and independent harvest on day 5 showed that even though the physical titers increase with the combination of harvests from day 4 and 5, primary B cell transduction was decreased. Our findings suggest that the MV envelope may not be stable overnight at 4°C and/or that the increase of physical titers is due to the detection of virus like particles (VLPs) produced on day 5.\nCritical: Different filter pore sizes and filter membrane types allow for different viral vector recovery propensity (Nilsson, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Avoid using high protein binding filters as their use will decrease recovery of MV-LV. Our observation has been that low protein binding PES membrane is the most appropriate type of filter for the purification/cell debris removal step. The use of a 0.45 μm membrane will result in higher MV-LV recovery. However, due to the low viability of human primary B cells in culture we chose to proceed with 0.22 μm PES filters for increased purity.\nCritical: Poly-L-Lysine was used to coat transfection plates to prevent detachment of producer cells from the plate. However, if CD46KO 293T cells detach and are observed in the supernatant, centrifuge the collected supernatant at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C before step 22 to prevent filter clogging.\nNext, place ultracentrifuge tubes into the SW28 Ti rotor, making sure to balance with appropriately weighted tubes. Sterile PBS can be used to balance ultracentrifuge tubes.",
    "Ultracentrifuge at 19,400 rpm using an SW28 Ti rotor, or at 67,865 × g for any other rotor, for 2 h 20 min at 4°C. Brake should be set to slow when using the OptimaTM L-90K Ultracentrifuge.\nCritical: Take extra care at this step to not dislodge the pellet when removing the ultracentrifuge tubes from the rotor. Directly proceed to step 26. Our observations suggest that temperature appears to have an important effect on MV-LV titer, possibly due to MV-LV stability.\nAfter collecting the MV-LV supernatant from the CD46KO 293T cell containing plates determine plasmid transfection efficiency using either fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. To collect cells for flow cytometry, add 1 mL of TrypLE and incubate plate at 37°C for 5 min. Add 100 μL of dissociated transfected CD46KO 293T cells in 900 μL of PBS and proceed with flow cytometry sample analysis.\nNote: Transfection efficiency should be ≥90% to achieve appropriate LV titer amounts to be able to achieve high transduction levels in primary B cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The relationship between transfection and transduction efficiency is not linear. A relatively small drop in transfection efficiency appears to have a disproportionately negative effect on transduction efficiency of primary B cells. Therefore, ensure high plasmid transfection efficiency to achieve high MV-LV titers for further use.\nAfter ultracentrifugation is completed, carefully remove tube, decant supernatant into a 10% bleach solution and invert tubes onto a sterile paper towel inside a tissue culture hood. Leave tubes inverted for 2 min to allow extra supernatant to drip onto the paper towel.\nResuspend pellet in 75 μL IMDM to achieve a 150× concentration. To recover pelleted vector, pipette up and down in IMDM at least 100 times, while limiting foaming.",
    "After resuspension, aliquot vector, being sure to label with MV-LV name and date of production.\nNote: We suggest resuspending the MV-LV in 75 μl IMDM per 3 × 10 cm2 plate collected (collected MV-LV volume=15 mL) to achieve significant transduction efficiencies in primary human B cells. Based on our observations, concentrated MV-LV from 1 × 10 cm2 transfection plate can efficiently transduce 3 × 105 primary B cells seeded in 1 well of a 96 well plate. It is important to transfect multiple 10 cm2 plates rather than larger size flasks to ensure high transfection efficiencies of the 5 independent plasmids.\nAliquot 75 μL of resuspended MV-LV in cryovials placed on ice. Immediately store vector at −80°C. Titrate using either functional titer (described below) or by p24 ELISA (Takara) following the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/Lenti-X%20p24%20Rapid%20Titer%20Kit%20User%20Manual_022621.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/Lenti-X%20p24%20Rapid%20Titer%20Kit%20User%20Manual_022621.pdf]).\nCritical: Storage temperature and temperature changes are known to affect MV-LV functionality and stability. Any higher temperature will significantly decrease functional titers. Make sure to aliquot vector to prevent multiple rounds of freeze-thaw. The vector is stable for long term storage at −80°C but a single round of freeze-thaw can decrease titers by as much as ∼50%.\nMV-LV titration\nTiming: 4 days\nBefore proceeding to primary B cell transductions titrate the produced MV-LV to ensure high titer stock. The methodology below describes the steps that should be followed to accurate measure MV-LV viral titers.\nCount and seed 3 × 105 Nalm6 cells per well in a 6-well plate in a final volume of 2 mL cRPMI. 12 wells of Nalm6 cells should be seeded to include technical duplicates of the 5 serial dilutions and two mock transduction samples.",
    "18 h post seeding, thaw viral supernatants to transduce Nalm6 cells to calculate viral titers. Nalm6 was chosen as an appropriate cell line to titrate measles virus pseudotyped LV due to its permissive nature and B cell lineage phenotype. Nalm6 cells need to be approximately 60% confluent on the day of transduction.\nCreate a series of viral supernatant 1/10 serial dilutions from 10-1 to 10-5 in a final volume of 600 μL cRPMI. LVs used for titration were stored at −80°C for a minimum of 18 h before thawing to perform serial dilutions.\nReplace old medium with 500 μL fresh cRPMI containing 8 μg/mL polybrene.\nNote: Polybrene is a cationic polymer that neutralizes the charge repulsion between virions and cells thereby increasing transduction efficiency.\nAdd 500 μL of each viral dilution to the 500 μL polybrene-containing cRPMI, mix by pipetting, and return plates to a 37°C, humified 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h.\nNote: Establish triplicates per each dilution in the series. Always seed two extra wells to use as mock transduced controls.\n2 h later add 1 mL of cRPMI and return plates to a 37°C, humified 5% CO2 incubator.\n48 h post transduction prepare cells for flow cytometry by collecting 100 μL of each cell well per condition and mix with 400 μL of PBS.",
    "Note: Titers should be calculated using values from the transduced wells in which the proportion of eGFP positive cells was between 2.5% and 25%. If the transduction efficiency is higher, it is likely that multiple vector particles could have transduced the same cell resulting in an underestimate of viral titers. Lower transduction frequencies, less than 2.5%, are unreliable. Calculate the transduction efficiency of each lentiviral vector by multiplying the number of seeded cells with the percentage of eGFP positive cells and with the vector dilution factor, divided by the final volume of culture (1 mL) per transduction well.\nNote: Transduction units (TU) are defined as the number of functional viral particles in the supernatant that are capable of transducing a cell and successfully expressing the transgene. A successful measles virus pseudotyped LV prep following these LV production and titration protocols is expected to generate ∼5.0 × 107–5.0 × 108 TU/mL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), while VSV-G pseudotyped LVs are generally expected to reach ∼109 TU/mL. Physical titers can be measured using the Lenti-X p24 Rapid Titer ELISA Kit (Takara) following the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/Lenti-X%20p24%20Rapid%20Titer%20Kit%20User%20Manual_022621.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/Lenti-X%20p24%20Rapid%20Titer%20Kit%20User%20Manual_022621.pdf]). Note that ELISA assays are generally characterized by higher variability compared to functional titration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Also, physical titers are less informative than functional titers as they cannot exclude detection of free Gag and VLPs. A good MV-LV prep will require a 105-106 dilution for within range p24 measurement. If the transfer vector of interest does not contain a reporter gene, ddPCR titration is an acceptable alternative (see ddPCR for measurement of vector copy number (VCN)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8] for protocol steps below).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1482-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Measurement of functional and physical titers for MV-LV",
    "(A) Measurement of infectious titers for Measles virus-pseudotyped LVs (MV-LV) in Nalm6 cells. Nalm6 cells were transduced with varying dilutions of MV-LVs as described above in triplicates. Functional titers were calculated by flow cytometry of eGFP-expressing cells, using the dilution in which samples contained 2.5%–25% eGFP+ cells. Graph shows mean ± S.D. of triplicates.\n(B) Measurement of physical titers of MV-LV from 2 independent production preps. ELISA p24 was performed on purified and concentrated MV-LVs. Graph shows mean of mean ± S.D. of triplicates.\nPrimary B cell isolation and activation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe workflow required for successful isolation and activation of human primary B cells is described below. Ensure B cell seeding in appropriate density and pre-stimulation before lentiviral mediated transduction.\nOn day 0 of the human primary B cell workflow depicted on Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], thaw one vial of isolated PBMCs in a 37°C water bath. Starting PBMC concentration should be 130–150 × 106 cells/mL.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1482-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Workflow of isolation, expansion and LV transduction of primary human B cells including the analytical assays performed for assessment of transduction efficiency\nNote: Alternatively PBMCs can be isolated from freshly collected blood. This is expected to improve the viability of B cells which are known to be sensitive to freeze-thawing. We chose to work with pre-ordered isolated frozen PBMCs for a more reproducible and simple protocol.\nPipette 5 mL of PBMCs slowly and dropwise in 20 mL PBS.\nCentrifuge PBMCs at 400 × g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate supernatant, resuspend in 20 mL of PBS and spin down as above. Meanwhile count cells.",
    "Aspirate supernatant and depending on the number of cells add up to 8.5 mL of EasySep buffer as per manufacturer’s suggestion. From this step onwards follow the protocol provided by STEMCELL’s EasySep Human B cell enrichment kit (https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/DX20007-PIS_1_1_1.pdf?_ga=2.258265034.1508623685.1644366130-665242244.1581346724[href=https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/DX20007-PIS_1_1_1.pdf?_ga=2.258265034.1508623685.1644366130-665242244.1581346724]) as described below.\nTransfer the total volume in a 14 mL polystyrene round bottom tube. Add 50 μL of enrichment cocktail per mL of sample. Leave at RT for 10 min.\nVortex magnetic beads for 30 s. Mix 75 μL of magnetic beads per mL of sample. Leave at RT for 5 min.\nAdd up to 5 mL of EasySep buffer.\nTransfer tube into a magnet and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nInvert the magnet containing the tube and pour the enriched B cell suspension into a new sterile tube.\nCount cells and resuspend in B cell expansion media in a seeding density of 1.5 × 106 cells/mL in a final volume of 3–5 mL/well of a 6 well plate.\nMV-LV transduction\nTiming: 5 days\nSteps 48–55 detail the methodology that should be followed to achieve high transduction efficiency of human primary B cells.\nOn day 2 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) collect and pool all cells. Count cells and resuspend in IMDM in a final concentration of 1.5 × 106 cells/mL.\nCritical: It is important to seed cells at the suggested seeding density as cell density is an important parameter for primary B cell viability.\nSeed activated primary B cells at 3 × 105 cells/well of a 96 well clear flat-bottom plate.\nAdd 20 μL (5.0 × 107–1 × 108 TU/mL) of MV-LV (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and create technical triplicates for each transfer vector or experimental condition of interest.\nSpinoculate for 30 min at 400 × g at RT and leave in a 37°C, humified 5% CO2 incubator for 6 h.",
    "6 h later centrifuge the 96 well plate at 400 × g for 5 min at RT.\nRemove 100 μL of media and replace with 100 μL of fresh 2× B cell expansion medium (all additives included in the B cell expansion IMDM medium should be at a 2× concentration) to achieve a final volume of 220 μL 1× B cell expansion medium. Return plate to a 37°C, humified 5% CO2 incubator.\nOn day 3 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) transfer cultures from each well of the 96 well plate to a 48 well flat bottom plate and add 200 μL 1× B cell expansion medium to each well for a final volume of 420 μL.\nOn day 5 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) transfer cultures from each well of the 48 well plate to a 24 well flat bottom plate and add 400 μL 1× B cell expansion medium for a final volume of 820 μL.\nFlow cytometry, surface and intracellular staining\nTiming: 8–9 h\nFlow cytometry can be used to determine transduction efficiency as well as the potential effect of lentiviral mediated transduction on B cell phenotype. The following protocol describes the staining process for the most important B cell markers. Transduction efficiency is assessed using the eGFP marker incorporated in the transfer vector.\nOn day 7 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) count and transfer 2 × 105 B cells per condition to a 96 well round bottom plate. Add 100 μL of PBS and centrifuge for 5 min at 400 × g.\nDecant supernatant. Add 200 μL of PBS and repeat spin step as above.\nMeanwhile prepare an extracellular staining master mix that contains AF350 LIVE/DEADTM fixable violet dead cell stain (dilution 1:1000), Brilliant Violet 605™ anti-human CD19 antibody (dilution 1:200) and Brilliant Violet 785™ anti-human CD3 antibody (dilution 1:200) in PBS.",
    "Decant supernatant. Add 50 μL of extracellular staining master mix. Pipette up and down multiple times. Cover plate and leave it at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\nOnce the extracellular staining step is complete, add 200 μL of PBS and repeat spinning step as above.\nDecant supernatant and add 100 μL of Cytofix/Cytoperm™ fixation and permeabilization solution. Cover plate and leave it at RT for 20 min in the dark.\nCritical: It is very important to thoroughly mix the cells in the Cytofix/Cytoperm™ solution using gentle pipetting for efficient intracellular staining. Do not exceed incubation time for more than 20 min.\nAdd 200 μL of Perm/Wash™ Buffer and spin as above.\nDecant supernatant and repeat step 62.\nDecant supernatant and add 100 μL of Cytoperm™ Permeabilization Buffer Plus. Cover plate and leave it at 4°C for 10 min in the dark.\nAdd 200 μL of Perm/Wash™ Buffer and spin as above.\nDecant supernatant and repeat step 65.\nDecant supernatant and add 100 μL of Cytofix/Cytoperm™ Fixation and permeabilization solution. Cover plate and leave it at RT for 5 min in the dark. Even though most protocols use a single fixation/permeabilization step, we have noticed increased IgM detection by introducing this extra step.\nAdd 200 μL of Perm/Wash™ Buffer and spin as above.\nDecant supernatant and repeat step 68.\nMeanwhile prepare intracellular staining master mix that contains PE/Cyanine7 anti-human IgM antibody (dilution 1:200) in Perm/Wash™.\nDecant supernatant. Add 50 μL of intracellular staining master mix. Pipette up and down multiple times. Cover plate and leave it at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.",
    "Meanwhile prepare compensation beads. Mix 3 drops of positive beads with 3 drops of negative beads and 1 μL of each antibody used respective tube. Mix well and place rack at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\nOnce the intracellular staining step is complete, add 200 μL of Perm/Wash™ and repeat spinning step as above.\nDecant supernatant and repeat step 73.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend pelleted stained cells in 250 μL PBS. Proceed to flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed with a BD LSRII machine equipped with UV, violet, blue, and red lasers using the following reagents and settings. Flow cytometry gating strategy is presented in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Voltages are included in the table below for convenience if using the BD LSRII flow cytometer. However, voltage optimization should always be performed on the user flow cytometer in the beginning of any acquisition to ensure appropriate compensation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1482-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Gating strategy for effective flow cytometric analysis of human primary B cells.\nGating strategy for effective flow cytometric analysis of (A) Mock and (B) Transduced human primary B cells. Doublets and dead cells were excluded by FSC, SSC, and AF350 LIVE/DEADTM fixable violet dead cell stain. T cells were excluded by selecting the CD3- population. Transduction efficiency was assessed by measuring the eGFP+ population. B cell phenotypic analysis was performed by CD19 marker staining and immunoglobulin expression was assessed with IgM staining.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1482_9.csv",
    "Note: Measurement of transduction efficiency following our protocol using the bicistronic eGFP-eCD4-Ig vector under the constitutive MND promoter was determined to be ∼75% on average. Long inserts and complex cassettes have been associated with reduced titers due to incomplete vector RNA and lowered virion production (Han et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Hence, we had chosen to work with a bicistronic vector that contains both eGFP and a therapeutic transgene with immunoglobulin containing properties (Gardner et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), also associated with reduced titers, as a model vector for protocol optimization. Therefore, even though a certain level of variation is to be expected, this protocol has taken into account the common LV packaging limitations.\nNote: Transduction efficiency and viability are measured 5 days post MV-LV mediated transductions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Viability of the genetically modified B cells is expected to be between 45%–50%, while viability of Mock B cells has been observed to be 55%–58% (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The purity of the MV-LV prep significantly affects B cell viability. The remaining B cell culture can be maintained in B cell expansion medium for approximately one additional week or used for differentiation and transplantation studies as described before (Hung et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). By the end of day 13 of human primary B cell culturing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), B cell viability is expected to drop to 10%, therefore the maximum duration of B cell culture, including all steps of activation, expansion, transduction and further culturing, as described in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], is approximately two weeks.\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) extraction from human B cells\nTiming: 1.5 h\nCollect and centrifuge all activated human primary B cells for 5 min at 300 × g at RT. VCN should be measured at 7–11 days post transduction to ensure degradation of non-integrated provirus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Critical: It is important to collect all primary B cells for gDNA extraction. As mentioned above, one of the limitations of the in vitro culture of human primary B cells is the high death rate. Extraction of gDNA from a small number of B cells of which approximately 50% are expected to be dead will lead to an overestimation of VCN due to DNA degradation. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to use the maximum number of B cells possible.\nResuspend pellet in 200 μL PBS and proceed to gDNA extraction using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen).\nAdd 20 μL proteinase K and 200 μL of Buffer AL. Mix thoroughly by vortexing and incubate samples at 56°C for 10 min for efficient cell lysis.\nAdd 200 μL pure ethanol and mix the sample thoroughly by vortexing. Pipet the sample into a DNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube and centrifuge at ≥6,000 × g for 1 min at RT. Discard the flow-through and return the spin column to the same collection tube.\nAdd 500 μL of Buffer AW1 in the spin column and centrifuge as above.\nAdd 500 μL Buffer AW2 in the spin column and centrifuge for 3 min at 20,000 × g at RT. Discard the collection tube.\nTransfer the spin column to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Elute the DNA by adding 50 μL of water to the center of the spin column membrane. Incubate for 5 min at RT. Centrifuge for 1 min at ≥ 6,000 × g at RT and proceed to nanodrop.",
    "Critical: Elute DNA in 50 μl of water. Manufacturer’s protocol suggests a 200 μl final volume, however due to the small number of live B cells with intact chromosomal DNA, addition of a a high elution volume can lead to diluted gDNA concentrations that will not suffice for the subsequent digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) reaction. Elution of DNA in a volume smaller than 50 μl will be inadequate for sufficient membrane hydration and will also lead to small gDNA concentrations. Following this protocol you should expect to get a gDNA concentration of 10–50 ng/ml. Do not proceed to the next step unless can see a distinct 260 nm peak of ≥10 ng/mL gDNA.\nddPCR for measurement of vector copy number (VCN)\nTiming: 2 days\nAn alternative method of assessing transduction efficiency, particularly in the absence of a marker in the transfer vector, is the measurement of integrated vector copy number. This protocol can be used in conjunction with, or instead of, flow cytometry.\nSample preparation\nDilute primers and probes at 100 μM. Then, prepare a 20× concentration stock for primers and probes by mixing 59 μL of water with 5 μL of probe, 18 μL of forward primer and 18 μL reverse primer for each target. Targets used here include the PBS of the HIV-1 leader, present in the integrated provirus, and the MKL2 gene, known as myocardin transcription factor B, present in each chromosome allele as a single copy.",
    "Add 25 ng of extracted genomic DNA to a 25 μL PCR reaction mix containing 2× ddPCR Supermix for probes, a 20× primer/probe set (p+p) for the HIV-1 target sequences and a 20× p+p set for MKL2 reference gene. The final concentration of each primer should be 0.9 μM and the final concentration for each probe 0.25 μM. Prepare this master mix as presented in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1482_10.csv\nCritical: 25–100 ng is the observed optimal range of genomic DNA for a successful ddPCR reaction.\nDroplet generation\nPlace an 8 channel disposable droplet generator cartridge into a cartridge holder. Add 20 μL of the reaction sample into each cartridge well and then load 70 μL of droplet generation oil into each sample. Attach the gasket to the cartridge holder and place the set in the droplet generator. Repeat per sample to create technical duplicates. Always load the sample first followed by addition of the droplet generation oil to prevent blockage of the cartridge channel microfluidics.\nRemove the cartridge holder from the droplet generator and discard the gasket. Carefully transfer 40 μL of each droplet emulsion to a 96-well propylene plate with a multichannel pipette.\nHeat-seal the plate with foil using the PX1 PCR plate sealer, and place the plate in a Bio-Rad T100 Thermal Cycler. PCR was performed using the following thermal cycling conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1482_11.csv\nDroplet reading\nAfter the reaction is complete, transfer the 96-well plate to a QX100 Droplet Reader for data acquisition.\nLoad the Quantasoft software, click ‘‘Setup’’ and then select ‘‘VCN’’ as the type of experiment. Assign HIV-1-FAM as Channel 1-Unknown and MKL2-HEX as Channel 2-Reference.\nSave your experimental set up and press ‘‘Run’’ to start the data acquisition process. The run indicator light flashes green to indicate that the droplet reading is in progress.\nData analysis",
    "When the droplet reading is complete, all four indicator lights will turn green. Open the door and remove the plate holder from the unit. Click ‘‘Analyze’’ to proceed to data analysis.\nSet the gates (in 1D Amplitude) by identifying the negative and positive fluorescence signals in the positive control sample reactions (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Export your data.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1482-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. VCN analysis with ddPCR\n(A) 1-D fluorescence amplitude plots of the FAM-labeled HIV target assay (top) and the HEX-labeled reference gene (bottom). Plots show all accepted droplets of the plate wells in both Channel 1 (FAM/HIV) and Channel 2 (HEX/MKL2). Established threshold differentiates between negative droplets, displayed in gray, and positive droplets in Channel 1, displayed in blue, and positive droplets in Channel 2, displayed in green.\n(B) Equation used to calculate VCN.\nCalculate VCN by using the following equation: VCN=[HIV]/([MKL2]/2). The concentration of MKL2 is divided by 2, as there are two copies of the MKL2 in each cell. The VCN is then calculated by dividing the total concentration of HIV to MKL2 to measure the copies of integrated provirus per cell (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nNote: To our observation, a transduction efficiency of 75% was associated with a VCN of 2–3, while a transduction efficiency of 50% was associated with a VCN of 1–2. VCN cannot provide information with regards to the function or expression of the transgene, therefore in the absence of a reporter marker we suggest the additional performance of analytical assays such as RT-qPCR, ELISA and, or, Western blots."
