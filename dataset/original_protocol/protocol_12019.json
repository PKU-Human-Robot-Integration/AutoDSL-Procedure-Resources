    "1. Preparation and Worm Husbandry\nNote: Refer Table of Materials for all product information.\nOP50 Escherichia coli culture: culture OP50 bacteria in Lysogeny broth (LB) (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.0) overnight at 37 °C without antibiotics.\nSeed 400 µL of OP50 bacteria to nematode growth media (NGM) plates (1.5 g of NaCl, 8.5 g of agar, 1.25 g of peptone, 1 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 1 mL of 5 mg/mL cholesterol in ethanol, 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4, and 25 mL of 1 M KPO4 buffer) and air dry the bacteria for 48 h.\nPick worms on seeded NGM plates and incubate at 15 °C or 20 °C.\n\t\nFor the analysis of the adult hermaphrodite germline, pick well-fed L4 worms to the bacterial lawn and incubate overnight at 20 °C.\nFor scoring sperm number in hermaphrodites, incubate L4 worms at 20 °C for 12 h until the worms reach the L4/adult molt. To synchronize the worms to the L4 stage, prepare eggs by picking adult worms with a lot of eggs in bleach solution (1 M NaOH and bleach in 1:1 ratio). Allow the eggs to hatch and pick L4 animals for the experiment.\nPrepare Teflon microscope slides by placing 25 µL of poly-L-lysine solution on the slide and spreading the solution well, using a pipette tip. After removing excess poly-L-lysine with paper towel, allow the slides to air dry and incubate the slides at 65 °C for 15 - 20 min.\n2. Germline Dissection and Staining6,13\nSpot 10 µL of 0.01% tetramisole (anesthetic) on a 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip and pick one-day old adult worms into it.",
    "Dissect the worm at the tail as it becomes sedated using a syringe (5 mL) and a needle (24\" x 1\"), and ensure that the germline is not damaged.\n\tNOTE: The dissection must be carried out before the worm becomes fully paralyzed so that the negative pressure in the worm and the worm movement aid the ejection of the germline. For scoring sperm, precautions must be taken not to damage the spermatheca by the needle during dissection. Avoid touching the germline with the needle except the dissection point after the spermatheca. If there is break in the germline compartment or any discharge from the germline is observed, the germline should not be used for analysis.\nPlace the inverted coverslip on a poly-L-lysine coated slide, keeping the dissected germline on the slide.\nRemove excess liquid under the coverslip by placing a paper tower at a corner of the coverslip, then place the slide in liquid nitrogen for 1 min. Quickly remove the coverslip using a needle with the germlines on the slide.\nTransfer the slides into -20 °C methanol for 30 - 60 s in a chamber, then incubate for 30 min in freshly prepared fixing solution (1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.08 M HEPES pH 6.9, 1.6 mM MgSO4, 0.8 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and 3.7% paraformaldehyde) at room temperature.\nWash the slides by placing in a chamber containing 1x PBS, pH 7.4 with 0.1% Tween-20 for 10 min. Repeat this step once.\nBlock the germlines with 30 µL of blocking solution (30% of goat serum prepared by adding 900 µL of goat serum in 1700 µL of distilled H2O and 300 µL of 10x PBS) in a humid chamber prepared by placing wet paper towel in a plastic box at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "Add 50 µL of REC-8 antibody solution prepared in 30% goat serum in a ratio 1:300 to each sample. Incubate overnight at 4°C.\nWash the slides by placing in a chamber containing 1x PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 10 min. Repeat the step once and remove excess liquid by placing a paper towel at the corner of the slide.\nPrepare secondary antibody solution by diluting green fluorophore (488 nm emission wavelength) conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000), phalloidin (actin stain, 1:4000), and DAPI (DNA stain, 1:4000) in 30% normal goat serum.\nAdd 50 µL of secondary antibody solution to the slide.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash the slides twice by placing in a chamber containing 1x PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 for 10 min. Wipe off excess liquid.\nAdd 30 µL of fixing reagent onto the slide and place a 12 mm2 x 1.5 µm coverslip on top and dry the slides at 4 °C overnight.\n3. Confocal Microscopy\nTurn on the confocal microscope, lasers, resonant scanner, and confocal microscope software. Place the slides with stained germlines on the slide holder above the 63X objective.\nLocate a germline, focus on the top of the germline and mark it using confocal microscope software. Similarly focus on the bottom of the germline and mark it to establish the total germline thickness.\nImage the entire germline by defining the thickness of each slice up to 0.5 µm. Mark the complete germline and start acquisition. Scan each slice 8 times and average the values to improve image quality. The resonant scanner will permit fast scanning to avoid bleaching during imaging. If the microscope does not have a resonant scanner, reduce the number of scans to four to avoid bleaching.\n4. Post Imaging Analysis of Nuclei Number and Distribution",
    "Note: Refer Supplementary Figure 1 for screenshots of the software tools and buttons used.\nImport the image to Imaris 8.4.1 or later versions of the software.\nDefine mitotic region, transition zone, meiotic region, oocyte region, and spermatheca of the germline by identifying the nuclear morphology in each region.\nUse the surface function button (Supplementary Figure 1A) of the software to select the region of interest.\nCancel automatic surface creation wizard and manually draw the region of interest at the first and last slice of the image from the three-dimensional stack.\nClick Create surface.\n\tNOTE: The software will automatically develop the stacks between first and last stack.\nMask all channels except DAPI by clicking Mask channel button (Supplementary Figure 1B-C).\nDefine nuclear size parameters using the spot function button (Supplementary Figure 1A). For the mitotic region, define an XY diameter of 2 µm while leaving Z diameter undefined. For the transition zone, define an XY diameter of 2 µm and Z diameter as 1.5 µm. (Supplementary Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: Troubleshoot the diameters according to the magnification and specifications of the microscope. For the current protocol, the objective used was 63X and provided an extra 1.70 times magnification during imaging. If the objective changes, for instance 40X, the diameters should be changed accordingly. Troubleshooting should be performed with wildtype germlines to establish the correct parameters. The mitotic region of a wild type germline arm has approximately 250 nuclei. The diameter should be modified to achieve this value. Use at least 15 germlines to determine the optimal value for the diameter. A similar approach should be used for calibrating the transition zone (150 - 170 nuclei) and meiotic region (600 - 700 nuclei).",
    "Limit the detection of spots by defining the minimum threshold (Supplementary Figure 1E). Use DAPI stained wild type germlines to establish minimum threshold by increasing the minimum three-dimensional rendering threshold until the first spot appears outside the germline.\nSave the image and obtain the number of nuclei from the table generated automatically by the software. Export the images as TIF files.\n5. Post Imaging Analysis for Scoring Sperm and Chromosome Number\nPerform three-dimensional rendering by selecting the spermatheca as the region of interest. To detect each sperm, define the spot diameter between 0.75 - 1.0 µm for X and Y- axis, while Z diameter remains undefined. Use the spots function button as shown in Supplementary Figure 1.\nSubtract the background by ticking background subtract box and using background correction values calculated by the software (Supplementary Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: Imaris software picks high intensity points first, therefore the effect of background is minimal as long as there is significant difference between the region of interest and the background. A second method is to define the background correction manually, where appropriate values can be given for the background. Manual background correction will be appropriate if the intensity of independent samples needs comparison.\nAdjust the three-dimensional rendering threshold to detect all DAPI stained sperm in the spermatheca (Supplementary Figure 1E).\nFor chromosome counting, define the spot diameter <0.75 µm for X and Y- axis before developing three-dimensional models.\nSave the image and export as TIF file.\n6. Post Imaging Analysis for Cytoskeletal Reconstruction of the Germline\nIdentify the region of interest in the germline and mask all channels except phalloidin by clicking Mask channels button.\nDefine a surface detail of 0.25 µm by using the surface function button (Supplementary Figure 1).",
    "Note: This means every 0.25 µm will be rendered into three-dimensional models. Surface detail can be constant for any region of the germline where a three-dimensional surface model will be created for every 0.25 µm. However, for the oocyte region, surface detail can be increased to 0.35 - 0.5 µm due the presence of well-defined actin fibers in this region.\nSubtract the background by ticking background subtract box and using background correction values calculated by the software (Supplementary Figure 1D).\nAdjust three-dimensional rendering threshold depending on the structure requiring analysis (Supplementary Figure 1E).\nSave the developed three-dimensional image and export as a TIF file.\nSubscription Required.
