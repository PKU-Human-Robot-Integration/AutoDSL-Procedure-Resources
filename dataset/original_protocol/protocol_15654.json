    "The experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of University of Yamanashi. Wild-type (C57BL/6J, Japan SLC) and transgenic mice expressing membrane-anchored GECI (Lck-GCaMP6f) in astrocytes were used in this study. The transgenic mice were obtained by crossing AldH1l1-CreERT2 mice [B6N.FVB-Tg(Aldh1l1-cre/ERT2)1Khakh/J, commercially obtained, see Table of Materials] and Flx-Lck-GCaMP6f mice [C57BL/6N-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<tm1(CAG-GCaMP6f)Khak>/J, commercially obtained] mice. The transgenic mice were treated with tamoxifen (20 mg/mL) for 5 days (0.05 mL/10 g bw, i.p.) to express GCaMP6f. All mice used were males and females at least 4 weeks old. The schematic of the window is shown in Figure 1A, and the surgical procedure is summarized in Figure 1B.\n1. Preparation for cranial window surgery\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane (induction: 3%, surgery: 1%-1.5%, flow rate: 0.2-0.3 L/min). Confirm the depth of anesthesia by the loss of tail or toe pinch reflex. Maintain the body temperature using a heating pad (36-38 °C). Apply eye ointment with a cotton swab to prevent the eyes of mice from drying out under anesthesia.\nInject 15% mannitol solution (see Table of Materials) intraperitoneally (3 mL/100 g body weight). Fix the head of the mouse on a stereotaxic frame with ear bars. Remove hair from the head of the mouse using a shaver and hair removal cream.\nDisinfect the skin surface with povidone-iodine and alcohol three times. Apply Lidocaine topically to provide preemptive analgesia. Remove the skin over the area of interest with surgical scissors and expose the skull (size: 15 x 15 mm). If bleeding is present, use a cotton swab to stop the bleeding.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the skin was removed to observe the prefrontal cortex to the visual cortex.",
    "Remove the periosteum over the exposed skull using a micro curette and dry the skull surface to firmly attach the head plate to the skull with dental cement (see Table of Materials) (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: The custom-made head plate is created using a 3D printer. The design file is deposited to the Github repository (https://github.com/Satoshi-Manita/Head-plates).\nAttach the head plate using dental cement (Figure 2C). Wait at least 20 min for the cement to harden. Secure the head plate with the head plate holder35.\n2. Making the cranial window\nRemove the extra cement over the skull with a dental drill (see Table of Materials). Be careful not to drill through the bone and damage the brain by drilling.\nMark the area to be cut with a pen and cut into the bone with a scalpel. Blunt the tip of the scalpel to ensure that the tip does not penetrate the skull (Supplementary Figure 1). Reference the brain atlas to determine where to make the window.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, a window was created between -2 mm and +4 mm from bregma in the anteroposterior axis and from sagittal suture to +3 mm in the mediolateral axis, including the motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices.\nScrape the bone repeatedly with a scalpel to deepen the groove until the bone in the area to be trimmed moves well when lightly touched.\nRemove the incised bone with fine tweezers. Do not push the bone flap into the brain, which may damage the brain (Figure 1Ba).\n\tNOTE: If bleeding is observed after removing the bone, immediately apply and aspirate artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, see Table of Materials) and repeat this process until the bleeding stops. Alternatively, place a hemostatic gelatin sponge (about 3 mm square cubes) soaked in the ACSF on the bleeding point.",
    "If the dura is not removed, proceed to step 2.7.\nRemove the dura mater following the steps below.\n\t\nRemove the dura, for example, in the following situations; transfection using the fibroin-AAV film method36 and observing small structures such as dendritic spines.\nCut the dura using a pulled glass pipette with a tapered tip of about 10 µm. To expand this cut over the entire window, use a U-shaped needle.\nSet the stereomicroscope zoom to 60-100x and remove the severed dura mater with ultrafine tweezers. If removing the dura mater causes bleeding, rinse with ACSF or use a gelatin sponge to stop the bleeding.\nCut out the PVDC wrap.\n\t\nSterilize a large (for example, 10 x 15 mm) piece of PVDC wrap (about 11 μm, see Table of Materials, Figure 2Aa) by autoclaving and with 70% ethanol.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, use tweezers and a scalpel to cut out a wrap of the required size.\n\t\tNOTE: The wrap size needs to be approximately 10 mm larger than the size of the cranial window but smaller than the opening of the head plate. For a 6 x 3 mm2 cranial window, prepare a 15 x 10 mm2 wrap.\nPlace the wrap accurately following the steps below.\n\t\nPlace the wrap on the brain surface, leaving the ACSF on the surface. Suck out the ACSF from the edge of the wrap, allowing the wrap to stick firmly to the brain surface (Figure 1Bb,c).\n\t\tNOTE: The wrap used is wrinkle-resistant, so just placing it on the brain's surface produces almost no wrinkles.\nTrim the wrap with a scalpel and tweezers so that there is approximately a 1 mm margin between the edge of the cranial window and the wrap (Figure 1Bd).",
    "Once the wrap is in place, glue the edge of the wrap to the skull with a biological adhesive (see Table of Materials, Figure 2D). Allow the adhesive to dry for about 30 min.\nApply the transparent silicone elastomer.\n\t\nApply the commercially available transparent silicone elastomer (see Table of Materials) on top of the wrap using a dispenser with a mixing tip (Figure 1Be, 2Ab-d) and place the cover glass (0.12-0.17 mm thickness) on top (Figure 2E).\nSeal the perimeter of the cover glass with waterproof film, superglue, or dental cement (Figure 1Bf).\nAfter surgery, monitor the mouse until it regains consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. After that, keep the mice individually, and allow them to recover in their home cage for at least 7 days.\n\t\nTo reduce stress and pain, administer anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents (e.g., dexamethasone and ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg each, i.p.).\nMonitor the mice regularly for infection. If an infection is confirmed, administer an antimicrobial drug (e.g., 10 % enrofloxacin, 1.7 µL/mL) in the drinking water until the infection is eliminated (typically less than 4 weeks).\n3. Making AAV film on plastic wrap using fibroin solution\nNOTE: Step 3 is optional.\nPrepare fibroin solution from silkworm cocoons following a previously published method37.\n\t\nIn brief, boil commercially available normal silkworm cocoons (5 g, see Table of Materials) in sodium carbonate solution (0.02 M, 2 L). Wash the cocoons in ultrapure water and dry overnight.\nDissolve the dried cocoons in lithium bromide solution (9.3 M, 20% w/v fibroin) while heating in an oven at 60 °C for 4 h. Dialyze the dissolved cocoon solution, centrifuge (twice at 12,700 x g, at 4 °C for 20 min)37, and collect the supernatant.\nPrepare the fibroin-AAV film following the steps below.",
    "Mix fibroin and AAV solutions20 in a 1:4 ratio in a small sample tube using a micropipette. Drop an aliquot of the mixed fibroin-AAV solution onto the plastic wrap for the cranial window, and dry it for at least 3 h.\n\t\tNOTE: For expression in an area of 3 mm in diameter, apply a 5 µL drop of fibroin-AAV solution. This ratio determines the amount of solution for a given area.\nAfter drying, cut the plastic wrap into the required size for the window (for example, 10 x 15 mm) and place it on the brain surface. Then, follow the abovementioned method from step 2.8.1 onward.\n\t\tNOTE: Before placing the wrap on the brain surface, remove the ACSF on the brain surface as much as possible. This is because the ACSF is expected to dissolve the fibroin-AAV film and reduce the concentration of AAV particles.\nWait about 2-4 weeks after creating the AAV-treated window until the GECIs are expressed sufficiently. During this process, check the condition of the mice and windows regularly.\n4. Calcium imaging and analysis\nNOTE: For details on the imaging and analysis, please see previously published reports1,2,38.\nPerform wide-field imaging following the steps below.\n\t\nImmobilize the mouse using a head fixation device under a tandem lens fluorescence macroscope (see Table of Materials).\nIlluminate the cerebral cortex of mice with excitation light from a 465 nm LED light source through an excitation filter, dichroic mirror, and objective lens.\nCollect the fluorescence images of the cerebral cortex by a CCD camera through an objective lens (1.0x), dichroic mirror, emission filter, and imaging lens (2.0x). The combination of these lenses gives a total magnification of about 0.5x.",
    "Acquire images at a sampling frequency of 50 Hz. After data acquisition, analyze the images using ImageJ software. Select the region of interest (ROI) manually. Calculate fluorescence change in each ROI as ΔF/F = (Ft - F0) / F0, where Ft is the raw fluorescence value of each frame and F0 is the mean fluorescence value obtained from an average image of all frames.\n\t\tNOTE: A macro program for ImageJ is deposited to GitHub (https://github.com/Satoshi-Manita/ImageJ-macro), which calculates ΔF/F images from calcium imaging data.\nPerform two-photon imaging following the steps below.\n\t\nImmobilize the mouse under a two-photon microscope using a head fixation device. Identify the area to be imaged using the microscope in bright-field mode with a low magnification (5x) objective lens.\nSwitch to two-photon imaging. Use a high magnification objective lens (16x or 25x) and illuminate the laser for two-photon excitation.\n\t\tNOTE: Green Lck-GCaMP6f22 and red XCaMP-R36 were excited by an ultrafast laser at excitation wavelengths of 920 nm and 1070 nm, respectively.\nAcquire fluorescence images at 30 Hz. After data acquisition, correct motion artifacts by the registration function of the suite2p software39. Obtain ROI and ΔF/F from images using the same method for wide-field imaging.\nPlot the data using python with the following libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas (see Table of Materials)."
