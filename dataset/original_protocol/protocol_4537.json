    "Preparation of recombinant proteins of the TRBD subunit of telomeraseMedaka TRBD subunit (residues 318-579) was inserted into a modified pMAL-2CX vector and the plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain ScarabXpress T7lac cells.Pick a single colony from a freshly streaked plate. Inoculate a starter culture of 5 ml LB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin in a sterile plastic tube. Incubate at 37 °C overnight with shaking at 250 rpm.Dilute the overnight culture into 2 L LB medium containing 0.2% glucose and 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and grow the culture at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until the cell density reaches OD600 = 0.5.Induce the expression of the recombinant TRBD proteins with 0.1 mM IPTG at 20 °C for 16 h with shaking at 250 rpm.Harvest cells by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (Beckman centrifuge).Resuspend the cell pellet in 50 ml lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM benzamidine, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin.Sonicate the cell suspension with 6 short burst of 30 sec followed by intervals of 30 sec for cooling (sonication power 100 W).Remove cell debris by ultracentrifuge at 4 °C for 40 min at 46,000 rpm using a 45Ti rotor.Slowly add ammonium sulfate (powder) into cell lysate to 55% saturation (add 16.3 g ammonium sulfate per 50 ml cell lysate). Mix for 30 min at 4 °C with slow stirring.Pellet the precipitated proteins by centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 rpm using a 45Ti rotor.Solubilize the protein pellet in lysis buffer and mix it with 5 ml pre-equilibrated amylose resin in a 50-ml conical tube. Rock the tube for 2 h at 4 °C.Transfer the bead-protein mixture to a BIO-RAD Econo-Pac column and allow all of the liquid to flow through the column.",
    "Then, wash beads with 100 ml lysis buffer.Elute the MBP-TRBD proteins with 15 ml lysis buffer added with 10 mM maltose. Apply the eluted MBP-TRBD proteins to a HiLoad Superdex 200 chromatography column to perform gel filtration purification. The column is pre-equilibrated with 120 ml lysis buffer.Collect the fractions that contain the MBP-TRBD proteins, and treat them with 200 μg protease 3C at 4 °C overnight to cleave the fusion proteins. Slowly pass the protease 3C-digested protein solution through 5 ml pre-equilibrated amylose resin by gravity to remove MBP and the uncleaved MBP-TRBD proteins. Apply the TRBD proteins to a HiLoad Superdex 200 chromatography column to perform gel filtration purification. The column is pre-equilibrated with 120 ml column buffer.Concentrate the purified proteins using Amicon 15 ml centrifugal filter to a concentration of 10 mg/ml (determined by UV280 absorbance) and store them at -80 °C in small aliquots.Preparation and purification of the CR4/5 RNAsPrepare the DNA templates for the in vitro transcription of the medaka telomerase CR4/5 RNA (nucleotides 170-220), with a glucosamine-6-phosphate-activated ribozyme (GlmS ribozyme) fused at its 3’ terminus, by PCR amplification.Set up 5 ml of the following in vitro transcription reaction and carry it out at 37 °C overnight. table:",

Pool and concentrate the RNA fractions. Treat them with 1 mM glucosamine-6-phosphate at 25 °C for 30 min to cleave the GlmS ribozyme from the 3’ site of CR4/5.Run another gel-filtration chromatography on HiLoad Superdex 200 with the column buffer to purify the CR4/5 RNAs from the GlmS ribozyme.Concentrate the CR4/5 RNAs to 10 mg/ml.Preparation of the TRBD-CR4/5 complex for crystallizationMix the TRBD proteins and the CR4/5 RNAs at a molar ratio of 1:2, and incubate the mixture on ice for 1 h. Purify the TRBD-CR4/5 mixture from the excess CR4/5 RNA by gel-filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 column with the column buffer.Concentrate the TRBD-CR4/5 protein-RNA complexes to 12 mg/ml. Proceed to crystallization trials or store them at -80 °C in small aliquots."
