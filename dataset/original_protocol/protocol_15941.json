Calculate the analyte concentrations using the calibration curves (area ratios obtained in the calibrators plotted against the nominal concentration). A lyso-Gb1 calibration curve is used to quantify lyso-Gb1 and its analogs, while an SPC calibration curve is used to quantify SPC and NPOPCS.\nA quadratic calibration curve with weighting 1/x is used for quantitation, and a fresh calibration curve is prepared with each batch of samples.\n43. For both lyso-Gb1 and SPC calibration curves, ensure that a minimum of 8 standards out of 10 have an accuracy (%bias) within ±15%, except for P1 (limit of quantitation), which should have an accuracy (%bias) within ±20%.\n44. Ensure that the calibration curves have a coefficient of determination (r2) >0.995."
