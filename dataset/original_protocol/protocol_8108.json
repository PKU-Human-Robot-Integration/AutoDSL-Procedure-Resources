    "The care and use of rats in this experiment conforms to institutional policies and guidelines (UPMC, INSERM, and European Community Council Directive 86/609/EEC). The following protocol is established for a standard litter of 12 pups.\n1. Preparation of the flasks (~5 min)\nNOTE: Perform the following steps the day before dissection in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nCoat the 150 cm2 flasks (T150) with filter cap (1 flask for 2 pups) using 5 mL of polyethylenimine (PEI, 100 mg/L, see protocol in Supplementary File 1).\nStore the flasks at 4 °C overnight.\nRinse coated flasks 3 times with sterile distilled water on the day of dissection.\n2. Preparation of media (~10 min)\nNOTE: Perform the steps in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nPrepare 500 mL of culture medium, consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 IU/mL).\nPrepare 20.6 mL of the enzyme digestion medium in a 50 mL tube, consisting of 20 mL of DMEM, 200 µL of DNase (50 µg/mL), 200 µL of papain (30 U/mL) and 200 µL of L-cysteine (0.24 mg/mL).\nFilter-sterilize the media using a 0.22 µm filter.\nKeep the media in the laminar flow hood at room temperature (RT) until dissection.\n3. Preparation for dissection (~10 min)\nNOTE: Perform the steps in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nPrepare 100 mL of phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium (PBS; 1x). Filter-sterilize using a 0.22 µm filter.\nPrepare 50 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS solution supplemented with 750 µL of 45% glucose. Filter-sterilize using a 0.22 µm filter.\nFill a 100 mm Petri dish with 1x PBS for cleaning instruments and three 60 mm Petri dishes with ice-cold PBS-glucose for tissue harvesting. Put the petri dishes on ice until dissection.",
    "4. Dissection\nNOTE: Dissection is performed from male and female Wistar rat pups at postnatal day (P) 2.\nIn order to provide a sterile environment, make sure to clean the bench with 100% ethanol. Sterilize all surgical tools with 100% ethanol.\nGently spray the neck of the pup with 70% ethanol.\nUse large surgical scissors to decapitate the animal and place the head in a 100 mm Petri dish containing ice-cold PBS-glucose.\nUse curved forceps to maintain the head of the animal at eye level. Use small surgical scissors to make a small incision at the base of the skull and cut the skull following the brain midline.\nUse forceps to gently peel off the two parts of the skull from the midline.\nUse a small surgical spoon to remove the brain from the head cavity. Put the brain in a 60 mm Petri dish containing ice-cold PBS-glucose on ice.\nViewing under a steromicroscope, use fine forceps to remove the cerebellum, the brainstem and olfactory bulbs from cerebral hemispheres.\nUse fine forceps to separate the two cerebral hemispheres. Use fine forceps to peel off the meninges. Put the cerebral cortices in a 60 mm-petri dish on ice.\n\tNOTE: Ice-cold PBS is critical for correct meninges removal.\n5. Tissue dissociation\nNOTE: Perform the steps in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nUse a sharp scalpel to finely chop the cerebral cortices. Transfer the minced tissue into a 50 mL tube containing enzyme digestion medium.\nIncubate for 30 min in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nUse a p1000 micropipette to gently remove the enzyme digestion medium while making sure that the cortical tissue remains at the bottom of the 50 mL tube.",
    "Use a p1000 micropipette to add 1 mL of DMEM-10% FCS and gently triturate the tissue.\nUse a 70 µm filter and a piston of a 1 mL syringe to filter the cortical tissue into a 50 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: One can rinse residual tissue on the inner tube wall several times with DMEM-10% FCS.\nFill the 50 mL tube with DMEM-10%FCS. Centrifuge at 423 x g for 5 min at RT. Carefully remove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet with 2 mL of DMEM-10%FCS.\nGently triturate cell pellet with a p1000 micropipette and then with a p200 micropipette. Dilute the cell suspension with the appropriate volume of DMEM-10%FCS.\n\tNOTE: Two brains = one T150 = 5 mL of DMEM-10%FCS.\nPlate 5 mL of the cell suspension on a T150 at a density of 1 x 105 cells/cm2. Add 20 mL of warm DMEM-10%FCS to each T150. Incubate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nRenew half of the culture medium after 6 days in vitro (DIV) with warm DMEM-10%FCS.\n6. Shaking preparation\nPerform shaking preparation on the day before shaking in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nRenew half of culture medium by adding fresh warm culture medium into the flask and incubate at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\n7. Shaking\nCoat three 100 mm Petri dishes with PEI. Store them at 4 °C overnight.\nCover the flasks cap with paraffin film and put the flasks into a plastic bag. Shake flasks containing glial cells overnight at 250 rpm at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: First shaking is performed at 8 DIV and one can perform up to three different shakings (see Figure 1 for timing).\n8. OL lineage cells harvesting and culture\nNOTE: These steps should be performed in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.",
    "On the day after shaking, prepare Bottenstein-Sato (BS) medium according to Table 1.\nRinse coated Petri dishes 3 times with sterile distilled water.\nHarvest flasks' supernatant containing mainly OL lineage cells but also some microglial cells and plate it on non-coated 100 mm Petri dishes.\n\tNOTE: This step allows removal of microglial cells through differential fast adhesion on the dish surface.\nIncubate the Petri dishes for 15 min in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nFill each T150 flask with 25 mL of warm freshly prepared culture medium and incubate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 until the second shaking.\nTransfer the supernatant from the Petri dishes into new non-coated 100 mm Petri dishes to allow adhesion of residual microglial cells.\nIncubate the Petri dishes for 15 min in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nRemove the supernatant, which contains non-adherent OL lineage cells, and transfer it into 50 mL tubes (supernatant from 2 Petri dishes for a 50 mL tube). Discard Petri dishes plated with microglia.\nCentrifuge the supernatant for 5 min at 423 x g. Carefully remove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet with 1 mL of BS medium. Pool all pellets in a common 50 mL tube and adjust volume to 10 mL with BS medium.\nDetermine cell density counting cells under a microscope.\n\tNOTE: A cell density between 3 x 105/mL and 5 x 105/mL should be obtained.\nAdd 20 mL of BS if cell density is higher than or equal to 4 x 105/mL to obtain a final volume of 30 mL, or add only 10 mL of BS if cell density is less than 4 x 105/mL to obtain a final volume of 20 mL.",
    "Plate two or three pre-coated 100 mm Petri dishes with 10 mL of cell suspension. Incubate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nClear the debris from the Petri dishes by refreshing all of the BS medium 2 h later.\n\tNOTE: Examine the culture under the microscope before and after clearing to verify cell density and efficiency of debris removal.\nIncubate for 2 days in BS medium in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Examine the culture under the microscope. The confluence should be 70% to 80%.\n9. OCM production\nNOTE: Perform these steps in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nPrepare NB-B27low medium according to Table 2.\nRenew culture medium with 10 mL of warm NB-B27low medium. Incubate for 2 days in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nHarvest the OCM, i.e., supernatant containing OL secreted factors. Filter-sterilize OCM using a 0.22 µm filter.\n\tNOTE: Store OCM at 4 °C for a maximum of 2 months.\n10. OCM addition\nNOTE: Steps should be performed in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions. OCM can be added to purified hippocampal neuron cultures prepared according to the following protocol14, and obtained by adding, 24 h after isolation, the anti-mitotic agents uridine and 5- fluorodeoxyuridine (5 µM) for 36 h.\nAt 3 DIV, remove all neuron culture medium containing anti-mitotic agents and add 500 µL of fresh warm OCM.\nRenew half of medium every 3 days with freshly made warm NB-B27.\n\tNOTE: Such cultures can be maintained up to 21 DIV.\n11.
