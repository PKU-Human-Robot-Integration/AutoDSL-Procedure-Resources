    "1. General Set Up and Tissue Preparation\nKeep the mouse in darkness for 30 min (aim to reduce its stress level). While waiting, prepare 1 L of extracellular solution. First dissolve 1.9 g of sodium bicarbonate in half a liter of Milli-Q water. Its pH is maintained at 7.4 by bubbling with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Five minutes later, dissolve 8.8 g of Ames Medium in 100 ml of Milli-Q water, add to the sodium bicarbonate solution, top up to 1 L with Milli-Q water and mix well. Keep this solution carboxygenated for the rest of the experiment.\nTake 250 ml of the carboxygenated Ames Medium and set up the fluid reperfusion system in the electrophysiological set-up. Keep the solution carboxygenated.\nUniformly smear a thin layer of vacuum grease onto the bottom of the perfusion chamber. Seal it with a cover slip and make sure it is air-tight. Take a small amount of grease (~ 2 mm in diameter) and position it on the top and bottom ends of the chamber. These balls will hold the grid (platinum frame strung with dental floss) in place and prevent it pressing too hard on the retina. Fix the chamber onto the platform and align both openings.\nThe animal is first anaesthetized with Isoflurane for 2 min, and then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Quickly remove eyes with a pair of small scissors (curved blades), wash thoroughly with carboxygenated extracellular fluid in a small beaker, and then place in a Petri dish filled with carboxygenated extracellular fluid.",
    "Under the dissecting microscope, make an insertion hole in the cornea (~ 2 mm from the edge) using a 19 gauge needle. Repeat for the other eye. This important step should be quick to allow oxygenation of both retinae. Remove one cornea with a small pair of iris scissors by cutting parallel to its edge. Next, remove the iris and lens with a pair of fine forceps. Repeat for the other eye. Transfer one eye cup into a beaker containing carboxygenated extracellular solution.\nWith a scalpel blade, cut one eye cup into half, to be able to flatten the whole-mount and to obtain two whole-mounts per retina. Carefully separate the retina from the pigment epithelium using a blunt dissecting probe or by gently pulling it off. Once detached, the retina is fairly transparent. Note the convex surface is the photoreceptors side. The concave surface is the ganglion cells side and it may stick to itself due to the presence of sticky vitreous humour.\nWith a pair of fine forceps, hold the edge of the detached retinal tissue close to the ora serrata and grab the ora serrata with another pair of fine forceps, pull it towards the center of the retina. This is a delicate process and may take a few attempts. If successful, ora serrata, ciliary body and vitreous humor are removed by this process, and the curvature of the retina is reduced (i.e. flatter).\nTrim the edges, and then transfer it to the perfusion chamber with ganglion cells facing up. Hold the tissue in place by placing the grid onto the grease balls. Place the remaining tissue with the other eye cup for later use. Similar procedures for retinal dissection are described in Middleton and Protti 16 and Pottek et al. 17.",
    "Mount the recording chamber under an upright microscope. Immediately set up the continuous perfusion of the retina with carboxygenated extracellular solution (35.5 °C) at a rate of 3 - 5 ml/min. Make sure the grounding electrode is in place.\nAttached to the microscope is a digital camera allowing visualization of the tissue. The whole set up sits above an air table (shock absorption) and inside a Faraday cage (blocks external static and non-static electric fields).\nTurn on the light source (infrared, > 850 nm) and with a 40X objective, bring its focus onto the cell bodies of ganglion cells. Find the central area of the whole-mount for recording.\nDefrost a frozen vial of K+ based intracellular solution (300 μl, pH = 7.4) containing (in mM) K-gluconate: 140, HEPES acid: 10, MgCl2: 4.6, ATP-Na+: 4, GTP-Na+: 0.4 and EGTA: 10. All reagents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n2. Patching Cell Bodies of Retinal Ganglion Cells\nFirst fire polish the ends of borosilicate capillary glass tubing, then pull them with a Glass Microelectrode Puller with two heating steps (resistance: 5 - 8 MΩ).\nAdd 3 μl of Lucifer Yellow (final concentration 0.2%) to the intracellular solution, mix well, and centrifuge it. Next, transfer the top 85% of the solution into a 1 ml syringe, connect it to a 0.22 μm filter unit, then to a 30 G reusable hypodermic needle. Refrigerate.",
    "Fix the glass pipette, of similar tip size as those used for recordings, in its holder and move it under the microscope using a micromanipulator. Under a 40X objective, slowly lower the pipette until it makes a small dimple on the surface of the inner limiting membrane. Carefully advance the pipette forward until it catches a small amount of tissue, and then move it upward and/or sideways to tear a small hole to expose the cell bodies of the ganglion cells. The smaller the hole, the higher the degree of integrity of the retinal network is maintained. If desired, sulforhodamine 101 (SR101; 0.5 - 1 μM) can be added to the extracellular medium to label damaged neurons by using fluorescence microscopy 15.\nFill up a clean pipette with 8 - 10 μl of intracellular solution. Insert it into the holder attached to the amplifier's head stage and make sure the chlorinated silver chloride electrode is submerged. Discard if dirt and/or air bubbles is/are present.",
    "Turn on all equipment. We used an EPC 8 patch clamp amplifier controlled by PatchMaster to achieve whole-cell recordings in voltage clamp configuration. Note that other amplifiers that allow current clamp recordings in fast mode can also be used. Apply and maintain positive pressure in the pipette solution. Select a cell with a large cell body so most likely it is a ganglion cell rather than a displaced amacrine cell or a glial cell. Slowly lower the pipette tip so it is making a small dimple on the surface of the membrane, stop, and release the pressure. Immediately lower the holding potential to - 60 mV. Once a gigaseal (GΩ) is achieved between them, gently suck to break the membrane to achieve a whole-cell patch clamp configuration. This procedure is a delicate step, if too much negative pressure is applied, then the connection becomes leaky; if too little, the membrane remains intact.\nOver time, Lucifer Yellow will fill the cell, allowing visualization of the cell's morphology. If stable, this set-up should last 30 min or more.\n3. Recordings of Ganglion Cells Using Dynamic Clamp\nFirst, a current-voltage test (from - 75 to + 35 mV every 10 mV) is executed using PatchMaster. Proceed to later tests only if a large Na+ current (> 1 nA) is present. Note that in the rare occasion where a displaced amacrine cell is patched, in that case, will not respond with trains of action potentials to subsequent current injections.",
    "Open LabVIEW and execute the custom written Neuroakuma program, then load various conductance waveforms. Set repeat number to 8 (6 - 8 for statistical purpose). Set reversal potentials of excitatory and inhibitory conductances at 0 and - 75 mV respectively. Select one matching pair of excitatory and inhibitory conductances for testing. Excitatory conductance trace (in green) and inhibitory conductance trace (in red) will appear in the lower panel.\nGo back to PatchMaster, select current clamp mode, and immediately switch the amplifier to 'CC + Comm FAST' current clamp mode. This mode allows to accurately follow rapid changes in membrane potential. If a good seal between the membrane and pipette is maintained, little/no compensation is needed; otherwise, the recording will not last long. In Neuroakuma, press the \"record\" button. The cellular response (usually with a phasic burst of action potentials, Figure 1A) will appear on the upper panel. Inject current into the cell with low scaling of conductances first, if little/no response is observed, increase in small increments until it produces a strong response. Excessive current injection can kill the cell. Once tests are completed, select a new pair of conductance waveforms, repeat the above for all pairs of physiological and artificial conductances. The physiological currents (I) injected in real time are based on:\n\tI(t) = Gexc(t) x (Vm(t) - Vexc) + Ginh(t) x (Vm(t) - Vinh)",
    "Conductance (G in nS) could be synaptic or artificial. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance waveforms were collected from previous experiments performed by Protti, Di Marco, Huang, Vonhoff, Nguyen and Solomon (unpublished results) in response to different visual stimuli in control conditions and in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM). Artificial conductance waveforms were modeled using an alpha function. Vm (in mV) is the recorded membrane potential. Gexc and Ginh represent excitatory and inhibitory conductances respectively whilst Vexc and Vinh represent the reversal potentials of excitatory and inhibitory conductances respectively. Time is t in ms. Sampling rate is 40 kHz.\nIs = I0(t/α)e-αt\nThe above equation is an alpha function (I0 = maximum current; 1/α = time to peak (sec-1) of the current). The rise time and decay time of the synaptic current is dictated by α 4. The excitatory conductance was unchanged whilst the latency of the inhibitory conductance was modified, reducing its delay relative to the onset of excitation (Figure 2D).\nAfter recording, carefully retract the pipette so the cell body stays intact. Immediately fix the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by three 10 min washes with 0.1 M of phosphate buffer. Refrigerate and perform antibody staining the following day or within a week.\n4. Antibody Staining Against Lucifer Yellow Filled Retinal Ganglion Cells\nAntibody staining against Lucifer Yellow filled ganglion cells at room temperature (primary anti-Lucifer Yellow rabbit IgG (dilution = 1:10,000) for five days; on the sixth day, overnight staining with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution = 1:500)). Wet mount the retina in Fluorescent Preserving Media. Cover slip and seal with nail polish.\nTake confocal pictures of the cell morphology using a Leica Spec-II confocal microscope (Figure 1B). The presence of an axon allows the confirmation of ganglion cells.",
