    "1. Synthesis of mRNA\nNOTE: For the mRNA synthesis, all the reagents and equipment must be specially treated to inactivate the RNases before use. See the Table of Materials for details about all the materials, instruments, and reagents used in this protocol.\nLinearization of DNA\n\tNOTE: Mouse cDNAs of CrkI and CrkL were cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-5a expression vector to add the FLAG epitope tag at the C-terminus and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector to incorporate the T7 promoter, as previously described18,19.\n\t\nAdd 10 µL of 10x reaction buffer, 1.5 µL of PmeI (10,000 units/mL), and 10 µg of a plasmid DNA to a microcentrifuge tube to linearize the plasmid DNA with the restriction enzyme. Add nuclease-free water to bring the reaction volume to 100 µL.\nMix by tapping, spin down, and incubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C overnight.\nSpin down, and add 5 µL of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 1 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL, RNA grade) to the reaction mixture. Mix by tapping, spin down, and incubate at 50 °C for 30 min.\nUnder the fume hood, add 100 µL of the bottom phase of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to the plasmid reaction mixture for extraction. Vortex, and then centrifuge at 18,800 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Move the upper phase to a new tube.\nRepeat step 1.1.4 with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol at 24:1.\nIn the new tube, bring the reaction volume to 300 µL by adding 200 µL of nuclease-free water, and then add 30 µL of 3 M sodium acetate and 600 µL of 100% ethanol.\nMix by vortexing, and then place at −20 °C for 30-60 min for the ethanol precipitation of the DNA.",
    "Centrifuge at 18,800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, and rinse the pellet with 1 mL of 70% ethanol. Repeat the centrifugation for 10 min, and then remove the supernatant completely.\nDry with the cap open for 2 min, add 30 µL of nuclease-free water, and resuspend the DNA pellet.\nDetermine the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.\nVerify the size and quantity of the linearized DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis.\nRNA synthesis using T7 RNA polymerase\n\t\nAdd 2 µL each of 10x transcription buffer, ATP, GTP, UTP, CTP, and T7 and 1 µg of a linearized DNA to a microcentrifuge tube. Add nuclease-free water to bring the reaction volume to 20 µL.\nMix by tapping, spin down, and incubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 2 h for RNA synthesis.\nSpin down, add 1 µL of DNase (2 U/µL), and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min to remove the template DNA.\nLithium chloride precipitation of the RNA\n\t\nAdd 10 µL of lithium chloride (7.5 M) to the reaction mixture. Mix by tapping, spin down, and incubate the reaction mixture at −20 °C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 18,800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, and rinse the pellet with 500 µL of 70% ethanol. Repeat the centrifugation for 10 min, and then remove the supernatant completely.\nDry with the cap open for 2 min, add 30 µL of nuclease-free water, and resuspend the RNA pellet.\nCapping\n\t\nHeat the RNA sample at 65 °C for 10 min, and then place it on ice for cooling.",
    "Add 5 µL each of 10x capping buffer, 10 mM GTP, and 1 mM (10x) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), 2 µL each of a capping enzyme mix and O-methyltransferase enzyme mix, and 1.25 µL of RNase inhibitor. Mix by tapping, spin down, and incubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPoly(A) tailing\n\t\nSpin down the sample, and then add 6 µL of nuclease-free water, 20 µL of 5x E-PAP buffer, 10 µL of 25 mM MnCl2, 10 µL of 10 mM ATP, and 4 µL of E-PAP poly(A) tailing enzyme. Mix by tapping, spin down, and incubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 2 h.\nLithium chloride precipitation and quantification of the synthetic mRNA\n\t\nAdd 50 µL of lithium chloride (7.5 M), and perform lithium chloride precipitation as described in steps 1.3.1-1.3.3.\nMeasure the concentration of the mRNA using a spectrophotometer.\nVerify the size and quantity of mRNA using formaldehyde (1%-2%) agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis.\n2. Extracellular matrix (ECM) gel coating of the cell invasion and migration (CIM) plates\nNOTE: A cell invasion and migration (CIM) plate is a commercially manufactured 16-well plate for impedance-based real-time cell analysis. For the cell invasion assay, coat CIM plates with ECM gel, as previously described but with some modifications11.\nRemove an aliquot of ECM gel stock from the freezer and keep it on ice.\nDilute the ECM gel (10 mg/mL) to a working concentration (100 µg/mL) by mixing 990 µL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (without serum or antibiotics) with 10 µL of ECM gel in a microcentrifuge tube. Mix by gentle pipetting.\nAdd 60 µL of diluted ECM gel to each of the 16 wells of the upper chamber of the CIM plate. Apply the reverse pipetting method while avoiding air bubbles20,21.",
    "NOTE: Optimize the concentration of the ECM gel for each cell line. For glioblastoma cell lines, 0.1 µg/µL to 1 µg/µL ECM gel was used for optimization.\nPlace the upper chamber of the CIM plate with the plate cover off on a protective plastic sheet inside a CO2 incubator for approximately 4 h to form a gel layer.\n\t​CAUTION: During the coating of the CIM plate with ECM gel, the electrodes of the upper chamber of the CIM plate should not have direct contact with the experimenter's hands or the surfaces of the equipment, including the biosafety cabinet or the CO2 incubator.\n3. Preparation of the tumor cells\nNOTE: All the cell culture materials must be kept sterile. Harvest and electroporate the tumor cells under a biological safety cabinet with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), as previously described but with some modifications11.\nCulture of the tumor cells\n\t\nCulture U-118MG cells in 10 mL of DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics per 100 mm x 20 mm polystyrene tissue culture dish at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator (culture condition).\nSerum depletion of the tumor cells\n\tNOTE: The exposure of the cells to the chemoattractants present in FBS must be minimized before the cell migration and invasion assays by using a high concentration of FBS.\n\t\nRemove the old medium, and add 10 mL of prewarmed DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and 1% antibiotics per dish (low-serum medium).\nRepeat step 3.2.1.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 4 h or longer.\nHarvesting of the tumor cells",
    "Remove the old medium, add 8 mL of prewarmed Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) per dish, remove the DPBS, add prewarmed 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (2 mL/dish) to cover the surface, and incubate in the CO2 incubator for 30 s.\nAspirate the trypsin-EDTA carefully, add low-serum medium (7 mL/dish), and then collect cells into a 50 mL or 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nAliquot a small volume of cells, and use a handheld automated cell counter to count the cells.\nCalculate the total number of cells and the required volume for 10,000 cells/µL.\nSpin down the cells by centrifuging them at 100 × g for 5 min at room temperature, aspirate the supernatant, add the calculated volume of DMEM containing 0.5% FBS (without antibiotics), and gently resuspend the cell pellet.\nTransfer 110 µL of the cell suspension, containing 1.1 million cells, to a microcentrifuge tube for each treatment.\nRepeat step 3.3.6 to transfer the cells to four microcentrifuge tubes for four different treatments.\n\t\t​NOTE: A CIM plate has a total of 16 wells. Design four different treatments for comparison so that four wells of the CIM plate can be assigned for each treatment. Use the electroporated cells for the following experiments: western blot analyses (0.3 million cells per 35 mm tissue culture dish), four wells of real-time cell migration assays (0.1 million cells/well), and four wells of real-time cell invasion assays (0.1 million cells/well) for each treatment. Adjust the number of cells that need to be electroporated if the experimental design changes.\n4. Electroporation of the tumor cells",
    "To remove the medium, add 1 mL of DPBS to the cell suspension in each tube, spin down the cell suspension three times for 10 s each time while rotating the tube 180° every 10 s using a mini centrifuge, and remove the supernatant using a micropipette.\n\tNOTE: It is important to form a compact but easily resuspendable cell pellet.\nAdd 110 μL of resuspension buffer R to the cell pellet to obtain 0.1 million cells in 10 μL.\nAdd synthetic mRNA to the cell pellet to obtain a concentration of 0.2-20 ng/µL depending on the desired expression level. Mix and resuspend the cell pellet gently by tapping or gentle pipetting.\n\tNOTE: Use different concentrations of synthetic mRNA, examine the protein expression using western blot analysis, and determine the concentration of synthetic mRNA that leads to the desired expression level in order to investigate the specific correlation between the protein expression and biological effects.\nElectroporate 10 µL of the cell suspension with an electroporation system at 1,350 V for 10 ms with three pulses each time.\nTransfer the electroporated cells into a new microcentrifuge tube with 1.1 mL of DMEM containing 0.5% FBS.\nRepeat the electroporation until the rest of the cell suspension is electroporated. Combine the electroporated cells in the microcentrifuge tube to obtain 1.1 million cells in 1.1 mL.\n\tNOTE: Both 100 µL and 10 µL electroporation tips may be used to electroporate a large volume of cells, but the electroporation tips for 10 µL and 100 µL are included in two separate kits and need to be purchased separately. Resuspension buffer R is included in both kits.\nUpon completing all the respective electroporations, gently resuspend the pooled cells.",
    "Plate 0.3 million cells in a 35 mm x 10 mm polystyrene tissue culture dish with 2 mL of DMEM containing 5% FBS, and culture the cells for 1 day under the culture condition for total cell lysate preparation and western blot analyses.\nKeep the rest of the electroporated cells at room temperature until the real-time cell analysis system is ready.\n5. Setting up the real-time cell analyzer, the program, and the CIM plates\nNOTE: Prepare the real-time cell analyzer and two CIM plates, as previously described11.\nEquilibration of the real-time cell analyzer\n\t\nMove the real-time cell analyzer into a CO2 incubator several hours before use to equilibrate the system under the culture condition.\nSetting up the analysis program\n\t\nOpen the analysis program by double-clicking on the real-time cell analysis software icon on the desktop.\nOnce the Default Experiment Pattern Setup option is open, select the option for running three experiments separately.\n\t\tNOTE: Each cradle has a separate window. There are different tabs to set up the measurement interval and duration, data analysis, and other experimental conditions.\nOpen each cradle by clicking on the Number tab.\nClick on the Experiment Notes tab, select the folder that the data will be saved to, and enter the name of the experiment.\nClick on the Layout tab, set up quadruplicate wells for each treatment condition by selecting four wells at a time and entering the sample information, and then click on Apply.\nClick on the Schedule tab | Add a step to set up the two-step mode of the cell impedance measurements. Then, click on Apply to set up the first step.",
    "Click on Add a step again, enter 10 min for the interval and 48 h for the duration for migration and invasion, and click on Apply to set up the second step.\n\t\tNOTE: The first step takes a one-time baseline measurement (one sweep with a 1 min interval). The second step measures the cell impedance for the experiment (for example, 289 sweeps with a 10 min interval for 48 h) at the cradle. Adjust the interval and duration depending on the experimental design.\nMove to the next cradle, and set it up by repeating steps 5.2.3-5.2.7.\nPreparation of the CIM plates\n\t\nOne hour before the cell impedance measurement starts, fill the wells of the lower chamber of the CIM plate with 160 µL of DMEM containing 10% serum or other chemoattractants.\nAssemble the upper chamber that contains the ECM gel-coated wells (for invasion) or uncoated wells (for migration) with the lower chamber.\nAdd 50 µL of low-serum medium to the wells of the upper chamber of the CIM plate for the cell migration assay, and place the CIM plate in the cradle of the system.\nClick on the Message tab, and ensure that the Connections ok message is displayed. The CIM plate is now ready for the experiment.\nPreincubate the assembled CIM plate in the CO2 incubator for 30-60 min before the real-time cell analysis to acclimate the CIM plate to the culture condition.\n6. Real-time cell analysis and data export\nNOTE: Perform a baseline reading, cell seeding, cell impedance measurement, and data export as previously described11.\nBaseline reading\n\tNOTE: The baseline should be read after the CIM plate is acclimated and before the cells are added to the wells of the upper chamber.",
    "Click on the Start button for each cradle. When the Save As window appears, save the experimental file to perform the baseline reading.\nCell seeding\n\t\nRemove the CIM plate from the cradle, and place it in the biosafety cabinet on the plate holder.\nAdd 100 µL (containing 100,000 cells) of electroporated cells to the wells of the upper chamber of the CIM plate according to the program in the control unit. Apply the reverse pipetting method while avoiding air bubbles.\nLeave the CIM plate under the biosafety cabinet for 30 min at room temperature to make sure the cells spread evenly on the well bottom.\nCell impedance measurement\n\t\nMove the fully assembled CIM plate back to the respective cradle. Click on the cradle Start button to begin the cell impedance measurement for the second step.\nClick on the Plot tab, then click the Add All button, and select the Average and STD DEV boxes to visualize the data in real time.\n\t\t​NOTE: The default plotting option is Time for the x-axis and Cell Index for the y-axis. The Plot Selection section allows the user to select alternative options for the y-axis: Normalized Cell Index or Delta Cell Index. Once the final sweep is made, the experiment is completed, and the results are saved automatically.\nExport of the data for analysis\n\t\nClick on the Plot tab and select the Average and STD DEV boxes to copy the data for each well individually.\nRight-click on the plot area, and select Copy Data in List Format.\nOpen an empty spreadsheet file, paste the data, and then save the file.\nGo back to the analysis program, click on the Plate tab for each cradle, and select Release to close the experiment for the cradle.",
    "Go back to the spreadsheet file, and adjust the time of the raw data so that the start time at the second step becomes the actual start time for the measurement.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
