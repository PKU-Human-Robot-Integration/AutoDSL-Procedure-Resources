These controls are required for the creation of spectral references (signatures) for every fluorochrome. The controls and unmixing matrix will allow the correct identification and separation of markers in the fully stained samples.\nPrepare single stained controls (except for the viability dye) with compensation beads (UltraComp eBeads, Invitrogen) following instructions from the manufacturer (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0019374_UltraComp_eBeads_and_UltraComp_eBeads_Plus_Compensation_Beads_PI.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0019374_UltraComp_eBeads_and_UltraComp_eBeads_Plus_Compensation_Beads_PI.pdf]).\nMix the beads vigorously by pulse-vortexing and add 1 drop in a half-deep well plate (round bottom) (or single polystyrene tubes) for each antibody included in the panels.\nAdd a single test (standardized quantity to stain 1 × 106 cells in 100 μL total volume, see Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) of conjugated antibody for each one of the single stained controls required, mix well by pulse-vortexing and incubate at 4°C for 20 min in the dark.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3159_3.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3159_4.csv\naIntracellular marker.\nbRecommended concentration by the manufacturer: 10 μL/106 cells.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3159_5.csv\naIntracellular marker.\nAdd 2 mL of flow cytometry stain buffer (BD) to each tube, and centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min.\nDecant and fix the beads with 400 μL of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at 4°C, and maintain protected from light.\nWash the beads with 1 mL of cold (4°C) 1× PBS by centrifuging at 400 g for 5 min.\nDecant and suspend the beads in 500 μL of cold (4°C) 1× PBS and maintain them protected from light at 4°C.\nFor the viability dye (Zombie UV, BioLegend), prepare one reaction with PBMCs and stain following the sample staining steps (see below).",
    "Note: It is recommended to run single stained controls each time that samples will be acquired, especially if there are changes of antibodies and/or reagent lot.\nOptional: Add an extra sample of fully stained PBMCs (in each panel) to set the PMT configuration in the cytometer without losing events from your objective samples.\nSample staining\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the preparation of antibody master mixes, as well as incubation and washing steps for the extracellular and intracellular staining of the target PBMCs. The concentration of antibodies for each panel is listed in Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\nCount, separate and wash the cells.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min with 1× PBS.\nSuspend 1 × 106 cells into 100 μL of cold stain buffer (1× PBS, 20% FBS) in a 96-half-deep well plate.\nAdd 5 μL of FcR-blocking reagent (Human TruStain FcX, BioLegend) directly in the stain buffer (1× PBS, 20% FBS) containing the cells, mix and incubate for 10 min at 18°C–20°C of temperature.\nNote: This step is optional. Step 3 of the staining requires the suspension of the cells in 20% FBS-containing stain buffer, which helps to reduce non-specific FcRs binding and background fluorescence. In addition, we tested the use of an FcR-blocking solution and we did not find major differences in the markers except for the expression of CD3 in CD14+CD19+ cells (which are negatively selected in this protocol). Thus, we recommend performing an extra step with an Fc-blocking reagent to maximize the reduction of potential background signals especially when aiming to analyze cells containing high levels of Fc receptors such as monocytes, macrophages, and B-cells.\nWash the cells with cold (4°C) 1× PBS (complete to 500 μL of total volume).\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min,",
    "Decant and suspend the cells in 100 μL of 1× PBS.\nAdd 1 μL of viability dye (Zombie UV, BioLegend) for each 1 × 106 cells in 100 μL cold 1× PBS (4°C) and incubate the cells for 20 min at 18°C–20°C of temperature in the dark.\nIn the meantime, prepare the different master mixes with the extracellular antibodies (panels A, B, and C) in cold (4°C) brilliant stain buffer (BD Biosciences) adjusting for a total volume of 100 μL/sample.\nNote: Antibody concentrations are indicated in Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\nNote: We recommend adding each one of the polymer-based antibodies directly into the sample and gently mixing instead of adding them all together in the master mix in order to reduce the chances of additional staining artifacts due to non-specific reactivity.\nAdd 50% overhead volume to account for potential pipetting errors.\nMix well by gently pipetting up and down.\nWash the cells with cold 1× PBS (complete to 500 μL of total volume).\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min, and decant.\nAdd the corresponding master mix of antibodies (100 μL) to the samples for extracellular staining (panels A, B, and C).\nMix well by gently pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 30 min at 18°C–20°C of temperature in the dark.\nWash the cells with cold (4°C) 1× PBS (complete to 500 μL of total volume).\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min and decant.\nFix the cells without intracellular staining markers (panel A).\nFix the cells with 500 μL of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min:\nWash the cells with cold (4°C) 1× PBS (complete to 500 μL of total volume).\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min.\nDecant by inverting the plate on absorbent clean paper towel.",
    "Suspend the cells in 500 μL of cold (4°C) 1× PBS.\nPause point: These stained and fixed cells (panel A) are ready for acquisition (maintain protected from light at 4°C if these are not immediately acquired in the cytometer).\nContinue with the intracellular staining of the corresponding samples (panels B and C):\nSuspend the cells in 300 μL of cold (4°C) permeabilization buffer (Cytofix/Cytoperm solution, BD) and incubate for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nPrepare the different master mixes with intracellular antibodies (Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\nPrepare the mixes in permeabilization/wash buffer (Perm/Wash Buffer, BD) previously diluted in distilled water (to make a 1× solution).\nAdjust for a total volume of 50 μL/sample and add 50% overhead volume to account for potential pipetting errors.\nMix well by gently pipetting up and down.\nWash the cells twice by adding 1× permeabilization/wash buffer (Perm/Wash Buffer, BD) (complete to 500 μL of total volume).\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min.\nDecant by inverting the plate on absorbent clean paper towel.\nAdd the master mixes of antibodies (50 μL) to the samples.\nMix well by gently pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nWash the cells with cold (4°C) 1× permeabilization/wash buffer (Perm/Wash Buffer, BD) (complete to 0.5 mL of total volume).\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant by inverting the plate on absorbent clean paper towel.\nFix the cells in 500 μL of cold (4°C) 4% PFA for 10 min.\nWash the cells by adding cold (4°C) 1× PBS (complete to 500 μL of total volume).\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min.\nDecant by inverting the plate on absorbent clean paper towel.",
    "Suspend the cells in 500 μL of cold (4°C) 1× PBS and maintain protected from light at 4°C.\nNote: Instead of a half-deep well plate, samples can be prepared in polystyrene tubes. The Sony ID7000 spectral cell analyzer supports 5-mL tube racks (24 tubes), 96-well standard height, 96-well half deep, 96-well deep plates, and 384-well standard flat bottom plates.\nNote: The final volume for cell suspension should be adjusted depending on the number and type of cells, and whether tubes, deep-well or other plates will be used. Volumes in this protocol are standardized for 96-half-deep well plates.\nPause point: The stained and fixed cells are ready for acquisition (maintain protected from light at 4°C if they are not immediately acquired).\nInstrument preparation and experiment set-up\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section refers to the creation of a new experiment in the spectral cell analyzer system and preparing the instrument for sample acquisition. The steps include the calibration of the Sony ID7000 system, setting the characteristics of the experiment such as the template and groups of samples, indicating the fluorochromes in the panel, and setting the final PMT voltages to acquire the samples.\nSet the spectral cell analyzer (Sony ID7000).\nRun daily purge, flow rate and QC calibrations following the instructions of the manufacturer (https://vimeo.com/847254690/e408449a02[href=https://vimeo.com/847254690/e408449a02]).\nNote: The ID7000 spectral cell analyzer needs to be calibrated using the daily QC and performance 8-peak beads before setting-up the experiment and acquire the samples.\nCreate a new experiment (one individual experiment for each panel);\nIn the spectral cytometer system software, indicate the type of template (tubes and/or 96-half-deep-well plates).\nCreate a new sample group and add the samples to the group.\nName the tubes or wells with the samples and single-stained controls.",
