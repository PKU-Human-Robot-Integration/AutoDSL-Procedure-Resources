    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nT cell isolation and expansion\nTiming: 4 days\nCytotoxic CD8+ T cells were isolated from KPC or KPCT mouse spleen via negative selection using EasySep Mouse CD8 T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC) following manufacturer’s recommendation with slight modifications. Note, this can be performed from a donor mouse prior to isolating and generating tumor slices from another animal or it can be performed from a tumor bearing mouse concomitantly with tumor harvest and preparation when matched samples are needed.\nCritical: Use at least 10% more of the required reagent volumes depending on cell density. Magnetic separation (step 7 and 8 in the manufactures protocol) may be repeated to further enrich T cell purity if desired.\nAfter isolation, CD8+ T cells are activated and expanded using Dynabeads Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following manufacturer’s recommendation with slight modifications. Cells were seeded at an initial density of 100K cells per well in a 96 well round bottom plate in 100 μL of media with 2.5 μL of activation beads. Cells were cultured in Immunocult media supplemented with 30 U/mL of IL-2 to encourage proliferation.\nCritical: The use of a round bottom plate is necessary to ensure T cell aggregation and encourages more uniform T cell activation and expansion.\nActivate cells for at least 4 days prior to removal of the CD3/CD28 beads and utilization in subsequent experiments. During the activation phase, add 50–100 μL of fresh immunocult media with 30 U/mL of IL-2 without disturbing cell pellet. If cells are expanding rapidly (cell pellet doubling/tripling in size) or culture media is turning yellow, split cells into 3 new wells and replenish with fresh media up to 100 μL.",
    "Note: T cells should form a small cell pellet in middle of the wells. Pellet will likely have 2 colors, brown in the center (activation beads) and opaque around the beads (T cells). Optimal activation and expansion occur with close physical contact. If a cell pellet is not forming, we recommend confirming cell viability or reseeding at a higher density.\nRemove the CD3/CD28 activation beads after 4 days: gently mix the cell suspension and centrifuge at 300g for 10 min. Resuspend cell pellet in 2 mL of fresh Immunocult media in round bottom tubes. Mix thoroughly and place the tube containing the cell suspension in the magnetic separator following the EasySep protocol.\nNote: If the cell pellet is large, you should resuspend the cell pellet in 4 mL (splitting suspension in two) and perform magnetic separation on both suspensions individually. Populations can be mixed after negative selection.\nNote: Always verify isolation purity to ensure population is CD8+. We recommend staining cells using an anti-CD8 antibody and assessing purity via flow cytometry before use in subsequent experiments. Additional markers like CD45, CD3, or a viability dye may also be desired. This should be done with each isolation as purity will vary from batch to batch. A minimal purity >85% is desired for these experiments.\nActivated primary CD8+ T cell can be used immediately or kept in culture for up to 7–8 days post isolation. If desired, cells may also be frozen down in freezing medium (15% DMSO in FBS) for future use. See below steps for recovering frozen primary CD8+ T cells.\nNote: To increase expansion after activation, increase IL-2 concentration in Immunocult media to 200 U/mL. Culture of primary activated T cells after 8 days is not recommended.",
    "Note: The following steps are for recovering and culturing T cells after having been previously frozen down.\nThaw T cells in a water bath at 37°C for 1–2 min.\nWash thawed cells in 10 mL of warm Immunocult media. Spin down suspension at 300g for 10 min.\nSeed thawed cells into a 96 well plate at a density of 2 × 102[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] in 100 μL of Immunocult media supplemented with 200 U/mL IL-2.\nLet cells recover for 24–48 h before starting subsequent experiments. If media changes color or cell pellet doubles in size post-thaw, split each well into three new wells and add fresh Immunocult media with 200 U/mL IL-2 to 150 μL.\nNote: It is not recommended to culture primary T cells >96 h post-thaw.\nPreparing tumor slices from murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma\nTiming: 2–3 h\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) tumors were obtained from genetically engineered mouse model, KrasG12D/+;p53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) and fluorescent reporter KPC mice KrasG12D/+;p53R172H/+;Pdx1-Cre;ROSATdtomato/+ (KPCT) which are used as a faithful mouse model for pancreatic cancer and reflects human pancreatic cancer genetically, clinically and histopathologically, and is highly informative for preclinical studies.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Minnesota.\nPrepare a 1.5% agarose solution (Genemate) for support for slicing. Dilute agarose in Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer and microwave this solution. When the agarose is completely dissolved, pour solution in a cell culture dish and leave on ice until gel hardens.",
    "Prepare a 6-well and 24-well tissue culture plate with organotypic culture inserts6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] with modifications. Begin by filter sterilizing a solution of 100 mM HEPES in 2× PBS. Prepare a 3 mg/mL rat tail collagen type 1 solution by mixing at a ratio of 1:1 of sterile 100 mM Hepes in 2× PBS and complete volume with sterile 1× PBS buffer. Coat 6-well and 24-well inserts with 250 μL and 50 μL, respectively, of 3 mg/mL rat tail collagen solution. Allow collagen mixture to dry in a sterile laminar flow hood for 1–2 h and either use immediately or add 1.1 mL 1× sterile PBS for a 6-well, or 400 μL for a 24-well insert. Store at 4°C for up to two weeks.\nNote: Prepare the collagen mixture in ice to prevent polymerization. Leave mixture in ice for at least 5 min prior to coating inserts.\nNote: Storing prepared culture inserts for up to two weeks is suggested; plates were not used or tested after this time frame.\nHarvest PDA tumor from KPC or KPCT mice, and transfer to a conical tube containing sterile ice-cold PBS with 10 μg/mL STI and 1× P/S for transport.\nNote: Mice are on a mixed background and were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and cohoused together. Necropsy was performed on mice to obtain fresh explanted KPC and KPCT tumors which were collected at the endpoint. Mice were euthanized with CO2. Immediately, euthanized mice were placed in dorsal recumbency on a clean dissection board or similar surface. Two sets, or more as required, of sterile scissors and forceps were used during the necropsy; one set for outer skin and the other for tissue harvesting to minimize tissue contamination.",
    "Using a (feather blade/scalpel), cut a small block from the agarose gel, slightly larger than the tumor, and adhere the agarose to the specimen disk of the vibratome stage using Loctite superglue. Glue the tumor directly in front of the agarose block, which serves as a support for the tumor during slicing. Once the glue dries, fill the tray with ice-cold sterile PBS.\nNote: The purpose of the agarose is to serve as a support for the tumor when slicing. This may be replaced with another material that provides equivalent support and does not interfere with viability or imaging. Optimal conditions and parameters will vary based on tissue type and/or disease stage.\nSection the tumor at a 300–350 μm thickness with the vibratome speed set on a 3 mm/s and the vibration frequency set on 8 mm.\nNote: Slice thickness, speed and vibration frequency will require optimization based on the machine, experimental set up and tissue type and/or disease stage.\nWhile sectioning, carefully transfer each slice with fine forceps to a conical tube or culture plate containing fresh sterile ice-cold PBS with 10 μg/mL STI and 1× P/S for transport.\nNote: Both the first couple of slices and the adhered bottom portion of the tumor should be discarded.\nAfter sectioning, prepare culture inserts by adding 1.1 mL or 400 μL, of warm RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS, 14.5 mM Hepes, 1× P/S, 5 μg/mL Plasmocin and 10 μg/mL STI, outside of the 6-well and 24-well plate inserts, respectively.\nTransfer slices to prepared organotypic culture inserts. Ensure slices lay flat and do not overlap to ensure optimal nutrient and gas exchange. While multiple slices may be transferred to a 6-well plate organotypic culture insert, single slices are recommended for a 24-well insert (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",

    "Note: The number of slices cultured in either a 24 or 6-well insert is a recommendation as this may vary depending on the type of tissue and size of isolated organ.\nOverlay explanted tissue with 100 μL or 50 μL of RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS, 14.5 mM Hepes, 1× P/S, 5 μg/mL Plasmocin and 10 μg/mL STI on the 6-well and 24-well inserts, respectively.\nCulture slices at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator and either use immediately or within 4 days to ensure viability and integrity. Replace media both above and below insert daily.\nTime-lapse imaging and analysis of T cell migration on tumor slices\nTiming: 3 h\nT cells, surrounding collagen architectures and carcinoma cells, if applicable, were visualized using combined multiphoton excitation and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging on a custom-built multi-photon laser scanning microscope7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] at an excitation wavelength of 880 nm. Set up two-photon time-lapse imaging according to the previous published protocol8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] with slight modifications. This section can be prepared before the previous section to have the system ready for imaging.\nCut a square piece of parafilm, larger than a 35 mm dish, and cut a smaller circular hold in the middle, smaller than the diameter of the objective, using a scalpel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAttach paper tape on all four corners of parafilm and place, like a collar, on the objective so that the lens is through the smaller hole.\nWrap the objective with bubble wrap tightly, and above the parafilm, to act as insulation.\nPlace O-ring around the 35-mm dish containing prewarmed sterile PBS and then place onto the heating element on the microscope stage and lower the objective to the water.",
    "Note: This setup does not have a controlled environment. Therefore, careful adjustment and monitoring of temperature is key to achieve optimal conditions for imaging.\nMake a seal with the parafilm around the 35-mm dish and attach the parafilm to the stage. Let the system equilibrate for at least 2 h before imaging.\nNote: Allowing the setup to equilibrate will greatly reduce imaging drift. Also, for time optimization, tissue samples, T cell labeling and plating can be prepared during the equilibration time (refer to step 27–34).\nOnce the sample is ready, from the following section, replace the dish with the sample, lower objective and focus on the tissue and reseal the system to maintain an even temperature.\nFind positions of interest within the tumor slice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) by visualizing CD8+ T cells and KPC tumor tissue, or tdTomato+ carcinoma cells in KPCT tumor slices, using multiphoton fluorescence (emission: green and red, respectively) and collagen by SHG (emission: blue) at 880-nm two-photon excitation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). For T cell migration in 3-D, images were taken at 1.5 min intervals with a total imaging duration of at least 45 min, and up to 2–3 h, since T cell migrate rapidly causing cells to potentially move out of the field of view. Images are acquired at 5-μm step size in a 75-μm-deep z section (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D) and quantitative analysis of migration can be performed (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F; and see section on post processing and cell tracking of migration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.1]).",
    "Note: Color scheme will vary depending on the settings of the microscope used as well as the different labeling techniques (e.g. T cells labeled with CellTracker Green, KPC tissue labeled with CellTracker Red, unlabeled KPCT tissue which have endogenous tdTomato+ carcinoma cells, and unlabeled collagen which can be visualized through SHG from the two-photon microscopy).\nT cell labeling and plating on murine PDA slices\nTiming: 2 h\nPrepare KPC tumor slices by staining the tissue with 5 μM CellTracker Red CMTPX for 15–20 min. Rinse tissue in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS, 14.5 mM Hepes, 1× P/S, 5 μg/mL Plasmocin and 10 μg/mL STI. This step may be omitted if using KPCT or equivalently tagged/labeled tumor slices since tdTomato+ carcinoma cells can be visualized.\nCollect and count cultured T cells, harvesting at least 2.0 × 105 viable cells to a microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge and resuspend in L-15 media with 1% FBS to increase binding and thus intensity of CellTracker dye.\nNote: Dyeing is optimal in low FBS concentrations. Uptake is significantly lower at higher FBS concentrations.\nAdd at 1:1 ratio of 2 μM stock CellTracker Green CMFDA, yielding a final concentration of 1 μM CellTracker dye.\nIncubate cell suspension in a water bath at 37°C for 5 min. Wash suspension twice with L-15 media with 10% FBS by spinning down at 300g for 5 min.\nUsing fine forceps, transfer individual slices to 24-well organotypic culture inserts in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Ensure the tumor side facing upwards remains the same as before.",
    "Resuspend stained T cells in a total volume of 100 μL of L-15 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× P/S, 5 μg/mL Plasmocin and 10 μg/mL STI. Overlay T cells onto the tumor slice and incubate at 37°C in a 0% CO2 humidified incubator for 1 h. Note, this is 0% as L-15 media supports cell culture in environments without added CO2.\nWith fine forceps, rinse the tumor slice by gently dipping the tissue into warm media to remove T cells which did not adhere and transfer to a 35-mm tissue culture plate.\nCritical: Consistent slice orientation is crucial. Ensure side with overlaid T cells is always placed upward.\nCritical: Handle slices minimally and only at the edges to minimize tissue damages prior to imaging.\nPlace a slice anchor (tissue harp) gently on top of the tissue to hold it in place (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Overlay with 5 mL of L-15 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× P/S, 5 μg/mL Plasmocin and 10 μg/mL STI. Place on the two-photon microscope stage and proceed with time-lapse imaging."
