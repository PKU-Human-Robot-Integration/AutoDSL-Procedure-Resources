    "The following protocol was approved (REF. 3057) and follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committee of Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición SZ. Furthermore, prior consent was obtained from the patients for this study.\nNOTE: This procedure is to be used for measuring bioelectrical impedance analysis using tetrapolar multi-frequency equipment (see Table of Materials) and will provide accurate resistance and reactance values at a single frequency of 50 kHz, as well as the ratio between 200 kHz and 5 kHz impedance values (200/5 kHz).\n1. Before testing\nPerform standardization of the person who will perform the measurements, as someone with a qualification in the area or who has extensive experience in making measurements.\nAsk the patient to refrain from eating for 4 to 5 h before testing.\nPeriodically test the equipment to verify the impedance measurement are as accurate as possible, according to the guidelines provided by the manufacturer, using a test resistor with a known value of 500 Ω (range 496-503 Ω). Make sure the adhesive electrodes correspond to the manufacturer's recommendation.\nClean the equipment using a chlorhexidine wipe, and then wash your hands. If the screen of the equipment shows the legend: change the battery, then replace the battery.\nIf the patient is conscious, explain the procedure to them. Obtain the age and accurate measurement of the patient's height (in cm) and introduce these data into the equipment.",
    "Remove the shoe and sock from the right foot, as well as any metal objects, such as watches or bracelets worn by the patient. Place the patient in a supine position for 5 min with legs and arms spread out around 45° before taking the measurements, verifying that they are not in contact with any other part of their body. In patients with obesity, in order to avoid contact between the thighs, place a sheet between their legs.\n2. Measurement of BIA parameters\nClean the surfaces where the electrodes will be placed with a 70% alcohol pad twice. Place two electrodes on the right hand dorsally, one behind the knuckle of the third metacarpophalangeal (middle finger) and the other on the wrist, next to the ulna head carpal joint. It might be helpful to draw an imaginary straight line between the protruding bones on the wrist, and then place each electrode in the center of that line.\nPlace two electrodes on the right foot, one behind the third metatarsophalangeal joint and the tarsal joint on the ankle between the medial and lateral malleoli. To place the electrodes, follow the bones underneath. Ensure that the distance between the electrodes on the foot and hand is at least 5 to 10 cm, according to the size of the hand.\nConnect the lead wires to the equipment, with the red alligator clip nearest to the nails and the black clip nearest to the ankle or wrist; ensure that the wires do not cross between them.\nEnsure that the patient is not talking or moving during the measurements, as this will affect the results.",
    "The patient's ID will come up on the first screen. Scroll through and change the patient's parameters (sex, age, height, and weight). Ensure that the electrodes are stuck down correctly, and press Enter. It will show: measuring, on the screen. It takes about 6 to 10 s to measure, and a beep will sound when the measurement is complete.\n3. Analysis of bioimpedance parameters\nThe equipment will display the raw impedance values (Z) at four different frequencies: 5, 50, 100, and 200 kHz, as well as the resistance and reactance at 50 kHz, which are the values needed to classify a patient with fluid overload.\nDownload the software named BIVA tolerance R-Xc graph13 (see Table of Materials) and open it.\nObserve that the software is in a workbook in a spreadsheet program with seven worksheets: guide, reference populations, point graph, path, subjects, Z-score, Z-graph.\nRight click on the Reference Population sheet, choose the line of the selected reference population, and copy and paste it into the second row (yellow row).\nRight click on the Subjects sheet and, in the second row, insert the following data: the subject ID assigned to the patient. In the second column named Seq, always put the number 1; and optionally fill out the surname and name columns. In the sex column, enter F for female patient and M for male patient. In the next two columns, input resistance and reactance at 50 kHz each. Insert the height (in cm) and weight (in kg) in the next two columns.",
    "In the Popul Code column, insert the number that appears in the first column of the reference population sheet. In group code, randomly chose a number between 1 and 10 (this number will be required in the Point graph sheet), insert the patient's age in the next column.\nIn the spreadsheet program menu, go to the Complements tab and right-click on the Calculate option to obtain the values of resistance and reactance adjusted by height and phase angle.\nRight-click on the Point Graph sheet, and observe that 50%, 75%, and 95% tolerance ellipses are drawn for the selected reference population (i.e., the population in the first yellow row at the top of the reference population sheet).\nIn the dialog box, select groups, right-click on the number placed in the group code located in the subjects' sheet, and right-click on OK. Next, the BIVA graph will appear, with the subject vector as a geometric figure (Δ, •, □).\nPatients with vectors that fall outside the lower pole of the 75% tolerance ellipse will be classified as fluid overload (see Figure 1).\nDivide Z at 200 kHz by Z at 5 kHz-which reflects the total body water and extracellular water compartment, respectively-in order to obtain the impedance ratio (Imp-R). A value ≥0.85 indicates fluid overload.\n\tNOTE: In new tetrapolar multi-frequency devices, the R-Xc graph is already included; however, it is important to ensure that the reference population is correct.\nSubscription Required.
