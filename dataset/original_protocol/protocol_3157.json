    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPre-treatment of animals with cyclosporine\nTiming: 5 min\nImmunosuppression is vital for xenograft transplantation in immunocompetent animals, as they suppress the host’s immune response and prevent graft rejection. Cyclosporine A enhances transplant success by inhibiting T-cell activation and interleukin-2 production.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nNote: An alternative to Cyclosporine A immunosuppression of immunocompetent host animals is the use of immunodeficient animals such as nude rats.\nCritical: Daily Cyclosporine injection must begin at least 2 days prior to transplantation surgery.\nAdminister intraperitoneal injections of Cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg).\nIdentify the right or left lower quadrant of the rat’s abdomen to avoid puncturing internal organs such as the cecum and bladder. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2927-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Diagrams illustrating pre-procedural steps such as intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections as well as shaving and preparation of the cranial surgical site\nClean the injection site with a 70% isopropyl alcohol pad.\nHold the syringe at a 20°–30° angle to the rat’s body (supine position), with the bevel of the needle facing up.\nQuickly and smoothly insert the needle into the peritoneal cavity, taking care not to insert it too deeply.\nAspirate gently to ensure that no blood, urine, or fecal matter is drawn into the syringe, which would indicate that an organ or blood vessel has been punctured.\nSlowly inject the solution and withdraw the needle.\nContinue performing cyclosporine A injections daily until the designated experimental time point for animal sacrifice.\nNote: Cyclosporine A is stored at room temperature at a stock concentration of 50 mg/mL, which is diluted 1:10 to achieve a working concentration of 5 mg/mL immediately before use.\nOrganoid incubation with Necrostatin-1\nTiming: 24 h",
    "To mitigate post-transplantation cell death due to necroptosis, incubate the organoids in Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) for 24 h immediately before transplantation. Nec-1 is a specific inhibitor of the kinase domain of receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1).7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nWe advise transplanting only organoids that have sharp borders suggesting a healthy neuroepithelium and no apparent cysts. We have successfully transplanted organoids at the ages of 20–80 days. For more details on organoid generation, please refer to our previously published study.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nPrepare Nec-1 solution.\nPrepare 5 mL of Nec-1 working solution (20 μg/mL), dilute 5 μL of 20 mg/mL Nec-1 stock solution in 5 mL of organoid maturation medium.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nVortex the solution briefly.\nTransfer the organoid into the Nec-1 solution.\nCut the tip off a P200 pipette tip using a sterile scalpel blade so that an organoid can fit within the tip without any physical contact with the tip itself.\nUse this cut pipette tip to transfer organoids to a 6-well plate (1 organoid per well).\nNote: This process is performed under sterile conditions.\nAdd 5 mL of Nec-1 working solution per well,\nPlace the plate on an orbital shaker until the organoids are ready for transplantation.\nThe next day, move the plate with organoids to an intermediary incubator in the surgical suite.\nNote: This step minimizes traffic between the surgical suite and the cell culture room and decreases the risk of culture contamination.\nAnimal preparation\nThis step encompasses anesthesia induction, all necessary pre-procedural medications, animal positioning in the stereotaxic frame, and sterilization of the surgical site. Anesthesia setup for major rodent surgeries typically involves a multi-stage process to ensure the comfort and safety of the animal. After the animal is initially anesthestized, a stable level of anesthesia is maintained for all subsequent steps of the surgical procedure.\nAnesthesia induction and maintenance\nTiming: 7–9 min",
    "Note: Anesthesia procedures are performed in three main areas: the induction chamber, animal preparation area, and stereotaxic frame. The induction chamber and stereotaxic frame are connected to an Isoflurane vaporizer machine (e.g., EZ-190 Auto Flow Anesthesia Machine).\nDetermine the weight of the animal.\nPlace the animal into an anesthesia induction chamber.\nInitiate isoflurane flow at 5% and turn the oxygen flow meter to 1 L/min.\nWait 5 min for anesthesia induction.\nAll medications to be administered can be prepared at this stage.\nNote: The induction chamber is used to introduce the rodent to an anesthetic agent, commonly an inhalant anesthetic such as isoflurane, in a controlled environment. The chamber is a sealed, transparent container connected to an anesthesia machine, which delivers the anesthetic gas mixed with oxygen.\nTransfer the animal to the surgical preparation area.\nPlace the anesthesia device nose cone over the animal’s nose to keep the animal anesthetized for the duration of this procedure.\nDecrease isoflurane concentration to 4%.\nApply ointment to both eyes.\nPre-procedural medication administration and surgical site preparation\nTiming: 5 min\nAdminister intraperitoneal injections of Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) and Cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg) as described in Step 1.\nAdminister Meloxicam subcutaneously (SQ, 2 mg/kg). The injection site is on the animal’s upper back, near its scapula (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nRemove fur from the cranial surgical site using a hair clipper. It is advisable to shave the majority of the scalp surface.\nInitiate isoflurane and oxygen flow to the stereotaxic frame nose cone and wait 20–30 s for the gas to reach the nose cone before proceeding to the next step.\nPositioning the animal in the stereotaxic frame\nTiming: 5 min",
    "Critical: After placement in stereotactic frame, anesthesia is maintained via a nose cone connected to the anesthesia machine, with continuous monitoring of vital signs, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.\nCarefully place the anesthetized rat in the prone position on the stereotaxic frame’s platform (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2927-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Rat head fixation in a stereotaxic frame\nThe animal is fixed in place using ear bars and a bite bar with the nose securely positioned within the nose cone to maintain stable anesthesia.\nEnsure the rat’s incisors engage with the bite bar to support the head.\nUse a cotton swab to ensure the bottom teeth and tongue are below the bite bar and do not obstruct the airway.\nSlide the nose cone over the rat’s mouth, ensuring the nose cone covers the jaw.\nPosition the left ear bar into the rat’s ear canal. Avoid penetration of the eardrum.\nPosition the right ear bar inside the other ear canal, following the same principles as the previous step.\nEnsure the ear bars are centered.\nDecrease the Isoflurane concentration to 2.5% by adjusting the flow rate on the isoflurane regulator.\nSterilize the incision area.\nClean the area using a 70% isopropyl alcohol pad, followed by a betadine pad. Repeat the process three times using a fresh pad each time.\nNote: Clean from the center of the incision site outwards in a circular motion\nIncision and skull exposure\nTiming: 10 min\nPut on sterile gloves.\nCheck the animal’s toe-pinch reflex.\nNote: Use sterile gauze to touch non-sterile surfaces\nPerform a midline scalp incision using a scalpel.\nGently push connective tissue laterally on both sides of the skull using sterile cotton swabs.\nRetract the scalp with Bulldog Serrefines.\nCut the full perimeter of the exposed connective tissue using a scalpel.",
    "Use a Bovie cautery device to stop any bleeding.\nClean the exposed bone by rinsing it with saline. Remove the saline and dry the area using vacuum suction and sterile cotton Q-tips.\nGently scrape the exposed bone with a scalpel to improve the adhesion of bone cement in later steps.\nGentle abrasion of the outer cortex of the skull should be performed using a scalpel blade with care to apply only light pressure.\nCraniectomy\nTiming: 15 min\nCraniectomy is a surgical procedure in which a portion of the skull is removed to expose the underlying brain.\nMark the points of reference using a hand drill.\nNote: The drill is used to make marks on the bone to preserve the sterility of the area. A newly opened sterile skin marker can be used as well.\nUse a drill to mark bregma on the bone surface lightly.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2927-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Skull exposure\nTo expose the skull before craniectomy, adipose tissue, and the underlying periosteum are removed.\n(A) The craniectomy site is marked using a caliper by scratching the surface of the skull. The figure shows the skull with an etched circle that is 5 mm in diameter. Black dot: bregma. The black triangle is the center of the circular craniectomy (5 mm posterior to bregma, 2.5 mm lateral from midline).\n(B) A drill has been used to create a trough along the etched circle in A. Only a very thin layer of flexible bone remains, which allows the bone flap to be peeled off. (C) The bone is carefully removed with curved tweezers revealing the underlying dura and brain.\nNote: Bregma is the point where the coronal suture intersects with the sagittal suture (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "Identify and mark with the drill the point along the midline corresponding to the craniectomy’s anterior-posterior center (5 mm posterior to bregma to target visual cortex).\nNote: This mark and bregma will serve as guide points for the craniectomy.\nMark the center of the circular craniectomy with the drill (2.5 mm lateral to the midline, 5 mm posterior to bregma).\nEtch the craniectomy circumference using the sharp edge of a sterile caliper (2.5 mm in radius).\nMark the circumference of the craniectomy with the drill, ensuring the previously etched mark remains the outermost boundary of the craniectomy.\nDrill the craniectomy perimeter.\nRemove the bone uniformly along the trough made by the drill and avoid excessive force that may cause the drill to plunge through the skull and damage the underlying brain.\nNote: As drilling proceeds, the remaining bone will become softer as it thins.\nDo not drill completely through the skull; thin the bone at the craniectomy perimeter until the bone flap moves vertically as you apply gentle pressure.\nNote: Minimize drill usage when the bone flap is mobile to reduce potential trauma to the underlying brain.\nCarefully remove the circular bone fragment.\nWhen the bone flap is adequately thinned, use fine forceps to remove it, exposing the dura and brain beneath.\nThe use of two pairs of curved, serrated tweezers can facilitate the lifting of the flap in a uniform manner.\nNote: Ensure that the bone flap edges do not sink into the brain when it is being removed, which can cause brain swelling.\nClean the craniectomy defect edge.\nUse a bone curette to remove any residual bone on the edge of the craniectomy defect.\nEnsure no residual bone is visible before proceeding to the next step.",
    "Critical: Removal of the bone flap in a manner that minimizes swelling of the underlying brain can improve transplantation outcomes.\nDurotomy\nTiming: 10–20 min\nModify a 32G needle by creating a right-angle bend at the tip of a 32G needle.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2927-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Durotomy\n(A) To create a hook for opening the dura, the tip of a 32G needle has been bent slightly in the opposite direction of the bevel. The round inset shows a graphical representation of the bent needle tip.\n(B) After the initial durotomy, the needle is cautiously inserted between the brain and the dura, with the bevel facing the brain. The needle is then moved horizontally to expand the opening of the durotomy in a linear fashion.\n(C) Graphical representation of the durotomy procedure. The asterisk represents the initial tear of the dura with the bent needle. The dashed line shows the linear durotomy made by the needle, and the arrows show how tweezers are used to open the dura further.\nNote: The needle can be gently tapped against a hard, sterile surface to create the bend (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nUse the modified needle to create a small opening in the dura by brushing the bent tip delicately against the dural surface.\nThe tip should catch against the dura, and gentle pulling of the needle should result in a small tear in the dura. A position where the initial tear is made is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B by an asterisk.\nWiden the dural opening (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B dashed line) by carefully inserting the right-angle bend of the needle between the brain and dura through the previously made dural tear.\nThe bend of the needle should tent up the dura, and the bevel of the needle should face the brain.",
    "Once the needle tip is in position, slide it against the dura horizontally to cut the dura and further enlarge the durotomy. This should result in a long, linear dural opening.\nFurther expand the dural opening to widely expose the brain using straight tweezers to tear the dura to the edges of the craniectomy defect. The arrows show the direction of tears using tweezers in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nThroughout the procedure, intermittently apply saline to the exposed brain to prevent desiccation.\nNote: Initial tear can be started anywhere at the craniectomy site. It is safest to initiate it away from the blood vessels. Do not open the dura medially; blood vessels tend to stick to the dura in that area; opening the dura will inadvertently lead to profuse bleeding in the area, which will be difficult to stop.\nAspiration\nTiming: 15 min\nUse a 2.5 mm sterile disposable biopsy punch to punch out 4–6 pieces of Gelfoam.\nIdentify an area close to the center of the craniectomy that avoids disruption of large blood vessels.\nAttach a sterile 200 μL pipette tip to tubing that is hooked up to a vacuum system. The pipette tip will act as the aspiration instrument to remove brain tissue.\nStart aspirating brain tissue to create a 2–2.5 mm cavity in diameter, depending on the size of the organoid (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2927-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Aspiration cavity\nA cortical cavity is created using vacuum aspiration.\nNote: The cavity should be just larger than the organoid so that manipulation of the brain and/or organoid is not needed for subsequent transplantation, and there is no excess space in the cavity.\nStarting at the perimeter of the intended aspiration cavity, move the pipette tip in a spiral motion toward the center of the cavity.",
    "Remove the tissue at a uniform depth within the cavity to improve visualization.\nPerform multiple “outside-in” spiral motions at progressively deeper depths.\nAspirate the entire thickness of the cortex until the corpus callosum is identified.\nNote: Typically, the corpus callosum has a whiter appearance than cortical tissue.\nAfter the cavity is made, irrigate it with saline for a few seconds before placing a piece of Gelfoam in the cavity to promote hemostasis.\nRemove the Gelfoam after 1–2 min and reassess the state of hemostasis.\nExchange pieces of Gelfoam in the cavity with a 1–2 min wait after each fresh piece of Gelfoam until complete hemostasis is achieved.\nNote: Gentle pressure on the Gelfoam with a cotton swab can help promote hemostasis. Patience is key to obtaining adequate hemostasis.\nOnce hemostasis has been achieved, fill the cavity with saline.\nTransplantation\nTiming: 15–20 min\nTake the well plate with organoid out of the incubator.\nAdd sterile saline to an empty well. Add 1–2 mL of saline, depending on the well plate used.\nUse a cut P200 pipette tip (see above) to transfer the organoid into a well with saline to wash off the media.\nTransfer the organoid into the cortical aspiration cavity using the same cut pipette tip (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2927-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Insertion of forebrain organoid intro injury cavity\n(A) Close-up view of an organoid graft after it has been placed in the cortical aspiration cavity.\n(B) Lower magnification view of the transplanted organoid with the PDMS cranioplasty inserted.\nCritical: Make sure there is no evidence of any bleeding within the aspiration cavity before transferring the organoids. Hemostasis should be obtained using the steps described above if new bleeding is identified.\nGently remove excess fluid from the brain surface and skull. This step is necessary to increase organoid-to-host tissue adhesion.",
    "Do not bring the vacuum aspirator near the transplanted organoid to prevent inadvertent damage to the organoid.\nPlace a piece of Gelfoam (pre-soaked but relatively dry) near the organoid to remove fluid near the organoid graft. Repeat this step as necessary to remove as much excess fluid as possible.\nCritical: Do not touch Gelfoam directly to the organoid as it might stick to the organoid and will be impossible to separate.\nReapply saline very slowly not to displace the organoid from the injury cavity.\nCranioplasty\nTiming: 20–30 min\nPunch out a 5 mm diameter piece of PDMS from the PDMS prepared earlier using a sterile tissue punch.\nTransfer the PDMS piece into the craniectomy defect (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nNote: It will act as a replacement for the piece of skull that was previously removed. Careful attention to creating a circular craniectomy previously should ensure that the PDMS fits well and does not pop out.\nOnce the PDMS cranioplasty is in place, apply a layer of bone cement on top of the PDMS as well as the surrounding skull (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2927-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Bone cement application and incision closure\n(A) Bone cement is applied over the PDMS cranioplasty.\n(B) Using interrupted knots, the skin is approximated evenly.\nAllow the bone cement to dry for 10–15 min.\nOnce the bone cement is dry, irrigate the surgical site with saline.\nClose the incision with a silk suture by making 7–8 simple interrupted knots (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nPostoperative care\nTiming: Varies depending on the length of the study\nAfter the surgery, proper care and monitoring of the animals are crucial to ensure their recovery and maintain experimental integrity. The following steps provide an outline for postoperative care and analysis of the brain samples.",
    "Place the animal in a recovery chamber with a heating pad set to 37°C.\nMonitor the animal’s breathing and responsiveness. Ensure that the animal is recovering from anesthesia and regaining consciousness.\nReturn the animal to the facility only after the animal is fully recovered from anesthesia.\nMonitor the animal daily for signs of discomfort or infection. Check the surgical site for redness, swelling, or discharge.\nInject Meloxicam SQ (2 mg/kg) daily for two days after the procedure.\nRemove the sutures 7–10 days after the procedure.\nBrain extraction and gross organoid visualization\nTiming: 20–30 min\nAnimal euthanasia and transcardiac perfusion9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] are performed using standard, widely-available protocols. However, a more specific aspect of our tissue processing protocol is making sure the organoid is not caught in connective tissue during extraction, which might cause the organoid to be inadvertently removed from the host brain. Additionally, we use a UV light to visualize GFP+ organoid survival on gross inspection. Details of this process are provided below.\nAfter standard transcardiac perfusion of the animal with 4% paraformaldehyde, open the prior incision with a scalpel and expose the skull and bone cement as detailed above.\nUse a scalpel to carefully remove the connective tissue layer without removing the PDMS or organoid.\nVisualize and remove the PDMS from the craniectomy site.\nIf there is scar tissue, cut around it and leave it on the brain as it might be attached to the organoid.\nConfirm the presence of a GFP+ organoid graft using UV light (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2927-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Organoid visualization after animal sacrifice\n(A) The GFP-expressing organoid graft can be visualized in situ before brain extraction via illumination with ultraviolet light. Anterior is designated with the arrow.\n(B) This micrograph shows a coronal brain section with the GFP-positive organoid (scale = 1 mm).",
    "Make a small hole in the skull anterior to the brain using scissors.\nUsing that hole, crack open the skull with the rongeur’s bone cutters.\nTake off the skull piece-by-piece without damaging the brain, starting contralateral to the organoid.\nTake extra precaution when removing bone around the organoid, as dura may be attached to the organoid.\nExtract the brain gently.\nPlace the brain into a 50 mL conical tube filled with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and place it in a cold room (+4°C) for 24 h.\nTransfer the brain to 30% sucrose solution in a 50 mL conical tube until the brain is quenched and sinks to the bottom of the conical tube.\nProceed with standard freezing and staining protocols."
