    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFever-range whole-body hyperthermia treatment of mice\nTiming: 6–7 h\nC57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mL sterile 0.9% saline.\nNote: The procedure is to avoid dehydration during WBH treatment. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nMice were divided into two groups randomly. One was treated with fever-range WBH (core temperature 39.5 ± 0.5°C) by being placed in an environmental chamber pre-set at 38.8°C for 6 h. The other normothermia (NT) control mice (core temperature 36.8 ± 0.2°C) were maintained at 22°C for the experimental period (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/900-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. NT and WBH treatment of mice\nThe environmental chambers were pre-set at 22°C or 38.8°C. Mice were placed in the chambers for 6 h to keep the core temperature 36.8 ± 0.2°C or 39.5 ± 0.5°C.\nT-cell isolation from mouse spleen\nTiming: 30 min\nAdapted from the manufacturer's protocol, please refer to https://www.stemcell.com/easysep-mouse-t-cell-isolation-kit.html[href=https://www.stemcell.com/easysep-mouse-t-cell-isolation-kit.html].\nWBH or normothermia treated mice were sacrificed by CO2.\nDisrupt spleen in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Remove aggregates and debris by passing cell suspension through a 70 μm mesh nylon strainer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min and resuspend at 1 × 108 nucleated cells/mL in 1 mL PBS in 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 50 μL Rat Serum to sample and transfer sample to a 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube.\nAdd 50 μL Isolation Cocktail to sample. Mix and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nAdd 75 μL RapidSpheresTM to sample. Mix and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 2.5 min.\nNote: Vortex RapidSpheresTM for 30 s before adding to sample to make sure particles appear evenly dispersed.\nAdd 1.5 mL PBS to top up the sample. Mix by gently pipetting up and down 2–3 times.\nPlace the tube into the magnet and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 2.5 min.",
    "Pick up the magnet, and in one continuous motion invert the magnet and tube, pouring the enriched cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCritical: Leave the magnet and tube inverted for 2–3 s, then return upright. Do not shake or blot off any drops that may remain hanging from the mouth of the tube.\nFlow chamber assay\nTiming: 4–5 h\nA polystyrene petri dish was coated with a 5 mm diameter, 20 μL spot of 5 μg/mL mouse VCAM-1-Fc or MAdCAM-1-Fc in coating buffer for 1 h at 37°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/900-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flow chamber system\n(A) Mouse VCAM-1-Fc or MAdCAM-1-Fc was coated on a polystyrene petri dish for 1 h at 37°C.\n(B) A silicon rubber gasket was covered on the coated protein on polystyrene petri dish.\n(C) Photograph of flow chamber system. Cells were diluted in buffer A containing 1 mM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+ immediately before infusion into the flow chamber at a consistent shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 for 1 min using a programmable syringe pump.\n(D) Schematic diagram of flow chamber system.\n(E) Devices for flow chamber system. 1. Flow chamber deck; 2. Programmable syringe pump; 3. Cells in 1.5 mL centrifuge tube; 4. Vacuum pump; 5. Computer used for recording the videos of cell adhesive behavior using StreamPix III software.\nNote: To study cell adhesion ability of other cell types, the concentration of mouse VCAM-1-Fc or MAdCAM-1-Fc could range from 2 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nThe spot was washed with blocking buffer and coated with 20 μL blocking buffer for 1 h at 37°C to block non-specific binding sites.\nAspirate off blocking buffer, add cover the coated protein on polystyrene petri dish with a silicon rubber gasket (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Cover the gasket with a flow chamber deck and assemble flow system apparatus connecting inlet, outlet, and vacuum lines to the deck. Fill system with media and remove all air from system (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C–2E).\nPause point: The flow chamber system was set up and could be operated after the cell samples were prepared.\nIsolated T cells were washed twice using washing buffer to eliminate free metal ions and collected by centrifugation at 750 × g for 7 min.\nNote: To guarantee the better status of isolated T cells, steps 12 to 15 could be carried out during fever-range whole-body hyperthermia treatment of mice and T cell isolation. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCells were washed twice using buffer A to clear away EDTA in washing buffer and collected by centrifugation at 750 × g for 7 min.\nCells were diluted to 1 × 106/mL in buffer A containing 1 mM Ca2+ + Mg2+ immediately before infusion in the flow chamber.\nCells were infused into flow chamber at a consistent shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 for 1 min by a syringe pump (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). The adhesive behavior was monitored by digital cameras. The videos were analyzed by Image-Pro Plus.\nNote: α4β7–VCAM-1 binding was disrupted by pre-treating the cells with 10 μg/mL α4β7 blocking antibody DATK32 when examining α4β1-mediated cell adhesion on VCAM-1 substrate. The affinity of VCAM-1 to integrin α4β1 and MAdCAM-1 to integrin α4β7 should be tested in advance. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]. If there are too many non-specific T cells to the surface of the polystyrene petri dish, the chamber could be washed with 1–2 mL washing buffer by the syringe pump. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Note: The motion of each adherent cell was monitored for 10 s following the initial adhesion point, and two categories of cell adhesion (rolling and firm adhesion) were defined. Adhesion was defined as rolling adhesion if the adherent cells were followed by rolling motions ≥ 5 s with a velocity of at least 1 μm/s; a firmly adherent cell was defined as a cell that remained adherent and stationary for at least 10 s.\nChemokine-induced transwell migration\nTiming: 5–6 h\nBoth sides of transwell chambers were coated with 5 μg/mL mouse VCAM-1-Fc or MAdCAM-1-Fc.\nT cells (2 × 106/mL in 150 μL RPMI 1640 medium) were added to the upper chamber and the lower chamber was filled with 600 μL RPMI 1640 medium with CCL21 (500 ng/mL).\nAfter incubation at 37°C for 4 h at 37°C in 5% CO2, cells remaining on the upper surface of the chamber were scraped with a cotton swab, and cells having migrated to the bottom surface were fixed with 2 % formaldehyde at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nCells were stained with DAPI at 20°C–25°C for 10 min and enumerated by fluorescence microscope.\nAlternatives: Cells having migrated to the bottom surface could also be stained with 0.5 % Crystal Violet and enumerated by microscope.\nNote: α4β7–VCAM-1 binding was disrupted by pre-treating the cells with 10 μg/mL α4β7 blocking antibody DATK32 when examining α4β1-mediated cell transmigration across VCAM-1 substrate."
