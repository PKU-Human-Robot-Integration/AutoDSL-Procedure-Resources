    "PreparationCut the Glass Pasteur Pipettes (Figure 1e) to a small curved (Figure 1f) and a large (Figure 1g) pipette with a diamond pen (Figure 1d). Polish the terminal with an ethanol flame to smooth the edge. Coat pipettes with undiluted horse serum.Coat two 6-cm cell culture dishes (2 ml for each dish) and a 24-well plate (400 μl for each well) with undiluted horse serum until the entire bottom of plates was covered, followed with incubation for 1 min under a cell culture hood, and then transfer the horse serum back to the original tube and store in a 4 °C fridge. Uncover the plates and air-dry under a cell culture hood for 1 h.Cover the plates and keep them at room temperature. It is better to coat the plate on the same day of the experiment. Set the temperature of a water bath to 37 °C.Prepare washing media (following Recipe 1 and then keep it in a 37 °C water bath). In general, 50 ml washing media is enough for up to 200 myofiber isolation from one EDL muscle.Prepare collagenase solution (following Recipe 2 and then keep it in a 37 °C water bath). Each EDL requires ~1 ml dilated collagenase solution (final concentration: 0.2% w/v) in a 15 ml tube.Thaw the 4% paraformaldehyde (following Recipe 3).Plug in the heating pad.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715024054_9895.jpgFigure 1.

    "This video was made at Guangdong Institute of Microbiology according to guidelines from the Guangdong Institute of Microbiology on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology under protocol [GT-IACUC201704071].Anesthetize the experimental mice with CO2.Cut the skin below the ankle.Cut through the skin along the inner leg.Expose the muscle fascia and patella by pulling the skin up (Figure 2A).Tore the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle fascia with a tweezer.Tear off vastus lateralis over the knee, expose and cut off the origin of TA and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (Figure 2B).Separate the tendon of TA muscle using a tweezer along the inner margin of the shank. Snip the tendons with the fine scissor (Figure 2C). Gently pull it up to separate the TA muscle from the bone and expose the entire EDL muscle (Figure 2D).Cut the tendon of EDL muscle by snipping two-thirds of the lower ankle, Use one tip of the forceps to separate EDL muscle gently (Figure 2E).Place the EDL muscle in a 15 ml tube with the prewarmed collagenase solution and place it in a 37 °C water bath to incubate for 60 to 80 min until myofibers are loose but not in crimped (it depends on the efficacy of collagenase and conditions of mice).Dissect the other EDL muscle following Steps B1-B9.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715024201_1585.jpgFigure 2.

    "org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Procedures to isolate myofiber from EDL muscle. This video was made at Guangdong Institute of Microbiology according to guidelines from the Guangdong Institute of Microbiology on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology under protocol GT-IACUC201704071.Transfer the digested EDL muscle to a horse serum coated 6-cm Petri dish with 5 ml prewarmed washing medium in it using the prepared big Glass Pasteur Pipette.Place the 6-cm Petri dish on the heating pad. Inhale an appropriate amount of solution from the dish. Hold the Petri dish with the right hand to adjust the position of dish. Flush the EDL muscle continuously to rotate it along its long pivots until myofibers are naturally released from EDL muscle.When a single muscle fiber is released, use a small bent glass Pasteur pipette to transfer it into a well of 24-well plate covered with 200 μl washing media. Repeat Steps C1 and C2 until the number of myofibers meets your requirement. It is recommended that the myofibers be collected within 1-h.Wash each well with 500 µl washing media three times before adding 500 µl culture media (following Recipe 4).Place the 24-well plate into a CO2 incubator at 37 °C.FixationWhen myofibers are cultured for 0/24/48/72-h or other different designated length of time, remove as much culture media as possible (leave the minimum amount of culture media to avoid myofibers’ exposure to the air).Fix myofibers with 500 μl 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature.Aspirate the fixation buffer, and add 500 μl 50 mM glycine to incubate for 10 min to quench the fixation at room temperature.Wash myofibers with PBS for 3 times at room temperature. The fixed myofibers can be stored in a 4 °C fridge for up to a week before immunostaining (Figure 3).",

Scale bars = 100 μm.ImmunostainingPermeabilize myofibers with Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) diluted in PBS for 10-min, followed by a 5-min wash in PBS for 3 times.Prepare blocking buffer as Recipe 5. Centrifuge the blocking buffer at 16,000 x g for 10 min in case there was any residue precipitate from goat serum. Incubate fibers with 400 μl blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature.Incubate with 200 μl blocking buffer containing primary antibodies of Pax7 (1:100) or MyoD (1:300) overnight at 4 °C.After night incubation with primary antibody, wash myofibers 3 times for 5-min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 to remove any unbound antibody.Incubate with 200 μl blocking buffer containing appropriate secondary antibody (1:500) for 1-h at room temperature protected from light.After 1-h incubation with secondary antibody, wash 3 times at 5 min per wash with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20.Transfer each fiber to a glass slide and drain the remaining liquid.Mount the glass slide with DAPI-containing mounting medium. Cover with a cover slide and dry the glass slide for at least 10 min before imaging.Observe myofibers under a fluorescent microscope and capture images of immunostained myofibers (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715024316_7582.jpgFigure 4.
