    "For this study, 16 female C57Bl6/J mice, 8-12 weeks in age, and a body weight of 20 to 25 g were used. The mice were housed under standard conditions and were fed with chow and water ad libitum. This study was performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Boston University. The open procedures described here were undertaken in a sterile condition.\n1. Xenograft model\nCell culture\n\t\nPrior to heterotopic subcutaneous implantation, grow MC-38 cells as a monolayer to 80% confluency.\nFollowing trypsinization and resuspension in 10% FBS-containing media, centrifuge cells at 277 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Then, resuspend the cells in serum-free media to a concentration of 1 x 104 MC-38 cells/µL serum-free media.\n\t\t\nFor trypsinization, culture the MC-38 cells until they reach a desired confluence (usually around 70%-80%) and then aspirate the culture medium from the Petri dish.\nAdd 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate the cells with trypsin for 1 min at 37 °C to allow detachment. Gently tap or shake the Petri dish to ensure even detachment.\nAdd a culture medium containing serum or a trypsin inhibitor to neutralize the activity and prevent further cell dissociation. Collect the detached cells along with the neutralized trypsin solution.\nFor resuspension, once the cells are detached through trypsinization, prepare them for transplantation or further experiments. Centrifuge the collected cell suspension at 277 x g to pellet the cells.\nCarefully remove the supernatant (liquid above the cell pellet). Add 9 mL of culture medium, buffer, or solution to the cell pellet to achieve the desired cell concentration for transplantation or experimentation.\nGently resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down or using a culture flask shaker. Avoid vigorous pipetting that could damage the cells.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the variant or cell line used, cells can be resuspended in a 1:1 ratio of solubilized basement membrane matrix and serum-free media to slow highly aggressive mouse cell growth and dissemination after implantation. All cell culture steps should be undertaken in a complete aseptic hood in a cell culture specifically allocated space and were tested for mycoplasma regularly.\nCount the cells with an automated cell counter as per the provided manual protocol.\nCell implantation\n\t\nRandomly assign eight mice to the experimental group, and eight mice to the control group as follows. In the control group, use mice with MC38 xenograft and perform IVC ligation with a polypropylene 5-0 suture. In the experimental group, use mice with MC38 xenograft and perform IVC ligation with a customized vascular clip.\nPlace the mouse in left lateral recumbency and shave the right side between the forelimbs and hindlimbs. Apply alcohol and iodine along the dorsal lumbar area to aseptically prepare the area for injection.\nInject 2 x 106 MC-38 cells prepared in 200 µL of medium subcutaneously in the flank, halfway between the animal's most distal rib and pelvic eminence using a 27G needle while holding the animal gently in the non-dominant hand.\nFollowing injection, inspect the animals carefully and put them back into the cage. The animals should be inspected for the followings; 1. Changes in behavior, activity levels, and overall mobility of the mice. Any significant changes could indicate discomfort or health issues. 2. The overall physical condition of the mice, including fur quality, grooming habits, and any visible signs of distress or abnormalities 3. Return to food consumption and water intake 4. Any changes in their activity level, posture, or interactions with cage mates. Lethargy or increased aggression could be signs of distress.\n2. Follow-up of tumor growth",
    "Monitor the animals on a bi-weekly basis for tumor growth trends for 3-4 weeks. Measure the tumors with a caliper and record the tumor dimensions.\n\t\nMeasure the tumors along their longest axis (L) and the axis perpendicular to the long axis (W). Calculate the tumor volume (V) using the equation L x (W2) = V. If the tumor size surpasses 20 mm in each dimension and or the tumor has evidence of ulceration, euthanize the animals before the termination of the experiment.\nOnce the tumor volume reaches 400 mm3, plan to use the mice for IVC ligation.\n3. Anesthesia and preparation\nAnesthetize the mouse in an isoflurane chamber and inject the analgesic subcutaneously: Hold the animal from the base of the tail. Keep the animal on the dorsum surface of the non-dominant hand.\nTransfer the animal to the continuous anesthetic induction chamber filled with 3%-4% isoflurane. Confirm adequate general anesthesia with the absence of a toe-pinch reflex. Use a maintenance dose of 1%-3% isoflurane. Apply vet ointment on both eyes.\nSubcutaneous injection with buprenorphine (opioid for mitigating pain): Dissolve the stock of buprenorphine at a concentration of 0.3 mg/mL in 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) to achieve the concentration of 0.03 mg/mL.\nInject a dosage of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg of 0.03 mg/mL buprenorphine together with 500 µL of sterile 0.9% NaCl subcutaneously before surgery. In a 20 g mouse amount of 2 µg or 66 µL of 0.03 mg/mL buprenorphine is required.\nSkin preparation: Place the fully anesthetized mouse in a supine position over the heating blanket. Disinfect the anterior abdominal area with 0.5% chlorhexidine tincture, 2x. Frequently check the temperature of the heating blanket during the procedure and make sure that the temperature does not fall.\n4. IVC ligation\nMidline laparotomy",
    "Incise the abdominal skin with fine scissors starting from xiphoidal eminence to the bladder. Pinch the peritoneum halfway along the skin incision with atraumatic forceps. Ensure adequate space between the incision and the overlying intestines (Figure 2A).\nOpen the peritoneum in a longitudinal manner along with avascular linea alba.\nExteriorizing the intestines to the right abdominal side\n\t\nPull the intestines with wet cotton tips. Cover the intestines in a completely moist sterile gauze. Ensure that the covered intestines are in a traction-free direction without any excessive traction on the mesenteric vessels.\nFull exposure of the IVC and branches, including the confluence of the left renal vein to the IVC (Figure 2B).\n\t\nDrop 200-300 µL of normal saline. Explore the ureters', IVC, Aorta, and renal veins course (Figure 2).\nAvascular plane at the confluence point of the infra-renal IVC and the left renal vein confluence.\n\t\nPass the polypropylene 6-0 suture through the avascular plane gently 2x-3x with caudal to cephalad movements with the closed tip atraumatic forceps.\nEnsure that any minimal oozing is controlled with gentle pressure provided with a cotton tip tamponade. Widen the provided plane by passing the 6-0 polypropylene suture with gentle caudal to cranial movements.\nCauterizing the gonadal and lumbar branches (Figure 2D)\n\t\nUp to 4 posterior or lumbar branches might be present. To avoid potential complications of spinal ischemia and claudication, leave the lumbar branches intact in the current protocol.\nCheck that 2 to 3 side branches, including the bilateral uterine horn arterial supply and hypogastric vessels are present. Ensure consistent disruption of the first bilaterally present branches. Cauterize the bilateral branches just distal to the confluence of the left renal vein and IVC (infra-renal IVC). Ensure that the venous draining vessels of the uterine horn are not disrupted.",
    "NOTE: Side-branch cauterization is opted for because this method provides a smooth and uninterrupted surface, reducing any potential for uncontrolled bleeding. Moreover, cauterization is faster and more feasible than suture ligation with 10-0 sutures. Therefore, the animals will be exposed to a shorter and safer procedure.\nDouble-check the ureters' course and the vasculature to ensure the absence of any oozing or inadvertent cauterizing (Figure 2C).\nIVC ligation with vascular clips in the experimental group\n\t\nCustomize the vascular clips with a width of 2-0 nylon suture by atraumatic forceps. Apply the customized vascular clips in the experimental group circumferentially around the infrarenal IVC.\nApply the vascular clips over the suture. The primary suture passage provides a sufficient avascular plane with two to three meticulous caudal to cranial movements (Figure 2E-F).\nFurther pass the vascular clips through the prepared plane. Prepare the plane at the confluence of the left renal vein and IVC wide enough to allow an uneventful clip passage (Figure 2E).\nPlace the customized vascular clip horizontally, perpendicular to the IVC course, through the prepared plane. Place the vascular clips over the 5-0 polypropylene suture to ensure adequate remaining space (Figure 2G).\nEnsure that the above steps are performed gently to prevent any vessel damage or bleeding at the site of vascular clips. Observe the surgical field for potential oozing. Apply gentle pressure with the cotton tip to the surgical field in case of oozing.\nIVC Ligation with suture in the control group\n\t\nSuture ligation with 6-0 polypropylene suture. Make a surgical square knot suture around the infra-renal IVC in the prepared plane over a 5-0 silk suture.\nOnce the suture is complete, gently remove the silk suture to ensure adequate remnant space.\nPerform subcutaneous injection of 200 µL of normal saline.",
    "NOTE: To provide a comparable technique for partial IVC occlusion with clamp application, the vascular clip is customized in the current study to provide space in between lips. The vascular clip is then placed in the prepared avascular plane in the confluence of the left renal vein and IVC.\nClose the laparotomy with continuous running 4-0 vicryl suture.\n5. Follow-up after the index surgery\nMonitor the animal continuously post-operation for 1 h or until balance and righting capability are recovered, whatever comes first in an isolated clean cage until fully recovered.\nMonitor the animal daily for 2 days. If the animal looks distressed, monitor it twice a day for 2 days. Administer postoperative analgesia and fluids per protocol.\n\t\nDissolve the stock of buprenorphine with a concentration of 0.3 mg/mL in 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) to achieve the concentration of 0.03 mg/mL.\nInject a dosage of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg of 0.03 mg/mL buprenorphine subcutaneously together with 500 µL of sterile 0.9% NaCl, every 8 to 12 h during the first 48 h following the index surgery. In a 20 g mouse, 2 µg or 66 µL of 0.03 mg/mL buprenorphine would be required.\n6. Euthanasia and harvesting the IVC containing the clot\nAnesthetize the mouse in an isoflurane chamber, hold the animal from the base of the tail and keep the animal on the dorsum surface of your hand.\nTransfer the animal to the continuous anesthetic induction chamber filled with 3%-4% isoflurane. Place the animal in the supine position.\nPerform a long midline laparotomy starting from the xiphoid to the bladder as described.\nExteriorize the intestine to the right side of the abdomen and harvest the clamped IVC distal to the iliac bifurcation to the extent of infra-renal IVC (Figure 2G).",
    "Following the clot and tumor harvest, euthanize the animal with cervical dislocation.\n7. Statistical analysis\nPresent statistical analysis as the mean, median, and standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM), 25th or 75th percentile, or the entire range of values, including minimum and maximum values, as appropriate. Perform a Student t-test, and the F-test as appropriate. Assess statistical significance at the p <0.05 level.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
