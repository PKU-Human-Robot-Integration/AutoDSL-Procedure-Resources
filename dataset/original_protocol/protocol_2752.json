    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransduction with pSCAR_Cas9 lentivirus and selection\nTiming: 7–10 days\nEngineer the cancer cell line to express the pSCAR_Cas9 construct. The following recommendations are based on manipulation of the Renca cell line and the virus produced in our laboratory. There are two pSCAR_Cas9 constructs available for use, pSCAR_Cas9_BSD and pSCAR_Cas9_HBP, which feature Blasticidin or Hygromycin B resistance, respectively. Select a construct that will not overlap with the resistance gene encoded in the sgRNA delivery vector(s) you plan to use.\nPlate 2.5 × 105 cancer cells per well into three wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate in cell culture media. We recommend that the user stagger plating such that no well with cells is directly next to another well with cells to avoid droplet contamination.\nOne well will be used as a selection control (non-transduced cells) and two additional wells will be used for transduction with two final concentrations of pSCAR_Cas9 lentivirus (for example, 500 μL and 1 mL).\nAdd media so that the final volume (including viral media) will be 2 mL per well. Distribute cells evenly.\nNote: The amount of virus needed to transduce the optimal number of cells may vary significantly between cell lines and viral preparations. It is highly recommended to test multiple concentrations of virus on the cells or determine the viral titer in advance to identify a volume of lentivirus that will produce the optimal transduction rate (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: “preparation of lentivirus[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]” and “determination of lentiviral titer[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]”).\nTransduction:\nAdd 4 μg/mL polybrene and 2.5 μg/mL plasmocin prophylactic to each well to improve transduction efficiency and prevent mycoplasma contamination.\nAdd the desired amount of pSCAR_Cas9 lentivirus dropwise to the cells and rock the plate to distribute the virus evenly.",
    "Bring the final volume of media up to 2 mL and rock the plate.\nTransfer cells to an incubator and incubate for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nIf 48 h later cells have not recovered and are growing slower than usual, change the media. Once the cells have reached an optimal confluence, passage/expand cells in the desired format (6-well plates or flasks) as needed and check transduction rate (percentage of GFP-positive cells) by flow cytometry (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2414-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Expression of fluorescent reporter GFP, which is expressed by pSCAR_Cas9, in non-transduced cells (left panel), following vector transduction at indicated MOI with (lower panels) and without (upper panels) antibiotic selection\nNote: The rate of cell growth depends on the cell line. For Renca cells, 48 h is sufficient for the cells to reach 70%–80% confluence at this seeding density. This step can be performed 72 h after transduction but it is not recommended to perform this step prior to 48 h as the cells may have had insufficient time to express the vector proteins.\nCollect 5 × 105–1 × 106 cells per condition (different virus concentrations and untransduced cells to be used as a flow cytometry negative control) in flow cytometry tubes. Spin down for 5 min at 350 g in a 4C centrifuge.\nWash cells 2–3 times in 1 mL of MACS/FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS + 0.8% 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0). Resuspend in 0.5–1 mL MACS buffer for flow cytometry analysis.\nFlow the cells for the expression of the GFP protein (blue laser, 488 nm excitation wavelength), which serves as a proxy for Cas9. Identify the concentration of lentivirus that produced the optimal transduction rate while maintaining low MOI (∼10%–40%). Carry these cells forward in subsequent steps.",
    "Once the transduction rate has been confirmed to be sufficient, to the remaining cells in the 6-well plate add the appropriate concentration of antibiotic selection based on the antibiotic resistance of the pSCAR_Cas9 construct used (Blasticidin for pSCAR_Cas9_BSD and Hygromycin B for pSCAR_Cas9_HBP) as determined in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”: “in vitro cell line optimization[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]”.\nNote: Be sure to add the antibiotic also to the untransduced control cells to monitor completion of antibiotic selection.\nTransfer cells to an incubator and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nMaintain the cells in antibiotic selection until the selection control cells are completely dead.\nOnce the selection control cells are dead and the pSCAR_Cas9-transduced cells reach confluence (varies by cell line and the transduction rate but typically 4–8 days), check the expression of the fluorescent reporter, which serves as a proxy for Cas9, by flow cytometry and expand the remaining pSCAR_Cas9 cells into a larger flask (T75).\nCritical: Ensure that the cells are >85% GFP+ before moving to the next step.\nPause point: Once the selection of pSCAR_Cas9-transduced cells is complete and cells have reached confluence in the T75, freeze the cells to maintain a stock for future use.\nTransduction with pSCAR_sgRNA lentivirus and selection\nTiming: 7–10 days\nThe following steps can be used with any pSCAR_sgRNA to generate single knockout cells or with a pSCAR_sgRNA pooled lentiviral library to generate a pool of cells to be used for in vivo screening or other applications. The following steps describe the transduction with a 10,000 sgRNA pooled lentiviral library in Renca cells as an example.\nNote: Prior to conducting pool-scale transductions it is recommended to test the genome editing efficiency in the specific cell line that is being used to confirm sufficient editing efficiency to perform a high-quality genetic screen.",
    "Expand pSCAR_Cas9 cells; selection antibiotics can be used at initial passages prior to library transduction.\nIf conducting pool-scale transductions, calculate the number of cells to transduce based on transduction rate with viral concentration determined in the test pool transduction to reach >1,000× coverage of the library during the pool transduction (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: “determination of lentiviral titer[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]”).\nExample: For a 10,000 sgRNA library, 107 cells have to be transduced to reach the optimal 1,000× coverage of the library. Optimization of transduction conditions with the library-containing viral media are highly recommended.\nMulti-layer flasks (VWR Cat #89204-478 (5-layer, 875 cm2) or #89204-476 (3-layer, 525 cm2) can be used here to simplify culturing a large number of cells.\nIf conducting single pSCAR_sgRNA transductions, follow the same protocol as used to conduct the pSCAR_Cas9 transductions (transduction in 6-well plates), noting that the pSCAR_sgRNA virus should have a much higher titer than the Cas9 virus so it is recommended to transduce with a lower percentage of viral media.\nSeed tissue culture flasks with the desired number of cells as calculated above and add media so that the final volume (including viral media) will be ∼25 mL per 175 cm2 flask or layer (if using multilayered flasks).\nNote: Maintain untransduced cells in a 6-well plate to be used as a flow cytometry negative control.\nTransduction:\nAdd 4 μg/mL polybrene and 2.5 μg/mL plasmocin prophylactic to each flask or well to improve transduction efficiency and prevent mycoplasma contamination.\nAdd the desired amount of lentivirus dropwise to the cells and rock the plate to distribute the virus evenly.\nTransfer cells to an incubator and incubate for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.",
    "Critical: For screening cell lines, from this point forward it is essential to maintain cells at >1,000× coverage of the library. For this example of a 10,000 sgRNA library, this requires maintaining >107 transduced cells at all times.\nIf 48 h later cells have not recovered and are growing slower than usual, change the media. Once the cells have reached an optimal confluence, passage the cells and maintain enough number of cells in culture to ensure optimal coverage throughout the protocol.\nCheck transduction rate by flow cytometry. Transduction efficiency can be measured by levels of fluorescent reporter (mKate2 or tagBFP):\nCollect 5 × 105–1 × 106 cells per condition in flow cytometry tubes. Spin down for 5 min at 350 g in a 4C centrifuge. Collect also untransduced cells to draw appropriate gates for mKate2 (or tagBFP) negative cells.\nWash cells 2–3 times in 1 mL of MACS/FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS + 0.8% 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0). Resuspend in 0.5–1 mL MACS buffer for flow cytometry analysis.\nFlow the cells for the expression of the mKate2 (or tagBFP depending on the SCAR vector chosen for sgRNA delivery) protein.\nCalculate the number of cells transduced with the sgRNA pool virus.\nExample: If the transduction rate is 20% (based on the percentage of the pSCAR_sgRNA fluorescent protein by flow cytometry) and 5 × 107 cells were transduced, 107 cells have been transduced and contain a sgRNA. Ensure that the number of cells successfully transduced is >1,000× the size of the library.",
    "Once it is confirmed that the pool transduction was successful and that there is sufficient coverage of the library, add the appropriate concentration of antibiotic selection based on the pSCAR_sgRNA vector that is being used to the cells, maintaining the same number of cells that were seeded at the time of the transduction.\nNote: Also add antibiotic to a well of untransduced cells as a selection control.\nTransfer cells to an incubator and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nMonitor the cells and maintain antibiotic selection until the selection control cells are completely dead (4–8 days), passaging the cells as needed, maintaining the same number of cells that were seeded at the time of transduction.\nOnce the selection controls are dead and the selected pSCAR_sgRNA+ cells reach confluence, flow the cells for the expression of fluorescent proteins.\nCritical: Ensure that the cells are >90% GFP+ and mKate2+ (or tagBFP+) before moving to the next step. This will ensure that the library is fully represented.",
    "Note: After allowing ∼ 1 week for selection and genome editing, pSCAR-sgRNA-transduced cells are ready for transduction with IDLV-Cre lentivirus. If freezing the cells transduced with the pool library, take into account that it is highly recommended to freeze down 2–3× the number of pSCAR_sgRNA pool-transduced and selected cells necessary to maintain 1,000× coverage of the library at this point. If thawed at >1,000× coverage, the cells can be used for subsequent screens but must be reselected for Cas9 or sgRNA expression prior to use (following delivery of IDLV_Cre, the cells will lose their resistance/fluorescence markers and cannot be reselected). It is not recommended to re-expand and freeze the libraries from the frozen aliquots, as repeatedly freezing and thawing sgRNA library cells will often cause the loss of sgRNA representation or the outgrowth of specific sgRNA clones, and therefore it is important to have sufficient coverage of the libraries frozen for any subsequent experiments at this step.\nTransduction with IDLV_Cre lentivirus\nTiming: 7–10 days\nOnce the transduced cells have completed genome editing (7–10 days following transduction), introduce integrase-deficient lentiviral Cre into the pSCAR_sgRNA-transduced cells to remove all viral vector components including Cas9, antibiotic resistance genes, and fluorescent proteins. This is a critical step that must be completed prior to using the cells for the in vivo screen. No antibiotic selection can be used from now on.\nUsing complete media without antibiotics, seed the selected pool of pSCAR_Cas9+ pSCAR_sgRNA+ cells between 1,000–5,000× coverage (e.g., for a 10,000 sgRNA library, seed between 107 and 5 × 107 cells). Also maintain the cells at >1,000× coverage until it is confirmed that the IDLV_Cre transductions were successful as well as for a control to monitor the dilution of the fluorescent proteins by flow cytometry.",
    "Bring the volume of media on the cells to 50% of the final volume to be used.\nTransduction:\nTo each flask, add 4 μg/mL Polybrene and 2.5 μg/mL Plasmocin Prophylactic.\nAdd the volume of IDLV_Cre lentivirus needed to achieve 50% of the final volume to the cells dropwise and rock the flask.\nNote: IDLV_Cre normally yields much higher titer virus compared to pSCAR vectors. We intentionally infect at high MOI (>1) to ensure efficient removal of floxed vector components. Some cell lines may be particularly sensitive to high titer lentiviral transduction (e.g., MC38) and the user should monitor cell lines for excessive cell death that could skew library representation.\nTransfer cells to an incubator and incubate for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nChange media and maintain the cells, passaging as needed for 7–10 days ensuring that the library is maintained at >1,000× coverage.\nConfirm efficient IDLV_Cre removal of viral vectors by flow cytometry analysis of the dilution of fluorescent reporter genes (as indicated in step 15). After 4–5 days following transduction with IDLV_Cre, it should be possible to observe the population of fluorescent cells moving from the “double-positive” (GFP+ mKate2/tagBFP+) towards the “double-negative” (GFP- mKate2/tagBFP-). By 7–10 days, the IDLV_Cre-transduced cells should overlap entirely with the untransduced cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). At this point, if necessary, freeze down enough cells to rethaw the library at 500–1,000 cells/sgRNA. If possible, continue with the screen without a freeze/thaw cycle.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2414-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Flow cytometry showing expression of fluorescent proteins GFP and mKate2, expressed by pSCAR_Cas9 and pSCAR_sgRNA respectively, in non-transduced cells (left panel), transduced cells and 4 and 10 days after IDLV_Cre transduction\nCritical: Ensure that the fluorescent proteins have been diluted sufficiently such that less than ∼10%–15% of the cells remain positive for the fluorescent proteins.",
    "Note: If Cre-mediated recombination and removal was not efficient and greater than ∼10%–15% cells retain vector expression measured by fluorescence, the user can use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to enrich double-negative cells or repeat the IDLV_Cre transduction until cells reach a satisfactory threshold for remaining fluorescent marker positivity (<15%).\nTumor challenge and in vivo screen\nTiming: 2–3 weeks (depending on experimental conditions)\nOnce the conditions for the in vivo screen have been determined (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: “designing an in vivo screen[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5]”) and the cells have been generated, grow the necessary number of tumor cells and implant them into mice. Our group typically injects 4 × 106 cells per tumor with a 1:1 mix of HBSS:Matrigel. The following protocol is written assuming these conditions but adjust as necessary based on engraftment tests (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: “engraftment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5.1]”).\nNote: Grow enough cells to have 1.25× the number of cells needed for any WT mouse injections and 1.5× the number of cells needed for any NSG mouse injections (note that each needle must be loaded individually to avoid contamination/infection issues in immunodeficient animals). Take into account any additional in vitro screening conditions if required. Also culture enough cells to collect an input sample (if possible, collect more than one pellet for “day 0” backup sample) on the day of the challenge as well as at least enough cells to maintain coverage in culture for an output sample (collected at the end of the in vivo experiment). These conditions would inform about the library representation for quality control (input) and will control for sgRNA that could have an impact on proliferation or cell death during the time tumors are growing into the animals (output).",
    "Once the total number of cells needed on the day of the tumor challenge is calculated, determine how many cells are recovered from a confluent tissue culture flask being used (multi-layer flasks are strongly recommended) and, using a conservative estimate, calculate how many flasks are needed to have sufficient cells on the day of the challenge.\nLeading up to the challenge, maintain the cells at or above 1,000× coverage to ensure that you do not have dropout of the library in vitro.\nExpand the cells to obtain the necessary number of cells on the day of the tumor challenge.\nNote: a 50% matrigel solution is recommended to maximize engraftment rates however it is not essential. If desired, determine the engraftment rate as described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: “engraftment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5.1]” without matrigel to ensure adequate screen coverage and recovery.\nBefore you begin on the day of the challenge: If using, thaw the amount of Matrigel that will be needed (100 μL/tumor, or 50% of a 200 μL injection, plus overage) on ice at 4°C overnight.\nNote: Matrigel is solid at both −20°C and at room temperature and is only liquid at 4°C, so it is critical to maintain both pure matrigel and cells resuspended in matrigel on ice at all times.\nCollect the cells from the flasks using trypsin if necessary, transfer into a 50 mL conical tube with media and pipette vigorously to break up cell aggregates.\nCount the cells at least four times to obtain as accurate cell count as possible.\nTransfer the number of cells needed for the in vivo screen including overage for needle loading as determined above to as many 50 mL falcon tubes as necessary. Spin down cells for 5 min at 350 rcf at 4°C.",
    "Note: Keep cells on ice for the duration of the cell preparation process to maintain cell viability.\nWhile cells are spinning down, with the remaining cells seed the necessary number of flasks to maintain in vitro screen coverage (>1,000×) for the duration of the in vivo screen to be used to collect an output pellet at the conclusion of the screen.\nOptional: If desired, seed additional flasks for in vitro screening arms at >1,000× coverage, including cytokine stimulations or other conditions, which can be conducted in parallel to the in vivo screen.\nCritical: Collect at least one input pellet (day 0) in one 50 mL falcon tube with at least enough cells to reach 1,000× screen coverage and spin down the cells. The genomic DNA can be extracted immediately (see “tumor harvesting and gDNA isolation from an in vivo screen[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.5]” below) or the cell pellet can be stored at −80°C for the duration of the screen.\nOnce cells to be used for the in vivo screen are pelleted, aspirate the media and wash cells three times by resuspending cell pellets in 1× sterile Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and spinning down cells for 5 min at 350 rcf at 4°C after each wash.\nNote: Cell pellets can be combined up to ∼5 × 107 cells per falcon tube and washed with ∼30 mL HBSS per tube.\nAfter the third wash, remove HBSS carefully and resuspend cells in the volume of HBSS needed to reach 4 × 107 cells/mL.\nNote 1: This concentration assumes a 200 μL injection volume with 4 × 106 cells/tumor. This can be adjusted as desired.\nNote 2: it is critical to fully resuspend the cells in HBSS prior to adding matrigel.",
    "Combine the cell suspensions with an equal volume of Matrigel to reach 2 × 107 cells/mL in a 1:1 HBSS:Matrigel solution.\nProceed with tumor inoculation; our group typically injects 4 × 106 tumor cells in 200 μL of a 1:1 HBSS:Matrigel solution subcutaneously in one flank of the mouse using a 23G needle.\nNote: Keep tumor cells on ice for the duration of the tumor challenge.\nIf treating the mice with any therapeutics, dose as required. In this case, we performed i.p. injections on days 6, 9, 12 post-tumor challenge (100 μg of anti-PD-1 and 100 μg of anti-CTLA-4). Tumor growth can be followed by measuring the longest dimension (L) and the perpendicular dimension (W) using a caliper every 3 days (or as observed in the animal experimentation protocol) starting around day 6 after tumor inoculation (or once tumor nodules start to be palpable). Tumor volumes are calculated with the formula V = LxW2/2. Sufficient anti-tumor response should be observed when tumors are collected (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). See before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]: “experimental conditions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5.2]”.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2414-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Tumor volume over time for SCAR-vector-system-library-transduced Renca cells in NSG, WT untreated, and anti-PD-1- and anti-CTLA-4-treated BALB/c mice (n = 40 mice per group)\nData are represented as mean ± SEM (for some data points error bars are too small to be appreciated). ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; Student’s t test at last measurement.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nTumor harvesting and gDNA isolation from an in vivo screen\nTiming: 2 days\nBefore you begin: Set a water bath to 56°C. It is also recommended to pre-label 50 mL conical tubes for each tumor and/or cage of tumors to be pooled to speed up the takedown process.",
    "At the conclusion of the screen, collect (trypsinize if necessary, spin down cells for 5 min at 350 rcf at 4°C and wash again in PBS) the in vitro output pellet as well as any additional in vitro conditions that were included in 50 mL falcon tubes with at least enough cells to reach 1,000× screen coverage and spin down the cells.\nPause point: The genomic DNA can be extracted immediately as described below or the cell pellets can be stored at −80°C until ready to isolate the gDNA.\nAt the conclusion of the in vivo screen, euthanize mice with CO2, extract the tumor from the flank using surgical scissors, and weight the tumors using a balance and record the mass.\nUsing surgical scissors, mechanically dice the tumor into ∼1 mm3 pieces placing the tumors on the back of a 10 cm plate until no large pieces remain and the processed tumors are easily resuspended with a serological pipette.\nTransfer the tumors into a 50 mL conical tube and resuspend in media to 0.1 g of tumor per 1 mL of DMEM + 2% FBS.\nOptional: To reduce downstream processing, you can pool all tumors from a single cage of mice for isolation of genomic DNA. To do this, transfer equal volumes of tumor suspension of each tumor in the cage to a new 50 mL conical for a final tumor mass of 0.8 g in 8 mL of DMEM + 2% FBS (e.g., a cage of 5 tumors, transfer 1.6 mL of each tumor suspension into a new tube).",
    "It is also recommended to keep “backup” tubes of pooled tumors that can be frozen at −80°C for up to 4 weeks in case the genomic DNA isolation fails. For that spin down the processed tissue at 350 rcf for 5 min at 4°C and remove supernatant.\nPooling tumors is generally recommended for larger libraries to reduce sequencing- and processing-related costs. If processing individual tumors, carry forward only up to 0.8 g of tumor mass per tube to avoid overloading the genomic DNA isolation columns.\nSpin down either pooled or individual tumor suspensions at 350 rcf for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove any frozen in vitro input, output, or any additional in vitro screening condition pellets from the −80°C freezer and allow them to thaw fully at RT.\nAfter spinning down tumor suspensions, aspirate media and resuspend tumor pellets and in vitro pellets in 10 mL of a 1:10 mixture of buffer proteinase K and buffer ATL. Vortex to fully resuspend.\nOptional: Can make a master mix of proteinase K/buffer ATL for n samples + 1.\nPlace samples in a water bath set to 56°C overnight (at least 8 h).\nThe next morning, remove samples from the water bath and vortex thoroughly for 10 s.\nPause point: After overnight digestion is complete, the samples can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 months.\nIsolate the genomic DNA from the samples using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications:\nInstead of adding QIAGEN Protease to the samples, add 200 μL of RNase A (100 mg/mL) to the lysed samples before beginning the gDNA isolation.",
    "Volumes should be adjusted. Per tumor, we use 5× what is recommended, except for the elution step. This should be optimized on an individual basis depending on the model.\nWhen the protocol indicates vigorous shaking, vortexing may be used to resuspend the samples.\nElute the samples with QIAGEN Buffer EB pre-warmed to 70°C.\nQuantify the concentration of gDNA using a Nanodrop or Qubit machine for downstream processing.\nPause point: gDNA can be stored at 4°C or −20°C for long-term storage.\nSequencing and data analysis from an in vivo screen\nTiming: Variable\nFollow the Broad Genetic Perturbation Platform protocol, “PCR of sgRNAs, shRNAs, and ORFs from genomic DNA for Illumina sequencing” available at https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/resources/protocols[href=https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/resources/protocols] using the P5 ARGON and P7 KERMIT primers to amplify the sgRNA barcode from each gDNA sample.\nSequence the gDNA on an Illumina sequencer. For large libraries we use a HiSeq2500 (50 cycles).\nFollow the GPP Pooled Screen Analysis Guide, available at https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/broad/[href=https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/broad/], to perform quality control on the sequenced files.\nNormalize counts data through the following steps:\nConvert counts to reads per million with a pseudocount of 1, and then log2 transform the data.\nZ-score the normalized counts data based on the mean and standard deviation of the control guide distribution.\nFold changes from all four pools are quantile normalized with gene-wise mean imputation, and these quantile normalized fold changes are used for hit-calling.\nRun the hit calling algorithm STARS,9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] available at http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/software/index[href=http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/software/index], to calculate the statistical enrichment and depletion of the genes targeted in the screen based on the normalized fold changes calculated in the previous step. Other analysis packages such as MaGecK10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] are also available and yield highly similar results."
