    "The study is approved by the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and the protocol follows the guidelines of participant protection and data safety as indicated by the review committee.\n1. Prepare Participant for Hair Sample and Hair Sample Collection Questions\nExplain to participant that the hair sample collected is less hair than that is lost normally in brushing each day from the back of the head (posterior vertex). Tell the participant that the site for the hair sample is hidden by surrounding hair and, thus, is not visible after collection. Inform the participant that the sample will be used to measure a hormone called cortisol present in the hair10,11.\nTake out the sample photo and show the participant the amount of hair that will be collected (30 - 50 strands).\n\tNOTE: See Figure 1 for photo of a hair sample.\nAsk the participant the hair care practice12 questions listed in Table 1.\n2. Collect the Hair Sample\nTell the participant that the sample is collected in a private area behind a portable partition, curtain, or closed door. Assure participants that, if they wear a wig or hairpiece, their hair is not cut in an area where others may see. Measure hair length from scalp to end by pulling the hair gently and taut.\nIf the hair is short (less than 3 cm), follow the short hair protocol in step 3 (although if the hair is less than 1 cm long, the sample cannot be collected, and, ideally, the hair should be at least 3 cm long). For hair longer than 6 cm, follow the long hair protocol in step 4. Otherwise, continue to the next step.",
    "Ensure that materials are ready by placing the hair cutting supplies (a sheet of aluminum foil, business envelope, salon grade scissors, large and small tooth parting comb, alcohol preps, painters tape, permanent marker, non-latex gloves [optional], and hair clips)10 on a surface next to the participant. Clean the scissors and comb with the alcohol prep pad before collecting the sample. Cut out an 8 x 10\" sheet of aluminum foil to use for the sample.\nPut on non-latex gloves. Take the comb and part the hair horizontally along the posterior vertex of the scalp between the tips of the ears.\nTake a clip and move the hair from the top of the part, then place another clip at the bottom to expose a 5 x 10 cm rectangle between the two clips of loose hair (about the size of a deck of playing cards).\nAsk the participant if they prefer use of a wide tooth or narrow tooth comb through the 2 - 3\" rectangle of hair. Ask the participant how she or he would like to have the remaining hair in the comb discarded. Give the hair in the comb to the participant, or, if (and only if) the participant states that it is okay to discard the loose hair, discard the remaining hair from the comb into a trash can.\nGrasp approximately 30 - 50 strands of hair to the right of the 2 - 3\" rectangle and gently pull and twist the hair away from the scalp in a rolling motion between the fingers.\nEnsure that the sample is collected as close to the scalp as possible, but do not cut the scalp. Use salon-grade scissors and make a clean straight cut.",
    "Grasp the hair sample and ensure that the root end is aligned carefully along the cut.\nAttach the hair to the sheet of aluminum foil by taping with painter's tape. Do not cover the scalp end, and do not use painter's tape on hair that is shorter than or equal 3 cm. Place the loose cut hair into the center of the foil and fold into a square, ensuring that the hair does not fall out of the foil.\nTake the marker and label the scalp end on the aluminum foil. Use premade bar-coded labels to attach to the foil and envelope.\nFold the aluminum foil without folding the hair on the scalp end to prevent bed head (crumpled and bent hair), place it in the business size envelope, and seal.\nLabel the outside of the envelope with the participant's unique study identification number, date, and the name of the primary investigator, or use a bar code label if available.\nStore the sample in a dry area at room temperature.\n3. Sample Collection for Short Hair (1 - 3 cm)\nFollow steps 2.3 and 2.4.\nAfter parting, ask the participant to hold the parted hair close to the scalp. Cut the hair along the part, while holding the hair tightly with index finger and thumb10.\nPlace loose hairs in foil and fold it securely. Do not tape the hair to the foil.\nFollow steps 2.11 through 2.14.\n4. Sample Collection for Long Hair (longer than 6 cm)\nPart the hair left to right at the posterior vertex.\nUse the hair clips to hold back the extra hair.\nCreate a twist of hair and hold tightly with the index finger and thumb so as not to drop the sample10.",
    "Make a clean straight cut as close to the scalp as possible. Collect 30 - 50 strands of hair.\nIf the participant has thin hair, then cut 2 - 3 small areas (1 cm apart) across the posterior vertex to conceal the site of the cut.\nFollow steps 2.10 through 2.14.\n5. Sample Processing\nStore the foil packets containing the hair sample at room temperature indefinitely until analysis.\n\tNote: Hair cortisol is extremely stable in hair and can be stored for years. In fact, cortisol has been measured in hair samples from mummified remains11.\nAnalyze hair cortisol as previously published12. Samples can be shipped overnight at ambient temperature.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
