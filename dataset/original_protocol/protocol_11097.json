    "The study was reviewed and considered as \"exempt\" by the Institutional Review Board of Georgetown University (IRB # 2002-022). Freshly harvested bone marrow tissues were collected from discarded healthy human bone marrow collection filters that had been de-identified.\n1. New chamber design (Figure 2)\nOpen a new dual-chamber cell analyzer plate. Set aside the top chamber with electrodes.\nUsing a milling machine, shave off 2 mm of the U-shaped bottom wells of the cell analyzer plate.\nAttach a 2 cm x 7 cm polyethersulfone (PES) membrane with 0.2 µm pore size to the bottom of the shaved wells using UV-curated adhesive. Allow 30 min curation time to ensure the glue is completely cured and inert.\nUsing a milling machine, cut out two longitudinal slits (1.5 mm x 5.6 mm) along the sides to snap into the ridges of the newly fabricated third chamber.\nUsing a milling machine, create a third polycarbonate chamber that replicates the overall dimensions of the cell analyzer plate; 72 mm x 18 mm (Table of Materials).\nCreate wells 4.8 mm deep and 4.75 mm in diameter to replicate the 16-well design of the cell analyzer plate. This allows 90 µL of volume per well.\nOn the sides, create two triangular ridges so that the chamber locks into the original slits created in step 1.4. The horizontal part of the triangle is 1.5 mm, the vertical is 1.4 mm, and the hypotenuse is 2.052 mm.\nCreate a knob on the short side that is 50.8 mm in diameter and 1.397 mm in height to fit into the original plate's notch (Figure 2, Middle).\nUse a 0.9 mm thick rubber washer for each well to provide a sealed fit.\n2. Cell culture (MDA-MB-231, DCIS, DCIS-Δ4, J2-fibroblasts)\nWash adherent cell cultures (~70% confluence) with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).",
    "Add 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution to lift the cells off.\nNeutralize the trypsin solution with cell culture media containing serum and count the cells using an aliquot of the cell suspension.\n\t​NOTE: The specific cell culture media can be found in Table 1.\n3. Patient-derived xenograft dissociation\nChop a fresh tumor piece (1 cm2) into fine mush using a sterile scalpel.\nPlace in a 50 mL conical tube with 20 mL of DMEM F12 media supplemented with 3 mg/mL trypsin and 2 mg/mL collagenase.\nIncubate in a thermal shaker (150 RPM) at 37 °C for 20 min.\nSpin the tube at 500 x g for 5 min; remove the supernatant.\nAdd 20 μL of DMEM F12 + 2% FBS to wash the cells; spin at 300 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat wash two more times.\nResuspend in 1 mL of PDX media (Table 1) to count the cells.\n4. Bone marrow cell extraction\nFlush the bone marrow (BM) collection filter with 25 mL of 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: In this study, PBS was added to a used BM collection filter from the hospital to collect the remaining BM in the filter.\nAdd the flushed BM slowly to a 50 mL conical tube with 25 mL of density gradient medium, taking care to keep the layers as separate as possible.\nSpin at 800 x g for 20 min at 18 °C\nSiphon off the top layers after centrifugation (fat/plasma) and transfer 5 mL of the white layer above the density gradient medium that has the BM cells to a 15 mL conical tube.\n\t​NOTE: Alternatively, dip a 5 mL pipette into the top layer until it touches the middle layer (BM) and pipette out the middle layer very slowly without moving the pipette.",
    "Fill the 15 mL conical tube with 1x PBS (~10 mL) and spin at 300 x g for 15 min.\nRemove the supernatant; the remaining white pellet is the BM.\nIf red blood cells are observed in the pellet, add 5 mL of RBC lysis solution (Table of Materials) and let it sit for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Spin at 300 x g  for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 10 mL of 1x PBS to wash the cells, spin at 300 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat the RBC lysis (step 4.7) until the pellet is white.\n5. Cell seeding and assembly\nPlace all three sterile chambers in the tissue culture hood.\nLocate the knob on the short side of the lower chamber. Orient the lower chamber so that the knob is facing the experimenter.\nAdd 30,000-50,000 cells in 90 μL of media to each well of the lower chamber. Avoid forming bubbles. These are the stromal cells that will provide secreted factors but will not be detected by the electrodes of the top chamber.\nUse 5% fetal bovine serum-supplemented media in two lower chamber wells as a positive control for cell motility. Use 0% serum-supplemented media as a negative control.\nLet the lower chamber with the cells sit for 10-15 min in the hood to settle.\n\tNOTE: This step is recommended if cells are adherent or grow in suspension.\nRotate the lower chamber at 90° and place the middle chamber on top so that the knob on the lower chamber slides into the notch on the middle chamber.\n\tNOTE: The knob on the lower chamber and the blue dot on the middle chamber are at opposite ends of the assembly.",
    "Push vertically down until a click sound is heard from each of the long sides of the assembly.\nAdd 160 μL of serum-free media to all the wells of the middle chamber.\nMake sure a dome-shaped meniscus is visible after wells are filled; otherwise, adjust the final volume based on the pipette calibration. Avoid forming bubbles.\nPlace the top chamber with electrodes facing down onto the middle chamber making sure to align the blue dots on the middle and top chambers.\nPush vertically down until a click sound is heard from each of the long sides of the assembly.\nAdd 25-50 μL of serum-free media to the top chamber.\nMount the assembly on the dual purpose cell analyzer in the tissue culture incubator and wait for 30 min before measuring the background.\n\tNOTE: This time is necessary to equilibrate the array and can be used to prepare the cell lines to be added to the top chamber.\nMeasure the background (see section 6) and place the assembly back into the tissue culture hood.\nAdd 30,000-50,000 cells in 100 μL of serum-free media to each well of the top chamber. These are the cells that the electrode will detect once they successfully migrate through the membrane.\n\tNOTE: To achieve maximum response, it is recommended to grow cells in serum-free or low serum media for 6-18 h before performing the assay.\nLet the assembly stand in the hood for 30 min before mounting on the dual purpose cell analyzer for impedance measurement.\n6. Background and impedance measurement\nPlace the array into the cradle in the dual purpose cell analyzer instrument.\nOpen the cell analyzer software and select the cradle to be used.",
    "Click on the Message tab and make sure it says Connections OK to ensure the array is well placed in the cradle and the electrodes are well aligned with the sensors.\nClick on the Experiment Notes tab and fill in as much information about the experiment as possible.\nClick on the Layout tab and fill in the description of the array layout.\nClick on the Schedule tab and add two steps from the Steps menu; a background step (one sweep) and a test step with 100 sweeps-a sweep every 15 min, totaling 25 h.\nAfter the array has been in the dual purpose cell analyzer incubator for 30 min, click on the Play button to start background measurement. A window asking to choose the folder to save the data will pop up.\nAfter the background measurement is done, remove the array from the cradle and place it back in the cell culture hood.\nAdd cells to the top chamber as described in step 5.13, and keep the assembly in the tissue culture hood for 30 min for the cells to settle.\nPlace the array back into the dual purpose cell analyzer and check the Message tab for the Connections OK message.\nClick on the Play button to start impedance measurement.\nClick on the Plot tab to monitor the progress of the signal.\nIf the endpoint is reached before 25 h, click on the Abort step from the Execute drop-down menu.\nTo export data, right-click on the graph, choose Copy in the list format, and then paste the data in a spreadsheet.\n\t​NOTE: The data can be exported as cell index or delta cell index. Graph and/or layout information can also be chosen for export.\n7. Detachment and cell collection",
    "Monitor the migration rate in real-time on the dual purpose cell analyzer to determine the stopping point of interest (6-18 h).\n\tNOTE: The stopping point depends on the cell's invasion rate and when a distinct invasion signal from the negative control is achieved.\nOnce achieved, unmount the assembly from the dual purpose cell analyzer and place it in the tissue culture hood.\nPrepare an appropriate number of 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes to collect the cells from the wells of interest.\nPlace the assembly in a 10 cm dish to contain liquids when the chambers detach.\nPush the flexible snapping ends on the long side of the middle chamber inward until a click sound is heard.\nDismantle the top chamber and invert it into a new 10 cm dish.\nUse a cell lifter with a 13 mm blade to collect the cells from all the wells harboring the same experimental condition (i.e., cell type, drug treatment, etc.).\n\tNOTE: Design the setup to have at least two wells for each experimental condition to achieve statistically significant change from negative controls.\nRinse or dip the blade in 1x phosphate buffered saline to collect the cells in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nSpin down the cells at 500 x g for 5 min.\nPropagate the collected cells (see section 8) or perform end point analysis such as single-cell RNA-seq.\n\t​NOTE: For bulk RNA-seq, use a low cell number RNA extraction kit.\n8. 3D cell propagation and retrieval\nNOTE: Due to the small number of cells collected, seed the cells in 3D using an extracellular matrix (ECM) to enhance viability. That said, 2D culture is also an option at this point, especially if the cells used are from established cell lines.",
    "Thaw an aliquot of the basement membrane matrix at 4 °C overnight. Keep the basement membrane matrix on ice until ready to use.\nAdd 25 μL of cold basement membrane matrix to the pellet of live cells collected and gently pipette up and down to mix. Avoid forming bubbles.\nAdd the cell-basement membrane matrix mix to the bottom of a small tissue culture well (i.e., in a 96-well plate), forming a dome. Try not to touch the walls of the well. Incubate at 37 °C for 20 min before gently adding 100 μL of media dropwise.\nTo retrieve cells, aspirate the media and add 100 μL of dispase to each well.\nIncubate at RT for 10 min, pipetting up and down occasionally.\nTransfer the cells and the dissolved basement membrane matrix into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 mL of 1x PBS, spin at 300 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat the wash once.\nAspirate the supernatant. Split the cells in the pellet or perform endpoint analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
