    "The surgical operation using MIIBC for the treatment of an osteoporotic fracture of the seventh thoracic vertebra in a 68-year-old woman was approved by the Ethics Committee of Linfen People's Hospital of Shanxi Medical University (T20220829006). The patient provided written informed consent.\n1. Collection and recording of the patient's medical history\nCommunicate with the patient to determine the history of trauma, heavy lifting, bumpy rides, jerking, or even coughing.\n\t​NOTE: The main clinical manifestations of OSF are as follows: (1) pain, which can be acute or chronic lumbago and back pain or body pain and even obvious limitations in rolling up and down activities and walking activities; (2) spinal deformation, which is mainly manifested as kyphosis, lateral curvature, shortened height, a humpback, and thoracic deformity. In cases of spinal cord compression, severe complications may occur, such as paraplegia and abdominal compression, which may affect cardiopulmonary function.\n2. Pre-surgical examinations\nPhysical examination\n\t\nCheck for percussion pain and pressing pain in the chest, waist, and back. Check the lower extremities for sensory and motor changes.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\t\nPerform MRI (see Table of Materials) to identify acute or old vertebral fractures, as shown in Figure 1.\n\t\tNOTE: Newly fractured vertebrae show obvious edema around the tissue. Surgery is prohibited for old vertebra fractures.\nX-ray examination\n\t\nPerform an X-ray (see Table of Materials) to examine the vertebral changes and bone density in the cuneiform lesions, as shown in Figure 2.\nComputed tomography (CT) examination\n\t\nPerform CT (see Table of Materials) to examine the integrity of the posterior wall of the fractured vertebra, and determine if a vertebral fracture mass is present in the vertebral canal, as shown in Figure 3.\nBone mineral density (BMD) examination",
    "Perform dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (see Table of Materials) to measure the BMD of the spine, as shown in Figure 4.\n3. Patient positioning\nPlace a chest pad (see Table of Materials) under the patient's chest to maintain the patient in a prone position. Place a soft pad (see Table of Materials) under the lower leg to bend the knee to 20°. See Figure 5 for the specific details on the patient positioning.\n\t​NOTE: Remind the patient to relax the thoracolumbar and back muscles to facilitate the later puncture operation.\n4. Surgical procedure\nPerform intraoperative digital radiography (DR) and puncture localization.\n\t\nFix the Kirschner wire (see Table of Materials) on the body surface, and use the C-arm of the DR machine (see Table of Materials) for intermittent imaging to identify and label the surface projection of the diseased pedicle, as shown in Figure 6.\n\t\tNOTE: The location of the diseased pedicle should be evaluated comprehensively based on the results of step 3.1, step 4.1, step 5.1, and step 6.1.\nPerform needle puncture and bone cement injection.\n\t\nLocate the injection point at 1-2 cm outside the surface projection of the outer edge of the pedicle. Perform full invasive anesthesia with 2% lidocaine (see Table of Materials) along the skin of the puncture site toward the pedicle, as shown in Figure 7.\n\t\tNOTE: The puncture point is not at the body surface projection of the injured pedicle but is 1-2 cm outside the body surface projection on the outer edge of the pedicle.",
    "Under lateral DR imaging, adjust the orientation of the puncture needle to be consistent with the midline of the seventh thoracic vertebra, and strike the puncture needle to the outer edge of the pedicle with a surgical hammer (see Table of Materials). Next, push the puncture needle to the anterior vertebral 1/3 junction under lateral DR imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: When the tip of the puncture needle reaches the posterior edge of the vertebral body, the DR imaging above the prone position should show that the puncture needle passes right over the outer edge of the pedicle. When the puncture needle reaches the anterior 1/3 junction of the vertebral body, the DR imaging above the prone position should indicate that the tip of the puncture needle is located in the center of the vertebral body.\nFill the syringe with the prepared viscous bone cement (see Table of Materials), and slowly inject it into the vertebra under lateral DR imaging. Insert the pillow inner to push the bone cement remaining inside the puncture needle (see Table of Materials) into the vertebral body.\nPull out the puncture needle by turning it backward. After pressing the puncture site for 3-5 min, wrap the puncture site with sterile surgical gauze (see Table of Materials), as shown in Figure 8.\n\t\t​NOTE: Bone cement should be freshly prepared when being used. If obvious leakage is found during the injection of the bone cement, the injection should be terminated immediately.\n5. Postoperative care\nAdminister oxygen, and monitor the vital signs of the patient in a supine position for 6 h after surgery.",
    "NOTE: On the first day after surgery, the patient can stand and walk under the protection of the lumbar support device. If the thoracolumbar X-ray re-examination is normal, the patient can be discharged from the hospital 2-3 days after surgery.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
