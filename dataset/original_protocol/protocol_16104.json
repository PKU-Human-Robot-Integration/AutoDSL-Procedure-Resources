    "Here we describe the steps required to establish in vitro cultures and how to micropropagate and multiply cassava plants. These mother plants generate the leaf explant material used to initiate the embryogenic target tissues for subsequent transgene integration. We provide directions to handle cassava plant material as in vitro plantlets obtained from germplasm collections such as those held by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Cassava genotypes obtained from germplasm collections are most often transported in glass or plastic test tubes. The steps below describe first how to establish mother plants from such cultures and then how to propagate them.\nWhile growth and multiplication rates vary, this protocol has proven successful for micropropagation of many cassava varieties. Details are provided for establishing and growing mother plants in Petri dishes. Glass jars can also be used, but Petri dishes are preferred because they can be stacked three or four high, allowing large numbers of mother plants to be maintained in a relatively small space within growth chambers. Use of 100 × 25–mm Petri dishes is recommended for the MS2 agar plates to provide plants with maximum headspace for growth, although 100 × 15–mm sterile dishes also work well.\nTo provide sufficient numbers of explants for production of target tissues and recovery of transgenic plants, 20 Petri dishes carrying 7-8 mother plants each (140-160 in vitro plantlets) should be established. The established plantlets should be subcultured every 6-8 weeks to ensure continued healthy growth and production of shoot materials in optimal condition for induction of embryogenic tissues.\nMaterials\nIn vitro cassava cultures (e.g., from CIAT)\nMS2 agar plates (see recipe)\nLaminar flow hood\nSterile fine pointed forceps\nSterile 100 × 15–mm Petri dishes (VWR, 25384-342)",
    "Miltex carbon steel no. 10 surgical blade (prod. no. 4-110)\nParafilm or Saran Wrap cut into 5-cm wide strips\n28°C growth chamber\nEstablish mother plants from in vitro plantlets\n1. Under a laminar flow hood and using sterilized forceps, carefully extract a plantlet from a test tube or other container and place on a sterile Petri dish lid.\n2. Using sterilized forceps and scalpel blade, trim away and discard old leaves. Cut the plantlet transversely to generate 2-3 nodes per stem segment.\n3. Transfer stem segments to MS2 agar plates, submerging 0.5 cm of the stem into the medium, and establishing 6-8 shoot explants per plate (20 plates per cultivar are ideal).\n4. Seal and label plates appropriately and place in a 28°C growth chamber under bright light (90 µMol m−2 s−1) with a 14-16 hr photoperiod.\nMicropropagate mother plants\n5. Open Petri dishes containing mother plants in the laminar flow hood.\n6. Using sterile forceps and a scalpel blade, excise apical stem segments 2-3 cm in length. Trim away lower leaves and petioles from the stem and discard, leaving the apical meristem and the first mature leaf at the top of the micro cutting.\n7. Place the cutting vertically into a new MS2 agar plate, submerging 0.5 cm of the stem into the medium, and placing 6-8 micro cuttings evenly spaced in each dish.\n8. Seal and label plates appropriately and culture as above.",
    "Mother plants can be harvested for leaf explants two to three times before they should be refreshed by subculturing as described above. After excision of new shoot growth, seal and return plates to the growth chamber and allow new shoots to grow. Four weeks later, new shoot growth can be harvested again from these mother plants. Mother plants should be renewed every 6-8 weeks by subculturing shoot cuttings onto fresh MS2 agar plates. If plants are not needed for establishing embryogenic cultures, the subculture period for maintenance of mother plants can be extended to 2-4 months.",
    "This protocol describes how to initiate sterile cassava in vitro if the researcher does not have access to previously established cultures of a desired genotype. Specifically, it provides a guide for surface sterilization and establishment of in vitro plantlets from greenhouse- or field-grown cassava plants. Only disease-free plants should be used to initiate cultures of a given variety. If stem cuttings are collected from the field, it is recommended that diagnostics be performed before proceeding in order to detect the presence of diseases such as cassava mosaic disease (CMD), cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), cassava bacterial blight (CBB), and cassava frogskin disease, as appropriate for the geographies where collection took place.\nMaterials\nField- or greenhouse-grown cassava plants\n15% (v/v) bleach (sodium hypochlorite, 8.25%) in sterile diH2O or reverse-osmosis (RO) water\nTween 20\nSterile RO water\nMS2 Gelzan plates (see recipe)\nMS2 agar plates (see recipe)\nStraight single-edge razor blade\n250- or 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks\nAluminum foil\nRotary shaker (optional)\nLaminar flow hood\n100 × 15–mm sterile Petri dishes (VWR, 25384-342)\nWaste bucket for bleach rinses\nFine pointed forceps\nMiltex carbon steel no. 10 surgical blade (prod. no. 4-110)\nParafilm or Saran Wrap cut into 5-cm-wide strips\n28°C growth chamber\nNOTE: As in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0001], the use of 100 × 25–mm Petri dishes is recommended for MS2 Gelzan and MS2 agar plates to allow unrestricted growth of new shoots and mother plants.\nCut and surface sterilize stem nodes\n1. Cut upper, green-colored stem material from field- or greenhouse-grown cassava plants.\nTwo stems with 12-18 nodes should be adequate. Do not use woody or semi-woody stem segments, as these are problematic to surface sterilize.\n2. Using a straight single-edge razor blade, cut off and discard all leaves and petioles to within 0.5 cm of the axillary buds.",
    "3. Cut individual nodes from the stem, leaving ∼1.0 cm of stem above and below the axillary bud.\n4. Place a maximum of 25 nodes in a 500-ml flask (15 nodes for a 250-ml flask; Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0001]) and cover with aluminum foil.\nAdding more than the specified number of nodes per flask will prevent proper contact of bleach solution with the stem surface and result in contaminated cultures.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/12a304f8-3fce-4829-a516-571fa87a5628/cpz1620-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nEstablishment of cassava plantlets in vitro culture. (A) Surface sterilization of excised nodes. (B) Nodes placed on MS2 Gelzan medium. (C) Shoot regeneration from sterilized lateral buds after 8 days.\n5. Pour 100 ml of 15% bleach into each flask containing cut nodal segments and add two drops of Tween 20. Cover the tops tightly with foil and swirl.\n6. Shake for 30 min at 150 rpm on a rotary shaker at room temperature, or swirl flasks by hand in a vigorous manner every 2 min for 30-40 min.\n7. Transfer flasks to a laminar flow hood. Remove foil and invert a Petri dish on the top of the flask. Tilt the flask over a large beaker to let the bleach solution pour out, using the Petri dish to retain nodes within the flask.\n8. To stop the sterilization process, add 150 ml sterile water to each flask, swirl, and drain the liquid into a waste bucket.\nComplete this process for all flasks before moving on to subsequent rinsing steps.\n9. Rinse at least five more times with fresh sterile water until nodes are thoroughly rinsed and a bleach smell is no longer present.\n10. Drain liquid and transfer nodes to new sterile Petri dish lids (one per flask).\nGrow shoots and establish mother plants",
    "11. Under the laminar flow hood, use sterile forceps and scalpel blade to trim bleached tissues away from each nodal segment to expose green healthy tissue above and below the node, taking care not to damage the axillary bud (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0001]).\n12. Transfer trimmed nodes to an MS2 Gelzan plate, placing 2-3 nodes per dish, with the axillary buds facing up (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0001]). Seal with Parafilm or Saran Wrap, label appropriately, and place in a 28°C growth chamber under bright light (90 µMol m−2 s−1) with a light duration of 14-16 hr.\n13. Observe plates every two days and allow shoots to grow to 2-3 cm in length. Discard if bacterial or fungal growth is observed.\nNew shoots should emerge from the nodal explants 5-10 days after placing on Gelzan medium depending on the cultivar (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0001]). If a nodal explant becomes contaminated, transfer the remaining axenic node(s) in the dish using sterile forceps to a fresh MS2 Gelzan plate.\n14. Use sterile forceps and scalpel blade to cut new shoot growth away from the original nodes. Insert new stems 0.5 cm deep into MS2 agar plates, placing 6-8 micro cuttings per dish.\n15. Culture new micro cuttings to generate roots and establish mother plants.\nOnce 20 plates containing 6-7 plants each are established, grow for 4-6 weeks, then proceed to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003]. To maintain mother plants and multiply for future experiments, perform Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0001] until ready for Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003].",
    "Here we describe steps required to produce transgenic plants in cassava variety 60444, a variety with high transformation efficiency. The process starts with production of organized embryogenic structures (OES) induced from immature leaf explants from in vitro plantlets produced in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0001]. To begin production of target tissues, approximately 20 plates of 6- to 8-week-old mother plants should be available. After OES formation, friable embryogenic callus (FEC) tissues are produced in three cycles of 21 days. FEC tissues are amenable to transformation by Agrobacterium and subsequent selection and regeneration of somatic embryos. Finally, the latter are germinated to produce plantlets. The total time required 3-3.5 months from the time of inoculation with Agrobacterium to obtain transgenic plantlets.\nDetails are provided for use of A. tumefaciens LBA4404 carrying pCAMBIA2300-based gene constructs. pCAMBIA2300 has an nptI gene for bacterial selection and an nptII gene for plant selection.

Select Petri dishes containing mother plants at 6-8 weeks since previous subculture onto MS2 agar plates.\nDo not use mother plants older than 10 weeks from previous subculture, as they will be stressed and the embryogenic response will be significantly reduced.\n2. Open one Petri dish and use fine forceps and a scalpel blade to excise the topmost (apical) 1-2 cm portions from 3-5 individual shoots (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0002]).

(C) Individual excised leaf lobe explant placed correctly on OES induction medium with midrib in contact with the medium.",
    "3. In a laminar flow hood under a dissecting microscope, select cuttings in which the youngest leaves are immature, unopened, and 2-5 mm in length.\n4. Using fine forceps to hold one cutting, use a 23-G hypodermic needle on a syringe to make incisions at the petiole/lamina junction to separate the three lobes of the leaf from the petiole (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0002]) and from each other (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0002]).\nCut leaf lobes as close to the petiole junction as possible without including any petiole tissue.\n5. Transfer 10-12 leaf lobe explants to an OES induction plate and orient to ensure that the midrib (abaxial side) is downwards and in contact with the medium (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0002]).\nCorrect orientation of the leaf explant on the OES induction medium is critical. Ensure that the midrib is in contact with the medium, but do not submerge explants into the medium.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 to obtain 100-200 leaf lobe explants in total.\n7. Seal plates, label appropriately, and place in a 28°C growth chamber under low light (20 µMol m−2 s−1) for 28 days.\nAfter 28 days, production of OES will be complete (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/db0ff8b2-1d20-42aa-87cf-3c9f111edb7e/cpz1620-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nProduction of friable embryogenic callus (FEC).

    "9. Working under a dissecting microscope in a laminar flow hood, use a no. 10 scalpel blade and fine point forceps to excise the OES and separate them from the surrounding non-embryogenic, wet, mushy callus. Cut away all adhering callus tissue and place excised OES fragments onto an FEC induction plate. Cover with a lid to prevent desiccation.\nWork with 2-3 explants at a time until OES from all induction plates are collected.\n10. Transfer all collected OES fragments to a sterile metal mesh (1-mm pore) placed on top of an empty sterile Petri dish (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0003]).\n11. Using a sterile stainless steel spatula, force the OES through the mesh, collecting the fragments below. Use a sterile needle to push adhering tissues through the mesh and add to tissue in the Petri dish.\n12. Using sterile forceps, gently mix the meshed OES to homogenize the tissue mass.\n13. Using fine forceps, transfer meshed OES to a new FEC induction plate and arrange fragments to form colonies of 10-15 fragments each (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0003]). Establish 6-7 such colonies per FEC induction plate.\n14. Seal plates with Parafilm or Saran Wrap, label appropriately, and place in a 28°C growth chamber under low light (20 µMol m−2 s−1) for 28 days (1st cycle).\n15. Use fine forceps to select FEC tissues (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0003]) from the colonies and transfer to fresh FEC induction plates. Do not subculture non-embryogenic tissues. Place groups of FEC tissues in a monolayer to generate colonies ∼0.5 cm in diameter, with 7-10 such colonies per dish, and incubate at 28°C in low light (20 µMol m−2 s−1) for 21 days (2nd cycle).\nFEC tissues can be identified as pale yellow, translucent spherical units 0.5-1.0 mm or smaller in diameter (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0003]).",
    "16. Use fine forceps to select FEC tissues from the colonies and transfer to fresh FEC induction plates to generate homogenous FEC tissues (Fig. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0003]). Place FEC tissues to generate colonies ∼0.5 cm in diameter, with 7-10 colonies per dish, and incubate at 28°C in low light (20 µMol m-2 s-1) for 21 days (3rd cycle).\nIt is recommended to use FEC tissues after three culture cycles on FEC induction medium for transformation with Agrobacterium. Tissues can be used after two culture cycles, but transformation efficiencies are often reduced. Subculturing FEC tissues for more than three cycles on FEC induction medium is not recommended, as it increases the frequency of offtype plants recovered.\nPrepare Agrobacterium suspension\n17. Streak an Agrobacterium glycerol stock on an LB plate containing the appropriate antibiotics. Incubate inverted for 48 hr at 28°C.\nFor LBA4404 carrying a pCAMBIA2300-based vector, use LB medium containing 30 mg/L rifampicin, 30 mg/L streptomycin, and 50 mg/L kanamycin.\n18. Take a single Agrobacterium colony and inoculate a culture tube containing 2 ml LB liquid medium with the same antibiotics. Incubate on a shaking incubator at 250 rpm and 28°C for 8-16 hr.\n19. Remove tube from shaker and allow any solids to settle. Take 0.5 ml and inoculate a 250-ml flask containing 20 ml YM liquid medium with the same antibiotics. Incubate overnight at 28°C with shaking at 250 rpm.\nYM medium is preferred for Agrobacterium LBA4404 liquid phases.\n20. Determine the optical density (OD600) using a spectrophotometer.\nA target OD600 of 0.5-1.0 should have been obtained. If an OD600 of 0.5 is not reached, continue growth and reassess at 2-hr intervals.",
    "21. Once an OD600 of 0.5 has been reached, transfer bacterial suspension to a sterile 50-ml tube and centrifuge 5 min at 8000 × g. Pour off supernatant and resuspend bacteria in 20 ml liquid inoculation medium. Repeat centrifugation and discard supernatant.\nUse a fresh sterile acetosyringone stock in the inoculation medium for each transformation experiment.\n22. Resuspend bacterial pellet in liquid inoculation medium at an OD600 of 0.5. Calculate the resuspension volume of medium (VR) using the formula:\n         \nVR = (VS × ODM)/ODT\nwhere VS is the starting volume (in ml) and ODM and ODT are the measured and target OD600 values. For example:\n         \nVR = (20 ml × 0.82)/0.5 = 32.8 ml\nInoculate FEC with Agrobacterium\n23. Remove 10-20 plates of FEC cultures from the growth chamber at the end of the 3rd cycle (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/af504da8-da74-4984-9798-f08a5c6efd47/cpz1620-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nTransformation with Agrobacterium and early selection stages for transgenic FEC.

(E) Pipetting FEC onto nylon mesh with sterile filter paper. (F) FEC tissues spread on multiple plates of callus selection medium.\n24. Using fine forceps and working under the dissection microscope, select and transfer good-quality FEC tissues to a fresh FEC induction plate.\nGood-quality FEC is pale yellow, translucent, friable, and grows prolifically (Fig. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0003]). Do not select callus tissue that is dark yellow or brown and non-friable in nature.\n25. Use forceps to gently mix the FEC and homogenize the tissue mass.\n26. Vortex the prepared Agrobacterium suspension for 10 s and dispense 2 ml to each well of a sterile 12-well plate.",
    "27. Using sterile forceps, transfer samples of homogenized FEC to each well (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0004]) until the bottom is covered (one sample is ∼0.5-0.7 cm3). Stir with a pipette tip.\nThe FEC within a well is considered one sample. Establish 3-7 replicate samples for each gene construct to be transformed in a given experiment.\n28. Place the lid on the plate and leave in the laminar flow hood for 30 min. Swirl gently by hand 2-3 times during this period to facilitate mixing.\nCo-culture FEC and Agrobacterium\n29. Place a piece of sterile nylon mesh on an empty sterile Petri dish lid.\n30. Use a 10-ml wide-bore pipette to extract the FEC/Agrobacterium suspension from one well.\n31. Touch the tip of the pipette to the mesh to prime it (so that moisture passes through the mesh), then transfer the tissue suspension onto the mesh.\n32. Use sterile forceps to gently spread the sample to make a monolayer on the mesh.\n33. Place the mesh with inoculated FEC on a co-culture plate (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0004]) and label the plate accordingly.\n34. Repeat steps 29-33 for each well individually.\n35. Seal plates with Parafilm or Saran Wrap and incubate for 2 days at 22°C under bright light (90 µMol m−2 s−1).\nWe have found co-culture under light promotes more efficient transformation than co-culture in the dark.\nAt the end of the co-culture period, transgenic single cells can be visualized under a fluorescence microscope if the gene construct carries a fluorescent marker such as GFP (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0005]) or DsRed.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b3bce79f-6840-42b1-b5c3-92564c4abd64/cpz1620-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

Place one sterile 15-ml plastic tube per FEC sample/plate in a test tube rack and label accordingly.\n37. Prepare a washing solution by adding 150 µl of 250 mg/ml carbenicillin to 250 ml GD2 liquid medium (final 150 mg/L carbenicillin). Pipette 8 ml to each 15-ml tube.\n38. Using sterile forceps, transfer FEC from each plate/mesh to its corresponding tube and vortex 30 s to mix and disaggregate the FEC.\n39. Allow tissues to settle for 10 min, then remove liquid using a sterile 10-ml pipette.\n40. Add 8 ml fresh GD2 liquid medium containing 150 mg/L carbenicillin to each tube, vortex again, and allow to settle for 10 min (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0004]).\n41. Record the volume of FEC in cubic centimeters that has settled to the bottom of the tube.\nRecording the settled cell volume (SCV) for each sample of transformed FEC allows subsequent determination of transformation efficiency. A sample will typically consist of 0.5-0.7 cc SCV.\n42. Place a sheet of sterile filter paper on an empty sterile Petri dish and then place a piece of sterile 100-μm nylon mesh on top of the filter paper.",
    "43. Use a 10-ml wide-bore pipette to extract 5 ml of medium from the first tube and discard, then transfer the remaining medium with FEC onto the nylon mesh, allowing the liquid medium to be absorbed into the filter paper (Fig. 4E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0004]).\n44. Use the pipette or sterile fine forceps to spread the FEC in a monolayer on the mesh.\n45. Transfer mesh with FEC to a fresh resting plate (Fig. 4F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0004]).\n46. Repeat steps 42-45 for all samples.\n47. Seal and label the plates appropriately and culture for 8 days at 28°C under low light (20 µMol m−2 s−1).\nA period of 7-8 days on resting medium without antibiotic selection is beneficial to allow the tissues to recover from the stress of co-culture with Agrobacterium. By the end of this period, and if the gene construct carries a marker such as GFP or DsRed, cell division, with 2-16 cell stages, should be visible under a fluorescence microscope.\nRecover transgenic tissues on callus selection medium\n48. Transfer FEC from the mesh/plates to separate 15-ml tubes containing 8 ml GD2 liquid medium containing 150 mg/L carbenicillin as above (see steps 36-38).\n49. Place four pieces of sterile nylon mesh on four separate sterile Petri dish lids. Use a 10-ml wide-bore pipette to extract the FEC from one tube and disperse equal portions across the four meshes.\n50. Transfer FEC to callus selection plates by inverting the mesh onto the medium. Using sterile forceps, gently press on the mesh to transfer all of the FEC (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0004]).\nEach FEC sample is spread evenly over four selection plates to ensure even exposure to antibiotic selection. This prevents the nursing effects of excessive tissue in a single location, which can result in recovery of non-transgenic “escape” plants.\n51. Repeat for each sample.",
    "52. Seal plates, label appropriately, and culture for 21 days at 28°C under low light (20 µMol m−2 s−1).\nRegenerate somatic embryos on stage 1 regeneration plates\n53. Under a dissecting microscope, identify healthy growing colonies of FEC.\nHealthy FEC colonies will be pale yellow compared to non-growing white or brown callus.\n54. Using sterile fine forceps, transfer about 10 healthy colonies to a stage 1 regeneration plate. Spread colonies evenly onto the medium to form distinct groups.\nEach FEC colony is considered to be a unique putative transgenic event. It should, therefore, be transferred separately and should not be mixed with other FEC colonies.\n55. Seal plates and place in the 28°C growth chamber in stacks of not more than three plates. Culture for 18-21 days under bright light (90 µMol m−2 s−1).\nMature somatic embryos on stage 2 regeneration plates\n56. Use sterile forceps and a dissection microscope to select and transfer healthy, growing, and developmentally advanced colonies showing the presence of torpedo to early cotyledon-stage embryos (Fig. 5E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0005]) to stage 2 regeneration plates, establishing a maximum of 4-6 colonies per plate.\nIf colonies do not show cotyledon-stage embryos, leave them for another 7-10 days before selecting and transferring.\nEach colony is now considered an independent transgenic event and should be assigned a unique tracking number. Colonies should be kept separated to avoid mixing putative transformation events. Placing more than six colonies per plate slows development of the somatic embryos and increases the risk of mixing the putative independent transgenic lines.\n57. Seal plates and culture for another 18-21 days following step 55.\nGerminate somatic embryos on germination plates\n58. Using a dissection microscope, look for somatic embryos that have developed distinct green cotyledons (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0006]-6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0006]).",
    "If green cotyledon-stage embryos have not developed after 18-21 days on stage 2 regeneration medium, or if more embryos are required, subculture tissues onto stage 3 regeneration medium and culture for another 18-21 days to encourage embryo maturation and production of green cotyledon-stage embryos before proceeding to the next step.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3485aa3e-6e6b-4a93-bc78-74d89f25d795/cpz1620-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nSomatic embryo maturation and regeneration of transgenic plants.

(D) Matured cotyledon-stage embryos developing on germination medium. (E) Shoot regeneration from cotyledon-stage embryo.\n59. Using fine forceps, pick individual cotyledon-stage embryos and trim away any adhering callus using a scalpel blade.\n60. Transfer individual embryos to germination plates and gently press into the medium until the underside of the cotyledons is in contact with the medium. Do not submerge the embryo.\n61. Place a maximum of 6 embryos from a given callus colony on a dish (Fig. 6D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0006]) and label with the line number.\nPlacing more than 6 embryos per Petri dish will slow maturation and delay germination.\n62. Seal plates and culture 18-21 days as in step 55 for embryos to mature and germinate (Fig. 6D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0006]).\nEstablishing regenerated plants on rooting medium\n63. Check for shoot production under a dissecting microscope.\nShoot production from cotyledon-stage embryos should commence 18-21 days after subculture onto germination medium. The germination process is not synchronous across all somatic embryos. If germination has not occurred by 28 days, place embryos on an empty Petri dish lid and cut away green cotyledon tissues and adhering callus, taking care not to damage the hypocotyl or apical regions. Place the trimmed somatic embryo on fresh germination plates and check every seven days for shoot development.",
    "64. Using sterile forceps and a scalpel blade, cut the stem of germinated plantlets just above the cotyledons (Fig. 6E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0006]). Transfer shoots onto MS2 agar plates, inserting stem ∼0.5 cm into the medium to initiate rooting and plant establishment.\n65. Allow plantlets to develop strong shoots and roots and then multiply by micropropagation as required (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0001]).\nAfter transgenic plant lines are recovered, molecular screening can be performed to confirm the presence and expression of transgenes, depending on the goals and needs. If phenotypic evaluation is required, follow Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0005] for transfer of in vitro plants to soil and establishment in the greenhouse.",
    "Although Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003] is a robust method for production of plants from cassava variety 60444, it must be adapted to regenerate transgenic plants of other genotypes. Changes include the use of alternative media for production of FEC target tissues (e.g., inclusion of tyrosine to encourage FEC production), adjusted Agrobacterium ODs and co-culture, and use of different antibiotics due to the toxicity of carbenicillin to cultivars other than 60444. Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-tbl-0002] lists the appropriate media for each step of the procedure, along with media composition, culture duration, and scale. The adjusted protocols have proved effective for recovery of transgenic plants in NASE 13, NASE 14, TME 204, TME 419, TME 3, TME 7, TME 14, TMS 01/0040, TMS 01/1206, TMS 91/02324, TMS 92/0326, and TMS 98/0505, plus additional East African landraces.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003])\nFEC induction post-mesh plates (see recipe)\nFEC proliferation plates (see recipe)\n100 mg/ml cefotaxime (see recipe)\nResting plates (see recipe) with cefotaxime\nCallus selection plates (see recipe) with cefotaxime\nStage 1 regeneration plates (see recipe) with timentin\nPrepare FEC for transformation\n1. Induce OES and prepare a meshed and homogenized OES sample as described (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003], steps 1-12).\n2. Using fine forceps, transfer meshed OES to an FEC induction post-mesh plate and arrange to form colonies of 10-15 fragments each. Establish 6-7 such colonies per plate.\nFor some cultivars (e.g., TME 7), addition of a higher concentration of tyrosine is better (500 µM instead of 250 μM). The optimal level of tyrosine (100-500 µM) should be determined empirically when commencing work with a new variety.\n3. Seal plates, label appropriately, and place in a 28°C chamber in the dark for 5 days.\nDark conditions are most easily achieved by placing sealed Petri dishes in cardboard or black plastic boxes.",
    "4. Using fine forceps, split each colony into two and subculture onto FEC proliferation plates, placing 6-7 colonies per plate. Seal plates and incubate for 28 days at 28°C in the dark (1st cycle).\n5. Use fine forceps to select FEC tissues from the colonies and transfer to fresh FEC proliferation plates. Do not subculture non-embryogenic tissues. Place FEC tissues to generate colonies ∼0.5 cm in diameter, with 6-7 such colonies per plate, and incubate at 28°C in the dark for 21 days (2nd cycle).\nFEC tissues can be identified as pale yellow, translucent spherical units 0.5-1.0 mm or smaller in diameter (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-fig-0003]).\n6. Use fine forceps to select FEC tissues from the colonies and transfer to fresh FEC proliferation plates. Place FEC tissues to generate colonies ∼0.5 cm in diameter, with 6-7 such colonies per dish, and incubate in the dark for 18-22 days (3rd cycle).\nPerform transformation\n7. Prepare Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 as described (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003], steps 17-22).\n8. Dilute Agrobacterium suspension by a factor of 10 with GD2 + 200 µM acetosyringone medium to reach an OD600 of 0.05.\nUse of Agrobacterium at this OD600 is highly effective for enhancing the efficiency of FEC transformation (Chauhan et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-bib-0007]).\n9. Inoculate and co-culture FEC with diluted Agrobacterium as described (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003], steps 23-35), but extend the inoculation period to 45 min and the co-culture period to 4 days.\nEstablish regenerated plants from transformed FEC\n10. Wash FEC and culture on resting medium as described (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003], steps 36-47) with the following modifications:\n         \na.Replace carbenicillin in washing solution (steps 37 and 40) and resting plates (step 45) with 125 mg/L cefotaxime (final concentration).",
    "Inclusion of 50 mg/L moxalactam in the resting medium has been found to be highly effective for enhancing transformation efficiency in some cultivars. It is not routinely added but is worth testing.\nb.In step 47, increase the culture time from 8 days to 10 days.\n11. Recover transgenic tissues on callus selection medium as described (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003], steps 48-52) with the following modifications:\n         \na.In step 48, replace carbenicillin in the liquid medium with 125 mg/L cefotaxime (final).\nb.In step 50, replace carbenicillin in callus selection plates with 125 mg/L cefotaxime and 27.5 µM paromomycin (final).\nSensitivity to paromomycin differs between cultivars. A lower concentration (25 µM) may be desirable at this stage for some cultivars (e.g., NASE 13) and should be tested empirically. Concentrations below 25 µM are not recommended due to the large proportion of non-transgenic escape plants that will be recovered.\n12. Regenerate and germinate somatic embryos as described (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003], steps 53-62), but replace carbenicillin in stage 1 regeneration plates with 30 mg/L timentin (final).\n13. Establish regenerated plants on rooting as described (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003], steps 63-65).\nAfter transgenic plant lines are recovered, molecular screening can be performed to confirm gene presence. Other studies may include gene copy number and gene expression levels, depending on the research goals. If phenotypic evaluation is required, proceed to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0005] for establishment of in vitro cultures in the greenhouse.",
    "Once transgenic plants have been obtained (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003] or Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0004]), there is often a need to establish them in soil for subsequent studies. Plants are micropropagated onto MS2 Gelzan medium and cultured for 3-4 weeks. It has been found to be highly beneficial to propagate plants in Gelzan prior to soil transfer. The use of 2.2 g/L Gelzan provides sufficient support for the plants but is soft enough for easy removal with minimal damage to the roots. Plants are then potted in soil and maintained at high humidity. This protocol describes the steps necessary for high efficiency transfer of plants from in vitro conditions to soil for growth in a greenhouse or growth chamber.\nMaterials\nIn vitro cassava plantlets (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0003] or Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0004])\nMS2 Gelzan plates (see recipe)\nBerger BM7 35% Bark HP (Hummert International, 10121500)\nGnatrol (Hummert International, 01-2035)\nNPK 15-5-15 fertilizer (Hummert International, 07-5902)\nMOST micronutrients (mix of soluble traces, Hummert International, 07-5990)\nSprint 330 chelated iron (Hummert International, 07-1511)\nNPK 10-30-20 fertilizer (Hummert International, 07-593300)\nNPK 15-16-17 fertilizer (optional; Hummert International, 07-592500)\n28°C greenhouse\n7.6-cm plastic pots (Hummert International, 11631100)\n27.8 × 54.5 × 6.2–cm tray with holes (1020 flat, Hummert International, 11-3000)\n27.8 × 54.5 × 6.2–cm tray without holes (NH flat, Hummert International, 11-3050)\n8-L watering can\nLow plastic dome (Hummert International, 11-3360)\nTall plastic dome (Humi-Dome, Hummert International, 14-3852-2)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for micropropagating in vitro plantlets (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0001])\nEstablish plants in MS2 Gelzan\n1. For each line to be propagated, micropropagate two ∼3-cm-tall plants (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-prot-0001]), trimming older leaves, into one MS2 Gelzan plate, spacing them evenly apart.",
    "Do not place more than three plantlets per plate. Restricting to two to three plantlets per dish allows robust shoot development and growth of relatively large plantlets well suited to survive transfer to soil.\n2. Label plates, seal, and place in a 28°C growth chamber under bright light (90 µMol m−2 s−1) for 4 weeks, stacking no more than two plates high.\nEstablish plants in soil\n3. Transfer plates to the potting area.\n4. Set up and label one 7.6-cm plastic pot for each plantlet to be potted. Keep pots for different lines separate to avoid mislabeling.\n5. Fill pots half full and at a slant with Berger BM7 35%, making sure that the soil is loose and has no large clumps. Place pots in a tray with holes.\n6. Add the following to an 8-L watering can and mix to dissolve completely:\n         \n7.6 L hand-warm tap water\n24 g Gnatrol\n12.5 g 15-5-15 fertilizer\n2.1 g micronutrients\n4.2 g Sprint 330\nGnatrol is recommended to control insects such as fungus gnats that are present in many greenhouses. An 8-L watering provides sufficient mixture for three trays containing 21 pots each. Scale appropriately.\n7. Pour mixture into a tray without holes until the liquid is just over the bottom of the pots and let soil become moist for ∼20 min.\n8. Remove lids from plates containing micropropagated plants and fill plates with warm water (33°-35°C).\nUse of warm water, not cold, prevents shocking of the delicate plantlets.\n9. Gently remove plants from plates by loosening the gel. Break up gel in spots free of roots first. Swirl plates to see if plants are loose and thus ready to be transferred. Use fingers to hold the root ball, taking care not to squeeze or damage the stem.",
    "Plantlets must be handled gently to ensure that stems are not crushed and roots are not broken.\n10. Lay each plant gently on the soil within a pot so that the apical meristem and 2-3 leaves are above the surface of the soil. Fill pot gently with Berger BM7 35%.\nBecause roots will develop from portions of the stem buried below the soil, it is beneficial to place the plantlet deep into the pot and cover the lower stem with soil so the plant will be anchored firmly and more roots will be available for water and nutrient uptake. This also ensures that all plants established in soil at the same time will be of similar height and more uniform for use in experiments.\n11. Water plants using a gentle stream from a hose. Place a low dome over pots to prevent wilting. Let tray sit in the Gnatrol mixture for 30 min until soil is saturated.\n12. Remove the tray and drain away all water and Gnatrol mixture.\n13. Replace low dome with a tall dome and place trays containing plants on a bench to provide 100% humidity. Allow plants to grow 7 days with at least 12 hr light, day temperature 26°C, and night temperature 25°C.\n14. Remove trays containing plants from mist bench, puncture the tall dome, and place on the open greenhouse bench. Grow for 5-10 days with 12 hr light, day temperature 27°-32°C, night temperature 21°-26°C, relative humidity 60%-70%.\nProvide supplemental lighting if naturally available light drops below 500 W/m2. This is provided by 1000-W metal halide fixtures generating light intensity of ∼145-165 W/m2.\n15. Remove dome gradually once leaves are fully expanded and plants look hardy. Arrange pots in the greenhouse with 10-15 cm spacing to allow vigorous growth.",
    "16. Once established, water plants with micronutrients 28 days after transfer to soil following manufacturer instructions.\n17. Apply 10-30-20 fertilizer (following manufacturer instructions) to hardened plants on the open bench as liquid feed each time a plant is watered until the plant has been in soil for 4-5 weeks. Then reduce fertilizer application to three times per week, watering on other occasions with regular water.\n18. After 5 weeks, if production of storage roots is required, switch fertilizer to 15-16-17 fertilizer and apply three times per week (Taylor et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.620#cpz1620-bib-0031])."
