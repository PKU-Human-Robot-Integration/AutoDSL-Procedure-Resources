    "Day 1: Plating and polarizing cellsTrypsinizationAspirate MDCK-II growth media from the stock cell culture flask used for passaging. For a T-75 flask of MDCK-II cells, add 5-10 ml of warmed, sterile PBS. Gently tilt/rotate flask to wash the cells. Remove PBS.For a T-75 flask, add 3 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA. Tilt/rotate flask to make sure cell surface is evenly coated.Return to a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 under humidified conditions for 5-10 min.Observe under a light microscope with phase contrast. If cells are properly detached, they will appear round and floating in suspension.Collect cell suspension in conical tube and pipet cells 6-8 times up and down. No clumps should be observed. Cell suspension should be a homogeneous mixture. Add MDCK-II cells at a density of 200,000 cells in 200 μl in complete growth media (see Recipes) to the apical side of a Transwell® insert (12-well 0.4 μm pore size Transwell®-65 mm). In addition, 1 ml complete growth media is added to the basolateral chamber.Two Transwell® inserts are prepared for (Untreated) controls, 2 Transwell® inserts for reporter peptide, and 2 Transwell® per glycosphingolipid-peptide fusion tested. Each condition is tested as biological duplicates (i.e., 2 Transwell® inserts per condition). Experiments must always include untreated and reporter-peptide controls.Incubate the plate for 2-3 days to allow for polarization at 37 °C with 5% CO2 under humidified conditions.Day 3: Preparation of testing glycosphingolipid compoundsCentrifuge the tube containing lyophilized compound at 13,000 rpm (~13,800 x g) for 3 min to pellet the material to the bottom of tube.Add 1 part volume of DMF (actual volume depends on stock concentration–for our compounds, this is ~60 μl), sonicate for 30-60 sec, followed by ~5 sec vortex. Notes: Sonication is done in a bath sonicator (VWR, AquaSonic, model  50T  ).",
    "You want to reach a high final concentration in the ~50-200 μM range (in a tube containing approximately 100 μg of lyophilized peptide [MW ~2,103], add 50 μl of DMF and 100 μl of water to obtain a stock solution in the ~50-200 μM range). The concentration of all test compounds is determined using NanoDrop (For the Alexa Flour 488 used in our studies, we use absorbance at 495 nm). The solution may appear cloudy and orange-red at this point. Add 2 parts H2O (for example 120 μl water to give a final volume of 180 μl) followed by a quick 5 sec vortex to reach a final 33% DMF in H2O.Notes: The solution should be bright green and clear of particulates. If it is orange, then add either more DMF or H2O until it turns green. (The color change we observed is for an Alexa Flour 488 attached to the reporter peptide)  At this point, this stock solution will be used to make the final dilution into “Apical” media for adding onto cells. To prepare this Apical test solution, dilute the appropriate volume of stock into Apical Solution (see Recipes) to reach a final concentration of 0.1 μM. Note: The goal is to have a final 1:1 ratio of lipid to dfBSA. Transcytosis in MDCKII cellsCheck electrical resistance of MDCK-II Transwell® inserts after 2-3 days using EVOM Epithelial Voltohmmeter to measure integrity of tight junctions. Note: Acceptable electrical resistances of MDCK-II monolayers used for transcytosis experiments is in the 250Ω-300Ω range. Prepare apical and basolateral solutions (see Recipes).Wash transwells 2 times using serum-free DMEM. Replace media with apical (200 μl) and basolateral (1 ml) solutions in the respective chamber. Allow cells to equilibrate for 15 min in a 37 °C/5% CO2 cell culture incubator.",
    "Replace apical chamber with 200 μl apical solution containing 0.1 μM reporter peptide or 0.1 μM glycosphingolipid fusion.Note: Reporter peptide and glycosphingolipid fusion stocks range from 30 μM to 150 μM in 33% DMF/66% H2O.  Incubate for 3 h in a 37 °C/5% CO2 cell culture incubator.To quantify transcytosed peptide and lipid-peptide fusions, collect basolateral media in pre-labeled Eppendorf tubes and proceed to streptavidin pull-down assay. To calculate the apparent permeability coefficient (PAPP, cm/sec), apical chamber solution is also collected in pre-labeled Eppendorf tubes. A standard curve ranging from 0 nM to 200 nM is used to interpolate concentration of peptide or lipid-peptide fusion in apical chamber after 3 h.Streptavidin Pull-down Assay of basolateral media samplesWash Streptavidin magnetic beads 3 times with TBS-T.Notes:Beads are never vortexed. They are brought into solution in stock tube by gentle inverting. Ten microliter beads are needed per sample. Example: For 12 samples, place 120 μl Streptavidin beads in an Eppendorf tube and wash 3 times each with 1 ml TBS-T using magnetic rack. Resuspend 10 μl beads in 50 μl TBS then add to 1 ml basolateral sampleExample: For 12 samples, resuspend 120 μl Streptavidin beads by adding 600 μl TBS. Then, add 50 μl Streptavidin beads to each basolateral sample. Incubate basolateral samples with streptavidin beads overnight at 4 °C with head-over rotation covered in foil.Day 4: Elution and read-out of basolateral samplesCollect the beads using a magnetic rack and wash 3 times with TBS-T.Note: Each wash is done with 1 ml TBS-T and beads mixed by inverting. Bound peptide or lipid-peptide fusions are eluted from beads by addition of 220 μl elution buffer (See Recipes) and boiling.Notes:Invert the beads to ensure that they are in solution. After beads are in solution, boil for 2 min at 65 °C in a heat block.",
    "After boiling, collect the beads using a magnetic rack. Pipet 100 μl of each sample x 2 (technical replicates) on a black 96-well plate.Fluorescence is read on a TECAN Spark microplate reader for Alexa-488 channel and against a standard curve for each compound. Settings:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015030543_7950.jpgSample standard curves (Figure 4)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015030456_0184.jpgFigure 4.
