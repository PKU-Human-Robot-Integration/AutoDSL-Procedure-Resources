    "This protocol demonstrates how to continuously assess adherence to the MedDiet by means of tailored EMAs. This protocol has been reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee of the Hospital del Mar: CEIm-PSMAR (reference number: 2019/8972).\n1. Study design: Sampling protocol\nDetermine the number of days to assess the dietary intake; a minimum of 1 week is required to obtain the first score and, therefore, ensure that the total number of days is adapted on a 7-days basis (e.g., 4 weeks of assessment to obtain the MedDiet adherence score over a month).\n\tNOTE: The determination of the number of days is closely related to the aim of the study. In studies monitoring the adherence to the MedDiet exclusively, short periods of time such as 2 weeks is recommended. In the case of intervention studies aimed at improving MedDiet adherence, longer periods of evaluation are recommended.\nDetermine the number of waves for the study (e.g., two monitoring periods of two weeks separated by a month). In the case of longitudinal studies, the evaluation of MedDiet adherence can be integrated in the repeated sampling of volunteers.\n\t​NOTE: We leave the decision of the number of waves to the researcher's criteria. This decision is likely going to be subject to a set of appraisal criteria such as the aim of the survey in the context of the study, the type of volunteers among others. Based on the literature, most of the studies monitor during only one period, while some other included up to 8 waves of data collection. Studies with more than one monitoring period had smaller duration than those with only one monitoring period8.\nDetermine the schedule of the delivery of EMAs (e.g., every evening at 21:00h).",
    "Determine the latency of EMAs; as in the amount of time given to the volunteers to answer the questions (e.g., 2 h).\n2. Selection of participants\nDefine the inclusion criteria for the participants' selection.\n\t\nEnsure that participants possess a smartphone.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, the study can provide smartphones in cases where participants do not have one.\nEnsure participants have good internet connection on their smartphone.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, the study can provide internet connection to the participants.\nDefine the exclusion criteria for the participant's selection.\n\t\nDo not include participants who are illiterate and/or do not have digital skills.\nDo not include participants residing in environments without internet connection.\nSelect study participants based on the inclusion exclusion criteria.\n3. Meeting with the participants before the assessment\nSchedule an introduction session with the participants.\nExplain in detail how to answer daily questions, emphasizing how they will receive notifications, how to respond to EMAs and the amount of time required to respond.\n\t\nInform them that they will receive the questions in their phone via SMS. The SMS has attached a specific link that leads to the questionnaire. Each link is specific for the volunteer and the day.\nIntroduce participants to the 8 EMA questions, explain which foods belong and do not belong to each category and describe the serving sizes when appropriate (Table 1).\nTo ensure the correct comprehension of EMAs, prepare a pilot test with participants, providing them with an example of a diet and enabling them to respond to EMAs based on the presented example.\n\t\nPrepare an example of a diet of an individual describing specifically the types of food consumed and portion sizes. An example has been included as supplementary material.\nProvide the example to the participants via email and ask them to read it carefully.",
    "Give the volunteers the 8 questions included in the EMA survey on an online form and ask them to answer them based on the diet example given. The online form consists of 8 multiple-choice questions and volunteers must be identified with their id study number.\nCorrect the questions and return a personalized feedback via email to each volunteer, with an explanation of the mistakes done.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nQuestion Nº,Food categories enquired,Food included,Food excluded of the group,Servings (s)\nQ1,Extra virgin olive oil,Extra virgin olive oil,Olive oil,Not applicable\nQ1,(EVOO),Extra virgin olive oil,Olive oil,Not applicable\nQ2,Vegetables,\"Salads, cooked vegetables, “sofrito”, frozen vegetables...\",\"Potato, sweet potatoes, peas...\",1 s = 200g grams\nQ2,Vegetables,\"Salads, cooked vegetables, “sofrito”, frozen vegetables...\",\"Potato, sweet potatoes, peas...\",½ s = Side dish\nQ3,Fruit,\"All fruit including raw, cooked…\",\"Juices, yogurt with fruits, jam…\",\"1 s = 1 medium piece, 1 slice of melon/ watermelon, 2-3 small pieces…\"\nQ4,Whole-grain food,All whole grain products,Refined cereals and non-whole grain multigrain products,Not applicable\nQ5,Sugary drinks (including juices),\"Soft drinks with and without sugar, natural and packaged juice\",Water and alcoholic drinks,1 s = 1 glass\nQ6,Legumes,\"Dried and cooked legumes, peas, tofu…\",Corn,1 s = 150 g\nQ6,Nuts,All nuts,Dried fruit,1 s = 25 g\nQ7,Sweets,Home-made and industrial baking,,Not applicable\nQ8,Fish and seafood,\"All types: raw, frozen, canned, smoked…\",Surimi and derivates,1 s fish = 100-150 g\nQ8,Fish and seafood,\"All types: raw, frozen, canned, smoked…\",Surimi and derivates,1 s seafood = 200 g\nQ8,Red meat,\"Bovine, game, viscera, duck…\",\"Chicken, turkey, lean pork cuts\",1 s = 100 – 150 g\nQ8,Processed meat,\"Sausages, ham, mince, or cured meat…\",-,1 s = 50 g\nQ: Question; s: Serving,Q: Question; s: Serving,Q: Question; s: Serving,Q: Question; s: Serving,Q: Question; s: Serving\nTable 1: List of food categories enquired, detailing examples of food products included and excluded, and the size of the serving reported.\n4.

The score has a maximum of 11 points. Additionally, translate the score into a percentage and classify into the following MedDiet adherence levels:\n\tWeekly score ≤ 5 points (≤ 45%): Low adherence to the MedDiet\n\tWeekly score > 5 and < 8 points (< 73%): Moderate adherence to the MedDiet\n\tWeekly score ≥ 8 points (≥ 73%): High adherence to the MedDiet\nAssess the compliance rate of the participants by means of the calculation of the accuracy of data of the week using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62161/62161eq01v2.jpg\nNumber of EMAs answered: total number of EMA prompts completely answered\nNumber of EMAs delivered: total number of EMA prompts send to the participants: 4 prompts x 7 days of the week =28",

Low accuracy percentages indicate low compliance of the participants and hence the quality of the data obtained is poor and probably not representative.\nSend personalized feedback to the participant by email; including the weekly score and the score achieved in each food category.
