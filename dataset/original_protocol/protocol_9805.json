    "The material used in the study was collected under a specific protocol, which was approved by the local ethics committee. Written informed consent from all patients was available.\n1. Histological and immunophenotypical revision of tissue specimens\nNOTE: An expert pathologist is responsible for activities described hereafter.\nHistopathological revision of selected cases according to well-established diagnostic criteria.\n\t\nUse the microtome to cut 4−5 µm thick tissue sections from representative FFPE tissue blocks and mount the sections on standard histology slides.\nPerform hematoxylin and eosin staining for each slide using an automated tissue slide stainer (Table of Materials).\nReview the histopathological diagnosis of the selected tumor cases according to WHO diagnostic criteria.\n\t\tNOTE: At this stage, the pathologist might identify morphologically distinct areas of the tumor within the same tissue section. It is possible to harvest those areas separately (see section 2). Histological resemblance of tumor and normal cells for SPNs is provided in Figure 2.\nPerform immunohistochemical staining for established markers to complement histological analysis and estimate immunophenotypic heterogeneity.\n\t\tNOTE: The pathologist might identify immunophenotypically distinct areas of the tumor within the same tissue section. It is possible to harvest those areas separately (see section 2).\nEvaluate neoplastic cellularity of the tumor tissue section and plan manual microdissection accordingly.\n\tNOTE: This is a pathologist-generated estimate of tumor cellularity.\n\t\nIf neoplastic cell content of the tissue section is higher than 70%, manual microdissection is not mandatory; move directly to step 3.1.\n\t\tNOTE: Target 70% of neoplastic cell content in order to (i) ensure adequate sensitivity for mutant allele frequency estimates and (ii) to possibly validate clonal mutations by less sensitive methodologies (e.g., capillary sequencing).\nIf neoplastic cell content of the tissue section is lower than 70%, microdissection is necessary and move to step 2.",
    "Evaluate tissue sections from the FFPE block where non-neoplastic tissue has been sampled. This tissue is used as a source of germline DNA.\n\tNOTE: Blood is an alternative source of germline DNA. In this case, proceed with DNA extraction as recommend in the note of step 4.1.\n\t\nIf only non-neoplastic tissue is visible in the tissue section (Figure 2D), manual microdissection is not needed; move directly to step 3.1.\nIf substantial contamination from neoplastic cells is present in the tissue section, then manual microdissection is necessary; move to section 2.\n2. Manual microdissection\nNOTE: This method is applicable to various solid tumor types, and it is intended to increase neoplastic cells content of tissue specimens. Alternatively, this method can be used to harvest morphologically and/or immunophenotypically distinct areas within the same tissue section.\nUsing a microtome, cut up to ten 4−6 μm thick FFPE tumor tissue sections and mount them on uncharged slides.\n\tNOTE: If only one 1 mm2 nest of cancers cells is visible in the specimen, 10 tissue slides should be cut and subjected to manual microdissection in order to obtain the targeted amount of DNA (40 ng); this assuming that 1 mm2 cluster contains between 700 and 1000 tumor nuclei.\nIncubate slides at 60 °C for 10 min.\nPlace the slides in a rack, and perform the following washes: xylene for 20 min, 100% ethanol for 10 min, 80% ethanol for 10 min, 70% ethanol for 10 min, distilled water for 1 min, hematoxylin counterstain for 10 s, tap water for 1 min.\nOn a standard inverted microscope, use a 27 G needle on a syringe as the microdissection tool and collect representative clusters of tumor cells. Harvest a minimum of ten 1 mm2 clusters of cells to ensure the required amount of DNA for sequencing.",
    "NOTE: If morphologically distinct areas are intended to be analyzed as different entities, then use the microdissection tool to harvest those areas separately.\nPlace harvested clusters in 1.5 mL tubes (Table of Materials) previously filled with 20 μL of protease K and 180 μL of lysis buffer (Table of Materials, both included in the DNA extraction kit) and mix by vortexing.\n3. Processing of tissues without prior microdissection\nNOTE: This procedure is used for tissue blocks that contain only non-neoplastic cells (source of germline DNA) or contain at least 70% of morphologically homogenous cancer cells.\nUsing a microtome cut up to six 4−5 µm thick tissue sections from selected FFPE tissue blocks. Place tissue scrolls in 1.5 mL tubes as described in step 2.5.\n4. DNA extraction from normal and neoplastic cells\nPurify DNA from normal and neoplastic tissue using the DNA FFPE tissue extraction kit (Table of Materials) according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n\tNOTE: When blood is used as a source of germline nucleic acid, purify DNA using a DNA blood extraction kit (Table of Materials).\nDNA quantification and quality check\n\t\nTo quantify the amount of double-stranded (dsDNA), add an aliquot of the DNA sample to a solution containing a fluorescent nucleic acid stain (Table of Materials) and measure emitted fluorescence using a benchtop fluorometer (Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: The assay measures the intensity of the fluorescent signal emitted from fluorescent dyes attached to dsDNA and determines the amount of DNA using a standard curve.\nUse a microvolume spectrophotometer (Table of Materials) to measure the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios of the sample in order to qualify DNA. “Pure” DNA should have a 260/280 of 1.8 and a 260/230 in the range of 1.8−2.2.",
    "NOTE: Spectrophotometric evaluation of the sample is intended to evidence the presence of chemical contaminants (e.g., phenol) that impact downstream reactions. In the event of contamination due to chemical reagents, perform a cleanup step using a column-based kit.\n5. Library preparation and quantification\nNOTE: The schematic flowchart of library preparation and quantification steps is reported in Figure 3.\nDNA library preparation (4 primer pools set up for each sample)\n\tNOTE: The 4 primer pools belong to the cancer panel reported in Table of Materials. Each pool contains primer pairs that are designed for a multiplexed target selection of 409 genes. A link to the list of genes composing the NGS panel is provided in Table of Materials.\n\t\nPrepare four DNA target amplification reactions for each sample, one per primer pool. For each primer pool (Table of Materials), add in a 0.2 mL tube (Table of Materials): 4 μL of master mix (Table of Materials, included in the library kit), 10 μL of high fidelity primer pool mix (Table of Materials, included in the cancer panel library), and 6 μL of DNA (10 ng total).\nAmplify target regions of each primer pool separately in four 1.5 mL tubes running the following program: hold at 99 °C for 2 min (activation of the hot-start polymerase), 16 cycles (denature at 99 °C for 15 s, anneal and extend at 60 °C for 8 min), hold at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Stopping point. Store target amplification reactions at 4 °C overnight or at -20 °C for longer time.\nPartial digestion of amplicons ends\n\t\tNOTE: The manual provided by the NGS manufacturer kit foresees a step in which the different amplification reactions from each sample are combined before partial digestion. Avoid that step and keep processing each amplification digestion separately.",
    "Add 2 μL of specific digestion mix (Table of Materials, included in the library kit) to each amplified pool of each sample (the total volume of each 0.2 mL tube is 22 μL). Vortex thoroughly and centrifuge each tube to collect droplets.\nLoad the tubes into the thermal cycler and run the following program: 50 °C for 10 min, 55 °C for 10 min, 60 °C for 20 min, 10 °C hold (for up to 1 h).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Stopping point. Store plate at -20 °C for longer periods.\nLigate adapters to amplicons and purify.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a different barcode adapter for each sample when sequencing multiple libraries on a single chip. All four amplification reactions from the same sample must receive the same barcode.\n\t\t\nPrepare adapters (Table of Materials, barcodes adapters kit). For each barcode X, prepare a mix of P1 adapter and unique barcode adapters (Table of Materials) at a final dilution of 1:4. Mix 4 µL of water with 2 µL of P1 adapter and 2 µL of unique barcode adapters. Use 2 µL of this barcode adapter mix for downstream passages.\nPerform the ligation reaction by adding to each amplified pool of each sample in this order: 4 μL of switch solution (Table of Materials, included in the library kit), 2 µL of barcode adapter mix and 2 µL of DNA ligase (Table of Materials, included in the library kit) (total volume = 30 µL).\nVortex thoroughly and briefly centrifuge to collect droplets.\nLoad each tube into the thermal cycler and run the following program: 22 °C for 30 min, 68 °C for 5 min, 72 °C for 5 min, 4 °C hold (for up to 24 h).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Stopping point. Store plate at -20 °C for longer periods.\nLibrary purification and amplification",
    "Centrifuge each tube and then transfer each barcoded sample in a 1.5 mL tube. Add 45 µL of beads-based purification reagent (Table of Materials) to each pool of each sample. Pipet up and down 5x to mix the bead suspension with the DNA.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature (RT), then place each tube in a magnetic rack and incubate for 2 min. Carefully remove and discard supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd in each tube 150 μL of fresh 70% ethanol. Wash the beads moving each tube side-to-side of the two positions of the magnet. Discard the supernatant and pay attention not to disturb the pellet.\nRepeat procedures described in step 5.1.5.3 and then keep the tubes in the magnet and air-dry the beads at RT for 5 min.\nRemove tubes with purified libraries of each primer pool from the magnet and add 50 μL of high-fidelity PCR Mix (Table of Materials) and 2 μL of library amplification primer mix (Table of Materials, included in the library kit) to the beads pellet of each tube.\nVortex each 1.5 mL tube and briefly centrifuge to collect droplets.\nPlace 1.5 mL tubes in the magnet for 2 min and carefully transfer the supernatant (~50 μL) from each tube to a new 0.2 mL tube without disturbing the pellet.\nAmplify libraries of each primer pool running the following program: hold at 98 °C for 2 min to activate the enzyme, 5 cycles (denature at 98 °C for 15 s, anneal and extend at 64 °C 1 min), hold at 4 °C. Store samples at -20 °C.\nPurification of amplified library\n\t\t\nCentrifuge each tube to collect the contents at the bottom and transfer each amplified library sample to a 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Add 25 μL of beads-based purification reagent. Pipet up and down 5x to mix the bead suspension with the DNA.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at RT, and then place tubes into the magnet for 5 min.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant, which contains the amplicons, from each tube to new tubes without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd 60 μL of beads-based purification reagent to the supernatant of each tube and pipet up and down in order to mix bead suspension and DNA.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at RT and then place the tubes in the magnet for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant from each tube and pay attention not to disturb the pellet.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The amplicons are bound to the beads.\nAdd in each tube 150 μL of fresh 70% ethanol. Wash the beads moving the tubes side-to-side in the two positions of the magnet. Discard the supernatant and pay attention not to disturb the pellet.\nRepeat the procedure in step 5.1.6.8 and air dry the beads at RT for 3 min. Avoid excessive drying of the beads.\nRemove the tubes from the magnet and add 50 μL of low Tris EDTA (TE) (Table of Materials, included in the library kit) to the pellet to disperse the beads.\nPipet the mixture up and down several times and incubate at RT for 2 min.\nPlace the tubes in the magnet for at least 2 min and carefully transfer the supernatant, which contains the amplicons, to new tubes without disturbing the beads.\nLibrary quantification\n\t\nUse a fragment analysis instrument (Table of Materials) to run a DNA chip according to high sensitivity DNA kit protocol.\n6. Libraries pooling and sequencing run",
    "Dilute each library to 100 pM with nuclease-free water. Combine 10 μL of each 100 pM libraries for a single run in a single tube. Mix the combined libraries by pipetting and proceed to templating and sequencing.\nPlanned run creation\n\tNOTE: A typical run includes four samples that can be loaded on two different types of semiconductor chip (Ion PI chip or Ion 540 chip) based on the sequencer available in the laboratory (Ion Proton System or GeneStudio S5 System, Table of Materials). These systems typically produce 80 million reads per run.\n\t\nOpen the Torrent Browser on a computer connected to the sequencing system (e.g., Ion Chef System) and plan a new run using the generic template for the selected application (AmpliSeqDNA).\nSwitch to the Kits tab of the plan. Select Ion Proton System or Ion GeneStudio S5 System from the instrument dropdown list based on the sequencing system being used.\nDepending on the sequencing system, select the appropriate chip (PI chip for Ion Proton Systems; 540 chip for Ion GeneStudio S5 Systems) from the Chip Type dropdown list.\nSelect Ion AmpliSeq 2.0 Library Kit from the Library Kit dropdown list.\nSelect the Ion Chef button for Template Kit, then select the appropriate Chef Kit (Ion PI Hi-Q Chef Kit for PI chip or Ion 540 Kit-Chef for 540 chip) from the Template Kit dropdown list.\nSelect the appropriate sequencing kit (Ion PI Hi-Q Sequencing 200 Kit for PI chip or Ion S5 Sequencing Kit for 540 chip) from the Sequencing Kit dropdown list, then select IonXpress from the Barcode Set dropdown list.\nSwitch to the Plugin tab and select the Coverage Analysis plugin.",
    "Switch to the Plan tab. Select the GRCh37/hg19 genome from the Reference Library dropdown list. From the Target Regions dropdown list, select the appropriate panel to be sequenced.\nSet the number of barcodes to be sequenced and the label of the library sample tubes into the appropriate fields.\nSet the barcode name and sample name for each library.\nSample libraries dilution and loading.\n\t\nDilute the stock library with nuclease-free water to 25 pM for PI chip or 32 pM for 540 chip.\nPipet 50 μL of each diluted library to the bottom of the appropriate library sample tube.\nTurn on the sequencing system and follow the on-screen instructions to load all required reagents and to import the run plan.\nLoad the library sample tube containing the pooled libraries and start clonal amplification program.\n\t\tNOTE: The Ion Chef System requires two chips to be prepared per run.\nSequencing on Ion Proton or Ion GeneStudio S5.\n\t\nTurn on the sequencing system and follow the on-screen instructions to initialize the sequencing and to import the run plan.\nLoad the sequencing chip after removing it from the sequencing system .\n\t\tNOTE: Be grounded before picking up a chip in order to avoid chip damage due to electrostatic discharge. Chip handling/positioning along with examples of successful/unsuccessful loading are reported in Figure 4.\nClose the chip compartment lid and wait until the Chip Status icon indicates \"Ready\".\nEmpty the waste container when the first run is complete, then sequence the remaining chip as soon as possible.\n7. Mutations and copy-number variations (CNVs) analysis\nNOTE: Alignment of sequencing data to the GRCh37/hg19 human reference genome is automatically performed once set in the Plan (step 6.2.8).\nUse the Coverage Analysis plugin (Table of Materials) output to verify depth of coverage and uniformity.",
    "Perform the variant calling using the Torrent variant caller plugin (Table of Materials), selecting the germline or somatic workflow as appropriate.\nDownload filtered variants Variant Call Format (VCF) files. Annotate variants using the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) software6 and NCBI RefSeq database.\nLoad sequencing data on the Ion Reporter Software using the Ion Reporter uploader plugin and use the Comprehensive Cancer Panel tumor-normal pair workflow to analyze the data in order to estimate CNVs.\nManually filter mutations and CNVs based on scores assigned by the software and verify them visually with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)7.\n\t\nVisually inspect the alignment for unusual reads (due to, for example, mispriming, overamplification or reads soft-clipping) that may generate artefactual calls.\nVerify CNVs by inspecting the normalized coverage for all amplicons across a given gene against the normalized coverage of the baseline.\n\t\tNOTE: This helps correcting false calls due to the segmentation software, which sometimes calls a CNV based on symmetrically abnormal coverage of few amplicons at the end of one gene and at the beginning of the successive gene.\nIndexing of somatic mutations\n\t\nFor each case, index mutation calls from sequencing of normal tissue/blood, primary tumor and metastases.\nFlag as germline and discard the calls that are also evident from sequencing data of germline DNA.\nFlag as clonal/founder the mutations that are shared among all lesions of a given patient.\nFlag as subclonal/progressor the mutations that are detected in some but not all lesions of a given patient.\n8. Immunophenotypic analysis: immunohistochemistry for relevant protein expression\nNOTE: Immunohistochemistry was used to validate the functional consequences of inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes.\nUsing a microtome, cut 3−4 μm thick FFPE tissue sections and mount them on charged slides and incubate slides at 60 °C for 10 min.",
