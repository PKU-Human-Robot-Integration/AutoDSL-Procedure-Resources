    "1. Preparation\nAsk the participant to fill out a safety screening form (see e.g. 21). Note: Participants who have contraindications for TMS should not be stimulated; the most common contraindications are: lack of sleep, medication (e.g. antidepressants), and a family history of epilepsy.\nExplain the TMS procedure and the experimental details to the participant and obtain informed consent.\nUsing alcohol, clean the skin above the belly of the FDI muscle in the right hand and in the reference site (e.g. tendon of the FDI muscle) and attach electrodes on these sites.\nClean the skin on the right side of the OO muscle with alcohol and attach one electrode to the right corner of the upper lip and one electrode to the right corner of the lower lip.\nClean the skin around the site for the ground electrode (e.g. on the forehead) and attach the electrode.\nConnect the wires of electrodes into an electrode box attached to an EMG recording system.\nCheck the EMG signals recorded from the hand and lip muscles when the participant is contracting and relaxing these muscles (by visually inspecting them using e.g. Spike2 software). If the signals look noisy when the participant relaxes the lip and hand muscles, twist the electrode cables, re-clean the skin at the electrode site and/or ask the participant to uncross their legs, remove their shoes and have their feet on the floor (better grounding).\nProtect the participant's hearing by using earplugs.\nPut the cap on the participant's head in order to be able to mark the position of the TMS coil.\n2. Localization of Motor Hand Representation",
    "Mark the vertex on the cap (by attaching a little sticker or by using a pen) and measure the distance from the vertex to the left preauricular point. Move 33% of this distance from the vertex towards the left preauricular point and mark this spot.\nPlace the center of the figure-of-eight TMS coil on this spot. Orient the handle of the coil 45 degrees from the midline.\nDeliver the first TMS pulse e.g. by pressing a foot pedal. Choose a low intensity (e.g. 40% of the max stimulator intensity) if the participant's motor threshold is not known. Move the coil slightly and/or increase the intensity, if no MEP or muscle twitch is visible in the hand.\nWhen an MEP is elicited, keep moving the coil in 5-mm steps around this area in order to find an appropriate \"hot spot\", i.e. the site and coil orientation that elicits the maximal MEPs at a certain intensity. Keep at least a 5-sec break between the pulses. Observe the participants hand to check which muscles twitch. When the spot in which the MEPs are the largest is found, mark this \"hot spot\" and the orientation of the coil on the cap.\n3. Localization of Motor Lip Representation\nMark a spot 2-3 cm from the FDI spot along a straight line towards the corner of the left eye (the location of the motor representation is more anterior and inferior than that of the hand representation).\nPlace the coil on this spot. Ask the participant to purse the lip muscles; this lowers the motor threshold and, therefore, makes it easier to find the motor lip representation.",
    "Tell the participant that the TMS pulses may feel more intense in this location than in the previous location and that s/he may feel twitches in his/her face (due to peripheral stimulation) and involuntary eye-blinks. Ask the participant to inform the experimenter at any point if the stimulation becomes unpleasant or painful or if they wish to stop the stimulation.\nDeliver the first pulses. If no MEPs are elicited, move the coil slightly and/or increase the intensity. Keep at least a 5-sec break between the pulses. When an MEP is elicited, keep moving the coil around this area in 5-mm steps in order to find a \"hot spot\" for the OO muscle. Note: The shape of the lip MEPs is often multiphasic and their shape can vary from participant to participant. Also, the motor threshold is often higher for the lip muscle than for the hand muscles.\n4. Defining Intensity for Single Pulse Experiments\nTrain the participant to maintain a constant level of contraction, if MEPs will be recorded from contracted lip muscles. Note: Providing visual feedback about the power of the EMG signal (e.g. by using Spike2 software) helps during the training; training can be stopped when the participant is able keep the level of contraction stable for at least 1 min.",
    "Place the coil on the hot spot for the OO muscle. Deliver 10 pulses with fixed intensity. Keep at least a 5-sec break between the pulses. Estimate the sizes of MEPs by visually inspecting them. Increase the intensity, if MEPs are very small or there was no MEP on every trial. Deliver 10 pulses again. Keep increasing the intensity until a robust MEP is elicited on every trial (e.g. with amplitude of approximately 0.3 mV when the lip muscle is relaxed or with amplitude of approximately 1 mV when the lip muscle is contracted). Use this intensity during the single-pulse experiment. Note: It is a good practice to report stimulator intensities in publications.\n5. Defining Active Motor Threshold for rTMS Experiments\nAsk the participant to contract the lip muscles as hard as they can. Determine the amplitude of this maximal contraction (by visually inspecting the EMG signal).\nAsk the participant to reduce the contraction of the lips. Guide him/her to reach the contraction level that is roughly 20% of the maximum. Ask the participant to keep this level for 1 min. Give him/her a short break and repeat the practice as many times as needed. Note: Providing visual feedback about the power of the EMG signal (e.g. by using Spike2 software) helps during the training; training can be stopped when the participant is able keep the level of contraction stable for at least 1 min.",
    "Deliver 10 pulses over the hotspot for OO while the participant is contracting the lip at 20% of the maximum. Count how many MEPs were elicited. If there was an MEP (with peak-to-peak amplitude of at least 0.2 mV) in fewer than 5 out of 10 trials, increase the intensity. If there was an MEP on more than 5 out of 10 trials, lower the intensity. Repeat until a minimum intensity level that elicits MEPs on at least 50% of the trials (active motor threshold) has been found.\nAsk the participant to relax the lip muscles and deliver 10 pulses at the intensity of active motor threshold. Check that no MEPs were elicited (i.e. stimulation intensity is sub-threshold). If no MEPs were elicited, use this intensity (i.e. 100% of active motor threshold) during the rTMS train (while the lip muscle is relaxed). If MEPs were elicited, go back to 5.3.\n6. Low-frequency rTMS\nDeliver TMS pulses at a frequency of up to 1 Hz for 15-min during the rTMS train. When using the MagStim BiStim system that consists of two stimulators, trigger these stimulators alternatingly (i.e. each stimulator delivers a pulse every 3 sec.) in order to create a monophasic pulse sequence of 0.66 Hz. Note: Spike2 software together with the EMG acquisition system (by Cambridge Electronics) can be used to create a sequence of trigger pulses. Note: In practice, the maximum intensity for 0.66 Hz pulse train using the MagStim BiStim system and standard coils is 65% of the maximum stimulator output. This limit relates to the maximum pulse frequency of each stimulator (0.33 Hz), over-heating of the coils and participant comfort.",
    "Monitor recordings from the lip and the hand muscles during the rTMS train to ensure no MEPs are elicited that would indicate an increase in excitability or spreading effects to the neighboring representation. Also monitor the participant for signs of discomfort or changes in the level of alertness.\nChange the coil after 7.5 min in order to avoid overheating. Note: This step can be omitted when using special coils that are cooled during the stimulation; heating of the coils can affect the strength of the magnetic field."
