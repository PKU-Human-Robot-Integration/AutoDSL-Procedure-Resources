    "An outline of procedures to express boric acid channels in oocytes is illustrated in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227235140_3959.pngFigure 1. Procedures to express boric acid channels in oocytes. The GFP-NIP5;1 ORF sequence was subcloned into pXBG-ev1 vector using the BglII site. The vector was linearized by BamHI and used for in vitro cRNA transcription. GFP-NIP5;1 cRNA was injected into oocytes for expression and subsequent boron transport assay.cRNA synthesis of NIP5;1Subclone ORF sequence of GFP-NIP5;1 in pXBG-ev1 vector (Figure 2) using BglII site. Note: The GFP was used to select oocytes expressing NIP5;1 in a later step (Procedure C). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227235413_6486.pngFigure 2. A map of the pXBG-ev1 vector for in vitro transcription (Preston et al., 1992). An ORF sequence of gene of interest can be subcloned between the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) and 3’ UTR using BglII site.Linearize the plasmid by endonuclease such as BamHI. Purify DNA fragment with a gel extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and dilute to be the concentration of 500 ng/µl in TE buffer or nuclease-free water.Run capped transcription reaction and recover cRNA following the manufacturer’s instruction. We use mMESSAGE mMACHINE T3 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Note: The manufacturer’s guide for cRNA synthesis could be found at https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1348[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1348].cRNA injection of NIP5;1Prepare sharp glass capillary by dual-stage glass micropipette puller PC-10 (Figure 3).Note: Fix a capillary and set the parameters in PC-10 as follows: No.1 Heater level: 60, No.2 Heater level: 58. Press the ‘start’ button to process automatically.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227235550_5046.pngFigure 3. Preparation of glass capillaries by the puller PC-10.

    "Usually the glass capillary made by PC-10 cannot be used directly because of the sealed tip-end (Figure 4D). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227235704_7863.pngFigure 4.

Filling the glass capillary with mineral oil. Filling the glass capillary with mineral oil by a syringe (A) and setting it on NANOJECT II (B, C). The white circle in B indicates the position of glass capillary on NANOJECT II.Incubate oocytes in MBS with Ca2+ buffer (see Recipes) at 18 °C for 6 h prior to injection.Note: Select healthy oocytes with clear black and yellow halves for injection (Sigel, 2010).For each cRNA sample, prepare 35 oocytes and inject 50 nl of cRNA solution for one oocyte by NANOJECT II (Figure 6).Note: Press ‘empty’ button to push out metal needle to the position at ~0.5 cm from tip-end of glass capillary. Place 4 µl of cRNA on Parafilm (Figure 6B) and take up by pushing ‘fill’ button (Figure 6A). Transfer several oocytes on polypropylene mesh placed in a new Petri dish by 1 ml end cut pipette tips (Figure 6C). Move microinjector close to an oocyte and gently insert glass capillary. Press the ‘inject’ button of NANOJECT II for injection. Detach the glass capillary from the oocyte and sequentially inject next one. Change capillary when you deal with different cRNA.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227235825_8770.pngFigure 6. cRNA injection into oocytes by NANOJECT II. A.",

Scale bars = 1.0 mm (7B, 7C, 7E), 0.5 mm (7F).Collect 7-8 oocytes as one pool in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube using 1 ml end cut pipette tip. Preparing 4 or more replicas is recommended.Remove the MBS buffer and add 1 ml of MBS containing 5 mM boric acid into each tube. Incubate for 30 min at 18 °C.Remove the MBS buffer and wash oocytes for 5 times using 1 ml of fresh MBS buffer without boric acid.B measurement by ICP-MSTransfer one pool of oocytes into a new metal-free tube without lids (we used DigiTUBEs, GL Sciences). Add 500 µl concentrated HNO3 to digest 20 min, followed by incubation at 100 °C in the DigiPREP Jr equipment (GL Sciences, Tokyo). Shake DigiTUBEs every 2 min to dry the solution completely. Resuspend the sample with 165 µl concentrated HNO3 and then add ultrapure water up to 5 ml to make 2% HNO3 solution. Add an appropriate volume of 2% HNO3 to dilute samples for ICP-MS measurement.",
    "We prepared 2% nitric acid containing solution and measure the boron concentration.Note: Occasionally, undissolved materials remain in DigiTUBEs. They can be eliminated by DigiFILTER 0.45 μm (GL Sciences). 1 to 5% HNO3 can be used dependent on ICP-MS instruments. Measure 11B using 0 to 100 ppb total B (natural abundance) as standards by ICP-MS (Figure 8). We used ICP-MS ELAN DRC-e equipped with ESI Autosamplers and software suit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) We calculated the total B concentration assuming that there is no isotopic discrimination during the transport (10B:11B = 20:80).
