  "procedures": [
    "1. Design RNA oligonucleotides\nDesign synthetic RNA oligonucleotides with different lengths (19 nt, 20 nt and 21 nt), including one (RNA #6) with both canonical and modified nucleotides. ψ is employed as a model for non-mass-altering modifications, which is challenging for MS sequencing because it has an identical mass to U. m5C is chosen as a model for mass-altering modifications to demonstrate the robustness of the approach.\n\tRNA #1: 5´-HO-CGCAUCUGACUGACCAAAA-OH-3´\n\tRNA #2: 5´-HO-AUAGCCCAGUCAGUCUACGC-OH-3´\n\tRNA #3: 5´-HO-AAACCGUUACCAUUACUGAG-OH-3´\n\tRNA #4: 5´-HO-GCGUACAUCUUCCCCUUUAU-OH-3´\n\tRNA #5: 5´-HO-GCGGAUUUAGCUCAGUUGGGA-OH-3´\n\tRNA #6: 5´-HO-AAACCGUψACCAUUAm5CUGAG-OH-3´\n\t \nDissolve each synthetic RNA in nuclease-free diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water (expressed as DEPC-treated H2O unless otherwise indicated) to obtain a 100 mM RNA stock solution. Stock solutions are stored long-term at -20 °C.\nTo avoid possible RNA sample degradation, use RNase-free experimental supplies including DEPC-treated water, microcentrifuge tubes, and pipette tips. Frequently wipe down surfaces of lab supplies using RNase elimination wipes.\n2. Label the 3´-end of RNAs with biotin\nTwo-step reaction protocol (adenylation and ligation)\n\t\nAdd 1 µL of 10x adenylation reaction buffer containing 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DTT), 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 µL of 1 mM ATP, 1 µL of 100 µM biotinylated cytidine bisphosphate (pCp-biotin), 1 µL of 50 µM Mth RNA ligase, and 6 µL of DEPC-treated H2O (a total volume of 10 µL) into an RNase-free thin-walled 0.2 mL PCR tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Store the reagents at -20 °C before the two-step reaction. Thaw the reagents at room temperature and mix well by vortexing and centrifuging before adding to the reaction.\nIncubate the reaction in a PCR machine at 65 °C for 1 h and inactivate the reaction at 85 °C for 5 min.",
    "Conduct the ligation step in an RNase-free, thin walled 0.2 mL PCR tube containing 10 µL of reaction solution from the previous step by adding 3 µL of 10x T4 RNA ligase reaction buffer containing 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1.5 µL of the 100 mM sample stock of the RNA to be sequenced, 3 µL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to reach 10% (v/v), 1 µL of T4 RNA ligase (10 units/µL), and 11.5 µL of DEPC-treated H2O (for a total volume of 30 mL). Incubate the reaction overnight at 16 °C in a PCR machine.\n\t\tNOTE: Combine reaction components at room temperature due to the high freezing point of DMSO (18.45 °C).\nIncubate the reaction overnight at 16 °C.\nQuench and purify the reaction by column purification to remove enzymes and free pCp-biotin using Oligo Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). Oligo Binding Buffer, DNA Wash Buffer, spin columns and collection tubes are provided in the kit. Add 20 mL of DEPC-treated H2O to the reaction solution to reach a 50 mL sample volume prior to adding the Binding Buffer.\nAdd 100 mL of binding buffer to each reaction solution. Add 400 µL of ethanol, mix by pipetting, and transfer the mixture to the column. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 750 µL of DNA Wash Buffer to the column. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g and maximum speed for 30 s and 1 minute, respectively.\nTransfer the column to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 15 µL of DEPC-treated H2O to the column and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 s to elute the RNA product.",
    "NOTE: Samples can be stored at -20 °C at this stage until the next step is performed.\nOne-step reaction protocol\n\t\nPerform a one-step labeling reaction by combining 2 µL of 150 μM adenosine-5´-5´-diphosphate-{5´-(cytidine-2´-O-methyl-3´-phosphate-TEG}C-biotin (AppCp-biotin), 3 µL of 10x ligase reaction buffer, 1.5 µL of the 100 mM sample stock of the RNA to be sequenced, 3 µL of anhydrous DMSO to reach 10% (v/v), 1 µL of T4 RNA ligase (10 units/µL), and 19.5 µL of DEPC-treated H2O (for a total volume of 30 mL) in a 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube.\nIncubate the reaction overnight at 16 °C in a PCR machine.\nPerform column purification as described above in steps 2.1.5-2.1.8.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare a separate/exclusive reaction tube for each RNA sample (150 pmol scale of RNA). Labeling of the 5´-end of the RNA(s) with sulfo-Cyanine3 (Cy3) or Cy3 may be needed (e.g., for bidirectional sequencing verification). The method is different than that of 3´-biotinylation and is described in a previous publication9.\n3. Capture biotinylated RNA sample on streptavidin beads\nActivate 200 µL of streptavidin C1 magnet beads by adding 200 µL of 1x B&W buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) in a 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube. Vortex this solution and place it on a magnet stand for 2 min. Then discard the supernatant by carefully pipetting out the solution.\nWash the beads twice with 200 µL of Solution A (DEPC-treated 0.1 M NaOH and DEPC-treated 0.05 M NaCl) and once in 200 µL of Solution B (DEPC-treated 0.1 M NaCl). For each wash step, vortex the solution and place it on a magnet stand for 2 min, followed by discarding of the supernatant. Then add 100 µL of 2x B&W buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl).",
    "Add 1x B&W buffer to the biotinylated RNA sample until the volume is 100 µL. Then add this solution to the washed beads stored in 100 µL of 2x B&W buffer. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature on a rocking platform shaker at 100 rpm. Place the tube on a magnet stand for 2 min and discard the supernatant.\nWash the coated beads 3 times in 1x B&W buffer and measure the final concentration of supernatant in each wash step by Nanodrop for recovery analysis, to confirm that the target RNA molecules remain on the beads.\nIncubate the beads in 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.2 with 95% formamide at 65 °C for 5 min in a PCR machine. Keep the tube on the magnet stand for 2 min and collect the supernatant (containing the biotinylated RNAs released from the streptavidin beads) by pipet.\n\tNOTE: This physical separation step prior to acid degradation is only used for sequencing of RNA#1 in Figure 1c, and is not mandatory for the 2D-HELS MS Seq since the hydrophobic biotin label can cause the 3´-labeled ladder fragments to have a significantly delayed tR during LC-MS measurement, which can clearly distinguish the labeled 3´-ladder fragments from the unlabeled 5´-ladder fragments in the 2D mass-tR plot.\n4. Acid hydrolysis of RNA to generate MS ladders for sequencing\nDivide each RNA sample into three equal aliquots. For instance, divide an RNA sample with a volume of 15 µL RNA sample into three aliquots of 5 µL.\nAdd an equal volume of formic acid to achieve 50% (v/v) formic acid in the reaction mixture8,9.\nIncubate the reaction at 40 °C in a PCR machine, with one reaction running for 2 min, one for 5 min, and one for 15 min, respectively.",
    "Quench the acid degradation by immediately freezing the sample on dry ice after each reaction finishes.\nUse a centrifugal vacuum concentrator to dry the sample. The sample is typically completely dried within 30 min, and formic acid is removed together with H2O during the drying process because formic acid has a boiling point (100.8 °C) similar to that of H2O (100 °C).\nSuspend and combine a total of three dried samples in 20 µL of DEPC-treated H2O for LC-MS measurement.\n\tNOTE: Samples can be stored at -20 °C at this stage while waiting for LC-MS measurement.\n5. Convert ψ to CMC-ψ adduct\nAdd 80 µL of DEPC-treated H2O into a 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube containing 0.0141 g of N-cyclohexyl-Nʹ-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMC) and 0.07 g of urea. Add 10 µL of the 100 µM sample stock of the RNA to be sequenced, 8 µL of 1 M bicine buffer (pH 8.3), and 1.28 µL of 0.5 M EDTA. Add DEPC-treated H2O to reach a total volume of 160 µL. Final concentrations are 0.17 M CMC, 7 M urea, and 4 mM EDTA in 50 mM bicine (pH 8.3)11.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is applicable to either a single synthetic RNA sequence or RNA mixtures.\nDivide the 160 µL reaction solution into four equal aliquots in RNase-free, thin walled 0.2 mL PCR tubes and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min in a PCR machine.\n\tNOTE: 50 µL per tube is the maximum reaction volume that can be used in a PCR machine.\nQuench each reaction with 10 µL of 1.5 M sodium acetate and 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 5.6).",
    "Perform column purification with four parallel spin columns to remove excessive reactants according to the procedure as described in steps 2.1.5-2.1.8. Dissolve the purified product in 15 µL of DEPC-treated H2O in each 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube.\nTransfer the purified product to four RNase-free, thin walled 0.2 mL PCR tubes. Add 20 µL of 0.1 M Na2CO3 buffer (pH 10.4) into each 15 µL of purified product and add DEPC-treated H2O to make a final volume of 40 µL for each reaction tube (in total four tubes). Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 2 h in a PCR machine.\nQuench and purify the reaction by column purification with four parallel spin columns as described in step 2.1.5. Elute the CMC-ψ converted product to a 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube each with 15 µL of DEPC-treated H2O.\nCombine the purified CMC-ψ converted sample from four collection tubes into one tube. Perform formic acid degradation 50% (v/v) according to the procedures as described in steps 4.1-4.6 to generate MS ladders for sequencing.\n6. LC-MS measurement\nPrepare mobile phases for LC-MS measurement. Mobile phase A is 25 mM hexafluoro-2-propanol with 10 mM diisopropylamine in LC-MS grade water; mobile phase B is methanol.\nTransfer the sample to LC-MS sample vial for analysis. Each sample injection volume is 20 µL containing 100-400 pmol of RNA.\nUse the following LC conditions: column temperature of 35 °C, flow rate of 0.3 mL/min; a linear gradient from 2–20% mobile phase B over 15 min followed by a 2 min wash step with 90% mobile phase B.",
    "NOTE: For more hydrophobic end-labels such as Cy3 and sulfo-Cy3 as mentioned in Section 2, a higher percentage of organic solvent may be necessary for sample elution (i.e., a similar gradient can be used but with an increased percentage range of mobile phase B). For instance, 2–38% mobile phase B over 30 min with a 2 min wash step with 90% mobile phase B.\nSeparate and analyze samples on an Agilent Q-TOF (Quadrupole Time-of-Flight) mass spectrometer coupled to an LC system equipped with an autosampler and an MS HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) system. The LC column is a 50 mm x 2.1 mm C18 column with a particle size of 1.7 μm. Use the following MS settings: negative ion mode; range, 350 m/z to 3200 m/z; scan rate, 2 spectra/s; drying gas flow, 17 L/min; drying gas temperature, 250 °C; nebulizer pressure, 30 psig; capillary voltage, 3500 V; and fragmentor voltage, 365 V. Please note that these parameters are specific to the type or model of mass spectrometer being used.\nAcquire data with Agilent MassHunter acquisition software. Use Agilent molecular feature extraction (MFE) workflow to extract compound information including mass, retention time, volume (the MFE abundance for the respective ion species), and quality score, etc. Use the following MFE settings: “centroid data format, small molecules (chromatographic), peak with height ≥ 100, up to a maximum of 1000, quality score ≥ 50”.\n\tNOTE: Optimize MFE settings to extract as many potential compounds as possible, up to a maximum of 1000, with quality scores of ≥ 50.\n7. Automate RNA sequence generation by a computational algorithm\nNOTE: This procedure is shown only for RNA #1 in Figure 1c.",
    "Sort MFE extracted compounds in order of decreasing volume (peak intensity) and tR. Perform data pre-selection via 1) setting tR from 4 to 10 min to select the RNA fragments labeled by the biotin, since the tRs of the biotin-labeled mass ladder components are shifted to this tR window (4 min to 10 min), and 2) using an order-of-magnitude higher of input compounds than the number of ladder fragments for algorithm computation to reduce data amount based on volume. For instance, for a 20 nt RNA, 20 labeled mass-tR ladder components will be required for sequencing of the 20 nt RNA, and thus, 200 compounds from MFE data file will be selected based on volume. Please note that the tR window may be different when a different type or model of mass spectrometer is used.\nPerform data processing and sequence generation of RNA #1 using a revised version of a published algorithm8. The source codes of the revised algorithm are described previously (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/20/e125/5558343#supplementary-data)9.\nIn addition to automating sequence generation using the algorithm, manually calculate the mass differences between two adjacent ladder components for base calling. All bases in the RNA can be called manually and matched with the theoretical ones in the RNA nucleotide and modification database8; thus, the complete sequence of the RNA strand can be accurately read out manually, which is used to confirm the accuracy of the algorithm-reported sequence read. More structures of RNA modifications can be found in RNA modification databases12, and their corresponding theoretical masses are obtained by ChemBioDraw. In Tables S1–S2, the ppm (parts-per-million) mass difference is shown when comparing the observed mass to its theoretical mass for a specific ladder component, and a value less than 10 ppm is considered a good match for each base calling.\n8. Sequencing RNA mixtures",
    "Label a mixture of five RNA strands (RNA #1 to #5) at their 3´-ends with A(5´)pp(5´)Cp-TEG-biotin using a one-step protocol described in step 2.2. In a total volume of 150 µL reaction solution, add 15 µL of 10x T4 RNA ligase reaction buffer, 1.5 µL of each RNA strand (100 µM stock of RNA #1 to #5, respectively, for a total volume of 7.5 µL), 10 µL of 150 µM A(5´)pp(5´)Cp-TEG-biotin, 15 µL of anhydrous DMSO, 5 µL of T4 RNA ligase (10 units/µL), and 97.5 µL of DEPC-treated H2O. Equally distribute the reaction solution into five aliquots. Each RNase-free microcentrifuge tube contains 30 µL of reaction solution.\nIncubate the reaction overnight at 16 °C in a PCR machine.\nPerform column purification according to the procedure as described in steps 2.1.5-2.1.8 with five parallel spin columns. Elute a mixture sample of 3´-biotinylated 5 RNA strands (mixture of RNA #1 to #5) to a 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube each with 15 µL of DEPC-treated H2O.\nCombine the purified mixture samples from the five collection tubes into one tube. Perform formic acid degradation according to the procedure described in Section 4.",
    "Measure samples by LC-MS as described in Section 6, and analyze the data using the data analysis software with optimized MFE settings to extract data containing mass, tR, and volume as described in step 6.5. The typical processing and base-calling algorithm is not applied due to the significantly increased data complexity resulting from the mixture. All bases in the RNA of the mixed sample are called manually in a method similar to Section 7.3 and match well with the theoretical ones in the RNA nucleotide and modification database8, thus the complete sequences of all five RNA strands in the mixed sample are accurately read out. In Tables S7–S11, all information is listed including observed mass, tR, volume, quality score and ppm mass difference.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
