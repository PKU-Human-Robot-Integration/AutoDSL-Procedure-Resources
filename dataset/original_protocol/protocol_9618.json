    "Apply 1 mL of the ECM solution to each well of two 6-well plates and incubate at 37 °C for at least 1 h prior to cell seeding, but no more than 24 h.\nThaw a frozen vial of cardiomyocytes in a water bath at 37 °C for 2 min or until the ice is just melted.\nSpray the vial with 70% ethanol and transfer it to the BSC.\nUse a p1000 pipette to transfer the thawed cells into a 50 mL conical tube.\nRinse the empty cryovial with 1 mL of room temperature (RT) plating medium to recover any remaining cells.\nSlowly dispense the 1 mL of rinse media dropwise (one drop every 5 s) into the conical tube of cells over the course of 90 s. Continuously swirl the tube to mix the cells during the slow media addition.\nSlowly add 8 mL of the plating medium using a 10 mL serological pipette to the 50 mL conical tube of cells.\nAfter all the media is dispensed, gently pipette up and down 3 times to mix the cells thoroughly. Count cells using a hemacytometer and trypan blue.\nCentrifuge the cells in the 50 mL conical tube at 300 x g for 3 min.\nAfter the cells have been pelleted, aspirate the supernatant.\nUse a p1000 pipette to transfer 1 mL of the plating medium to the tube and gently break up the pellet by slowly pipetting up and down 3-5 times. Resuspend the cells with an additional plating medium.\nSeed between 2-4 x 106 cells per well of a 6 well plate in 2 mL of the plating medium.\nWash the ECM-coated 6-well plates with DPBS (2 mL/well).",
    "Pipette 2 mL of cell suspension per well of a 6 well plate. Move the plates gently along the work surface to the left and right 5-6 times followed by forward and back 5-6 times to ensure even distribution of cells on the plate surfaces.\nPlace the plate into the cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRepeat steps 1.3.3-1.3.16 for all vials of the cells to be thawed.\nChange to 3-5 mL (depending on cell line and density) of maintenance medium the next day after plating, and then change the medium every other day.

    "Transfer the stromal cells to the flask at a density of 3-4 x 103 cells/cm2. Slide the flask gently along the work surface to the left and right 5-6 times followed by forward and back 5-6 times to ensure even distribution of cells on the flask surface.\nChange media the next day with 45 mL of warmed stromal cell medium. Culture the cells for 3-4 days before casting into 3D tissues.\n2. Material preparation\nFibrinogen\n\tNOTE: When reconstituting fibrinogen, take care to maximize the amount of surface area the fibrinogen powder is being layered on. In this protocol, the amount of diluent used was optimized to the size of the container being used, i.e., just enough diluent was used to cover the bottom of the dish. For example, layer 0.5 g of fibrinogen over 10 mL of PBS in a 100 mm dish rather than a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Maximizing the amount of surface area of the diluent will reduce the amount of time needed to reconstitute the fibrinogen and reduce potential clumping of protein.\n\t\nReconstitution\n\t\t\nTransfer 10 mL of PBS to a 100 mm cell culture dish and warm to 37 °C in a cell culture incubator.\nLayer 0.5 g of fibrinogen powder over the entire surface of warm PBS and keep at 37 °C until fibrinogen has fully dissolved. This should take no more than 2 h. The dissolving powder may be gently swirled, but do not vigorously shake the dish.\nSterile filtration\n\t\t\nOnce the powder has fully dissolved, run the solution through a 100 µm filter and collect it into a 50 mL conical tube to remove any clumps of gelled fibrinogen.",
    "Pour the filtered solution into a 10 mL syringe capped with a 0.2 µm filter. Push the solution through the filter and collect it into a new 50 mL conical tube. The filter may need to be changed more than once to sterilize all 10 mL of solution.\nAliquot 300 mL of sterile fibrinogen into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20 °C. Thaw the aliquots on ice or at 4 °C as needed. Avoid repeated freeze/thaws.\nThrombin\n\t\nAdd 6 mL of PBS and 4 mL of diH2O directly into one vial of thrombin (1 KU) to make a 100 U/mL thrombin stock solution.\nFilter sterilize with a 0.2 µm filter, aliquot, and store at -20 °C in 1.5 mL plastic microcentrifuge tubes as thrombin adsorbs to glass. Avoid repeated freeze/thaws.\nPoly(ethyleneimine) solution (PEI)\n\tCAUTION: PEI is toxic. Use appropriate PPE as designated by the manufacturer.\n\tNOTE: PEI is supplied as a 50% w/v solution. It is highly viscous and difficult to pipette. Make a 0.1% solution from a 10% stock solution rather than directly from the 50% w/v solution.\n\t\nMeasure 5 mL of 50% w/v PEI solution in a 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 20 mL of diH2O and mix to yield a 10% stock solution. This highly concentrated stock solution cannot be sterile filtered.\nTo make a 0.1% solution for cell culture, add 5 mL of 10% stock to 495 mL diH2O. Sterile filter using a 500 mL filter flask and store at RT for no longer than 1 week.\nGlutaraldehyde\n\tCAUTION: Glutaraldehyde is toxic. Use appropriate PPE as designated by the manufacturer.\n\t\nGlutaraldehyde is supplied as a 25% solution. To make a 0.01% solution, add 40 µL to 99.6 mL of diH2O. Sterile filter and store at 4 °C for no longer than 1 week.",
    "Post preparation\n\t\nPlace consumable tissue casting kit inside a sterile culture hood. The casting kit contains a lid, a post lattice holding 24 pairs of posts (one pair of posts per well of a 24-well plate), and a specialized 24-well plate bottom containing 24 casting wells. Each casting well contains a trench in the bottom of the well to hold the cell/hydrogel components and mold them into a tube-shaped tissue as the hydrogel polymerizes (Figure 1B).\nFill the wells of a 24-well plate with 1.5 mL/well of a 0.1% PEI solution and place posts in plate so that the tips of each pair of posts are submerged. Let it sit for 10 min. PEI will deposit a positive charge on the posts so that proteins in the hydrogel firmly attach to the posts during tissue casting.\nFill the wells of a second 24-well plate with 2 mL/well of sterile diH2O and transfer the posts. Let it sit for 1 min.\nIn a third 24-well plate, fill the wells with 1.5 mL/well of 0.01% glutaraldehyde (GA) and transfer the posts. Let it sit for 30 min. GA will fix the positive charge from PEI to the posts.\nWhile the posts sit in glutaraldehyde, aspirate the diH2O wells, wash with 2 mL/well of sterile diH2O, aspirate, and refill with 2 mL/well of sterile diH2O. A fresh, 24-well plate may be used instead of rinsing.\nWhen 30 min is up, transfer the posts to the 2 mL/well of sterile diH2O. Let it sit for 1 min.\nAspirate the diH2O and add another 2 mL/well of sterile diH2O. Let it sit for 5 min.\nTransfer the posts to a 24-well plate to dry (approximately 15 min).",
    "Once dry, reassemble the casting Kit. Parafilm the edges to seal the lid and the plate together, and then store at 4 °C for up to 72 h prior to cell seeding. Longer storage times are likely possible but have not been tested.\n3. Tissue casting protocol\nCasting plate preparation\n\t\nPre-chill the tissue casting kit at 4 °C.\nTransfer a bucket of ice into the BSC. On ice, prepare 50 µL of thrombin solution (3 µL of thrombin stock + 47 µL of EMT medium) per well to be cast.\n\t\tNOTE: See step 3.2.1 for details on EMT medium.\nRemove the chilled casting kit from the refrigerator and place it onto a cold block or ice inside the cell culture hood. Lay casting plate flat on ice and move the post lattice from the casting plate to a new, sterile 24-well plate.\nPipette 50 µL of thrombin solution into each pre-chilled well of the casting plate.\nReassemble the kit and return it to the refrigerator until needed for tissue casting. Cast the tissues within 3 h of thrombin addition to the wells.\nCell preparation\n\t\nPrepare EMT base medium, sterile filter, and leave on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: If cell-specific casting medium contains FBS, use heat-inactivated FBS as it may interact with fibrinogen and cause premature polymerization.\n\t\t\nPrepare cardiac EMT medium: Add 500 mL of RPMI medium, 10 mL of B27, and 2.5 g of aminocaproic acid. (Optional) Add 10 mM ROCK inhibitor (add only to the EMT medium used for casting tissues and not the entire 500 mL volume).\nPrepare skeletal EMT medium: Add 50 mL of F10 medium and 0.25 g of aminocaproic acid (ACA) for primary EMTs and 0.1 g of ACA for iPSC-derived EMTs.",
    "Warm the cell culture grade dissociation reagent to 37 °C. Warm an equal volume of EMT medium to dilute the dissociation reagent.\n\t\tNOTE: It is critical that the protease used is completely inactivated. Active protease will interfere with 3D tissue formation and post adherence.\nWash the cells (Figure 1A) with PBS. Use 2 mL/well for a 6-well plate. Use 6 mL, 15 mL, and 15 mL for a 100 mm dish, T175 flask, and T225 flask, respectively.\nAdd the warmed cell culture grade dissociation reagent to lift the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min or until the cells have lifted. For cardiac cultures, use the 10x dissociation reagent. For stromal cells and skeletal muscle myoblasts, use a 1x dissociation reagent. Use 1 mL/well for a 6-well plate, 3 mL for a 100 mm dish, 8 mL for a T175 flask, and 10 mL for a T225 flask.\nCheck the cultures every 2-3 min by tapping the side of the plate.\nOnce the cells have lifted, transfer them to a 50 mL conical tube and triturate with a P1000 pipette to ensure a single-cell suspension.\nWash the plate or flask with an additional EMT medium to collect the remaining cells and add them to the conical tube. Use 1 mL/well of the EMT medium for a 6-well plate, 2 mL for a 100 mm dish, 5 mL for a T175 flask, and 5 mL for a T225 flask.\nTriturate the cells to ensure a single cell suspension.\nAdd EMT medium to terminate the dissociation process, and then take samples of the cell suspensions for cell counts. Use 1 mL/well for a 6-well plate, 3 mL for a 100 mm dish, 8 mL for a T175 flask, and 10 mL for a T225 flask.",
    "Spin the cells at 200 x g for 4 min. Perform cell counts using a hemacytometer and trypan blue while suspensions are centrifuged.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of EMT base medium to remove the residual dissociation reagent.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 4 min. Aspirate the supernatant and prepare the cell suspensions at the appropriate densities.\nIncrease the longevity and function of 3D skeletal muscle EMTs with the addition of 10%-20% ECM proteins in the EMT medium14,16.\nSeed stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and their stromal cells at 5 x 105 cells and 7.5 x 104 cells per tissue construct, respectively. Seed the skeletal muscle myoblasts at 7.5 x 105 cells per tissue construct.\nCardiac tissues\n\t\t\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the stromal cells at a density of 2.5 x 106 cells per mL in EMT medium and put them on ice. Use 30 µL of this suspension per EMT.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the CMs at a density of 8.3 x 106 cells per mL in EMT medium and put them on ice. Use 60 µL of this suspension per EMT.\nSkeletal muscle tissues\n\t\t\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the skeletal muscle cells at a density of 8.3 x 106 cells per mL in EMT medium and put them on ice. Use 90 µL of this suspension per EMT.\nCalculate the volumes of each cell solution required to make up the desired number of tissues (e.g., 60 µL of the prepared CMs and 30 µL of the prepared stromal cells or 90 µL of the skeletal muscle cells per EMT).\nPipette the calculated volumes of cells into a 15 mL conical tube.\nAdd 10 µL of fibrinogen per EMT to the cell suspension and keep it on ice.",
    "Total reagents and cell volumes per EMT: Ensure that each EMT has 90 µL of cells, 10 µL of fibrinogen, and 50 µL of thrombin solution.\nTissue casting\n\t\nTransfer the tissue casting kit to a cell culture hood and remove the lid (post lattice containing flexible and rigid posts should remain on the casting plate; Figure 1B). Keep the casting plate with post lattice laying flat on ice.\nMix the cell/fibrinogen mixture and draw up 100 µL with a P200 pipette.\nAdd 100 µL of the mixture to wells prepared with 50 µL of thrombin solution and triturate 5 times to mix well. Do not push the pipette past the first stop and remove the tip after trituration to avoid creating any bubbles.\nAt this stage, and until the post lattice is ready to be lifted from the casting plate (step 3.3.10), any movement of the lattice may compromise the long-term attachment of the tissue to the posts. Hold both the lattice and casting well plate simultaneously using the pointer finger and thumb of one hand to avoid any movement of the lattice.\nRepeat with a fresh P200 tip for each tissue until all the tissues are cast. Mix cell suspension in a 15 mL conical tube before casting each tissue as cells settle quickly.\nCarefully transfer the seeded kit to the incubator, making sure not to move the lattice. Movement of lattice after seeding may result in decreased success in transferring tissues out of the casting wells. Incubate at 37 °C for 80 min, regardless of the cell type. This will begin the polymerization of the hydrogel and allow proteins to attach to the posts.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare a fresh 24-well plate with 2 mL/well of the EMT medium for cardiac tissues. 10 mM ROCK inhibitor may be added to the EMT medium if desired. Incubate the plate at 37 °C to warm the medium.\nPrepare 2 mL/well of growth medium containing 5 g/L aminocaproic acid (0.2 mm sterile filtered) for primary skeletal muscle tissues or 2 g/L ACA for iPSC-derived EMTs. Incubate the plate at 37 °C to warm the medium.\nAfter incubation, gently add 1 mL of the EMT medium to the edge of the casting wells and incubate for another 10 min at 37 °C, regardless of the cell type. This will dislodge the hydrogel from the edges of the casting well and permit easy transfer of the tissue.\nAfter 10 min, carefully lift the post lattice and transfer the tissues from the casting plate to a prepared 24-well plate with medium (Figure 1C). Return the plates with tissues to the cell culture incubator at 37 °C.\nMaintenance\n\t\nAfter 24 h, transfer the cast tissues to a fresh 24-well plate with 2 mL/well of the EMT media (without the ROCK inhibitor if it was included) and incubate at 37 °C. For skeletal muscle cells, switch the growth medium to the differentiation medium to promote myoblast fusion.\nTransfer the cardiac tissues to fresh wells with 2 mL/well of the EMT medium every 2-3 days.\nTransfer the skeletal muscle tissues to fresh wells with 2 mL/well differentiation medium containing 5 g/L Aminocaproic acid (0.2 mm sterile filtered) every 2-3 days. Use 2 g/L ACA for iPSC-derived tissues.",
    "To aid in medium changes, transfer the post lattice to a fresh 24-well plate rather than change the medium in the same plate to avoid damaging the 3D tissues. Prepare a second 24-well plate with the EMT medium and transfer the tissues to the fresh medium. Keep the plate with the old medium alongside the active culture to use for the next medium change. Transfer the post lattice back and forth between the two plates throughout the culture period. Alternatively, use a fresh plate for each medium change.\nMeasure the EMT contraction either via optical tracking of post deflection (Figure 1D) or magnetic sensing hardware13,14. Cardiac tissues start beating spontaneously after 3-4 days in culture. Skeletal muscle tissues are typically contractile with electrical field stimulation after 7 days in culture."
