    "This protocol follows the guidelines of New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities human research ethics committee.\n1. Villous Tree Dissection\nRinse formalin fixed placenta tissue with phosphate buffed saline (PBS)14 to remove the formalin and place in a Petri dish on the stage of a dissection microscope. Use scalpel and fine forceps to tease the placenta tissue apart to locate villous trees (white threadlike branching structures). Dissect out pieces of villus tree (several mm long) and transfer the tissue to a micro-tube containing ~1 mL PBS.\n2. Immunofluorescent Staining\nWith a pipette, remove the PBS and replace with fresh PBS. Let stand for 10 min with occasional swirling. Repeat once more.\n\t​NOTE: This step and all further steps are done at room temperature except the primary antibody incubation.\nUsing a pipette, remove and replace the PBS with PBS +0.1% Triton-X100 + 2% goat serum (PBS-T-GS) to permeabilize the tissue and block non-specific binding of secondary antibodies. Incubate for 30 min.\nReplace the PBS-T-GS with PBS containing 2% goat serum, both mouse monoclonal anti-CK7 and rabbit anti-CK7.\n\t\nIncubate tissue overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove the remaining antibodies by washing with PBS-GS for 10 minutes with occasional swirling.\nRemove the PBS-GS and replace with PBS-GS containing both goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with a green emitting (520 nm) fluorophore and goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled an infrared emitting (652 nm) fluorophore.\nRemove the antibodies by repeating step 2.1.\nStore the immunolabeled tissue at room temperature in the dark.\n3. Clarification of the Tissue\nWash the samples 3 times with PBS at 10 minute intervals.",
    "Dehydrate the tissue by removing the PBS with a pipette and replacing it with 50% ethanol (methanol may be used as well). Incubate for 10 min. Replace with fresh 50% ethanol and incubate for 10 min. Repeat this once more for a total of 3 incubations. Repeat incubations with 70%. Then replace with 100% ethanol and incubate for 15 minutes (alternatively methanol may be used).\nWith a fine-tipped forceps, transfer tissue to a fresh micro-tube containing ~ 1 mL Solution-1 for 4 h.\nWith fine-tipped forceps, transfer tissue to a fresh micro-tube containing Solution-2 for ~ 4 h.\n\tNOTE: When stored in the dark, the immunofluorescence is stable at room temperature for at least 6 months.\nDo not mix with any aqueous solution, (e.g. mounting medium) as the clearing will lost.\n4. Mounting for Microscopy\nDo not mount the tissue between a standard glass slide and a coverslip as the tissue is soft and easily deformed.\nRefer to Figure 5B and mount the tissue in a Sykes-Moore chamber as follows;\n\t\nWith fine-tipped forceps place a 25-mm round coverslip in the chamber base.\nWith a fine-tipped forceps place the rubber gasket in the base on the coverslip.\nWith a pipette place a drop (~40 µL) of Solution-2 in the center of the coverslip.\nWith the fine-tipped forceps transfer a piece tissue from Solution-2 to the drop in the center of the coverslip.\nPlace a second coverslip on the top of the gasket.\nThread the locking ring into the top of the base compressing the coverslips and gasket until firm.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to over-tighten or the coverslip will shatter.\nInsert a 22-gauge needle into a port on the base and through the gasket.\nFill a 3-mL syringe with ~ 1.5 mL of Solution-2.\nMount a 25-gauge needle on the syringe.",
    "Insert the syringe needle into the opposite port and through the gasket.\nEnsure that the air in the chamber is venting through the other 25-gauge needle, gently inject solution-2and fill the chamber.\nRemove the needle and syringe and place the chamber on a large glass slide on the confocal microscope stage.\nAlternatively, cut custom wells out of PDMS silicone sheets.\n\t\nWith scissors cut a 25.4 × 25.4 mm2 piece from the PDMS sheet.\nWith a scalpel cut ~ 12.7 × 12.7 mm2 well in the piece.\nPress the piece firmly onto a microscope slide.\nFill the well to the top with Solution-2.\nTransfer the tissue piece from the micro-tube to the center of the well.\nWith fine-tipped forceps place a coverslip on the top of the well such that the bottom of the coverslip is wetted with Solution-2.\nMount the Sykes Moore Chamber assembly with the tissue on the confocal microscope stage.\n5. Confocal Microscopy\nBring the tissue in the chamber into focus with a 10x objective.\nMove the microscope stage up and down through the focal plane to measure the distance between the top and bottom of the tissue.\nMove the stage in 2.5 µm steps to collect a confocal image file containing a set of images through the tissue from top to bottom.\n6. Reversing the Clearing\nReverse the clearing by transferring the tissue to a micro-tube containing > 20x the volume of 100% ethanol. At 1 h intervals replace with 70% ethanol, then 50% ethanol and finally PBS. Store at 4 °C in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Now process the tissue for standard paraffin embedding, sectioning and histological or immuno-histochemical staining.\n7. Deconvolution\nNOTE: For the following steps, software Commands, Tabs and drop-down menus are italicized.\nStart the deconvolution software and open the image file.",
