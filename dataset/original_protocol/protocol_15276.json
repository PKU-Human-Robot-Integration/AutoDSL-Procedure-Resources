    "1. Donor Operation\nAnesthetize male rats weighing 200±20 grams with isoflurane on cone mask (3% for the induction, 2% during the operation, 1 l/min air flow, FiO2 70%).    \nPerform a large median and transverse laparotomy and cauterize the epigastric vessels on both sides. \nCut the falciform ligament, and separate the left diaphragmatic vein from the suprehepatic vena cava. Finally, divide the diaphragmatic vein between two 7-0 silk ligatures. \nCut the left triangular and the gastro-hepatic ligaments. \nDivide the hepato-esophageal ligament and artery between 7-0 ligatures (coagulation is a valid alternative). \nIsolate the infrahepatic vena cava down to the left renal vein. Separate the right renal vein from the surrounding tissues and divide it between a 10-0 and a 7-0 ligature, on its proximal and distal ends, respectively. \nDivide the right suprarenal vein between 7-0 ligatures and free the liver from its posterior ligaments by cutting under gentle traction. \nIsolate the gastrosplenic vein and divide it between a 10-0 and a 7-0 ligature, on its proximal and distal ends, respectively. \nDivide the proper hepatic artery between 7-0 ties. \nIsolate the duodeno-pancreatic vein and divided it between a 10-0 and a 7-0 ligature, on its proximal and distal end, respectively. \nInsert a 22G, 3.5 mm stent into the common bile duct by practicing a small incision at 1 cm distance from the hepatic hilum. Secure the stent in position with a 7-0 ligature. \nInject 10 UI of heparin, diluted into 1 ml of normal saline, through the dorsal vein of the penis.",
    "Cannulate the vena porta (as far as possible from the hilum) with a 21G needle and gently flush the liver with 20 ml of cold ringer lactate (or other preservation solutions). At the same time, cut the vena cava below the renal veins to allow an adequate outflow. Liver cold perfusion should last between one and two minutes. \nCut the vena porta below the duodeno-pancreatic vein. \nCut the common bile duct distally to the ligature around the stent.    \nComplete the incision of the infrahepatic vena cava. \nCut the suprahepatic vena cava skim to the diaphragm and remove the liver. \nPlace the liver into a basin filled with cold ringer lactate and lay the basin on an ice pad. \n2. Graft Preparation\nInsert the vena porta into its cuff, then evert the vessel around the edge to expose the intima. Secure the everted segment on the cuff with a 7-0 ligature.    \nRepeat the same operation on the infrahepatic vena cava. \nPosition a micro-clamp (4-6 mm length) on the proximal part of the infrahepatic vena cava. This operation avoids blood loss after portal reperfusion. \nOverturn the liver and insert two prolene 8-0 sutures at the opposite lateral edges of the suprahepatic vena cava, from outside to inside. \nStore the graft (immersed into ringer lactate solution) in the refrigerator at 0-4 °C. \n3. Recipient Operation\nAnesthetize male rats weighing 200±20 grams with isoflurane on cone mask (3% for the induction, 2% during the operation, 1 l/min air flow, FiO2 70%) and keep on a warm pad.  Of note, recipient and donor weights should be matched (±40 grams).    \nInject 10 ml of normal saline subcutaneously and 0.03 g of piperacillin/tazobactam intramuscular before laparotomy. \nPerform a midline xipho-pubic laparotomy. \nReverse the xiphoid process with an auto-static forceps in order to better expose the liver.",
    "Cut the anterior ligaments and divide the left diaphragmatic vein between two 7-0 ties. \nDivide the hepato-esophageal ligament and artery between 7-0 ligatures (coagulation is a valid alternative). Not shown in the video (identical to donor operation). \nIsolate the infrahepatic vena cava down to the right renal vein. \nDivide the right suprarenal vein between 7-0 ligatures and free the liver from its posterior ligaments by cutting under gentle traction (not shown in the video (identical to donor operation)). \nPlace a 7-0 ligature around the common bile duct, just below its division. Put another ligature one millimeter below and cut in between. \nIsolate the hepatic artery at the hilum and divide it between 7-0 ligatures.    \nGently separate left and right portal branches. Pay attention not to damage the common hepatic artery or the gastro-splenic vein. \nPosition the caval ring around the vena cava, cranially to the right renal vein. Then secure the vessel wall to the ring by placing four cardinal 9-0 sutures. \nRepeat the same operation with the portal ring on the vena porta. \nInject 10 UI of heparin, diluted into 1 ml of normal saline, through the dorsal vein of the penis. \nSet the anesthesia on 0.25% and the FiO2 on 100%. \nClamp the infrahepatic vena cava just above the right renal vein, then clamp the vena porta just above the gastro-splenic vein. Finally clamp the suprahepatic vena cava being sure to include at least 2 mm of diaphragm.    \nCut the suprahepatic vena cava close to the parenchyma. \nCut the left and the right portal branches and divide the septum in between. \nCut the infrahepatic vena cava close to the parenchyma, paying attention not to incise any of the sutures previously positioned. Remove the liver and place the graft into the abdominal cavity.",
    "Perform an end-to-end anastomosis between the suprahepatic vena cava of the graft and the recipient. Start with the running suture of the posterior wall from left to right, then proceed on the anterior wall from right to left. Keep the anterior suture loose until the end in order to allow a generous flushing of the interior lumen before tightening the ends. \nInsert the caudal branch of the approximator into the portal ring handle; then insert the vena porta of the graft into the slit of the cranial branch of the approximator, with the portal cuff finding its position into the slot. \nClose the approximator while flushing the recipient's vena porta with normal saline and allow the cuff to insert into the vessel. Secure the recipient's vena porta around its cuff with a 7-0 circumferential tie. \nRemove the approximator. Open the clamp on the suprahepatic vena cava and the vena porta in order: portal flow is now reestablished. \nRemove the portal ring by cutting the 9-0 ligatures with extra-fine scissors.\nInsert the caudal branch of the approximator into the caval ring handle; then insert the infrahepatic vena cava of the graft into the slit of the cranial branch of the approximator, with the caval cuff finding its position into the slot. \nClose the approximator while flushing the recipient's infrahepatic vena cava with normal saline and allow the cuff to insert into the vessel. Secure the recipient's vena cava around its cuff with a 7-0 circumferential tie. \nRemove the approximator. Open the microclamps on the infrahepatic vena cava of the graft and the recipient in order: venous flow is now reestablished.",
    "Perform a partial incision of the recipient's common bile duct, apply a gentle traction towards the head, and insert the free side of the stent previously inserted into the bile duct of the graft. Secure the stent with a circumferential 7-0 tie.    \nClose the animal by layers with 5-0 sutures. Allow free water and food from wakening. \nAdminister effective analgesia according to local institutional protocols. A minimum duration of 24 h is recommended.   \nOf note: end-to-end hepatic artery anastomosis can be performed, when required by the experimental design (the artery is not required for long-term survival after rat liver transplantation). \n4. Representative Results\nThe described technique could be successfully mastered by our team after approximately 10 training surgeries. It allowed 100% long-term (>21 days) survival on 36 consecutive Lewis-to-Lewis and Dark Agouti-to-Lewis transplantations, after the short training period (a number of syngeneic liver graft recipients have been kept alive for over 12 months now). Post- syngeneic transplant day 1 liver function tests showed median aspartate transaminase (AST): 84 U/l (51.7 - 92.7) and median alanine transaminase (ALT):  172.5 U/l (127.5 - 240.2). The mean anhepatic phase (from vena porta clamping to graft re-perfusion) was 14 ±2 min, with the longest step being the suprahepatic vena cava anastomosis (running suture) time 9±2 min.\nThe quick-linker system allowed the positioning of 1.55 mm-bore cuffs on vena porta and 2.40 mm-bore cuffs on vena cava (recipients weighing 200 ±20 g). By contrast, when we tried transplanting using Kamada's technique, they could not exceed 1.40 mm and 2.16 mm, respectively (rats matching for strain and weight). As shown in Figure 7, quick-linker rings are designed to keep recipient's vessels on optimal stretching, allowing minimum caliper and length wasting, which results in closer-to-physiological hemodynamic results.    \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4143/4143fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
