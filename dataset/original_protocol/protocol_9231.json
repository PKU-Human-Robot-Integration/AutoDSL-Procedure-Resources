  "procedures": [
    "1. Dissection of the mouse VNO\nUse adult mice. As pheromone sensing is implicated in multimodalities, careful distinction between strains, genotypes, sexes and ages is important and will influence your results. Here, we choose adult VG mice30 previously used for the identification of a pheromone-receptor pair (2-heptanone-V1rb2)31 (Fig. 1A).\nBefore starting the dissection, prepare fresh cold artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (ACSF; NaCl 118 mM, NaHCO3 25 mM, D-Glucose 10 mM, KCl 2 mM, MgCl2 2 mM, NaH2PO4 1.2 mM, CaCl2 2 mM; pH 7.4) saturated with oxycarbon (95% O2 : 5% CO2). For that, mix all the ACSF components except CaCl2. Saturate the solution by directly bubbling it with oxycarbon. In the end, add the CaCl2 and adjust with ddH20 to the desired volume. Keep the ACSF solution on ice until use.\nEuthanasia of the mouse should be preferentially done by cervical dislocation or by CO2 inhalation just before the experiment.\nCut the mouse head. Place it under a dissecting microscope in cold ACSF continuously oxycarbonated.\nCut the lower jaw and position the head in order to visualize the palate (Fig. 1B).\nMake an incision horizontally in the upper part of the palate (Fig. 1B) with micro scissors and remove the palate membrane with micro dissecting forceps. Hydrate and clean the exposed cavity with ACSF (Fig. 1C).\nCut the upper and the lower part of the nasal septum (Fig. 1C). Delicately extract the nasal septum containing the VNO and place it directly in ACSF on ice (Fig. 1D).\nSeparate vertically the two parts of the VNO using micro dissecting forceps and delicately remove the cartilaginous capsule of the VNO (Fig. 1E). Make sure that all the cartilaginous pieces are removed.\n2. VNO tissue slice preparation",
    "The VNO tissue slice preparation described in this section 2) is mainly for calcium imaging investigations. VNO slices can also be used for immunohistostainings on floating slices to verify the structural integrity of the tissue (please see section 3) of the protocol).\nPrepare low-melting agar (3% in standard PBS) and your working place. You will need ACSF, a microtome and supports, micro dissecting forceps, embedding molds (22 x 22 x 20 mm), precision wipes, brushes, tissue culture plates, cyanacrylat glue, ice and a thermometer.\nFill the embedding mold with 3% low-melting agar. Make sure that the temperature is not higher than 41°C before placing vertically the shortly wiped VNO (Fig. 2A) to be able to obtain coronal slices.\nPlace the embedding mold on ice for 1 min until solidification and then separate it from the agar block. Cut the agar block in a pyramidal shape and place it with glue on the microtome support (Fig. 2B).\nCut coronal VNO slices with the microtome, with a speed of 0.5 mm/s, an amplitude of 0.7 mm and a thickness of 100 μm in cold ACSF and collect the tissue slices with a brush before placing them in a tissue culture plate filled with cold ACSF.\nIf your slices contain endogenous fluorescence like GFP (in gene-targeted neurons) you can select them under a fluorescent stereomicroscope (Fig. 2C).\n3. Immunohistochemistry on VNO floating slices",
    "The goal of this procedure is to verify the integrity of the VNO tissue slices obtained in section 2). Acetylated-tubulin is a microtubule / cytoskeleton marker expressed in dendrites and microvilli of VNO sensory neurons. For calcium imaging experiments, go directly to section 4) of the protocol. The immunohistostaining method on floating VNO slices can be adapted to the evaluation of the expression of any protein of interest. For this purpose, we recommend that you fix the VNO for 1h at 4°C in a fixative solution (paraformaldehyde 4% in PBS, pH 7.6) after the point 1.7) of the protocol and use from this point PBS at pH 7.6 rather than ACSF solution.\nIn the tissue culture plate, fix your slices of interest in a fixative solution (paraformaldehyde 4% in PBS, pH 7.6) 1h at 4°C.\nBlock your tissue slices overnight at 4°C in a PBS solution containing NGS (normal goat serum) 10% and triton X-100 at 0.5%.\nIncubate slices with the primary antibody (anti-acetylated-tubulin, Mouse, 1:2000) for 16h at room temperature (RT) in a PBS solution containing NGS 5% and Triton X-100 at 0.25%.\nWash 3 times for 5 minutes with a PBS solution containing NGS 2%.\nIncubate in the dark with the secondary antibody (Cy5-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse, 1:200) in a PBS solution containing NGS 2% for 1h at RT.\nWash 3 times for 5 minutes with PBS containing NGS 2%, PBS NGS 1% and PBS only.\nMount your slices in a fluorescent mounting media (containing or not DAPI) by placing them in the centre of the hydrophobic delimited zones (use a hydrophobic pen) and cover the slices with coverslips.\nMake observations and acquisitions with confocal microscopy and a software allowing 3D reconstructions (Fig. 2D-F).\n4. Calcium imaging on VNO slices",
    "The following procedures will take place in the dark. Incubate VNO slices for 1h at 37°C in a loading solution composed of cold ACSF with Fura-2AM (7 μM; stock solution of 1 mM in DMSO) and pluronic 0.1% (w/v; stock solution at 20 % in ddH2O).\nKeep the loaded slices on ice with oxycarbonation until use. Loaded slices can be kept for 3-4h.\nPlace the loaded slices with a brush in a perfusion chamber containing ACSF and maintain the slices with a tissue slice anchor (Fig. 3A).\nPlace the perfusion chamber on the stage of a calcium imaging microscope (Fig. 3B) and continuously perfuse with oxycarbonated ACSF at RT. Temperature can be adapted with the use of a bipolar temperature controller.\nObservations of the loaded VNO slices (Fig. 3C-E) are performed with an inverted fluorescence microscope, with a 25x or 63x objective and a CooL SNAP-HQ camera. Illumination is done sequentially (340/380 nm) with a polychromator instrument and recorded at a rate of 5Hz. Filtered emission is done at 510 nm. Intracellular calcium ratio changes (ΔF = 340 nm/380 nm) are monitored with an appropriate software.\nChemostimulation should be selected according to your own experimental purpose. Here, perfusions of ACSF containing a pheromone mix (isobutylamine, 2-heptanone, 4-heptanone, 2-heptanol, pentylacetate, dimethylpyrazine, α/β-farnesene, 10-6 M), 2-heptanone (10-6 M) or freshly collected male and female (1:1) mouse urine (1:100) are performed32. Perfusion of ATP (125 μM) is used as a viability test at the end of the experiments (Fig. 3F) and should indicate a proportion of approximately 80% viable neurons. Under these conditions, slices can be used up to 2 hours.\nGFP-tagged subpopulations of sensory neurons are visualised by specific illumination (here the V1rb2 expressing neurons) and can be analysed precisely (Fig. 3G-I).\n5. Representative Results:",
    "To establish a functional assay to investigate the multi transduction pathways taking place in the mouse VNO, or to identify new pheromone-receptor pairs, we take advantage of the VG mouse line (Fig. 1A). In this line, one out of 240 V1Rs receptors, the V1Rb2 receptor is GFP-tagged allowing the easy visualization of a particular subpopulation of vomeronasal sensory neurons. After extraction and dissection of the VNO (Fig. 1E), we prepare acute VNO slices (Fig. 2C). We fix a fraction of them, in order to check and validate the tissular integrity of the preparation by performing immunohistostainings against the acetylated-tubulin protein (Fig. 2D-F). The other fraction of the slices is used for calcium imaging experiments. For that, slices are loaded with Fura-2AM (Fig. 3C-E) and the intracellular calcium level of each neuron is monitored as a ΔF ratio (Fig. 3F). Viability of the neurons is evaluated by perfusion of ATP (125 μM), after which rapid and transient increase of the ΔF ratio is expected (Fig. 3F). Urine being a major source of pheromones, perfusion of freshly collected mouse urine (1:100) is used as an endogenous control. It triggers calcium transients in approximately 50% of the recorded neurons (cell 1 and 2, Fig. 3F). Under GFP illumination, V1Rb2 positive neurons are observable, and perfusion of its known pheromonal ligand, 2-heptanone, initiates cellular activation (cell 1, Fig. 3I). Interestingly, neuronal activations are also observable in a fraction of neurons that do not express the V1Rb2 receptor (GFP negative neurons) (cell 2, Fig. 3I), demonstrating the complexity of pheromone coding in the VNO.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3311/3311fig1.jpg",
