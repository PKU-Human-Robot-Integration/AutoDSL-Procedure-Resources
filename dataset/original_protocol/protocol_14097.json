    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the scientific Ethics Committee of the North Denmark Region.\n1. Participant Screening\nRecruit participants that are capable of completing the test. Participants must have vision capabilities that allow for fixation on a dot at a distance of 1.0 to 1.5 m away.\nDisqualify participants with a history of neck surgery or cervical herniation, because the head impulses applied might worsen such conditions. Remove any makeup, as this might cause poor tracking of the pupil.\nAssess the eye movements of the participant by performing a gross eye movement examination to rule out any eye muscle palsies that might affect the examination. Also note if there is any spontaneous or gaze-induced nystagmus that may affect the final results.\nPerform a gross eye movement examination by requiring participants to move their eyes in the vertical and horizontal planes to the outer edge of the eye sockets to ensure no eye muscle palsies are present.\nEvaluate sizes of the pupils in a well-lit room and note the configuration of the pupils. This ensures that the tracking of the pupils is not compromised during testing.\nDetermine if both eyes are equally suited for the recording of eye movements.\n\tNOTE: Not all vHIT systems have the option of recording either left or right eye movements.\n\t\nDecide which eye is optimal for recording eye movements (if they are not equally good) following examination of the participants eye movements and visual acuity.\nTake special notice of the area surrounding the eyes and use proper precautions if the participant has one or two droopy eyelids. Evaluate and note if eyelashes are very long and could compromise tracking of the pupils during the test.",
    "Use either vHIT system A or B for the test, if the right eye is suitable for testing. If only the left eye is suitable for testing, then use system A for the vHIT test.\n2. Preparation for the Experiment\nInclude recommended hardware and software to enable video head impulse testing. Make sure to read the manual before installment.\nThe hardware requirements consist of a laptop PC and pair of accompanying lightweight goggles containing a high-speed camera and motion sensor. Use an inertial motion sensor with vHIT system A and head velocity sensor chip (MEMs gyroscope) with system B. The motion sensors provide information about the head velocity. Check that the individual hardware components are intact.\nInstall the appertaining software for each system.\nSeat the participant in a non-rotating solid chair at least 1.5 m away for vHIT system A or at least 1.0 m away (vHIT system B) from a fixation dot placed on a wall. Adjust the height of the chair so that the eyes of the participant are leveled with the fixation dot; alternatively, place dots at different heights to achieve the same effect.\nMake sure the room is well-lit to minimize the size of the pupils. Instruct the patient thoroughly regarding the different steps of the test.\nAsk participants not to move their heads during the test by relaxing their neck muscles. To optimize the test, all head movements must be applied by the examiner.\nAsk the participant to avoid blinking with the eyes during the head impulse. If needed, offer a pause between individual head impulses to overcome this problem. During the test, participants should maintain fixation on a dot on the wall.\n3. Conditions and Experimental Design\nFit and adjust the goggles on the patient’s head. It must be tightly fixed (this is crucial).",
    "Tighten the strap firmly to ensure that goggles will not shift during application of head impulses. Place the cable from the goggles at the midline of the neck and attach it to the cable strap holder (vHIT system A) or with the accompanying cable clip to the patient’s clothing (vHIT system B).\nEnsure that the eyes are wide open, with eyelids in a position where they do not interfere with pupil detection. If required, adjust the skin around the eyelid accordingly.\nTilt either the bottom or top of the goggles out and away from the face, pull the skin up or down, and reposition the goggles to hold the skin in place. Visually inspect to see if the goggle fit is satisfactory.\nNOTE: The goggle fit is an extremely important procedure. Improper goggle fit may result in inaccurate data collection with addition of noise to the test.\nAlign the camera to center the pupil in the image by rotating the camera in the yaw, pitch, or roll direction. Place the boundary of the lower eyelid along the bottom edge of the image (vHIT system A).\nWith vHIT system B, position the ROI (region of interest) around the pupil and select auto threshold on the laptop.\nAssess the tracking of the pupil by making short horizontal and vertical head movements prior to initiation of the test. Make sure that the entire pupil is visible in all positions. Adjust manually if necessary.\nCheck if the reflections from the LED (two white dots) appear to be close to the edge of the pupil. If this is the case, move the patients head forward in the pitch plane to increase the distance between the two reflections and pupil (system A and B).",
    "Ask the participant to look straight ahead at the leveled fixation dot. If the center laser projection does not match the fixation dot on the wall, readjust the laser that is mounted on the part of the goggle that sits above the rim of the nose (system A).\n4. Calibration\nFor vHIT system A, initiate standard calibration (steps 4.1.1-4.1.2) prior to testing of the lateral SCCs with the appertaining software. Immediately following this procedure, initiate head calibration (step 4.1.3) if vertical SCC testing is intended.\nDouble-click the software icon on the desktop, which will open the program. Select the instrument by double-clicking on the EyeSeeCam icon in the Select Instrument Box.\n\t\t\nSelect Standard in the Calibration menu and click on Prepare.\nTell the participant to look at the middle laser dot. Inform the participant not to blink and instruct the participant to look at each of the designated laser dots for approximately 2-3 s (one at a time) without moving the head.\nFollow the instructions on the screen or decide the order in which the patient must look at the dots. It is important that participants direct their eyes to each of the five dots once, preferably twice.\n\t\t\nMake sure the standard calibration meets the required criteria. A good calibration is visualized in the calibration report as a cross in which each arm is equally long (see Figure 1).\nMake sure there are five highlighted circles illustrating one center point and the four outer markings (Eye in Image). Also make sure the arms of the cross are located in zero degrees both vertically and horizontally (Eye in Space).\nPerform the head calibration to include vertical SCC testing. Select Head in the Calibration menu, then click on Prepare.",
    "Ensure that the amplitude of the head movements (peak head velocity) is around 50°/s. Amplitude must not exceed 100°/s (the edge of the circle markings).\nRotate the patients head back and forth (along pitch axis) at least 5x followed by side-to-side rotations (along the yaw axis) at least 5x. The motion is depicted on the screen.\nMake sure the amplitude of the head movements is around 50°/s. Be careful that it does not exceed 100°/s (the edge of the circle markings).\nEvaluate the quality of the calibration. Learn the characteristics of a good head calibration.\n\t\t\t\nMake sure the markings do not exceed the edge of the circle. Also ensure that markings are in close proximity to the vertical and horizontal lines.\nMake sure a third image is shaped like a cross where the legs do not deviate more than one triangle vertically and horizontally (see Figure 2).\nUse the default settings if the patient cannot fully cooperate during the calibration. Try recalibrating at least 2x before choosing this option.\nFor vHIT system B, follow these steps of calibration to enable testing of all six SCCS. Make sure the ROI embeds the entire pupil area.\nTurn the lasers on. Ask the participant to move the head to position the left and right laser dots on each side of the fixation dot equidistantly (see Figure 3).\nTell the participant to keep their head in that position. Ask the participant to follow the visible laser beam dot by moving their eyes only (during calibration, only one laser dot is visible alternating between the left and right side).\nCheck the calibration by having participants stare at the fixation dot. Move their heads side-to-side about 10°.",
    "Check that eye and head velocities match. Keep in mind that catch-up saccades seen during low frequency head rotations can indicate either vestibular loss, cerebellar dysfunction, or both.\n5. Procedure\nGeneral test principles:\nDeliver head impulses unpredictably. This is required both in regard to direction and timing.\nDeliver abrupt head impulses. Apply head impulses with a small amplitude (5°-20°).\n\t\t\nPerform high acceleration head impulses (1,000°/s2-4,000°/s2). Make sure that the head impulses are fast.\nDeliver head impulses with peak head velocities between 150°/s-250°/s for horizontal SCC testing and deliver head impulses with peak head velocities between 100°/s-250°/s for vertical SCC testing.\nDeliver head impulses with an amplitude of 5°-20°. After completion of each head impulse, the software will provide feedback on quality of the head impulses.",
    "​NOTE: With vHIT system A, head impulses are accepted if peak head velocity is reached within the first 70 ms after onset of the head impulse and if the peak head velocity exceeds 150°/s (lower limit may be changed according to personal preferences). Note that this is shown visually by a green check mark or alternatively with a red cross indicating that the given head impulse did not meet the predefined criteria. With vHIT system B, data is collected in real-time during the actual testing. Head impulses will be accepted if the predefined data algorithm criteria are met. These include a head movement with a peak head velocity of minimum of 120°/s to 250°/s for testing of the lateral SCCs and a head movement with peak head velocity of minimum of 100°/s to 250°/s for testing of the vertical SCCs. Head impulses will also be rejected if the frame rate drops below 219 frames/s. Following each head impulse, operator feedback is also displayed for the current impulse. A green circle indicates that the head impulse was accepted (performed adequately), and an orange dot indicates that the head impulse was rejected (not performed adequately).\nTo perform horizontal SCC testing, place hands on the jaw or on top of the head. Be careful not to touch the goggle strap or cable to avoid any unintentional movement of the goggles.\nAsk participants to clench their teeth during testing to reduce jaw movement and facilitate a more direct force transfer to the head if testing is done with hands placed on the jaws.",
    "Turn the patients head 30° forward in the pitch plane to position the horizontal SCCs completely horizontal. Deliver between 10 to 20 head impulses to each side. Note that the software keeps track of the total number of impulses applied to each SCC.\nTo perform vertical SCC testing, place the dominant hand on top of the patient’s head and direct the fingers in the direction of the anterior SCC to be tested. Place the non-dominant hand on the chin.\nAsk participants to clench their teeth (the patient may bite on a wooden tongue depressor). Be careful not to touch the goggle strap or cable to avoid unintentional movement of the goggles (thumbs can be positioned on the mastoid and other fingers on the mandible).\nTwo different methods for testing of the VOR function of the vertical SCCs exist. Evaluate the vertical SCC function using either the 2D (step 5.3.3) or 3D vHIT (step 5.3.4) test method (see Figure 4).\nUse the 2D vHIT test method for examination with vHIT system B. Rotate the chair 45° to either side, and before vertical SCC testing, place the table legs on fixed markings on the floor to ensure exact alignment of the starting position with every consecutive test. This will also assure a minimum distance of 1 m between the participant’s test eye and fixation point on the wall.\n\t\t\nRight anterior (RA) and left posterior (LP) SCC: turn the solid chair 45° to the left. Ask the patient to look at the fixation dot. The eye that is being measured is now lateralized.\n\t\t\t\nRight anterior (RA): rotate the participants head forwards in the pitch plane perpendicular to the wall. Be careful not to touch the cable or the goggle strap.",
    "Left posterior (LP): rotate the participants head backwards in the pitch plane perpendicular to the wall. Be careful not to touch the cable or the goggle strap.\nLeft anterior (LA) and right posterior (RP) SCC: turn the solid chair 45° to the right. Ask the patient to look at the fixation dot. The eye that is being measured is now medialized.\n\t\t\t\nLeft anterior (LA): rotate the participants head forwards in the pitch plane perpendicular to the wall. Be careful not to touch the cable or the goggle strap.\nRight posterior (RP): rotate the participant’s head backwards in the pitch plane perpendicular to the wall. Be careful not to touch the cable or the goggle strap.\nUse the 3D vHIT test method for examination with vHIT system A.\n\t\t\nPosition the participant in front of the wall at the desired distance. Ask the patient to remain in this position throughout the entire test.\nUse the direction/plane guide in the upper right corner for visualization of the plane of the head rotations during vertical SCC testing. If the test is done correctly, the direction must be depicted within the colored areas where the direction is shown in grey and the latest vertical head impulse in black.\nRight anterior (RA) SCC: rotate the head forwards and 45° to the right of the sagittal plane. Left posterior (LP) SCC: rotate the head backwards and 45° to the left of the sagittal plane.\nLeft anterior (LA) SCC: rotate the head forwards and 45° to the left of the sagittal plane. Right posterior (RP) SCC: rotate the head backwards and 45° to the right of the sagittal plane.\nBe careful not to touch the cable or goggle strap, as it may add noise to the test.\n6. Interpretation of Results",
    "During testing, both vHIT systems disregard datasets that do not meet certain predefined criteria. Adjust the preset head velocity criteria of both vertical and horizontal SCCs with system A manually (optional).\nNote that a final algorithm, incorporated in the company software, automatically removes head impulses than contain artifacts and noise following completion of the vHIT test. If the final test results still contain noise or artifacts, remove artifacts/noise by manual data selection.\nBoth vHIT systems allow video recording of the eye movements during testing as an additional means of troubleshooting. Enable this is as needed (optional).\nManually remove additional noise/artifacts following vHIT system A testing with the appertaining software. Enter the Edit menu.\n\t\t\nChoose Velocity Trace Selection. Select Multiple in the dropdown menu.\nManually select the curves to be deleted and choose Delete Selected. A new report without the selected curves will then be generated. In case too many curves have been removed by a mistake, selection of Show All will regenerate the original report containing all data initially obtained.\nManually remove additional noise/artifacts following vHIT system B testing with the appertaining software. Enter the 2D analysis menu.\n\t\t\nPlace the cursor at the desired head impulse to highlight the entire graph related to that specific head impulse. Press delete to manually remove this head impulse if graph contains noise and/or artifacts.\nMean gain values and graphs containing saccades will adjust concomitantly following manual removal of head impulses. Restore the dataset in case of unintended deletion of head impulses.\nEvaluate and interpret the test report upon completion of the vHIT test. The test report includes a 2D graphic depiction of the head impulse by means of time and head and eye velocities as well as calculation of a mean gain value.",
    "The mean gain value is calculated by dividing the peek eye velocity (°/s) by peak head velocity (°/s). The normal range for the horizontal SCC gain values are 0.80 to 1.207. Determine if the gain value is either within the normal range, too high, or too low.\n\t\t\nIf the mean gain value is between 0.80 and 1.20, conclude that the gain value is normal.\nPerform all steps of the vHIT test again, including a recalibration (perform all steps and substeps included in step 4, and perform all steps and substeps included in step 5 for the relevant vHIT system), if higher than expected mean gain values are obtained (>1.20).\n​NOTE: High numbers do not truly represent any vestibular pathology but indicate that the test was not carried out correctly or that the participant did not fully cooperate during the test.\nIf the mean gain value is below 0.80, conclude that the gain value is too low and may represent pathology within the vestibular organ by means of compromised VOR function.\nThe normal range for the vertical SCC gain values are 0.70 to 1.207. Determine if the gain value is within the normal range, too high, or too low. If the mean gain value is between 0.70 and 1.20, conclude that the gain value is normal.\n\t\t\t\nPerform all steps of the vHIT test again, including a recalibration (perform all steps and substeps included in step 4, and perform all steps and substeps included in step 5 for the relevant vHIT system), if higher than expected mean gain values are obtained (>1.20).\n​NOTE: High numbers do not truly represent any vestibular pathology but indicate that the test was not carried out correctly or that the participant did not fully cooperate during the test.",
    "If the mean gain value is below 0.70, conclude that the gain value is too low and may represent pathology within the vestibular organ by means of compromised VOR function.\nEvaluate the test report graphs and determine if any saccades are present. Saccades are corrective eye movements and, if pathological, are due to a compromised VOR function.\nInterpret all graphic material and conclude whether or not pathological saccades are present as defined by Abrahamsen et al.13.\n\t\t\nEvaluate the frequency of potential saccades. The saccades must occur in more than 50% of the total number of head impulses.\nEvaluate the latency of potential saccades. The saccades must occur within the interval between 100 ms after the head movement is initiated and within 100 ms after head movement has stopped.\nEvaluate the velocity of potential saccades. The saccades must have a peak head velocity of minimum 50% of the peak head velocity.\nEvaluate the direction of potential saccades. The saccades must be in the same direction as the VOR. If the saccades are depicted in the opposite direction, consider if the findings may be depictions of spontaneous nystagmus instead.\n7. Conclusion\nClassify the vHIT examination of each separate SCC to be normal, atypical, or pathological based on the mean gain value and the presence/absence of pathological saccades.\nConclude the individual SCC function to be normal if the mean gain value is within the normal range and no pathological saccades are present.\nConclude the individual SCC function to be pathological if the mean gain value is below the normal range and pathological saccades are present.\nConclude the individual SCC function to be potentially compromised/atypical if the mean gain value is below the normal range and no concomitant pathological saccades are present.",
