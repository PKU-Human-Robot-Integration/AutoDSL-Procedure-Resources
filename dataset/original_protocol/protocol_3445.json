    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell-tracking microfluidics data collection\nTiming: 36 h/1.5 days\nThis step describes how to collect microfluidics data for single-cell tracing.\nDay 1\nSet up yeast cultures by inoculating 3 mL synthetic media of choice in a 15-mL tube with yeast from a freshly streaked plate (less than 1 month old) and grow at 30°C with shaking at 250–300 rpm for 10–15 h.\nDay 2\nFilter media through a 0.22 μm filter to remove particulate matter or precipitates from older media that could clog the microfluidics microchambers/microchannels.\nDilute cells by inoculating a fresh culture of 3 mL media with 25–50 μL culture from step 1 and grow at 30°C with shaking at 250–300 rpm for ∼4 h (∼2 doublings) until cells reach low log phase (∼3–9 × 106 cells/mL).\nNote: Many strains of S. cerevisiae grown in typical growth media are in log phase with a concentration of ∼0.3–3 × 107 cells/mL. In most spectrophotometers, this corresponds to an optical density (OD) from 0.1 to 1; however, this should be previously determined. Using spectrophotometers where S. cerevisiae log phase is 0.1–1, low log phase corresponds to OD readings between 0.1 and 0.3.\nPlace microfluidics chip in the heating chip holder and secure the chip with screws + holders.\nCritical: The chip should be sufficiently tightly secured such that movement is not possible during the time-lapse experiment; however, take care not to apply too much pressure on the chip, as this can cause the coverslip to break. Securing the chip is important to prevent movement so that cells of interest are continually tracked and remain in focus.\nConnect all tubings (media and cell) to the chip and prime with media.",
    "Note: We recommend using ∼10 cm of tubing for cell inlet and outlet. The tubing lengths for media inlet and outlet will depend on your setup, but ∼50 cm tubing should be sufficient for most setups.\nNote: We recommend priming the chip and tubings with enough media until a continuous flow is observed into the waste (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nOptional: Tape the tubings onto the stage. Tubings can move during the experiment and affect the focus of the cells.\nCarefully inject cells obtained from the low log phase culture into each microchamber using a 1 mL syringe and a 22 gauge blunt edge needle inserted into 1 of the 2 cell tubes attached to each microchamber (the other cell tube allows uncaptured cells and media to flow out of the chip) such that each microchannel has very few cells.\nCritical: It is best that the starting cells that will be captured and tracked have a bud. This helps to avoid capturing old/sick/arrested/dying cells. In case unwanted cells are captured, they can be flushed out by injecting more culture with a slightly harder push on the syringe.\nNote: Choose the number of starting cells depending on the purpose and length of the experiment. For example, in a memory experiment as in Bheda et al. (2020a)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], we started the experiment with ∼2 budding cells in each region of interest to capture ∼8 generations.\nStart pumping media through chip.\nNote: We recommend a flow rate of 10–50 μL/min. Higher flow rates can lead to loss of cells (see “Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]”).\nChoose positions to image. Set focus for each position. Collect images with 3-min resolution with phase contrast and any filters for fluorescent molecules of interest.",
    "Note: For segmentation and analysis by PhyloCell, we recommend the following order of acquisition: (channel 1) phase contrast, (channel 2) fluorescent protein of interest, (channel 3) lineage marker.\nNote: Exposure levels and times will need to be determined for each protein of interest such that signal is not saturated and there is minimal photobleaching.\nNote: According to our experience, capturing images every 3 min provides enough time resolution for cell mapping and to capture budding events for lineage tracking without resulting in severe phototoxicity (see “Limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]”).\nCritical: We have successfully used the Perfect Focus System (Nikon) and the Definite Focus (Zeiss) autofocus systems to minimize focus loss. Even with autofocus systems, there can be focus loss due to e.g., tubing movement, channel clogging, or thermal expansion. Therefore, we recommend checking the progress of the experiment after 30 min to 1 h to ensure that cells are still in focus.\nDay 3\nAfter the experiment is complete, clean media and cell tubings by pumping first ddH2O, then 80% ethanol, and then drying them completely by letting air run through.\nNote: We recommend a flow rate of ∼300 μL/min for 20 min for each step, therefore running ∼6 mL of each liquid through the tubings.\nCell-tracking microfluidics data processing\nThis step describes how images collected from the single-cell tracking microfluidics data should be processed prior to quantification and statistical analyses. We have used the custom software PhyloCell (see “Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” above for further details).\nSegment cells using fluorescence or phase contrast images.",
    "Note: To use PhyloCell for this step, the images should first be imported to generate a segmentation project. We recommend JPEG image files. PhyloCell can generate a segmentation project in a number of ways. For more details, please access the help files available for PhyloCell on Github (see “Loading images and generating segmentation projects with PhyloCell”). For Nikon NIS Elements users, we have a function available to convert the ND2 file format into a PhyloCell project with JPEG images.\nOptional: Segment lineage markers.\nMap cells so that they are tracked from frame to frame.\nBuild pedigrees based on mother-bud proximity or lineage markers (see “Preparation of yeast reporter strains[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]” in “Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” above).\nCorrect any segmentation, mapping, or lineage errors.\nMeasure fluorescence in segmented cells.\nNote: This information can be used as absolute fluorescence or as normalized to cell area.\nSubtract cellular autofluorescence and/or background fluorescence to determine fluorescence signal of interest.\nNote: Different kinds of media (e.g., synthetic vs rich or glucose vs galactose) result in different autofluorescence levels. Therefore, rather than subtracting autofluorescence signal in the strain of interest from a non-inducing medium, it is preferable to use a strain with the same background lacking the reporter.\nNote: Background fluorescence can be calculated using a contour in the image that does not contain any cells."
