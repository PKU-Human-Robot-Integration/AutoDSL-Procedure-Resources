    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCldU Administration\nTiming: 2 weeks\nCells are treated with CldU (1 μM) for two consecutive weeks to ensure all the parent DNA strands are labeled (all steps in the below protocol are performed with U2OS cells. Adjustments can be made for other cell lines).\nTo label the DNA strands, add CldU to the culture media at a final concentration of 1 μM for 2 weeks (Pine et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). During this period, cells are maintained in the exponential growth phase by passaging every 72 h. CldU-containing media is freshly prepared by diluting the stock at 1:1000 before passaging.\nTwo weeks later, seed 1–2 × 105 cells on a 20 mm poly-lysine-coated glass coverslip in a 12 well plate for immunofluorescence, to verify that all cells are CldU positive (refer to steps 10–20, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/221-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Immunofluorescence Images Showing All Cells Are CldU Positive after Being Treated with CldU for 2 Weeks\nScale bars, 20 μm.\nNote: As the cell cycle length and CldU labeling efficiency vary among different cell lines, the labeling period should be modified accordingly. As for U2OS, the preliminary experiment showed that two-week CldU administration can achieve the highest labeling efficiency without causing significant cytotoxicity.\nCritical: It is important to make sure that all the chromosomes are labeled with CldU, so that the old parental DNA could be detected as CldU-positive DNA strands.\nPause Point: The CldU-labeled cells can be cryopreserved for a couple of months at −80°C using a standard protocol for cell cryopreservation with CELLSAVING.\nCell Synchronization, Replication Stress Induction, and G1 Daughter Cells Collection\nTiming: 3 days",
    "After being cultured in the absence of CldU for one cell cycle (around 24 h), cells are treated with DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (0.3 μM) and CDK1 inhibitor RO3306 (9 μM) to induce replication stress (Okamoto et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], Minocherhomji et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) and G2/M arrest, respectively. Replication stress induction is the key step to increase the frequency of NDS (Xing et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nReseed the cells at 30%–50% confluence in CldU free media in a 10 cm dish for one cell cycle (about 24 h for U2OS cells), after which the nascent DNA strands are CldU negative but the old DNA strands are still CldU positive as the result of semi-conservative DNA replication.\nIn order to enrich mitotic cells in the next cell cycle, two enrichment steps are performed as followed. First, add thymidine directly to the culture media at a final concentration of 2 mM for 18 h (Chen and Deng, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) to synchronize cells in the S phase.\nSecond, wash the cells with PBS for two times and reseed into a new 10 cm dish at 50% confluence in culture media supplemented with 9 μM RO3306 and 0.3 μM aphidicolin. 16 h later, most of cells are at late S phase to G2/M boundary (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/221-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Wash the cells with prewarmed PBS for three times within 5 min and add 6 mL of prewarmed culture media to the plate. Put the culture plate back into the 37°C incubator for another 30 min to release the cells into mitosis.\nCritical: To enrich mitotic cells, make sure PBS and culture media are preheated at 37°C and the wash procedure is finished within 5 min.\n30 min after releasing the cells, many orbicular and bright mitotic cells can be seen under the microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Remove 3 mL culture media from the culture dish and shake off the loosely attached mitotic cells by gently tapping the side of the plate (Macheret and Halazonetis, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Rotate the plate between each tap to allow even removal of mitotic cells. Rinse the plate with the remaining 3 mL media and collect the mitotic cells in a 15 mL tube at 25°C–37°C.\nTo ensure complete removal of mitotic cells, repeat the shake-off process for multiple rounds (1–3 times recommended), aspirating and adding 3 mL of fresh media between each round.\nNote: When collecting the mitotic cells, gently aspirate and collect any liquid that is adhering to the lid or the edge of the plate to achieve better recovery.\nNote: Verify under the microscope that few mitotic cells have remained on the culture plate after the collecting procedure.\nCentrifugate at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspend the collected mitotic cells in 3 mL of fresh media. Seed the cells into a 12 well culture plate with an appropriate number of coverslips and incubate them at the 37°C incubator for at least 140 min to allow the cells to progress into G1 phase (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Note: If only a single shake-off is performed in step 8, the mitotic cells can be directly seeded into the 12 well plate without centrifugation.\nNote: The number of coverslips can be decided according to the number of collected mitotic cells. Based on the preliminary experiment, 2–4 × 104 mitotic cells can be recovered from a 10 cm dish and are suitable for 2 to 4 wells with coverslips.\nNote: As the cell cycle varies among different cells, the release time should be optimized for the cell line used. We recommend a combination of microscopic examination of the cellular morphology and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry to determine the optimal time for harvesting the daughter cells. Under bright field microscopy, the morphology of the reseeded mitotic cells can be examined at different time points. The time when most of the cells divide into two neighboring cells separated by a clear cleavage furrow will be appropriate for collecting G1 daughter cells. With flow cytometry-based cycle analysis, the appropriate release time can be determined as when the DNA content of most cells decrease from 4 N to 2 N.\nWash cells with PBS once and fix them with ice-cold 70% ethanol at −20°C for at least 2 h.\nPause Point: Fixed cells can be stored at −20°C for no more than 2 weeks.\nImmunostaining and Fluorescence Microscopy\nTiming: 1–2 days\nImmunostaining and nonrandom DNA segregation detection.\nTo denature the DNA, cells are incubated with 2 N HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (500 μL each well) at 4°C for 1 h (Pine et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nCritical: 2 N HCl treatment is indispensable because CldU can only be stained when the DNA is fully denatured.",
    "After two washes with 0.5% Triton X-100/0.5% BSA in PBS and one wash in 0.5% Triton X-100/0.1% BSA in PBS, cells are blocked using 5% BSA/0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (500 μL each well) at 4°C for 1 h.\nPrepare 3% BSA as the antibody dilution buffer: To prepare 10 mL, add 300 mg BSA to 10 mL PBS and mix well.\nIncubate cells with anti-BrdU BU1/75 (1:1000 dilution in 3% BSA, 400 μL each well) at 4°C for at least 8 h (Sarek et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nOptional: Primary antibody (BU1/75) incubation time can be shortened to 1–2 h at 25°C.\nWash the cells with PBS for three times and incubate with anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594 (1:2000 dilution in 3% BSA, 400 μL each well) for 1 h at 25°C, protected from light.\nCritical: Wash cells for at least three times to reduce nonspecific binding.\nWash cells with PBS for three times and incubate with 1 μg/mL DAPI (400 μL each well) at 4°C for 10 min, protected from light.\nWash cells with PBS once.\nPipette 20–30 μL of Fluoromount-G mounting media on each clean glass slide.\nTake out the coverslips from the 12 well culture plate carefully using a syringe with curved needle and a tweezer. Mount the coverslips with the cells facing down on the glass slides. Seal the coverslips with nail polish.\nImages are captured using the Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. First, use DAPI channel (Ex 359 nm) to locate suspicious daughter cells whose nuclei are close to each other. Then use DIC channel to validate they are bona fide daughter cells separated by a cleavage furrow, rather than merely two adjacent cells. Finally, images are captured with DAPI channel (Ex 359 nm ) and TRITC channel (Ex 550 nm) using OLYMPUS FV31S SW.",
    "Note: Keep the exposure time same for each channel.\nThe chromatin segregation pattern is determined by ImageJ.\nOpen a stored image of TRITC channel and convert the image to 8-bit of gray.\nAdjust the threshold using the slider. Choose the parameters of the Integrated density (IntDen) and shape descriptors in the “set measurement.”\nSelect one of the daughter cells by the area selection tools and obtain its IntDen value by clicking “measure.”\nCalculate the relative fluorescence as log2 (IntDen of one daughter cell / IntDen of another daughter cell). Daughter cells with a relative fluorescence above 8 are defined as NDS.\nNote: According to the preliminary results, there were two distinct groups of data well separated at the cutoff of 8. So, we defined those cell pairs with a CldU ratio above 8 as NDS.\nOptional: BF (Bright field) and PH (Phase contrast) are alternatives to DIC.\nOptional: Other fluorescent microscopes are optional."
