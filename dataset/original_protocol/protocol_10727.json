    "Data collection and data analysis in this project have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Georg-Elias-Müller Institute for Psychology of the University of Göttingen (proposal 039/2012).\n1. Experimental Setup\nChoose a location that is away from a high-traffic area, such as in a computer lab or other specified area with individual workstations that can be configured as an LAN (local area network).\nArrange for 10 to 12 notebooks of the same type to be used for the experiment as well as one computer to function as the server (Figure 6). The server program as well as client programs need a JAVA runtime environment, which is available on all common operation systems (a Raspberry Pi as client can suffice).\nEquipment configuration\n\t\nArrange notebooks on individual workstation tables with chairs as shown in Figure 7.\nConnect notebooks to the server computer via Ethernet cables and a network switch to create a local area network.\nInstall partition walls between individual workstations to prevent visual sensory communication (eye contact, hand gestures, facial expressions, etc.) between neighboring participants.\nAcquire earplugs (for one-time use) to be distributed to all participants to prevent audible communication between participants.\n2. Participant Recruitment\nChoose a recruiting location where there are a large amount of people, such as the entrance hall of an auditorium.\nAddress potential recruits using the standardized text that explains the purpose and background of experiment, experiment duration, maximum payment calculated according to performance, and requirement for participation in a multiplayer game on institution-owned laptops.\nEnsure that participants can understand the English and German instructions and questionnaires related to the experiments.\nIf the experimental design includes the use of colors, ensure that participants are free of any color blindness that may prevent them from differentiating the colors used.",
    "Do not recruit previous participants, as participants should be naïve to the experiment.\nLead willing recruits to a waiting area away from the recruiting area. Kindly request that they await completion of the group recruitment without talking to each other. Explain that this restriction is related to integrity of the experimental results.\nOnce 10 to 12 participants have been recruited, lead them into the pre-arranged computer lab or specified area where the experiment will take place.\nBefore participants take their places in the partition-encased workstations, have the participants sign a form designating informed consent.\nDistribute the hygienic, one-time use earplugs to all participants. Inform them that audio-visual communication with other participants is prohibited. Therefore, the use of earplugs and partition-encased workstations is mandatory.\nHave participants take their places in the partition-encased workstations.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nNOTE: In this experimental procedure, the game used by Boos et al.1 is described as an application example.\nPreparation phase\n\t\nThe program itself is formatted as a zip-file HC.zip containing 1) the runnables HC.jar, 2) three files for configuration, namely hc_server.config, hc_panel.config, and hc_client.config, and 3) two subfolders named intro and rawdata.\nCreate a shared folder on the server computer and unzip the HC.zip into this folder.\nOn each client computer, mount and access this shared folder and open a terminal (Linux, Mac OS X: spotlight | search | terminal) or a prompt (Windows: search \"cmd\"), respectively. Use the command “dir” or “ls” so that the unzipped files appear on each terminal.\nExecute the command “java -version” on each terminal to ensure that a java runtime environment is available. If not, install java before continuing.\nLook in the three configure files.",
    "Edit hc_server.configure to configure the 1) number of players, 2) minimum numbers and maximum numbers of moves each player can make, 3) values of the so-called nuggets, and 4) perception radius condition (local or global).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The two perception conditions are the global condition (player can see positions of avatars of all participants) and local condition (player can see only those avatars adjacent to their avatar; see Figure 3)\nEdit hc_client.configure to tell the clients the server's IP.\nIn hc_panel.config, adjust the size of the hexagons according to the screen's resolution.\nFirst, start the server program HC_Gui.jar (Figure 8) using the command “java -jar HC_Gui.jar”. Then, start the client programs on each workstation using the command “java -jar HC_ClientAppl.jar”.\n\t\tNOTE: The clients' screens should display the message, \"Please wait. The computer is connecting to the server.\" In the server GUI, a line appears displaying the IP address of each of the clients. When all clients are connected, the server program displays the message, \"All Clients are connected. Ready to start?\"\n\t\t​NOTE: The experimenter can prepare the session up to this point.\nWhen all participants have taken their places, give the final instructions before they insert the earplugs.\nClick \"OK\" to start the session. Hereon, the experiment is controlled only by the instructions on the screens visible to participants. Instructions for a single experiment require multiple screen pages, and reading is made possible by the participants paging back and forth as necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: Each participant indicates, by clicking a designated button on the screen, that he/she has read the instructions. The experiment cannot commence until all participants are finished reading the instructions.\nTesting phase",
    "Observe whether the participants are mouse-controlling their avatar dot (twice as big as the visible avatar dots of the other participants) on the HoneyComb virtual 97-hexagon playfield (see Figure 1).\nHave participants start the testing phase in the center of the field, then move on the HoneyComb virtual playfield according to the previously provided instructions on screen.\n\t\t\nAll instructions on how to play the game are placed as editable html-files within the program folder of the HoneyComb game. See subfolders intro/de and intro/en for German and English instructions, respectively.\nHave players left-click into the adjacent small hexagon of their choice to move their avatar dot. Only adjacent fields can be chosen for the initial and subsequent moves.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After each move, a small tail appears for 4000 ms for each participant, indicating the last direction from which he/she hailed.\nAllow each participant to partake only once in order to avoid possible biases.\n\t\tNOTE: The game described here requires 5-10 min, including the reading of instructions. Overall, 400 participants in 40 ten-person groups were tested by Boos et al.1.\nDo not restart the experiment with the same participants if there is a technical breakdown or if a participant fails.\n4. Post-Test Phase\nOnce the game is completed, have participants fill out questionnaires assessing demographic data, Big Five personality factors, perceived levels of stress or calmness, and pay satisfaction (to be paid upon completion of the experiment). These questionnaires can be offered as stand-alone html-files.\nWhile participants fill out questionnaires, prepare anonymous envelopes with the appropriate amount of money earned in the HoneyComb game just completed. The game’s HoneyComb-computed amounts to be paid to each player are stipulated on the server screen.\nDistribute the earned payments to participants as they exit the testing area.",
    "Close the server program, then close the client programs once the server program has finished closing.\nTransfer the data, in the form of 2 text files marked by day- and time-stamp of the experiment, to a USB stick."
