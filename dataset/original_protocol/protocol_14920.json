    "The following procedure, developed as part of an investigator-initiated study, was reviewed and approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Committee on Human Research (CHR) and all participants gave informed consent.\n1. Equipment\nUse an EKG gated image capture system to record and analyze the FMD. Connect a Philips HD11 ultrasound to a desktop PC.\nConnect a video signal from the ultrasound with a special frame-grabber card on the PC.\nRelay an audio signal from the ultrasound to an EKG gating module which amplifies the signal. Carry the amplified signal to the PC, to allow the image capture software to identify and record images at a consistent point in the cardiac cycle. Generate the signal from the sharp deflection of the R-wave in the EKG.\nUse a 5-12 MHz linear array transducer to optimize resolution at the depth of the brachial artery.\n2. Subject Preparation\nEnsure that participants fast and avoid exercise for 8 hr before the exam as well as avoid caffeine or nicotine for at least four fours. Ensure that participants avoid medications affecting vascular tone or cardiac output for four half-lives.\n\tNOTE: Diet, medications, and time of day may affect results.\nConduct the exam in a quiet, darkened room at 21 °C. When conducting longitudinal studies, hold repeat exams at the same time of day.\n3. Baseline Measurements\nAsk the subject to lie supine on an exam table. Attach a 3-lead EKG in a standard position. Address any orthopedic issues to ensure the subject will be comfortable and refrain from movement during the exam.\nAllow the subject to rest for 10 min before the start of the exam. After 5 min rest, measure the subject's blood pressure by an oscillometric, non-invasive blood-pressure monitor.",
    "Apply a 5 cm tourniquet cuff in either a proximal or distal position to demonstrate the upper arm technique.\nExtend the subject’s arm laterally and maintain at the level of the heart.\nDepending upon the operator's preference, use a table and pillow to constrain the subject’s arm.\nPlace the arm of the operator in a position that resists fatigue and provides support for the wrist. Try to minimize extension of the wrist and keep the forearm in the anatomic neutral position.\nConduct a cross-sectional scan of the brachial artery, beginning at the insertion of the bicep and proceeding proximally. Use color flow imaging to verify the brachial artery and to locate collateral vessels that may serve as landmarks.\nWhen a suitable position is found, rotate the probe 90° so that the proximal edge appears on the left of the ultrasound screen. Maintain position on the artery using substantial practice and a delicate touch. Verify the orientation by pushing the tissue near the distal edge. Mark the subject’s skin along the distal edge of the probe.\nAlign the focus setting of the probe with the deep or “far” wall of the brachial artery to improve lateral resolution of the image. Vary probe settings on the axial resolution with a higher frequency improving axial resolution.\nAdjust the angle of the probe to optimize contrast resolution of both the near and the far walls. Small changes to the angle can result in improved contrast. Estimate the angle with a simple protractor if serial exams are conducted on the subject.\nTo ensure quality measurements, ensure that the vessel is horizontal and aligned with the longitudinal axis. Make small changes in pressure (heeling one edge of the probe) to help align the artery. Overall, keep pressure light to help prevent operator fatigue.",
    "When optimized, ensure that the “Double Lines of Pignoli” can be seen in both walls, corresponding to the intima-media thickness. Use gain adjustments to reduce echo in the vessel lumen. Allow at least 2 cm of intima-mediate thickness (IMT) on both sides for accurate diameter measurements.\n4. Baseline Measurements\nRecord the baseline velocity using 2D Doppler mode. Place the sample gates in the middle of the lumen and maintain an insonation angle of 60°. Collect 60 sec of data.\n5. Occlusion Phase\nInflate the cuff to 50 mm Hg above the subject’s systolic blood pressure. Using a 5 cm tourniquet cuff will overestimate the systolic pressure. Use the 2D Doppler mode to verify occlusion.\nUse a timer to track the duration of occlusion as many blood pressure cuffs will slowly lose pressure over 5 min. Use 2D Doppler mode to verify complete occlusion.\nAfter 4:30 of occlusion, place the 2D-Doppler gate slightly superficial to the longitudinal axis of the artery. Adjust the vertical scale to account for velocities 2-3x higher than baseline.\nAdjust the settings on the image capture software for 3:10 of recording.\nBegin recording 10 sec before cuff release to capture the time of cuff release, an important parameter when measuring time to peak diameter during data analysis.\n6. Hyperemia\nRelease the cuff. As the artery may shift superficially after cuff release, make small changes to the probe's position while listening for amplification of the sound to help compensate for the shift. Reposition the Doppler sample gate and insonation angle if the artery shifts.\nAfter 30 sec of velocity recording, switch the ultrasound to B-Mode.",
    "Since it is common for the probe to slide proximally during an exam, use vessel landmarks or the marking on the subjects' skin to verify probe position. This phase of the exam is critical for obtaining accurate results.\nAdjust the probe position or angle to optimize the IMT on both walls as small changes can substantially improve the image. Record the diameter for 3 min.\nIf repeat measurements are planned, use the marking on the subject's skin to record distance from the antecubital fossa. Ask the subject to bend their arm 90° and mark the crease. Measure from this line to the line made earlier.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
