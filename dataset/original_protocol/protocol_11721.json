    "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Yale University and the University of Virginia approved all animal experiments listed in this protocol.\n1. Obtain mouse eyes for retinal isolation\nPrepare 1x ice-cold PBS and add 500 μL to each well of a 48-well plate.\nEuthanize neonatal mice at postnatal day six (P6) according to approved institutional guidelines. For this experiment, litters of approximately 4-8 neonatal mice are euthanized at P6 via isoflurane inhalation for at least three minutes after the respiratory arrest, followed by decapitation.\nRemove the eyes from each of the mice. Cut away the skin and membrane over the eye by cutting perpendicular to the eyelid using dissection scissors. Then, use forceps to press down gently above and below the eye so that the eye moves out of the socket.\n\t\nCarefully pinch underneath the eye with the forceps and cut the optic nerve that is keeping the eye attached. Then, place each eye in the 48-well plate in the prepared 1x ice-cold PBS until finished harvesting.\n\t\tNOTE: Use one well per mouse, with both eyes from a single mouse in the same well.\n2. Isolate mouse retinal tissue\nFill a Petri dish, lined with a dissection pad on the bottom, with 500 μL of 1x ice-cold PBS to submerge the eyes and place it under a dissection microscope set to 4.0x magnification.\n\t\nSuspend eyes in the dissection pad using a transfer pipette with a wide tip so as not to damage the eyes.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the eyes are completely covered with PBS.",
    "Using two fine dissection forceps, hold the optic nerve with one of the forceps for stabilization, and with the second forceps pierce a hole through the anterior chamber where the cornea and sclera connect (Figure 1B). Tear the hole in a circle about 75% of the way around the cornea.\n\t\nWhile still holding the optic nerve with one of the forceps, use the second forceps to gently tear the sclera off of the retinal tissue.\nAs above, use the second forceps to gently tear off the vitreous body of the retinal tissue.\nAgain, using the second forceps, gently remove the lens and hyaloid plexus vessels that did not come off when the vitreous body was removed. To do this, reach into the retina with open forceps until almost touching the retina, close the forceps to grab the lens and hyaloid plexus vessels, and pull the forceps out from the retina. This can be repeated until all vessels are removed.\n\t\tNOTE: The hyaloid plexus resembles a clear, web-like structure.\nFill 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes with 500 μL of 1x ice-cold PBS and place the retinas in the tubes. Isolate all retinas from the eyes and place them into ice-cold PBS before moving on.\n\tNOTE: Use one tube per mouse, with two retinas from the same mouse sharing a tube. If retinal tissue is torn, transfer it in multiple pieces. The total time of retinal tissue dissection for a litter of mice should take 15-60 min, starting with euthanasia and ending with final retinal tissue isolation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63133/63133fig01.jpg",

Digest retinal tissue into a single cell suspension\nPrepare 500 μL digestion solution for every two retinas isolated. Add FBS and Collagenase Type II to DMEM to a final concentration of 10% FBS and 1 mg/mL Collagenase Type II. Mix and warm the solution to 37 °C using a water bath.\nRemove excess PBS from the 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes by carefully pipetting. Leave enough PBS to completely cover the retinal tissue, about 100 μL in each tube.\nAdd 500 μL of the digestion solution to each tube with retinal tissue (Figure 1C).\n\t\nUse a P1000 pipettor and pipette tip to pipette up and down the retinal tissue in the digestion solution five times.\nIncubate the digestion mixture in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min.\n\t\nUse a P1000 pipettor and pipette tip to pipette the digestion mixture up and down every 5 min. After incubation, the retinal tissue has dissolved into a single cell suspension, so the digestion mixture should be cloudy (Figure 1C).\n4. Count cells",
    "Set a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C and place the digestion mixture tubes inside. Pellet the digestion mixture by centrifugation at 375 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant digestion solution by pipetting. Do not disturb the cell pellet (Figure 1C). Re-suspend the pellet in 500 μL of ice-cold 1x PBS by gently mixing up and down with the pipette.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer under a microscope.\n\tNOTE: Cell counts are approximately 1 x 106 cells per two retinas.\nEnsure the cells are properly resuspended by gentle mixing, and then aliquot 20 μL of cell suspension into three tubes for control staining (tube 1: IgG control, tube 2: CD31 control, and tube 3: CD45 control), as described and used previously17,18.\nSet a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C and place tubes containing cells inside. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 375 x g for 5 min.\n5. Immunostain the cells with antibodies\nPrepare 100 μL of staining buffer per two retinas stained plus four control tubes. Add FBS, HEPES, and D-Glucose to HBSS buffer to a final concentration of 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, and 1 mg/mL D-Glucose.\nObtain fluorescently conjugated antibodies against CD31 and CD45. Add the antibodies at a 1:100 dilution into the staining buffer (tube 1: IgG antibody only, tube 2: CD31 antibody only, and tube 3: CD45 antibody only). Add 1 μL of antibody per 100 μL of the staining buffer for a final antibody concentration of 2 μg/mL.\nCarefully remove the PBS from the washed cell pellet by pipetting.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 μL of antibody staining solution per 0.5 x 106 cells.\n\t\nIncubate the single-cell suspension with the antibody staining solution for 30 min on ice in dark. Tap the tubes every 10 min to gently mix the cells.",
    "6. Prepare for fluorescence-activated cell sorting\nSet a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C and place the tubes containing cells inside. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 375 x g for 5 min.\n\t\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend these cells in 500 μL of 1x PBS to wash.\nSet a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C and place the tubes containing cells inside. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 375 x g for 5 min\nPrepare 1.5 mL of FACS Buffer (1% FBS in 1x PBS).\n\t\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of FACS Buffer by gently mixing with a pipettor.\nAdd propidium iodide (PI) to the sample tubes containing the FACS buffer to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL. PI is used as a viability marker.\nTransfer and combine the cell suspensions into 5 mL test tubes through a cell strainer snap cap. The cell strainer snap cap should contain a 35 μm filter, and the cell suspensions can be pipetted directly onto the filter.\n\t\nKeep the FACS tubes on ice in the dark and transfer them to the cell sorter.\n7. Set up the FACS instrument\nInstall a 100 µm nozzle into a FACS instrument.\n\tNOTE: This size nozzle minimizes collection volume and maximizes isolated cell density.\nPrepare 250 μL of 1x PBS into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube as a collection tube to be installed into the FACS instrument.\n8. Isolate viable endothelial cells via FACS\nTurn on the FACS instrument and the computer. Click on the FACS software icon to open the FACS software on the computer to run and operate the FACS instrument. Perform routine quality control tests.",
    "Load the control-stained samples into the FACS instrument to adjust the axes. Start with IgG antibody only cells to generate and adjust FSC and SSC, then CD31-antibody only to generate and adjust CD31, and then CD45-antibody only to generate and adjust CD45. Record data from control samples.\nLoad stained sample cells into the FACS instrument and run the sample.\nGate the cells based on forward-scatter and side-scatter (FSC-A and SSC-A, respectively) parameters (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: The FSC-A and SSC-A parameters are used to select cells based on size, density, granularity, surface properties, and refractive index.\nGate cells by FSC-A and FSC-H to identify cell doublets and only collect single cells (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: The FSC-A and FSC-H parameters are used to select single cells based on the principle that during forward scattering, cell doublets will be droplets containing a greater area-to-height ratio.\nGate cells by PI and SSC-A to identify viable cells (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: Viable cells will be PI-negative.\nMake a CD31+/CD45- gate with controls and gate cells by CD31 and CD45 (Figure 2A,B).\n\t\nInsert a collection tube with 250 μL of FACS buffer.\nStart sorting cells that are CD31-positive/CD45-negative into the installed collection tube.\nKeep the collection tubes on ice for further analysis. Samples can be processed for next-generation sequencing applications at this step1.\n9. Perform viability assay\nMix 10 μL of cells with 10 μL of 0.4% trypan blue solution to assess cell viability.\nCount viable cells by pipetting the stained mixture onto a hemocytometer slide. Place the slide under a microscope for accurate viability counts. Count blue cells as non-viable and count clear cells as viable.\n\t\nDivide the viable cell count by the total cell count to calculate percent viability.\n10. Perform gene expression assay",
    "Obtain 10,000-20,000 cells per sample and perform RNA isolation to analyze murine retinal endothelial cell gene expression. RNA isolation is performed using a commercially available kit that uses ethanol-based RNA precipitation, and then centrifugation and membrane columns to wash and elute purified RNA from cell lysate. Samples can be processed for some next-generation sequencing applications at this step1.\nConvert the RNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase enzyme and supporting reagents19.\nQuantify using a DNA binding dye and a quantitative PCR (qPCR) machine20. Load cDNA samples in a 384-well qPCR plate with primers to amplify genes of interest. Reaction volume should total to 10 µL, including DNA binding dye, which will be used to quantify gene amplification.\n\t\nUse CD31, VE-Cadherin, CD45, and β-actin forward and reverse primers to measure gene expression.\nUse the sample for next-generation sequencing applications1.\nSubscription Required.
