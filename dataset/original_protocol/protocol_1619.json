Spleen harvesting steps\n(A) Euthanize mice according to institutional guidelines. Collect spleen using scissors and tweezers. The red arrow indicates the spleen.\n(B) Place spleen in a 6-well plate containing few milliliters of PBS1×/2%FBS and keep at RT.\n(C) Place spleen on a 70 μm cell strainer.\n(D) Dilacerate the organ with the piston of a syringe.\n(E) After centrifugation, red cell pellet indicates the presence of red blood cells.\n(F) Following RBC lysis buffer, the cell pellet is depleted from red cells.\n(G) Hemocytometer image of cells stained with trypan blue. The red arrow indicates a dead cell while the green arrow indicates a live cell. Cells were observed with a microscope (20× magnification). To calculate cell concentration we used this formula: [Number of cells in a small grid] × 9 × dilution factor × 104 = number of cells/mL.\nEuthanize mice using carbon dioxide and place them on a dissection board. Herein we used Mycdel mice (for ex vivo assay), Mycdel OT-II (for in vivo assay) mice and their Control counterparts. Sterilize the skin using 70% ethanol. Using sterile scissors, cut through the skin and the muscle layer. Visualize the spleen next to the stomach on the left side of the mouse.",
    "Note: For euthanasia with CO2, mice are placed in a hermetically sealed box, then we use an automatic CO2 euthanasia machine (TemSega) which allows a sequence of 3 phases according to a strict and secure protocol 1) ‘induction’ phase which lasts 1 min and corresponds to a progressive saturation in CO2; 2) ‘Euthanasia’ phase which lasts 2 min (100% CO2); 3) ’Emptying’ phase which lasts 2 min and corresponds to CO2 absorption.\nRemove the spleen, trimming away any non-specific tissue (like fat) and place the spleen in a six-well plate containing a 3 mL of PBS1×/2%FBS in each well.\nPerform the following steps at room temperature (RT; 20°C–25°C) under a cell culture hood.\nPut a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL conical tube.\nPlace the organ on the cell strainer, which was previously moistened with PBS1×/2%FBS, and dilacerate the spleen with the piston of a syringe. (Add PBS1×/2%FBS to facilitate the dilaceration).\nAdjust the volume to 20 mL for each tube with PBS1×/2%FBS.\nCentrifuge (450 × g, 7 min, at RT). Discard supernatant.\nNote: For all centrifugations performed in this protocol, we used shortest acceleration time/braking time. For our centrifuge (Eppendorf 5810R) this corresponds to level ACC 9/BRK 9.\nAdd 2 mL of Red Blood Cells lysis buffer on the cell pellet. Resuspend cells by pipetting and incubate 10 min at RT.\nNote: We advise to resuspend cells by gentle pipetting in order to prevent cell death, also do not exceed 10 min incubation, as it might alter cells of interest.\nAdd 10 mL of PBS1×/2%FBS and centrifuge (450 × g, 7 min, RT).\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet with 10 mL of PBS1×/2%FBS.\nTake 5 μL of cells and mix them with 45 μL of trypan blue (previously diluted at 1:1 ratio with PBS1×).",
    "Load cell mixture into a hemocytometer. Using a microscope, count viable cells which correspond to bright cells that are not stained in blue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nAlternatives: Cells can be counted with an automated cell counter.\nCentrifuge conical tubes containing 10 mL of cell suspension at 450 × g (7 min, RT).\nResuspend the pellet in PBS1×/2%FBS in order to be at 1 × 108 cells/mL.\nImmunophenotyping\nTiming: 50 min\nAfter splenic cells harvesting, T cells are characterized by flow cytometry using specific markers to determine the percentage of CD8+, CD4+, DP or OT-II+ cells.\nTransfer 106 cells into a 5 mL polystyrene tube (FACS tube).\nAdd for each sample, 5 μL of antibodies cocktail n°1 and FACS buffer up to 100 μL.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C, in the dark.\nWash cells with 2 mL of PBS1×. Centrifuge cells (650 × g, 3 min, 4°C). Discard supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of FACS Buffer.\nAcquire cells on a flow cytometer (we used a BD Canto).\nNote: Cells are not fixed so they are kept at 4°C until their acquisition which is performed as soon as possible (within 3 h maximum).\nAnalyze files using an adapted software such as FlowJo.\nNote: Antibodies cocktail is defined according to surface markers of interest.\nSplenic T cells enrichment\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the purification of T cells from a splenic suspension. We use mouse T cell Isolation kit (StemCellTM) which is designed to isolate T cells by negative selection and we follow the manufacturer’s instructions 10000003744-PIS_01.pdf (stemcell.com). Below (steps 22–30) is the procedure to process 5 × 107 cells (from Mycdel, Mycdel OT-II or Control mice).\nTransfer 5 × 107 cells into a FACS tube.\nAdd 25 μL of Normal Rat Serum.",
    "Add 25 μL of EasySepTM Mouse T cell isolation cocktail.\nIncubate 10 min at RT.\nVortex EasySepTM Streptavidin RapidSpheresTM for 30 s and transfer 37.5 μL into cell suspension.\nIncubate 2.5 min at RT.\nAdd 2 mL PBS1×/2%FBS and pipette mix (avoid vortexing).\nPut the FACS tube (without cap) on a magnet and wait 2.5 min at RT.\nTransfer cell suspension into a new 15 mL conical collection tube by inverting magnet/FACS tube in a single continuous motion.\nCritical: It’s very important to make this movement properly and without shaking to prevent beads from coming loose.\nCount cells as described in steps 11 and 12.\nTo check the quality of the purification, take an aliquot (around 50 μL of cell suspension) and stain cells with 5 μL of antibodies cocktail n°2. Then, proceed to steps 17–21 described above. An example of FACS analysis of T cells purification is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nCentrifuge cells (450 × g, 7 min, RT). Aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet at 2 × 107 cells/mL in PBS1×.\nNote: FACS analysis step is important to assess the efficiency and the quality of T cell enrichment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1181-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. T cells enrichment\nFACS plot showing the expression of CD4 and CD8. Percentages of cells in depicted gates are indicated.\n(A) Before T cells enrichment.\n(B) After T cells enrichment.\nCell trace violet staining\nTiming: 25 min\nThis step describes cell staining with a carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-based reagent in order to follow cell proliferation. Here we use CellTraceTM Violet (CTV), yet other types of CFSE-based reagents are commercially available.\nDilute CTV stock solution (5 mM) at 1:1000 with PBS1× and protect from light.\nIn a microcentrifuge tube, add 20 μL diluted CTV (5 μM) to 3 × 106 cells in 1 mL PBS1×.",
    "Mix well by gentle pipetting.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min (in the dark).\nWash cells twice with 500 μL of cold PBS1×. Spin cells (700 × g, 5 min, 4°C).\nResuspend cell pellet in complete RPMI (for ex vivo assays, step 39) or PBS1× (for in vivo assays, step 50) and store at 4°C in the dark until use.\nNote: The samples can be stored at 4°C until use, but usually cells are used within 3 h in order to prevent cell death.\nEx vivo T cell receptor stimulation\nTiming: 3 days\nIn the following section T cells are stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry 24H and 72H post-stimulation.\nResuspend cells in complete RPMI at a cell concentration of 3 × 106 cells/mL\nIn a 48-well plate, dispatch 106 cells of each sample in 2 wells:\nWell #1: ‘Not stimulated’.\nWell #2: ‘Stimulated CD3/CD28’: add 10 μL Dynabeads Mouse T-activator CD3/CD28.\nOptional: Addition of a control well. In a well #3 ‘PMA/ionomycin’: add Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL respectively.\nAlternatives: Instead of using Dynabeads for stimulation, it is possible to pre-coat the plate with anti- CD3 antibodies and then add cell suspension together with anti-CD28 antibodies.\nIncubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAt 24H, resuspend cells by gentle pipetting and take 100 μL cells in FACS tube. Add 1 mL PBS1× in each sample.\nFor stimulated cells, put the tube on a magnet to remove Dynabeads. Wait 2 min and collect the supernatant into another FACS tube.\nFor all samples, centrifuge cells (700 × g, 5 min, 4°C). Discard supernatant.",
    "Add 5 μL of antibodies cocktail n°3 and FACS Buffer up to 100 μL for each sample. Incubate for 30 min at 4°C, in the dark.\nWash cells by adding 2 mL Annexin-V binding buffer 1×. Centrifuge cells (650 × g, 3 min, 4°C) and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 100 μL of Annexin-V binding buffer 1× and add 1 μL of Annexin-V APC.\nAcquire cells on a flow cytometer and analyze data using FlowJo software.\nAt 72H, repeat steps 42–48.\nIn vivo T cell receptor stimulation\nTiming: 7 days\nHerein, we performed in vivo stimulation assays using OT-II mouse model. This model generates some CD4 T cells expressing OT-II TCR which recognizes chicken ovalbumin antigen (Barnden et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The major steps are the following: at day 0, splenic T cells (from OT-II MYC-deficient or MYC-proficient mice) are harvested and engrafted in C57BL/6 recipient mice. After two days, T cells are stimulated through injection of ovalbumin (Day 2) and few (usually ranging from 3 to 5) days later, mice are euthanized for analysis (Day 7).\nResuspend CTV-labelled cells (from step 38 above) at 10 × 106 cells/mL in PBS1× at RT and protect from light.\nSedate C57BL/6 recipient mice using isoflurane with a flow rate of 4 L/min for 3 min.\nAlternatives: Mice sedation can be performed by an intraperitoneal injection of xylazine/ketamine anesthetic.\n100 μL of cells are i.v. injected (retro orbital injection) using an insulin syringe (or 1 mL syringe with 30 gauge needle).\nAlternatives: Tail vein injection can be applied.\nPlace grafted mice under a heating lamp until they wake up, and then put them back in their cage.\nAllow mice to recover (here we set 2 days for the recovery time).\nAfter 2 days, anesthetize grafted mice as described in step 51.",
    "Perform a subcutaneous injection in the ear of 100 μg of ovalbumin in the presence of complete Freund’s adjuvant (maximum volume of injection: 100 μL) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1181-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Ovalbumin/CFA injection\n(A) Preparation of ovalbumin-CFA mixture. Two syringes containing ovalbumin and complete Freund’s adjuvant are linked together by a connector. The two solutions are mixed by pressing several times the plunger of the two syringes.\n(B) The ear of the sedated mouse is immobilized with a tape.\n(C) Subcutaneous injection to the ear. Place the needle of the syringe subcutaneously.\n(D) Inject ovalbumin-CFA mixture by pushing the plunger of the syringe. The blue arrow shows swelling due to correct injection.\nPlace injected mice under a heating lamp until they wake up.\n3–5 days post-immunization, euthanize grafted mice (as described in step 1) for analysis.\nCollect the cervical lymph nodes, trimming away any non-specific tissue (like fat) and place the lymph nodes in PBS1×/2%FBS at RT.\nPut a 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 mL conical tube.\nPlace lymph nodes on the cell strainer, which was previously moistened with PBS1×/2%FBS, and dilacerate with the piston of a syringe.\nAdjust the volume to 10 mL with PBS1×/2%FBS.\nCentrifuge cells (450 × g, 7 min, RT). Discard supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet with 5 mL of PBS1×/2%FBS.\nCount cells as described in steps 11 and 12.\nTransfer 106 cells into a FACS tube.\nAdd 5 μL of antibodies cocktail n°4 and FACS Buffer up to 100 μL for each sample. Incubate for 30 min at 4°C, in the dark.\nAdd 2 mL PBS1× and centrifuge (650 × g, 3 min, 4°C). Discard supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 100 μL of FACS buffer.\nAcquire cells on a flow cytometer and analyze files using FlowJo software.",
    "Alternatives: Our mouse models bred on C57BL/6 background harbor ROSA26-LSL-eYFP tracking system, thus we can easily distinguish cells of interest from host wild type C57BL/6 cells. As an alternative to ROSA26-LSL-eYFP, two distinct strains of C57BL/6 mice can be used to differentiate host cells from injected cells: typically CD45.1 or CD45.2 C57BL/6 mice strains."
