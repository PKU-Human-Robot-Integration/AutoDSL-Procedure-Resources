    "The Institutional Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the China Medical University approved all procedures.\n1. Animal Preparation and Monitoring\nLeave all magnetically susceptible objects such as wallets, keys, credit card, etc. outside the scanner room prior to commencing animal preparation for MRI scanning.\nInitially anesthetize the rat (2-month-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat, 280–350 g) in an induction box using a mixture of 5% isoflurane (ISO) and oxygen (2 L/min) for 3–5 min, as necessary.\nWhen the animal is recumbent and exhibits no response to a tail or toe pinch, discontinue ISO administration and transfer the animal to the scanning room.\nPlace the rat in the MRI bed in a head-first prone position, and deliver 2-3% ISO through a nose cone device for maintaining anesthesia.\nMonitor respiration by placing a respiratory pillow sensor under the animal's torso.\nConnect the sensor to a respiratory system and check for respiration rate between 40-50 beats per minute (bpm).\nFor cine-gated PC-MRI acquisition, place one electrode each on the right forepaw and the left hind paw, respectively (Figure 1a).\nTwist the electrocardiography (ECG) cables together.\nUse a head holder with ear bars and a bite bar to secure the animal to restrict head movement.\nUse a warm air heating system or gauze pads to maintain body temperature while in the magnet.\nEnsure that the R-wave is clear on the ECG monitor (Figure 1b), and place the animal in the scanner. There is no need to place the surface coil on the top of the animal's neck as images are acquired by the volume coil.\n2. MRI Acquisition\nUse 2–3% ISO to maintain anesthesia during the entire imaging procedure. Continuously monitor physiological responses and keep as constant as possible.",
    "Start the MRI scans once the animal is placed inside the scanner and continues to be physiologically stable. In this study, use a 7 T small animal MRI system with a gradient strength of 630 mT/m, but other field strengths of small animal MRI systems can be used.\nSelect the \"Localizer\" sequence from the console monitor of the MRI scanner and acquire scout images along all three orientations using any fast image acquisition sequence, e.g., the fast spin echo, to create coronal, axial, and sagittal images. The purpose of these scout images is to determine the imaging planes.\nEnsure that the center of the animal's head and neck is at the center of the magnet. If necessary, adjust the animal's position until the correct position is reached. If the animal is repositioned, repeat scanning to obtain scout images.\nSelect the \"Time-of-flight (TOF) angiogram\" sequence from the console monitor of the MRI scanner and acquire a 2D TOF angiogram first to ascertain the precise anatomical location of the CCA. Use the following scanning parameters: repetition time (TR)/ echo time (TE)=22/4.87 ms, flip angle = 90°, field of view (FOV) = 40 × 40 mm2, matrix size = 256 × 256, slice thickness 0.6 mm, with the number of excitation (NEX) = 1.\n\tNOTE: The name of the TOF sequence could be vender-specific. The user can insert these parameters in the console monitor.\nEnsure that the saturation band is \"on\" and is placed on the top to avoid interference from venous signals.\n\tNOTE: For the saturation band, it usually comes with the TOF sequence. If the saturation band does not show on the monitor, please notify the service person.",
    "After locating the CCA using the TOF angiogram, target the image plane of the PC-MRI to the center of the CCA and orient such that the slice is perpendicular to the direction of blood flow (Figure 2a).\nEnsure that both respiration and ECG gating are connected to the MRI system, showing the clear signal on the monitor computer (Figure 1b), and set the trigger module to be \"on\" in the \"Trigger Mode\" from the console monitor of the MRI scanner.\nConfirm that the animal's physiological responses are stable before initiating the PC-MRI scan from the monitoring computer (Figure 1b). Verify that gating selections are \"on\" in both the monitor computer and the console monitor of MRI scanner.\n\tNote: The physiology monitoring system used in this study is provided by the vender. For most animal scanners, the similar physiology monitoring systems are provided and vender-specific.\nSelect the sequence of PC-MRI sequence from the console monitor of the MRI scanner and perform gated PC-MRI scans using the following parameters: TR/TE=15.55/4.51 ms (minimum TR and TE), flip angle=30°, FOV = 40 × 40 mm2, matrix size = 192 × 192, slice thickness = 2 mm, velocity encoding (VENC) = 120 cm/s, with NEX=8. Unidirectional VENC is acquired in the through-plane direction.\n\tNote: The scan time is approximately 8.5 min, but the actual scan time may be slightly different among animals due to the variation in cardiac cycles.\nRepeat steps 2.6–2.9 of image acquisition if the region of interest (ROI) is to be changed to another location in the CCA, such as at the bifurcation 4.\nRemove the animal from the scanner and return it to its recovery cage when the scan is complete.",
    "Warm the animal with a heating lamp to maintain body temperature. Keep the lamp at least 15 cm away from the animal to prevent overheating.\nWhen the animal starts to move and exhibits a response to a tail or toe pinch, turn off the heating lamp.\n3. Data Processing\nSave MRI data in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format or any other vender-specific format. Generate cine series with two types of images: a magnitude image (anatomy image) and a phase image (Figure 2b).\n\tNOTE: In some scanners, the third type of image, which could be the magnitude image × phase image or the complex-difference (the complex subtraction between the two acquisitions with different velocity-encoding gradients), is generated. The third image is vendor-dependent.\nPre-process the image data. Covert the phase image into the velocity map and correct the phase-offset error 5.\n\tNOTE: The phase image has an arbitrary MR unit of signal intensity instead of true velocity values, but the MR signal intensity is linearly proportional to velocity. The maximum MRI signal from the phase image is typically assigned as the value of VENC, and the minimum signal is assigned the opposite value of VENC. See supplemental code file 1 for an example of the Matlab script and press the button of \"Run\".\nDelineate the ROI carefully by tracing the boundary of the CCA. As the artery may dilate and construct during the various cardiac phases, delineate ROIs for each time frame. Calculate the blood flow by integrating over the artery ROI, i.e., velocity × area. The resulted blood flow of each artery was in the units of mL/s. See supplemental code file 2 for an example of the Matlab script and press the button of \"Run\".\nSubscription Required.
