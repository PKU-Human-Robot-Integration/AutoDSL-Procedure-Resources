  "procedures": [
    "1. Purpose\nTo demonstrate a capsulorhexis radial tear out rescue technique using a cystotome on a virtual reality cataract surgery simulator and in a human eye.\n2. Method\nWhen a capsulorhexis begins to veer radially towards the periphery beyond the pupillary margin the following steps should be applied without delay.\nStop further capsulorhexis manoeuvre and reassess the situation.\nFill the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD). We recommend mounting the cystotome to a syringe containing OVD so that the anterior chamber can be reinflated rapidly.\nThe capsulorhexis flap is then left unfolded on the lens surface.\nThe cystotome tip is tilted horizontally to avoid cutting or puncturing the flap and is engaged on the flap near the leading edge of the tear but not too close to the point of tear.\nGently push or pull the leading edge of tear opposite to the direction of tear.\nThe leading tearing edge will start to do a 'U-Turn'. Maintain the tension on the flap until the tearing edge returns to the desired trajectory.\n3. Results\nUsing our technique, a surgeon can respond instantly to radial tear out without having to change surgical instruments. Changing surgical instruments at this critical stage runs a risk of further radial tear due to sudden shallowing of anterior chamber as a result of forward pressure from the vitreous. Our technique also has the advantage of reducing corneal wound distortion and subsequent anterior chamber collapse.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
