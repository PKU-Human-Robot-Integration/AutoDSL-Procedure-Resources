    "Sample lysis and λ Phosphatase treatment  For all samples   For each sample analysed (sample A), a negative control (sample B) treated with λ Phosphatase will be assayed concurrently. Prepare two tubes with ice-cold λ Phosphatase Lysis Buffer, freshly prepared, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (A) or only protease inhibitors (B).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150321/20150321010703_2942.jpg Figure 1. The flowchart of sample lysis and λ Phosphatase treatment    For cell lines   Wash cells from a 10 cm dish (80% confluence) with 10 ml ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice.   Scrape cells with 1 ml ice-cold PBS, collect in two 1.5 ml microfuge tubes A and B (500 μl each) and spin for 3 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C. Discard supernatant.   Add 18 μl ice-cold λ phosphatase lysis buffer containing only protease inhibitors to the pellet B and next 2 μl of λ Protein Phosphatase (40 units/ μl final concentration). Incubate at 30 °C for 30 min in a dry block.   Add 180 μl ice-cold λ Phosphatase Lysis Buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors to the pellet A. Resuspend the pellet by pipetting and after 10 min on ice, spin for 10 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml tube (sample lysate A).   Add 160 μl cold λ phosphatase lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors to the pellet B. Resuspend the pellet and after 10 min on ice, spin for 10 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml tube (sample lysate B).   Analyse protein content of the supernatant obtained from steps 4-5 by Lowry method.    For tumor samples   Take two fragments of the same tumor of approximately 0.1 g each.",
    "Leave each fragment of tumor on a 35 mm dish on ice in the presence of 0.4 ml of cold λ phosphatase lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (dish sample A) or only protease inhibitors (dish sample B), but not DTT and MnCl2 in any case (will be added in step 5). Mince the tumors in the smallest possible pieces with a scalpel and scissors and collect all volume, containing minced tissue and lysis buffer, in 1.5 ml microfuge tubes.  Note: If the sample is a frozen tumor, mincing of the tumor in the presence of the buffer has to be done while the tumor is thawing.    Homogenize the samples with a tissue grinder on ice until no clumps remain in the suspension.    Spin the tubes at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min to discard unlysed tissue and collect supernatants in new tubes. The volume of samples obtained is about 300 μl.   If the tumors are mice xenografts, it is convenient to clarify the samples with Dynabeads protein G in order to eliminate putative mouse Igs that might be infiltrating the tumor thus interfering with phospho-KRAS detection:   Transfer 30 μl of Dynabeads (previously vortexed) to a tube.   Separate the Dynabeads from the solution with Magnet DynaMagTM, discard the supernatant, remove the tube from the magnet and wash dynabeads with λ phosphatase lysis buffer (1 ml, inhibitors free).   Separate the Dynabeads from the buffer with a magnet, discard the buffer, and remove the tube from the magnet.   Incubate the Dynabeads with the samples for 20 min in a tube rotator to allow gentle mixing at 4 °C. The volume of samples is about 300 μl (volume of supernatant obtained in step 3).",
    "Separate the Dynabeads from the samples with the magnet and transfer the clarified samples A and B to a new tube. Measure the volume of clarified samples.     Add 5 mM DTT (from stock 1 M DTT) and 2 mM MnCl2 (from stock 25 mM MnCl2) to clarified samples A and B. Mix gently.   Take 40 μl of sample B to a new tube, add 4 μl of λ Protein phosphatase and incubate at 30 °C for 30 min. The rest of sample B is discarded.   Add phosphatase inhibitors to sample B: 0.2 μl of 1 M sodium fluoride and 0.4 μl of 20 mM sodium orthovanadate (or 0.04 μl of 200 mM sodium orthovanadate) should be added to the 40 μl of sample B to achieve the 5 mM sodium fluoride and 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate final concentrations that are stated in the Materials section.    Analyse protein content of sample A from step 5 and sample B from step A6 by the Lowry method.      Sample preparation and Phos-tag SDS and transfer   Transfer 20 μg of each sample in 10 μl of final volume with λ phosphatase lysis buffer and add 5 μl of sample buffer 3x. Boil the samples for 1 min in a 1.5 ml tube.   Load the samples into a 12% SDS-PAGE mini gel supplementing the resolving gel with 100 μM Phos-tag and 100 μM MnCl2.   Run the gel 12 h to 15 h at 5 mA/gel at 4 °C.   Soak the gel twice with general transfer buffer containing 1 mM EDTA for 20 min and once with EDTA-free general transfer buffer for 10 min.   Transfer proteins from the gel onto PVDF for 3 h at 70 V.   Perform Western blot with the appropriate antibodies: anti- K-RAS antibodies or any antibody against a putative tag-KRAS expressed."
