    "Note: The whole experiment should be in aseptic conditions including all materials and reagents. All operations should be sterile. Allow the growth factor-reduced matrigel melt overnight from -20 °C to 4 °C in a refrigerator.Put 24 well plates and pipette tips in -20 °C chilled overnight.Use electronic scale to weigh rat.Use 5 ml disposable sterilized syringe to inject 4% chloral hydrate to rat’s abdomen, 1 ml chloral hydrate per 100 g to anesthesia rat then sacrifice the animal through cervical dislocation, place the rat on the animal operation asepsis.Spray 70% ethanol to rat’s skin and bundle the rat.Use scissors to open the chest and remove other organs to expose the Thoracic aorta (Figures 1 and 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160701/20160701002241_2528.jpgFigure 1.

Open the chest and remove other organs to expose the thoracic aorta Use tweezers and scissors to separate the spine and aorta (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160701/20160701002507_7370.pngFigure 3. Use tweezers and scissors to separate spine and aorta Cut the aorta from diaphragm to the end of the heart, then put it in 10 cm dish and wash the aorta with sterile PBS at room temperature (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160701/20160701002657_1400.pngFigure 4. Cut aorta from diaphragm to the end of the heart Carefully clean the surrounding tissue around theaorta (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171017/20171017233316_1870.jpgFigure 5. Clean the surrounding tissue around the aorta Use scalpel to cut the aorta into sections as 1 mm long rings measured by a ruler (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171017/20171017233350_9063.jpgFigure 6. Use scalpel to cut aorta into sections as 1 mm long rings measured by a ruler Keep the growth factor-reduced matrigel on ice. Then add 150 µl matrigel into each well in 24 well plates in biosafety cabinet. Three complex wells for each group.Notes: The matrigel should be careful and quick. It’s easy to become solidified at room temperature.",
    "Keep the matrigel on ice before adding it to the well, but the plate does not need to be put on ice, the plate should be chilled before the matrigel is added. After adding the matrigel gently shake the plate to be sure the whole surface is covered by matrigel. If there are some bubbles in the well use 2 ml sterilized syringe to break them. Gently shake the plate then leave it in an ordinary humidiﬁed incubator for 30 min (37 °C).Put the 1 mm aorta ring in the middle of each well.Then incubate for about 10 min in the ordinary humidiﬁed incubator (37 °C).Add another 150 µl matrigel into the well to cover the ring.Then incubate for 30 min again in the ordinary humidiﬁed incubator (37 °C).As the aorta ring is embedded in the matrigel then add 200 µl the Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle’s Medium with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum per well, finally put 24 well plates in the incubator (37 °C) (Figure 7)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160701/20160701003857_3465.pngFigure 7. The aorta ring in the matrigel covered by medium in the 24 well platesRefresh the medium every 2 d. After 7 d, the branch of vascular is observed under microscope (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160701/20160701004034_0198.pngFigure 8. After 7 days, the branch of vascular is observed by microscope. Scale bar, 100 µm.Use Image-Pro Plus 6.0 to detect the sprouting length and range.Total vessel outgrowth is summed for each ring using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. The total length of all branches of each ring is calculated so that we can compare them within groups."
