    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRetroviral particles production and concentration\nTiming: 4 days\nPackage and concentrate retrovirus from HEK293T cells\nLate afternoon, seed 6.0 × 106 HEK293T (293T) cells per 150-mm dish containing 10% FBS in 20 mL high glucose and sodium pyruvate DMEM medium (293T medium). Gently mix the cells and culture medium before returning dish into incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). Keep culturing for 16–20 h.\nPEI transfection (Early in the morning)\n293T cells should be 60%–70% confluent and well attached. To increase the transfection efficiency, add 5 mL fresh and warm 293T culture medium containing 25 μL 25 mM chloroquine (1000 × stock, final concentration is 1 mM) per dish at 1 h before starting the transfection. Gently rock the dishes from side to side and return them to incubator.\nTake out the transfection plasmids and PEI aliquot from freezer. Per 150-mm dish, prepare transfection mixture A (25 μg retroviral plasmid and 20 μg pCL-Eco helper plasmid in 1 mL Opti-MEM) and mixture B (add 135 μL 1 mg/mL PEI into 1 mL Opti-MEM). Transfer the mixture B to A, vortex gently for a short period of time, and incubate the transfection mixture for 20 min at 20°C–25°C without disturbance.\nNote: Check plasmids integrity and isoforms by running agarose gel prior to starting transfection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The supercoiled plasmid has a higher transfection efficiency than other isoforms.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/571-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative plasmid DNA isoforms\nAgarose gel electrophoregrams for 3 batches (lane 1–3) of plasmids with identical construction. Supercoiled, linearized, and nicked isoforms are labeled in left.\nAdd 2 mL plasmids/PEI mixture to each 150-mm dish in a dropwise manner. Rock the dish gently from side to side before returning it to incubator.",
    "Twelve hours after transfection, carefully aspirate the old medium, pipet 20 mL fresh 293T medium slowly against the side wall of 150-mm dish and return plates to incubator.\nCritical: The transfection medium should be replaced with fresh 293T medium 12–14 h post transfection because of the toxicity of PEI and chloroquine.\nNote: PEI has a high transfection efficiency in 293T cells. More importantly, it costs much less than the transfection reagent that we used previously (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCollect and concentrate viral particles\nTwenty-four hours after changing medium (36 h post transfection), collect supernatant from each 150 mm dish into 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cells and debris. Carefully transfer the supernatant into a new 50 mL tube.\nAdd 1 volume of Retro-X Concentrator for 3 volumes of supernatant. Gently mix by inverting the tubes every 10–20 min during the first hour of incubation at 4°C.\nIncubate mixture for 10–16 h at 4°C refrigerator.\nCentrifuge the samples at 1,500 × g for 45 min at 4°C. The white pellet at the bottom of 50 mL tube will be visible. Discard as much as possible of the supernatant.\nAdd 1/10 to 1/50 of the original volume of RPMI medium supplied with 2% heat inactivated FBS. Gently shake the tube on ice until the pellet completely goes into suspension.\nNote: To avoid damaging virus, do not vortex white pellet. Because the viral pellet is difficult to resuspend if adding too little medium, we recommend resuspending the pellet with more than 1/50 of the original volume medium.\nTitrate the concentrated virus immediately or freeze the aliquots at −80°C.\nTitration of retrovirus\nTiming: 4 days",
    "Plate 50,000 healthy NIH 3T3 cells in 500 μL of complete DMEM (DMEM+10% FBS) per well of a 24 well plate. To ensure that each well has same number of cells as much as possible, we resuspend 1.3 × 106 cells in 13 mL complete DMEM and then aliquot 500 μL into each well. Return the plate into incubator and keep culturing for 16–20 h.\nTrypsinize 3 wells from the plate and count cell number individually. Record average number as (#) cell plated.\nAspirate old medium from each well and add 450 μL complete DMEM containing 8 μg/mL polybrene (for boosting infection efficiency).\nThaw a vial of frozen retrovirus (or fresh viral supernatant) in 37°C water bath and prepare a series of 10 fold dilution of the tested virus as follow:\n100 μL non-diluted viral supernatant.\n10−1: 18 μL of non-diluted viral supernatant + 172 μL complete DMEM.\n10−2: 18 μL of 10−1dilution + 172 μL complete DMEM.\n10−3: 18 μL of 10−2 dilution + 172 μL complete DMEM.\n10−4: 18 μL of 10−3 dilution + 172 μL complete DMEM.\nDistribute 50 μL /well of each virus supernatant dilution in triplicate. Leave 3 wells as a non-viral infection control (add 50 μL/well complete DMEM).\nNote: Be sure to keep virus and cells warm, as a cold shock will decrease infection efficiency.\nGently pipet up and down 3 times using a 1 mL pipette. Return the plate into incubator.\nTwenty-four hours after infection, replace medium containing the viral supernatant with 500 μL fresh complete DMEM.\nForty-eight hours after infection, trypsinize and resuspend the 3T3 cells from each well in FACS buffer individually. Analyze the percentage (%) of GFP+ cells using Flow Cytometer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). For a well with 1%–10% of GFP+ cells, calculate virus titer as follow:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/571-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. FACS plots showing 3T3 cells transduced with retroviral supernatants\n3T3 cell was infected with 2 μL, 8 μL, and 50 μL of 10−2 diluted viral supernatants (unconcentrated and 10-fold concentrated) individually. The percentage of positive transduced cells (GFP+) was measured by flow cytometry at 48 h after infection.\nVirus infectious units per mL (IFU/mL) = (%) GFP+ × (#) cell plated (right before infection) × dilution factor/ 0.05 mL. The average value of triplicate wells represents the viral titer.\nNote: The method provided above is suitable for fluorescent labeled and non-transmission (replication defective) virus. For the non-fluorescent retrovirus, please switch to other retroviral titration methods or commercial kit such as Retro-X qRT-PCR Titration Kit (Takara, Cat#: 631453).\nIsolation of murine HSPCs\nTiming: 4 days\nIn order to enrich hematopoietic and progenitor stem cells (HSPCs), we intravenously inject (iv) 300 μL 10 mg/mL 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for a 20 g adult mouse (150 mg/kg) at 4 days prior to viral infection (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nEuthanatize the mice through cervical dislocation at 4 days after administration of 5-FU. Rinse shortly with 70% ethanol, and then place the mouse on paper towel and then transfer it into a biosafety cabinet.\nCut the hind and front limbs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) into a 100-mm dish containing 10 mL PBS. Disconnect the joint and remove the muscles as much as possible. Place the bones in a new 100-mm dish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/571-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell isolation from mouse bone marrow\nCutting sites were marked by red arrows (A). After disconnecting joints and removing meat, clean bones (B) were transferred into a new dish.\nFlush out bone marrow into a new 50 mL tube with bone marrow flushing buffer using a 10–20 mL syringe and 25G 1 1/2 inch needle.",
    "To dissociate the clumps of cells, pipet up and down twice by the same syringe and needle. Spin down the cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant.\nTo lyse the red blood cells, add 5 mL ACK lysis buffer and resuspend the cell pellet into a new 15 mL tube. Keep the tube on ice until the lysis becomes clear.\nAdd 8 mL more flushing buffer into the tube to stop the lysis. Inverse the tube 3–5 times and then centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the bone marrow with 10 mL flushing buffer. To remove tissue and cell cluster, pass the suspension through a 40 μm strainer.\nEnrich c-Kit+ HSPCs using CD117 magnetic beads and LS column following manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd117-microbead-kit-human.html[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd117-microbead-kit-human.html]) (optional).\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL RPMI 1640 medium (containing 20% FBS, 20 ng/mL SCF, 20 ng/mL Flt-3, 10 ng/mL IL3 and 10 ng/mL IL6) per mouse to resuspend HSPCs cells into one well in 6 well plate. Count the cell number.\nNote: Typically, 5–10 × 106 HSPCs, if there are no further enrichments, could be obtained from a mouse at 4 days after 5-FU injection. To obtain enough cells for viral infection and subsequent transplantation, pool cells isolated from 2–3 mice in one well.\nIncubate the cells for 20–24 h in 37°C incubator supplied with 5% CO2.\nOptional: A commercial HSPCs culture medium (StemSpan) is an option for growing HSPCs.\nRetroviral infection of HSPCs\nTiming: 1 day\nThaw one vial (200 μL aliquot) of frozen retrovirus and frozen polybrene in 37°C water bath.",
    "Add 200 μL of viral suspension and polybrene (final concentration is 8 μg/mL) in one well of 6-well plate containing 2 mL cell suspension. Pipet up and down 3 times to briefly mix. Return the plate into incubator.\nAfter a 30 min incubation, initiate spinoculation by centrifuging the plate at 500 × g for 90 min at 32°C.\nCarefully return the plate into incubator and keep culturing for 2–4 h.\nRepeat spinoculation once by adding 200 μL more concentrated retrovirus in same well as descried above. Return the plate into incubator.\nAfter 1–2 h incubation, collect cells in a 15 mL tube and count cell number.\nAliquot approximately 10,000 cells in same medium and keep culture for 24 h. Next day, check transduction efficiency by FACS if the virus expresses fluorescence (e.g., GFP). For non-fluorescence expressing virus, estimate cell viability by antibiotics resistance gene screening (such as hygromycin or puromycin selection). Calculate cell viability as follow:\n% cell viability = cell (#) after incubation with antibiotics for 24 h / cell plated (#) (here 10,000) ×100%\nWash the cells that used for transplantation to remove virus and polybrene with RPMI medium supplied with 2% heat inactivated FBS.\nPlace the tube on ice until injection into murine recipients.\nNote: For each retroviral infection of HSPCs, we recommend performing preliminary experiment to estimate the transduction efficiency or measure the functional effect through colony formation assay at 24 h after infection. Since pluripotency of HSPCs decreases with prolonged culture time, the cells should be transplanted into recipient mouse as early as possible (24–48 h post infection).\nBone marrow transplantation\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Depending on the purpose of experiment, irradiate the recipient mice lethally (1100 Rads, 3 h apart) or sub-lethally (450 Rads once) from an X or gamma irradiator. Note that lethal irradiation leads to complete myeloablation which generally follows reconstitution of the whole hematopoietic system by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\nReturn irradiated mice into cages with fresh food and drinking water supplied with 0.2 mg/mL Baytril.\nResuspend cells with 10 mL cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% heat inactive FBS and filter the suspension through 40 μm Strainers. Centrifuge at 400 × g, 4°C for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant by vacuum.\nPipet up and down of cells with a proper volume of cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% heat inactive FBS.\nCount and adjust cell number into a concentration of 0.2–1 × 106 cells/0.2 mL.\nNote: Cell number that used for transplantation is dependent on the cell transduction efficiency and the purpose of experiment. Thus, we recommend performing a preliminary experiment to check transduction efficiency in similar condition (e.g., same batch of virus). The transduced cell number for each mouse could be calculated as: Transduced cell (#) = transplanted cell (#) × (%) transduction. For recipient mice with lethal irradiation, co-transplant with 0.2–0.5 × 105 healthy bone marrow cells as helper.\nInject 0.2 mL cell suspension into each irradiated recipient mouse via tail vein using a 1.0 mL syringe and 27G 1/2 inch needle.\nChange cages with fresh food and drinking water (containing 0.2 mg/mL Baytril) one week post transplantation.\nNote: Recipient mice are immunocompromised for the first two weeks post BMT, and therefore they should be housed under strict barrier conditions. The Baytril added in the drinking water can protect mice from bacterial infection.",
    "Optional: After irradiation, the recipient mice could also be maintained on acidic (adjust to pH 3.0 by hydrochloric acid) drinking water for 2 weeks.\nExpected outcomes\nIn this protocol, to produce high titer retrovirus with less cost, we use PEI as a mediator to deliver retroviral packaging plasmids (MSCV-IRES-GFP and pCL-Eco) into HEK293T cells, which produced comparable retroviral particles (up to 3 × 107/mL) after 20 fold concentration.\nWe usually obtain 40–60 × 106 mononuclear bone marrow cells from each 8–12 weeks old mouse by following the protocol as mentioned above and else (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Yang and Jiang, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). 5-FU is a nucleotide analogue that is incorporated into DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Thus, it induces cell death of cycling cells and enriches HSPCs that have slow cell division in vivo. To enrich HSPCs, Intraperitoneal injection (IP) of 5-FU is mentioned in other publications (Zhu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Chen et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). However, we found that intravenous (iv) injection is more powerful and reliable for enrichment of HSPCs. For each mouse, around 5–10 × 106 mononuclear BM cells could be isolated at 4 days after iv injection of 5-FU. Those cells could be directly transduced with retrovirus or be further enriched by surface marker based enrichments such as c-Kit conjugated beads or flow mediated selection.",
    "Herein, four days after administration of 5-FU, we further enriched c-Kit positive BM cells using a commercial CD117 magnetic beads and pooled cells isolated from 3 mice in one. After transduction with retrovirus expressing GFP, 0.4 × 106 total cells (CD45.2+) together with 0.2 × 106 competitor BM cells (CD45.1+) were transplanted into each lethal irradiated recipient. Percentages of GFP+ cells in bone marrow and splenocytes were estimated by flow cytometry at 5 weeks post-transplantation. Results were analyzed by FlowJo software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). More than half of CD45.2+ BM cells, 25% B220+; CD45.2+ spleen cells were GFP+, suggesting a significant number of HSPCs were transduced.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/571-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Donor contribution of retroviral transduced cells (GFP+) in total bone marrow cells and splenocytes\nWild type bone marrow cells were isolated and transduced with retrovirus expressing GFP. Donor contribution of (GFP+) in total BM cells (A) and B220+ spleen cells (B) were estimated by flow cytometry at 5 weeks post transplantation."
