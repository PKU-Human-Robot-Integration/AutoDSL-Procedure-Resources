    "The study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital in China. All the studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association, and written consent was obtained from all patients.\n1. Preparations for the surgery\nEvaluate patients through a detailed history assessment and a physical examination, comprising of pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, scrotal size measurement, and assessment of the severity of the scar (Figure 1A).\nEnsure that the preoperative anesthesia risk assessment of the patient has been performed by an anesthesiologist.\nAsk the patient to shower and wash the skin of the surgical region daily.\nOn the day of the operation, administer intravenously antibiotics containing cefuroxime sodium (1.5 g) in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, 30 min preoperatively.\nAfter general anesthesia, place the patient in the lithotomic position for optimal exposure of the surgical area.\nFor adequate disinfection, continuously disinfect the skin of the surgical area with an iodophor and coverwith surgical drapes.\n2. Performing the operation\nRemove the scar tissue and skin around the penis until it is released (Figure 1B). Perform coagulation of bleeding vessels with monopolar electrocoagulation.\nPlace a catheter through the urethra for urine drainage and urethral protection intraoperatively.\nMeasure the size of the penile skin defect when the penis is completely stretched (Figure 1C). The flaccid stretched penile status is regarded as approximate to the length of the erect penis15.\nDesign the bilateral scrotal skin flap according to the length and circumference of the foreskin defect. Make an incision longitudinally along the midscrotal line with a length just half of the circumference of the penis.",
    "Subsequently, divide the scrotal skin into two parts (Figure 1D). Make a transverse incision across the scrotum to form two long flaps on either side of the midscrotal line with a length equal to that of the stretched penis (Figure 1E).\nHarvest the flaps along the tunica vaginalis by blunt dissection, and carefully preserve as much of the superficial dartos of the flap as possible.\nRotate each flap approximately 90°, with the base of the flap as the center to cover the corpus cavernosum (Figure 1F). Ensure that the base of the flaps is wider, and the flap is trapezoidal.\nClose the wound using drainage at the bottom of the scrotum. Fix the drainage at the scrotal skin using a silk 2-0 suture.\nLayer the subcutaneous tissue and scrotal skin off with 3-0 absorbable polyglactin sutures (Figure 1G,H). Fix the penis upward with an elastic bandage at an angle of approximately 45° horizontally.\n3. Postoperative care\nPostoperatively, administer an intravenous antibiotic containing 1.5 g of cefuroxime sodium in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution every 12 h for 3 days.\nRemove the drainage tube and change the dressing on postoperative day (POD) 3. After two dressing changes on POD 3 and 5, discharge the patient on POD 5.\nAsk the patients to perform postoperative disinfection with iodophor by themselves every 2 days to prevent postoperative infection of the incision.\n4. Follow-up study\nAsk the patients to attend follow-up examinations on POD 7, 14, and 30. During the follow-ups, assess postoperative outcomes, including postoperative IIEF-5 score and any complications that might have developed.\nSubscription Required.
