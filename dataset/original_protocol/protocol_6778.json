    "Lentiviral vectors assembly and titrationAssembly Prepare plasmid stocks following standard molecular biology procedures (https://www.jove.com/v/5062/plasmid-purification[href=https://www.jove.com/v/5062/plasmid-purification]) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer of the NucleoSpin plasmid mini kit (Macherey-Nagel).Manually seed 6,000,000 HEK 293T cells in 100/20 mm cell culture dishes with 8 ml of DMEM 10% FBS (Recipe 1) and incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to reach 70-80% confluency. For a detailed procedure of seeding cells please refer to the bio-protocol paper by Freppel et al., 2018 (reference 3).Using a pipette, replace the medium by removing and discarding all the DMEM 10% FBS in the dishes (~8 ml) and adding 4 ml of fresh DMEM 2% FBS (Recipe 1).Prepare the transfection mix as follows:Suspension A: 45 µl PEI 1 mg/ml (Recipe 2) + 955 µl unsupplemented DMEM (without FBS and antibiotic-antimycotic).Suspension B: 6 µg pLenti-FlaviA-GFP-puro or pLenti-CMV-FlaviA-mNeptune-puro + 6 µg pMD2.G + 6 µg psPAX2 and bring to 1,000 µl with unsupplemented DMEM.Mix suspensions A with B and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Add the 2 ml transfection mix to the cells (dropwise) and incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Replace the medium with 6 ml of fresh DMEM 2% FBS and incubate for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Harvest culture supernatants and filter them (0.45-μm pore size) to eliminate cells and debris. Use filters with low protein adherence, like cellulose acetate or polyethersulfone (PES). Do not use nitrocellulose filters as they could bind the lentiviral particles.Prepare 500 µl aliquots and store at -80 °C.Titration As described above, seed 50,000 BHK-21 cells per well in a 48-well cell culture plate with 500 µl/well of MEM 2% FBS (Recipe 4) and incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Prepare extra wells to be used as control cells.",
    "Thaw in a water bath (37 °C) one of the lentiviral 500 µl stock aliquots and add polybrene (Recipe 3) at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml.Prepare 10-fold serial dilutions (10-1-10-6) of the lentiviral stock in 1.5 ml reaction tubes. Start mixing 50 µl of the lentiviral particles in 450 µl of DMEM 2% FBS + 5 µg/ml polybrene (10-1). Vortex the tube for 5 s and mix 50 µl of the 10-1 lentiviral dilution in 450 µl of DMEM 2% FBS + 5 µg/ml polybrene (10-2). Repeat this procedure for the other dilutions (10-3-10-6) and incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Change the tip between dilutions to avoid cross-contamination. For a detailed and graphical explanation of 10-fold serial dilutions preparation please refer to the bio-protocol paper by Freppel et al., 2018 (reference 3).Replace the medium of the cells with 150 µl/well of undiluted lentiviral stock and each serial dilution thereof. Add 150 µl/well of DMEM 2% FBS + 5 µg/ml polybrene to the control cells. To avoid cross contamination, make the inoculation of the samples in order, starting with the control, following with the serial dilutions (from higher to lower dilution), and ending with the undiluted lentiviral stock.Centrifuge at 300 × g for 2 h at 25 °C for viral adsorption.Replace the inoculum with 500 µl/well of DMEM 2% FBS and incubate for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Discard the medium, wash the cells once with 100 µl/well of PBS, add 100 µl/well of TrypLETM express (no phenol red), incubate for 5 min at 37 °C, and resuspend the cells with 400 µl/well of PBS 1% FBS (Recipe 5).",
    "Based on the basal background of the reporter proteins and by comparison with the non-transduced control cells (Figure 1), determine by flow cytometry the percentage of GFP+ (488 nm laser - 530/30 nm filter) or mNeptune+ (640 nm laser -675/25 nm filter) cells present in the samples infected with different dilutions of the lentiviral seed. For a detailed procedure about flow cytometry of fluorescent proteins please refer to the protocol by Hawley et al., 2004 (reference 5).Using the data of the higher dilution with detectable transduced cells, calculate the biological titer in transducing units per milliliter (TU/ml), applying the following formula:TU/ml = (P × N / 100 × V) × 1/DFwhere P = % GFP+ or mNeptune+ cells, N = number of cells at transduction = 50,000, V = volume of inoculum per well = 0.15 ml, and DF = dilution factor = 1 (undiluted), 10–1 (diluted 1/10), 10–2 (diluted 1/100), and so on (Tiscornia et al., 2006).Reporter cell lines production and selectionProduction As described above, seed 100,000 BHK-21 cells per well in a 12-well cell culture plate with 1 ml/well of MEM 2% FBS and incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Prepare an extra well for the control cells.Thaw in a water bath (37 °C) one of the 500 µl stock aliquots of lentiviral particles carrying genetic constructs codifying for either the FlaviA-GFP or the FlaviA-mNeptune reporters and add polybrene at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml.Based on the previously calculated biological titer in TU/ml, prepare 500 µl/well of lentiviral inoculum at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 (1 TU per cell). As 100,000 cells per well were plated in manteinance medium (MEM 2% FBS), 100,000 TU must be diluted in MEM 2% FBS + 5 µg/ml polybrene to a final volume of 500 μl.",
    "Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Replace the medium of the cells with the 500 µl/well of lentiviral inoculum. Add 500 µl/well of MEM 2% FBS + 5 µg/ml polybrene to the control cells.Centrifuge at 300 × g for 2 h at 25 °C for viral adsorption.Replace the inoculum with 1 ml/well of MEM 2% FBS and incubate for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Based on the basal background of the reporter proteins, monitor the effectiveness of the transduction by fluorescence microscopy in the green/GFP (FlaviA-GFP) and far-red/Cy5 (FlaviA-mNeptune) channels.Selection For the antibiotic selection of transduced cells, replace the medium with 750 µl/well of MEM 10% FBS containing 8 µg/ml of puromycin (Recipe 6) and incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Apply the same treatment to the control cells.Replace the medium of both transduced and control cells with 1 ml/well of MEM 10% FBS containing 4 µg/ml of puromycin. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until 100% mortality of the control cells is evidenced by light microscopy (commonly 24-48 h).Replace the medium of the selected cells with 1 ml/well of MEM 10% FBS + 0.5 µg/ml puromycin and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until reaching confluency of 80-90%.Passage the selected cells to 25 cm culture flasks with 5 ml of MEM 10% FBS + 0.5 µg/ml puromycin and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until reaching a confluency of 80-90% (https://www.jove.com/v/5052/passaging-cells[href=https://www.jove.com/v/5052/passaging-cells]).For the FACS selection, discard the medium, wash the cells once with 1 ml of PBS, add 500 µl of TrypLETM express (no phenol red), incubate for 5 min at 37 °C, and resuspend the cells with 1 ml of PBS 1% FBS.Count the cells with a hemocytometer (https://www.jove.com/v/5048/using-a-hemacytometer-to-count-cells[href=https://www.jove.",
    "com/v/5048/using-a-hemacytometer-to-count-cells]) and prepare 2 ml of cell suspensions at 1,000,000 cells/ml in PBS 1% FBS.Aspirate the cell suspensions into the cell sorter. For the FlaviA-GFP reporter isolate at least two cell subpopulations with different but homogeneous levels of the reporter's basal background using the FL1 detector (488 nm laser - 530/30 nm filter) (Figure 1). Apply the same procedure to the FlaviA-mNeptune reporter but using the FL4 detector (640 nm laser - 675/25 nm filter).Note: The basal background of the FlaviA-GFP and FlaviA-mNeptune reporters make them sensitive to the levels of cellular expression: If the expression is too high the background will mask the signal produced upon activation of the reporters. If the expression is too low there will not be enough reporter’s signal over the background. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3942/bioprotoc-11-05-3942-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Histogram showing the difference in the green fluorescence (FL1 detector- 530/30 nm filter) between wild-type and reporter BHK-21 cells due to the basal background of the FlaviA-GFP reporter proteins. B. Scatter plots showing the heterogeneity in the population of stable BHK-21 cells with different levels of expression of the FlaviA-GFP reporter. For the selection of the best reporter cells (highest signal-to-noise ratio), at least two cell subpopulations with different (low, medium or high) but homogeneous levels of the reporter's basal background must be isolated and tested by live-cell imaging upon flavivirus infection.Seed the isolated cell suppopulations in different wells of a 48-well cell culture plate with 1 ml/well of MEM 10% FBS + 0.5 µg/ml puromycin and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until reaching a confluency of 80-90%.Passage the selected cells to a 6-well cell culture plate with 3 ml of MEM 10% FBS + 0.",
    "5 µg/ml puromycin and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until reaching a confluency of 80-90%.Test the different isolated cell suppopulations by a live-cell imaging flavivirus infection kinetics according to the protocol described in Procedure C.Note: The best reporter cells will be those with the highest signal-to-noise ratio upon flavivirus infection. The fluorescence signal-to-noise ratio is calculated by dividing the signal of the reporter cells treated with infectious virus by the noise given by the reporter cells treated with UV-inactivated virus at the same post-inoculation time. Infection kinetics in reporter cells by live-cell imagingPrepare and titer the flaviviral seed of your choice (e.g., DENV, ZIKV, or YFV) according tostandard virological methodologies (Medina et al., 2012; Freppel et al., 2018). For viral inactivation, place 200 µl/well of the flaviviral seed in a 24-well cell culture plate, remove the lid and apply 5 cycles of UV light (254 nm) exposure at an energy of 400,000 µJ/cm2 into an ultraviolet crosslinker. Between cycles, shake the plate for 5 s using your hands.As described above, seed 15,000 BHK-21/FlaviA-GFP stable cells per well in a µClear black 96-well plate with 100 µl/well of MEM 2% FBS and incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Based on the calculated titer of the flaviviral seed in plaque forming units (PFU)/ml, prepare 50 µl/well of inoculum at a low MOI (between 0.1 and 0.25). As 15,000 cells per well were plated in maintenance medium, between 1,500 and 3,750 PFUs must be diluted in MEM 2% FBS to a final volume of 50 μl/well. Multiply for the total number of wells to be inoculated and prepare a single inoculum suspension. Likewise, prepare the UV-inactivated inoculum suspension.",
    "Replace the medium of the cells with 50 µl/well of either the infectious or the UV-inactivated flaviviral inoculum and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for viral adsorption. Using your hands, shake the plate for 5 s every 15 min.Replace the inoculum with 150 µl/well of FluoroBriteTM DMEM 2% FBS (Recipe 7) and incubate for the desired time of your kinetics (e.g., 120 h) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 into the automated fluorescence microscope. Add 200 µl/well of PBS to the surrounding wells to avoid desiccation.Using your microscope’s software (e.g., Gen5 Image+), program the image acquisition with the 4× or the 20× objective in the green/GFP channel at the desired post-infection times (Figure 2A).Note: The acquisition parameters (excitation intensity, exposure time, and camera gain) of the images are variable according to the particular reporter cell subpopulation isolated by FACS. Always include an extra well of control cells for the adjustment of the acquisition parameters as the overexposure to the excitation light may harm the cells of the experimental conditions. Our recommendation is to set those parameters to a level where the background signal of the reporter proteins is just perceptible in the first images of the kinetics, in order to increase the dynamic range of the reporter’s fluorescence upon activation by flaviviral proteases. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3942/bioprotoc-11-05-3942-g002.jpgFigure 2.
