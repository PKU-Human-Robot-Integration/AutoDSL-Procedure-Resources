    "Prepare solutions See ‘Recipes’ section.Smurf assayNotes:  All fish work was performed following Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and UK Home Office approval (PPL 70/8681).If the blue dye is used at the correct concentration, well dissolved and filtered, no adverse effects are expected from the 30 min incubation period, except some temporary stress and discomfort. After blue-dye incubation, fish should be kept in separate tanks for at least 4 h before joining the main aquarium tanks where water is shared, to ensure all dye is excreted.Any signs of potential adverse effects such as impaired prolonged swimming and feeding should be brought to the attention of the NACWO and/or NVS and any definite or probably adverse effects should lead culling of the animal using an approved procedure performed by a person registered as competent by the certificate/licensed holder (10.1089/zeb.2016.1248). It is important to standardize the conditions under which Smurfs are examined.Transfer individuals onto SA mediumDrosophila and nematodes: overnight.Fish: 30 min.Transfer individuals onto fresh normal medium for immediate scoringDrosophila: if you have to process large numbers of vials, you might want to transfer vials one at a time to prevent individuals from clearing the blue dye before scoring.Nematodes can be examined directly on the fluorescein medium using an epi-fluorescence microscope.Fish: rinse them until no blue comes out of the individuals in successive and independent fish tanks (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201014357_2907.jpgFigure 5.

    "An alternative protocol for fish (Raquel Martins and Catarina Henriques): Since penetration of the blue dye through the skin of fish will always be a confounding factor with a dipping protocol, we tested oral administration of the blue dye by following the adult zebrafish gavage protocol published in Collymore et al. (2013). 5 µl of a 5% (m/v) filtered blue dye dissolved in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) was administered through oral gavage. Older individuals show the Smurf phenotype whilst we did not observe this in younger individuals (Figure 6C). This method requires training to prevent the experimenter from injuring the gut. It is nevertheless non-lethal, thus allowing further monitoring of individuals post assay. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201014616_5601.jpgFigure 6. Gavage allows to identify zebrafish Smurfs. Smurf zebrafish obtained using the ‘gavage protocol’ (A). All six Zebrafish WT AB individuals of 6 and 29 months of age used (B) and respective quantification of the blue hue that leaked through the gut and is now visible on the skin. (C) Quantifications were performed from digital pictures in ImageJ selecting three different parts of the body/fish, avoiding the blue stripes and quantifying the median of pixels per area. All 3 older fish turned bluer than the younger fish (t-test assuming normality and equal variances: P < 0.05 or more conservative: unequal variance t-test or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank test P ≤ 0.10). See Video 1.    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Detailed zebrafish Smurf gavage protocol  Pre-injection preparation:  Before the gavage procedure, the fish must be fasted for 24 h or at least 4 h prior to gavage, which will empty the intestinal bulb (stomach) contents. On the flat face, make a cut (10-15 mm deep) in the soft sponge, which will hold the fish for injection. Then, set the sponge into a 60 mm Petri dish.",
    "This will hold water to help maintain sponge moist.Anesthesia, Injection and Recovery: Anaesthetize fish with diluted Tricaine and monitor fish behavior. When fish is quiet, transfer it to the wet sponge (soaked in Tricaine) and move the sponge into a vertical position, as illustrated in the video. Then, open the zebrafish mouth using the 22-G catheter tubing adjusted to the size of the fish (approximately 2.5 cm), and gently insert the tubing until the tip is past the gills (approximately 1 cm or the length of the tubing). The implantation tubing should not need to be forced. Resistance suggests the tube may be hitting the gill arch or heart. Thus, if there is resistance, gently withdraw, reposition and try again.When the tube is completely inserted (reaching the middle intestine), inject the material slowly (5 μ of filtered (0.45 μm syringe filter) 5% (w/v) blue #1 diluted in HBSS). To accurately measure 5 μl, pipette 5 μl of the solution onto Parafilm and aspirate with a syringe, avoiding air bubbles. While injecting, make sure that the solution does not exit via the gills or the mouth. After injecting all the content, remove the fish from the sponge and place into the recovery tank. Fish should be monitored for regurgitation as shown by visualizing the fish actively expelling material from its mouth, or no opercular movement. Fish can be returned to their regular tank, or kept separately in a mating box, once they have recovered.Blue hue measurementsUsing ImageJ freehand selection tool, ROIs are selected on a picture converted to HSB space (command Image → Type → HSB Stack). Then, the hue is measured by the mean gray value (Analyze → Set measurements… → Mean gray value) in the Hue dimension of the picture."
