    "1. Cleaning the Glass Coverslips\nDilute 7x Cleaning Solution (see Materials Table) 7-fold with deionized water in a 100 mm deep borosilicate glass dish with a flat bottom and heat it up to 95 °C on a level hot plate for 20 min or until the cloudy solution becomes clear.\n\tNOTE: The solution will be hot, use caution to avoid bodily injuries. The 7x Cleaning Solution is a proprietary blend of hexasodium [oxido-[oxido(phosphonatooxy)phosphoryl]oxyphosphoryl] phosphate, 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol, sodium 1,4-bis(2-ethylhexoxy)-1,4-dioxobutane-2-sulfonate and non-hazardous additions.\nUsing tweezers, arrange the coverslips (40 mm length x 22 mm width x 0.16-0.19 mm height) on an aluminum staining rack in alternating directions. Keep an empty spot between each coverslip to prevent them from touching each other.\nFully submerge the staining rack with the coverslips in the cleaning solution. Keep the coverslips in the solution for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: As the water evaporates, keep adding fresh deionized water to keep the solution concentration unchanged.\nTake the staining racks out of the cleaning solution and wash the coverslips with copious amounts of deionized water to remove the detergent.\nDry the coverslips with nitrogen gas (approximately 5 min per staining rack), and then place the coverslips in a kiln for 6 h at 550 °C for annealing.\n\tNOTE: This is a crucial step that smoothens rough features on the glass surface.\nPlace the coverslips in a plastic container and keep them away from dust.\n2. Fabricating Micropatterned PDMS Blocks\nMix polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer and the curing agent at 10:1 (w/w) ratio in a large plastic weigh boat and degas it in vacuum for 1 h with vacuum strength at 500 Torr or less.",
    "NOTE: PDMS is a transparent and inert silicone polymer. To get the desired PDMS block thickness (0.5 cm), mix 55 g of the prepolymer with 5.5 g of the curing agent.\nPlace the silicon master which contains multiple replicates of the same SU-8 micropattern in a large (10 cm base diameter) plastic weigh boat and pour in the degassed PDMS. Then, cure it in a dry oven at 60 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Micropatterns are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. Each pattern contains 8 microchannels (100 µm width x 40 µm height x 1 cm length) with 40 µm spacing in between (Figure 1A, 1B). Silicon wafer mold comprised of hard baked SU-8 photoresist was fabricated in a nanofabrication facility27. Other approaches for master preparation include hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching, high-temperature water etching, xurography, and 3D printing28,29,30,31. Commercial sources for silicon master preparation can also be used. The patterns for the microfluidic device was designed with a drafting software (see table of materials). The original file containing the pattern design is provided as a supplemental file \"Pattern Design.dwg\", which can be provided directly to the manufacturer.\nGently, peel off the PDMS from the silicon master with hands. Mark the boundaries of each micropattern in rectangles using a surgical scalpel and a ruler. Then, cut the PDMS into blocks.\nPunch 16 holes (8 inlets and 8 outlets per block) at both ends of each microchannel with a biopsy punch (1.0 mm hole diameter) as indicated in Figure 3B.\nApply tape over each PDMS block to protect the micropatterns from damage and dust. Store them in a plastic container.\n3. Preparing Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUVs)",
    "NOTE: Negative control bilayer composition is 99.5 mol% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 0.5 mol% ortho-Sulforhodamine B-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (oSRB-POPE). Test bilayer composition is 92.0 mol% POPC, 0.5 mol% oSRB-POPE, and 7.5 mol% of either L-α-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) or L-α-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Below is the procedure for preparing 92.0 mol% POPC, 0.5 mol% oSRB-POPE, and 7.5 mol% PI(4,5)P2-containing SUVs. The synthesis of oSRB-POPE used in this study was previously described20.\nCalculate the volume of POPC, PI(4,5)P2, and oSRB-POPE that needs to mixed, which accounts for the following total amounts: 2.22 mg of POPC, 0.26 mg of PI(4,5)P2, and 2.1 x 10-5 mg of oSRB-POPE.\nPipette the calculated volume of POPC, PI(4,5)P2, oSRB-POPE into a single 20 mL glass scintillation vial.\n\tNOTE: POPC and oSRB-POPE stock solutions come in a chloroform solution, whereas the PI(4,5)P2 (and other phosphoinositides) stock comes in a chloroform:methanol:water (20:9:1) solvent mixture. For accuracy, wet the pipette tip with chloroform before using it. For safety, this step should take place inside a chemical fume hood.\nDry the mixture in a stream of nitrogen gas inside a chemical fume hood for 10 min or until the solvent evaporates and a thin lipid film forms at the bottom of the vial.\nDesiccate the mixture under vacuum for ≥3 h at a vacuum strength of 10 mTorr to remove any residual organic solvent.\n\tNOTE: The 3 h desiccation time is sufficient for the scale of SUV preparation described in this protocol, which is adequate for 50 experiments. If a larger scale of SUV preparation is required, overnight desiccation can be performed.\nRehydrate the dried lipid film with 5 mL of running buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, at pH 7.0) and place it in an ultrasonic bath at an operating frequency of 35 kHz for 30 min at RT.",
    "NOTE: Mixing the amounts of lipids specified in step 3.1 and adding 5 mL of running buffer in step 3.5 yields a vesicle suspension at 0.5 mg/mL. At this stage, the vesicle suspension is a mix of unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles (Figure 2B). The solution will appear pink/purple in color and relatively turbid.\nFreeze-thaw the vesicle suspension with liquid nitrogen and water bath at 40 °C to get unilamellar vesicles. Repeat the freeze-thaw 10 times.\n\tNOTE: (Optional) To ensure the absence of non-unilamellar vesicles in the suspension, centrifugation step can be applied32,33.\nExtrude the vesicle suspension through a 0.10 µm track-etched polycarbonate membrane using a lipid extruder (see table of materials) to enrich for SUVs. Repeat the extrusion 10 times.\n\tNOTE: A 15-mL conical tube can be used to collect the extruded vesicles. The solution should be void of turbidity at this stage. SUV diameter can be confirmed via dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 2C). SUVs are best suited for forming SLBs34.\nCover the conical tube with aluminum foil and store at 4 °C until ready to use.\n4. Assembling the Microfluidic Device\nTest the inlets and outlets of the PDMS block for blockage by squirting deionized water through the holes using a water wash bottle. Then, dry the PDMS block with nitrogen gas.\n\tNOTE: This step will also remove any dust particles that might have been trapped within and/or between channels. If necessary, dedust pre-cleaned coverslips with nitrogen gas to remove any dust particles.\nPlace the PDMS block and the pre-cleaned coverslip (see section 1) inside the oxygen plasma system (see table of materials) sample chamber to expose with oxygen plasma for 45 s with power setting at 75 Watts, oxygen flow speed at 10 cm3/min, and vacuum strength at 200 mTorr.",
    "Place the patterned surface of the PDMS block in contact with the coverslip immediately after the oxygen plasma treatment. Press gently to remove any air bubbles at contact sites.\nPlace the device on a level hot plate at 100 °C for 3 min to enhance the bonding.\nUse a wet lint-free wipe (e.g. kimwipe) with 100% ethanol to remove any dust particles from the top (PDMS) and the bottom (glass) of the device. Then, tape the device on top of a glass microscope slide.\n\tNOTE: Do not use an excessive amount of ethanol and avoid ethanol getting into the inlet and outlet channels. Performing this step while the device is still hot is recommended to ensure that the ethanol evaporates immediately. Glass microscopy slides can be stored in 100% ethanol solution to remove dust and other contaminants.\n5. Forming Supported Lipid Bilayers (SLBs)\nTransfer 100 µL of PI(4,5)P2-containing SUVs from step 3.8 into a 0.65 mL microcentrifuge tube. Adjust the pH of the solution to ~3.2 by adding 6.4 µL of 0.2 N hydrochloric acid.\n\tNOTE: Confirm the pH of the solution with a pH meter equipped with a micro pH probe (see table of materials).\nPipette 10 µL of the pH-adjusted SUV solution into each channel through the inlet and apply pressure through the pipette until the solution reaches the outlet. Detach the tip from the pipette and leave it attached to the device.\nRepeat the above step for each channel and then incubate the device for 10 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: Injection of vesicles into microchannels should be performed immediately after the device assembly.\nCut sets of inlet and outlet tubing each 60 cm (inlet tubing) and 8 cm (outlet tubing) long, respectively.",
    "NOTE: Cutting the tubing diagonally and creating a sharp edge, makes it easier to insert the tubing into the inlets and outlets. The outlet tubing should have an arc shape. The length of the inlet tubing may vary based on the microscope setup. The internal diameter of the tubing is 0.05 cm.\nUsing tweezers, connect the outlet tubing set to the device, and then tape the device onto a microscope stage.\nSubmerge one end of the inlet tubing set in 25 mL of running buffer contained in a conical tube and tape it to make sure that the tubing is secured.\nPlace the conical tube on a higher ground (~20 cm) than the device in order to push the solution through the microchannels via gravity flow; a lab jack can be used to achieve this.\nFor each inlet tube, use a syringe to draw 1 mL of running buffer from the free end of the tubing. Remove the pipette tip from the inlet and insert the free end of the inlet tubing into the device.\n\tNOTE: Introduce a drop of running buffer onto the inlet to reduce the probability of an air bubble being introduced into the channel during this step. After the inlet tubing is attached to the device, use a lint-free wipe to remove the excess buffer.\nRepeat the above step to connect all the inlet tubing pieces to the device.\n\tNOTE: Flowing running buffer through the channels helps to remove excess vesicles and equilibrate the bilayer to experimental conditions.\nOpen the microscope control software (see table of materials). On the left panel, click on the \"Microscope\" tab and choose the \"10X\" objective.\nClick on \"Live\" and then \"Alexa 568\" image icons on the toolbar. Using the fine and course adjustment knobs, focus on the microchannels.",
    "Scan through the device to check the quality of the SLBs and the channels (Figure 8). Then, click \"FL Shutter Closed\" image icon on the toolbar.\nClick on the \"Acquisition\" tab, and under \"Basic adjustments\" select \"Exposure time.\" Set the exposure time to \"200 ms\".\nOn the left panel, click on \"Multidimensional Acquisition\" and under the filters menu select the red channel (marked as \"Alexa 568\"). Then, click on the \"time lapse\" menu, set the time interval to 5 min, duration to 30 min, and click \"Start\".\n\tNOTE: Based on the duration (30 min) and the flow rate (~1.0 µL/min), 30 µL of running buffer is used to equilibrate the SLB within a channel, i.e. 240 µL of running buffer is used for all 8 channels.\nSelect the \"Circle\" tool under the \"Measure\" tab and draw a circle in any channel. Right click while the circle is selected and choose \"Properties\". Under the \"Profile\" tab, check \"all T\" to view the fluorescence intensity as a function of time.\nMake sure this curve reaches a plateau, which indicates equilibrium, before proceeding to the next step.\nLower the buffer solution to an equal ground as the device to stop the flow.\nSave the time lapse file.\n6. Testing PLC-δ1 PH domain interaction with PI(4,5)P2-containing SLBs\nPrepare dilutions of the PH domain using the running buffer as a diluent.\n\tNOTE: Since there are eight channels within the device, use at least two of them for blank controls. Pick the far ends on each side and use the remaining channels for protein dilutions. The following PH domain concentrations were tested: 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, and 2.50 µM. Approximately 200 µL of each dilution was sufficient to reach equilibrium within 30 min.",
    "One at a time, detach each outlet tubing and apply 200 µL of each protein dilution into the outlet channel using a pipette. Do not apply any pressure, let gravity do the work. Detach the tip from the pipette and leave it attached to the microfluidic device.\nRepeat the above step for each channel and make sure that air bubbles are not introduced into the channels during this process.\nLower the inlet tubing to a ground below the microfluidic device to start flowing the protein through the microchannels. Tape the free end of the tubing to a waste container. Flow the protein dilutions for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: This will reverse the flow and allow the protein to be introduced into the channels. The time to equilibration and volume of protein dilutions needed will be dependent on the affinity of the interaction.\nOn the left panel of the software, under the \"Time Lapse\" tab, click on \"Start\" to begin imaging again.\nRepeat the step 5.15 to make sure equilibrium is reached. When the experiment is complete, save the time lapse file.\n7. Assessing Membrane Fluidity\nNOTE: Fluorescence Recover After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments should be performed with each new batch of SUVs and cleaned glass coverslips to ensure that the SLBs are fluid.\nFollow the procedure for cleaning glass coverslips (1.1-1.6), fabricating micropatterned PDMS blocks (2.1-2.5), preparing SUVs (3.1-3.8), assembling the microfluidic device (4.1-4.5) and forming SLBs (5.1-5.17) as previously described.\nFocus the microscope on the bilayer, set the exposure time to 200 ms, and the binning to 1.",
    "Photo-bleach a circular spot using a 532 nm, 2 mW laser beam (13 µM radius). Immediately after photobleaching, start capturing a series of images every 3 s for the first 45 s, followed by a 30 s interval for the remainder of the time (15 min total duration). Once the data acquisition is complete, save the time lapse file.\nSelect the bleached area using the circle drawing tool to extract fluorescence intensity values as a function of time. Additionally, select two more areas nearby, one corresponding to an unbleached region and one corresponding to a region without any SLBs.\nCalculate the fluorescence recovery (y) using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55869/55869eq1.jpg\n\tNOTE: Here Ft represents the intensity of the bleached region as a function of time, Fi represents the fluorescence intensity before bleaching (use \"1\" as a normalized value in this case); F0 is the background intensity.\nPlot fluorescence recovery (y-axis) as a function of time (x-axis) to generate a FRAP curve. Then, fit the data to a single exponential function as follows,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55869/55869eq2.jpg\n\tNOTE: Here A represents the mobile fraction and k is the kinetic constant for the mobile fraction, which is used to calculate the half-time to recovery (t1/2):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55869/55869eq3.jpg\nUse the t1/2 to calculate the diffusion constant (D):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55869/55869eq4.jpg\n\tNOTE: Here R represents the laser beam radius (13 µm). The diffusion constant for a fluid bilayer should be ≥1.0 µm2/s.\n8. Processing Data\nNOTE: The routine of the data analysis will be dependent on the microscope, image processing software, and the curve-fitting software being used.",
    "Open the time lapse files of before (from step 5.17) and after (from step 6.6) titrating the PH domain. Go to the last frame of each time lapse file and do a line scan across all the microchannels to obtain the fluorescence intensity data as a function of distance in pixels (Figure 6A). Transfer the data to a spreadsheet software.\nFor each microchannel (before and after PH domain addition), sample some data within the channel and either side of the channel representing the baseline (Figure 7A).\n\tNOTE: The blank channel fluorescence intensity should have remained unchanged. All the other channels are normalized to the blank channel, so it is crucial to have two blank channels and make sure that their fluorescence intensities remain consistent with each other.\nApply the formula below to normalize the data to the blank channel; a sample calculation is provided in Figure 7B.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55869/55869eq5.jpg\n\tNOTE: Here ΔFprotein represents the background subtracted fluorescence intensity of the protein channel, ΔFblank represents the background subtracted fluorescence intensity of the blank channel, pre and post refer to before and after protein titration steps, and α represents the correction factor which is the ratio of the fluorescence intensities of the protein channel and the blank channel ([Fprotein/Fblank]pre) at a pre-protein titration step. Since the fluorescence intensity decreases as a function of the PH domain concentration, normalized data will be negative in value.\nUsing a curve-fitting software (see Materials Table), plot the normalized fluorescence as a function of PH domain concentration and fit to a Langmuir isotherm (Figure 6C):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55869/55869eq6.jpg",
    "NOTE: Here ∆F represents the change in fluorescence intensity relative to the maximum change in fluorescence intensity when a saturation concentration of protein is present (∆Fmax), whereas the Kd,app represents the apparent dissociation constant, which is equal to the bulk protein concentration ([PLC-δ1 PH]) at which 50% coverage (membrane bound complex) is achieved. This is an equilibrium-based binding measurement so the normalized data is fit to a simple Langmuir isotherm to extract an apparent experimental parameter Kd,app. Based on the fitting software the Kd,app for PLC-δ1 PH-PI(4,5)P2 interaction is 0.39 ± 0.05 µM (Figure 6B).\nSubscription Required.
