    "1. Construction of ADE2 or LUC1 reporter yeast strains containing a specific RE (yAFM-RE or yLFM-RE)\nStreak a yAFM-ICORE or yLFM-ICORE strain12,14 (ICORE = I, ISce-I endonuclease under GAL1 promoter; CO = counter selectable URA3; RE = reporter KanMX4 conferring kanamycin resistance; Table 1) from a 15% glycerol stock stored at -80 °C on a YPDA agar plate (Table 2). Let it grow for 2-3 days at 30 °C.\nTake one yeast colony from the fresh plate (no more than 3 weeks old) and place it in a small flask containing 5 mL of YPDA (Table 2). Incubate at 30 °C overnight, shaking at 150-200 rpm.\nThe next day, to remove all traces of dextrose, pellet the cells for 2 min at 3,000 x g and discard the supernatant by inversion of the tube.\n\tNOTE: Perform all centrifugations in this protocol at room temperature (RT).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 30-50 mL of pre-warmed CM (complete media) containing galactose (Table 2) and incubate for 4 h at 30 °C, shaking at 150-200 rpm (necessary for the induction of I-SceI).\nCentrifuge the cells for 2 min at 3,000 x g and discard the supernatant by inversion of the tube.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 30-50 mL of sterile water. Repeat step 1.5.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of sterile water. Repeat step 1.5.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of sterile LiAcTE (Table 3), an ionic solution that favors DNA uptake. Repeat step 1.5.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 250 µL of sterile LiAcTE and transfer the cells to a 1.5 mL tube. Repeat step 1.5 and resuspend the cell pellet in 300-500 µL of sterile LiAcTE.",
    "During the washes, denature a 10 mg/mL solution of salmon sperm DNA carrier for 10 min at 100 °C and chill immediately on ice to maintain it as single-stranded DNA.\nIn a separate 1.5 mL tube, add 500 picomoles of the desired oligonucleotide (Table 3), 5 µL of the boiled salmon sperm carrier DNA, 300 µL of sterile LiAcTE PEG (Table 3), and 50 µL of the yeast cell suspension (from step 1.9).\nVortex the tubes for 10 s to mix and incubate for 30 min at 30 °C, shaking at 150-200 rpm. Place the 1.5 mL tubes on the side to favor shaking.\nHeat shock the yeast cells for 15 min at 42 °C in a heating block, then centrifuge the cells for 20 s at 10,000 x g. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of sterile water.\nSpread 100 µL of the cell suspension on YPDA agar plate and incubate (upside down) for 1 day at 30 °C. To ensure well-separated colonies are obtained, also spread 100 µL of a 1:10 dilution.\nThe next day, replica plate using sterile velvets onto CM agar plate containing dextrose and 5-FOA (Table 2). Consider a second replica plate on a new plate if many cells are transferred (i.e., some growth of URA3 cells).\nThree days later, replica plate on non-selective YPDA and YPDA containing G418 (an aminoglycoside antibiotic similar to kanamycin) agar plates (Table 2), marking each plate to facilitate their subsequent comparison. Incubate the plates overnight at 30 °C.",
    "The next day, identify the candidate reporter strains from colonies that are G418-sensitive but grow on YPDA plates (e.g., yLFM- or yAFM-RE colonies). Streak the identified colonies (3-6 colonies) on a new YPDA plate to obtain single colony isolates and let them grow for 2 days at 30 °C.\nPatch single yeast colonies on a YPDA plate to isolate the colonies for further analyses. After 24 h at 30 °C, test them by replica plating on a YPGA agar plate (Table 2) that prevent the growth of petite mutants (i.e., respiratory-deficient mutants). At the same time, replica plate on a new YPDA agar plate.\nTest the correct patches (i.e., growth on YPDA and YPGA agar plates; 1-3 colonies) from step 1.18 for the presence of correct oligonucleotide integration by colony PCR. Assemble a reaction mix by adding 5 μL of 10x PCR buffer (1.5 mM MgCl2), 2 μL of 10 picomoles/μL primers (Table 3), 4 μL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.25 µL of 5 U/μL Taq polymerase, and water to a final volume of 50 μL. Multiply the reaction mix for the number of yeast colonies that need to be screened and aliquot 50 μL into each PCR tube. Using a pipette, add a very small amount of yeast cells from the YPDA agar plate into a single PCR reaction mix.\nPerform the PCR reaction with the following program: 94 °C for 8 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, primers annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, and extension for 2 min at 72 °C.\nAfter the reaction is completed, load an aliquot of the PCR reaction (about one-tenth the volume) on an agarose gel to check the correct size (~500 bp) .",
    "Sequence the PCR product after purification with a commercial kit to confirm the integration of the desired RE sequence using the same primers of step 1.19.\nAfter the validation of the correct sequence, make a 15% glycerol stock of yAFM-RE or yLFM-RE strain culture (in YPDA) and store it at -80 °C.\n2. Evaluation of P53 protein transactivation ability using the qualitative color-based ADE2 yeast assay\nRepeat steps 1.1 and 1.2 using the yAFM-RE strain (Table 1).\nThe day after, dilute the cell culture (1:10) in 30-50 mL of pre-warmed YPDA and continue to incubate at 30 °C by shaking until the OD600nm reaches 0.8-1.0 (~2 h).\nRepeat steps 1.5-1.10.\nIn a separate 1.5 mL tube, add 300-500 ng of yeast P53 (or control) expression vector (Table 4), 5 µL of the boiled salmon sperm DNA carrier, 300 µL of sterile LiAcTE PEG, and 50 µL of yeast cell suspension.\nRepeat steps 1.12 and 1.13 but resuspend the cell pellet in 300 µL of sterile water.\nSpread 100 µL of the cell suspension on synthetic selective (for P53 expression or control vector) plates containing dextrose as a carbon source and high amount of adenine (Table 2), then incubate (upside down) at 30 °C for 2-3 days.\nStreak single yeast transformant colonies (2-6 streaks per plate) on a new selective plate and let them grow overnight at 30 °C.\nThe day after, using sterile velvets replica plate onto new selective plates that allow for the assessment of the color phenotype (i.e., plates containing dextrose as carbon source but limiting the amount of adenine ; Table 2). Incubate the plates upside down at 30 °C for 3 days. Optionally, to evaluate temperature sensitivity of P53 protein, incubate at three different temperatures for 3 days: 24 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: The same streak can be replica plated multiple times.\nTo evaluate the P53 protein transactivation ability, check the color-based phenotype of yeast colonies and compare the P53 protein phenotype with respect to P53 wild-type and empty vector phenotypes.\n3. Evaluation of P53 protein transactivation ability using the quantitative luminescence based LUC1 yeast assay\nTransform yeast cells with P53 (or control) expression vectors (Table 4) using the LiAc based method described in protocol 2. Use yLFM-RE strain (Table 1).\nPatch single transformants on a new selective plate with the high amount of adenine containing glucose as the carbon source and let them grow at 30 °C overnight. For each transformation type, make 5-7 different patches.\nAfter overnight growth, resuspend a small amount of yeast cells using a sterile toothpick or pipette tip from the plate in synthetic selective medium containing dextrose or raffinose as the carbon source (200 µL final volume in a transparent 96 well plate, with a round or flat bottom). If the experiment requires inducible P53 expression, add galactose to the raffinose medium to modulate the level of induction (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: These cell suspensions should have an OD600nm of about 0.4 and no higher than 1.\nMeasure the absorbance of each well at OD600nm after inducible P53 expression (4-8 h at 30°C with 150-200 rpm shaking) using a multilabel plate reader. Make sure the cell suspensions are homogeneous by mixing each well with a multichannel pipette.\nTransfer 10-20 µL of cell suspension from the transparent 96 well plate into a white 384 (or 96) well plate and mix with an equal volume (10-20 µL) of lysis buffer. Incubate for 10-15 min at RT on a shaker (150-200 rpm) to achieve permeabilization of the cell to the luciferase substrate.",
    "Add 10-20 µL of Firefly luciferase substrate and measure the light units (LU) by a multi-label plate reader.\nTo determine P53 protein transactivation ability, normalize the LUs of each well to the corresponding OD600nm (relative light unit, RLU). Calculate average RLU and standard deviation from 3-4 patches of yeast transformant colonies.\nCompare the P53 protein transactivation data with respect to P53 wild-type and empty vector, either by subtracting the values obtained with the empty vector or by dividing by the values obtained with the empty vector (i.e., computing fold of induction).\n\tNOTE: The P53 transactivation activity can be also evaluated using the same experimental set-up in the presence of P53-interacting proteins (i.e., MDM2 and MDMX) and/or including drug treatment.\n4. Evaluation of P53 protein growth inhibition using the yeast phenotypic assay\nTransform yeast cells with P53/MDM2/MDMX (or control) expression vectors (Table 4) using the LiAc-based method described in section 2. Use the CG379 strain (Table 1) and spread yeast transformants on minimal selective plates (Table 2).\nGrow transformed cells in minimal selective medium (Table 2) to approximately 1 OD600nm.\nDilute yeast cells to 0.05 OD600nm in the selective induction medium (Table 2), and optionally, add a chosen small molecule to the appropriate concentration (or solvent only) to test its efficacy in reactivating mutant P53 or in inhibiting MDM2-/MDMX-P53 interactions.\nIncubate cells at 30 °C under continuous orbital shaking (200 rpm) for approximately 42 h (time required by negative control yeast to reach mid-log phase, about 0.45 OD600nm).\nSpot 100 µL aliquots of yeast cell cultures on minimal selective plates (Table 2).\nIncubate for 2 days at 30 °C.",
    "Measure yeast growth by counting the number of colonies obtained in the 100 µL culture drops (colony forming unit, CFU counts). For example, calculate the mutant reactivating effect of compounds considering the growth of wild-type P53 expressing yeast as the maximal possible effect (set to 100%), while the growth of cells expressing mutant P53 (but exposed to solvent control) represents the zero level of reactivation.\nSubscription Required.
