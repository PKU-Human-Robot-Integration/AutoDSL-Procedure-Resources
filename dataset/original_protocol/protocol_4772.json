    "Total lipid extraction (Figure 1)Aliquot 3 ml preheated isopropanol (75 °C with 0.01% BHT) into glass tubes (50 ml, 25 x 150 mm tubes with Teflon-lined screw caps are recommended).Fresh Arabidopsis leaves were harvested and immediately soaked in hot isopropanol for at least 15 min in 75 °C water bath to inactivate phospholipase D. To achieve higher reliability and repeatability, 5-30 mg delipidated “dry weight” as measured in step A10 is recommended (~2-8 fully developed leaves to start with). Samples were cooled to room temperature after incubation. Isopropanol treated samples are stable at room temperature within a day.Add 1.5 ml chloroform and 0.6 ml water to cooled samples, mix by vortexing. Incubate samples in water bath shaker at room temperature, 50 rpm for 1 h.Transfer extracted lipids (disregard potential phase separation) with a glass Pasteur pipettes to another glass collection tube.Add 4 ml lipid extraction solution to leaf samples and incubate in 25 °C water bath shaker for 30 min. Transfer extracts to the same collection tube.Repeat step A5 to extract samples with lipid extraction solution until all leaf samples become white. It is recommended to extract each sample the same number of times. 5 extractions (including isopropanol in step A2) are usually needed. Old leaves are harder to be extracted completely, longer incubation time in steps A2, A3 and A5 and more extraction steps may help.Add 1 ml KCl solution to the combined extract (~20 ml), mix thoroughly by vortex, centrifuge at ~200 x g for 10 min, discard upper phase carefully.Add 2 ml water, mix by vortex, centrifuge at ~200 x g for 10 min, discard upper phase carefully.Dry lipid samples completely in the nitrogen evaporator, mild heating (<50 °C) may be used to accelerate the process.",
    "Dried lipids can be stored at -80 °C with cap tightly closed. An aliquot of lipids can be resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) for quality check (Figure 2). Briefly, total lipids corresponding to ~0.2-1 mg DW were spotted on the TLC Silica gel 60 plate and resolved by chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:H2O = 85:15:12.5:3.5. The plate was left dry completely in the fume hood before staining by iodine vapor and examining by eye or 0.01% primuline in acetone/H2O (60:40; v/v) and examining the plates under ultraviolet (360 nm) light.Dry extracted leaves in oven at 105 °C overnight. Weigh to get “dry weight”.Lipid profiling by ESI-MS/MS and data processingReconstitute dried lipid samples (step A9) in chloroform, cap tightly before use to avoid evaporation. For easy sample preparation, lipid samples were diluted to the same concentration according to dry weight. We usually use 250 µl chloroform per mg dry weight.Each sample contains 840 µl solution B, 5 µl PL standard, 3 µl GL standard and lipid sample corresponding to 0.1-0.2 mg dry weight (25-50 µl), add chloroform to 1,200 µl in a 2 ml snap seal autosampler vial, cap with pre-cut vial caps.For every 10 lipid samples, only one “internal standard (IS)” vial is used for machine correction/contamination control. Chloroform is used in place of lipid samples in this vial.Load the autosampler in the following format: IS1, sample1-10, IS2, sample11-20 and so on. “Blank” samples are recommended between different genotypes, which contains only solution B and chloroform.Profile lipid samples by ESI-MS/MS. Detailed information can be found in Welti et al. (2002). The parameters we used on API 4000 are listed in section C. Optimization is needed on different setups, such that fewer or more parameters can be adjusted on older or newer machines. A representative phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) profiling result is attached (Figure 3).",
    "Data were extracted by Analyst 1.5.1 with necessary corrections, including background subtraction and smooth. For each lipid class, multiple (usually 2) novel lipid species were used as internal standards (Table 1), linear interpolation according to molecular weight of each lipid species was used for internal standard peak area normalization. The amount of each lipid species was calculated according to sample peak area compared with normalized internal standard peak area. Five or more biological repeats are recommended, Student’s t-test is used for statistical analysis.Lipid data may be presented as absolute amount (nmol/mg “dry weight”, recommended) or percentage of total lipids (PL and GL).Lipid profiling parameters on API 4000API 4000 LC-MS/MS system equipped with TurboIonSpray probe and HTC PAL autosampler was used for lipid profiling. The source temperature was 100 °C, interface heater was on, IonSpray Voltage was set to 5.5 kV, nitrogen gas was used for both source and curtain gas. The scan resolution was set to 0.1Da. The samples were introduced using the autosampler with 1 ml syringe and injection loop for full lipid profiling. The samples were presented to the TurboIonSpray probe by direct infusion at 0.03 ml/min. The scanning parameters for each lipid class were listed in Table 2.Table 2.
