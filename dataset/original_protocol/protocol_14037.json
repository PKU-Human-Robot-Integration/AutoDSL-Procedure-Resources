    "Tissue protocols were approved by Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, Germany (G0121/16). Experiments were conducted in accordance with the European directive 2010/63/EU on Care, Welfare and Treatment of Animals.\n1. Fixation, dehydration, paraffin embedding, sectioning, mounting of sections\nPrepare 2% formaldehyde solution by dissolving paraformaldehyde in TBS (pH 7.4). Avoid heating above 60 °C. Cool to RT. Formaldehyde solution can be stored at -20 °C.\nPlace fresh tissue (here: mouse lung) into a glass Petri dish with TBS. With a scalpel, dissect into pieces not exceeding 20 mm x 30 mm x 3 mm in size. Immerse specimen into 2% formaldehyde solution in TBS.\n\tNOTE: The volume of fixative should be at least 20x that of the tissue.\nFix at RT for 8−20 h. Transfer specimens to TBS. Place into cassettes.\nDehydrate using a series of ethanol (70%, 80%, 90%, 96%, 100%, 100%), with each step lasting 1 h.\nClear specimens 2x in 100% xylene (dimethylbenzene), each step 1 h.\nSoak in paraffin 2x at 60 °C (melting temperature 54−56 °C), each step 1 h.\nMount specimens using embedding molds, use the cassette bottom as a cover.\nLet paraffin solidify and remove embedding molds.\nPrepare 3 µm tissue sections, and let them float on 37 °C water bath.\nFloat sections on water surface onto adhesive glass slides (Table of Materials).\nIncubate sections on glass slides overnight at 40 °C to bond the tissue to the glass.\n2. Rehydration, heat-induced epitope retrieval, staining, mounting, microscopic analysis\nPlace sections on glass slides in racks and submerse them into the media used for dehydration and clearing, in reverse order, with each step for 5 min: 2x 100% xylene, ethanol series (2x 100%, 96%, 90%, 80%, 70%).",
    "Heat a water bath with a temperature-controlled hot plate to 70 °C. Place a jar filled with heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER)-buffer (pH 9; Table of Materials), containing 10% glycerol as a temperature buffer, into a water bath. When the HIER buffer has reached 70 °C, place the rack with slides into buffer jar.\nIncubate slides for 120 min at 70 °C.\nRemove the jar from the water bath and let it cool to RT. Rinse sections 3x with deionized water and once with TBS (pH 7.4).\nCarefully remove liquid from slides between sections with rolled filter paper or cotton swab, leaving sections hydrated.\nCreate barrier around sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen.\nIncubate sections in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 2% normal donkey serum, 5% cold water fish gelatin and detergents [Table of Materials] in TBS) at RT for 30 min to prevent unspecific binding.\nDilute primary antibodies at a concentration of 1 µg/mL in blocking buffer.\n\tNOTE: For human and mouse NETs, a combination of rabbit antibody against neutrophil elastase and chicken antibody against Histone 2B can be used (Table of Materials).\nPlace slides into a moist chamber. Remove blocking buffer and add the diluted primary antibodies without washing to the sections using sufficient volume to prevent drying. Seal moist chamber with paraffin film and incubate overnight at RT.\nWash sections 3x with TBS for 5 min each.\nPrepare working solution of secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. For detection of primary antibodies, use secondary antibodies raised in donkey and pre-absorbed against serum proteins from multiple species (Table of Materials). Cover tissue sections with working solution of secondary antibodies. Transfer slides to moist chamber, seal with paraffin film. Incubate for 1 h at RT.",
    "NOTE: Donkey anti rabbit conjugated to Cy2 and donkey anti chicken conjugated to Cy3 can be combined with a DNA counterstain.\nWash sections 3x for 5 min each with TBS, then once for 5 min with deionized water.\nCover sections with mounting medium (Table of Materials) and apply cover glass avoiding bubble formation.\nLet mounting medium solidify, then analyze immunofluorescence using a wide-field microscope with appropriate band pass filters or a confocal microscope."
