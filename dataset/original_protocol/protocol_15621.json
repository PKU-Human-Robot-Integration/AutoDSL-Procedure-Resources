    "This protocol follows the guidelines approved by the Regional Ethical Committee, Lund, Sweden (ethical permit number 2021-07006-01). Healthy neocortical tissue was obtained from patients undergoing elective surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.\nNOTE: All the tissues obtained were processed regardless of their size. However, tissues smaller than 1-1.5 mm3 in size will be technically challenging to handle and section with a vibratome.\n1. Tissue collection, maintenance, cutting, and plating\nPreparations on the day before tissue slicing\n\t\nPrepare 2 L of cutting solution (Table 1) in a volumetric flask. Dissolve all the ingredients except MgCl2 and CaCl2 in ~1,800 mL of deionized water and bubble with carbogen gas for 15 min. Then add appropriate amounts of 1 M MgCl2 and CaCl2 solutions and continue bubbling for another 15 min. Finally, fill the flask to the 2 L mark; check the pH and osmolarity and adjust if needed. Freeze 2 x 350 mL of the prepared solution and store the rest at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The pH and osmolarity are typically 7.3-7.4 and 295-300 mOsm, respectively.\nPrepare 100 mL of rinsing solution (Table 2). Dissolve 476 mg of HEPES and 200.6 mg of glucose in 100 mL of HBSS supplemented with 5 mL of penicillin/streptomycin. This can be stored at 4 °C for up to 10 days.\nPrepare human adult cortical (hACtx) culture medium (hACtx medium) (Table 3) and filter it in the cell culture lab under a ventilated hood. The medium comprises neuronal medium without phenol red (see the Table of Materials), B27 supplement, L-glutamine (see the Table of Materials), and gentamicin. Store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nPreparations on the day of the operation before the arrival of the tissue samples",
    "Check the availability of the needed equipment and lab space, and thoroughly clean all the surgical tools and the vibratome (see the Table of Materials), as well as the benchtop space, with distilled water (without detergent), followed by 70% ethanol. Let the ethanol dry for at least 30 min before using the tools and equipment.\nCrush the frozen cutting solution and bubble the \"soup'' of ice and liquid with carbogen gas for 30 min. Then, tightly close one of the containers with the crushed solution ''soup'' and place it in the icebox. This will be used to collect the tissue from the operation room.\nCalibrate the vibratome and set the cutting parameters: 0.05 mm/s speed and 1.7 mm vibration. Place the cutting chamber on a vibratome stage and start the cooler connected to it so that the chamber is at a constant temperature of −3 °C.\nPrepare the slice collection chamber with inserts to place the tissue slices and cutting solution, bubbling it constantly with carbogen gas at room temperature (RT).\nIn the cell culture lab and under a ventilated hood, place the culture inserts in a 6-well plate using forceps. Add 5 mL of hACtx medium on the bottom of the insert until it contacts the membrane, avoiding the formation of bubbles, and add 2 mL on the top of the insert. Equilibrate in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 2 h before transferring the tissue slices into the inserts.\nTissue collection and slicing procedures\n\t\nImmediately after resection, collect the tissue from the patient in the operation room, if possible, directly into a container with frozen, bubbled, and crushed cutting solution. Transfer the closed container on ice immediately to the cutting area of the lab.",
    "Inspect the tissue and locate the best surface to glue (see step 1.3.3) it to the cutting stage of the vibratome, considering the orientation of the cortical layers. If needed, cut the uneven surface with a scalpel so that it is easy to place the tissue on the stage for optimal slice orientation.\nGlue the tissue to the stage with tissue adhesive (see the Table of Materials), place it in the slicing chamber, and immediately fill the chamber with cold bubbled cutting solution. Continue the bubbling during the whole cutting procedure.\nCut coronal or sagittal slices, depending on the tissue-to-blade orientation, at a thickness of 300 µm to contain all the cortical layers and, if possible, the white matter. Place the slices in the collection chamber with bubbling cutting solution at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: Cut from the white matter side toward the surface of the cortex. Do not remove the meninges, as this may damage the tissue. The cutting blade usually slices through them easily.\nOnce all the tissue has been cut, transfer the slices into a sterile Petri dish with rinsing solution at RT and transport them to the cell culture lab. This step is necessary to remove excess sucrose from the slices before transferring them to the culture plate.\n\t\tNOTE: To transfer the slices (in this and the following steps), use an inverted glass pipette, break off the thinner part, and place a rubber teat for suction.\nCulture and maintenance of hACtx tissue slices\n\t\nIndividually place the tissue slices on top of the already wet and submerged inserts. After 24 h, change the medium to further remove any remaining sucrose or other residual substances from the cutting procedures.",
    "Replace the culture medium with fresh medium every 7 days. After 2 weeks, use hACtx medium without gentamicin. The culture can be maintained for up to 2 months.\n\t\tNOTE: Equilibrate the hACtx medium in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 2 h before the medium change. Fresh medium should be prepared every 2 weeks. Check the slices every 2-3 days and, if some of the medium has evaporated, add more to the top of the insert.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nCutting solution,Stock concentration,Final concentration [mM],Per 1 L\nSucrose,Powder,200,68.46 g\nNaHCO3,Powder,21,1.76 g\nKCl,Powder,3,0.22 g\nNaH2PO4,Powder,1.25,0.17 g\nGlucose,Powder,10,1.80 g\nMgSO4,1 M,2,2 mL\nCaCl2,1 M,1.6,1.6 mL\nMgCl2,2 M,2,1 mL\nTable 1: Composition of cutting solution.

Aliquot in a volume of 100 µL.\nDilute 1 mg of cyclopamine in 2.5 mL of DMSO to a final concentration of 400 µg/mL, and make 100 µL aliquots.\nPrepare basic medium (Table 4) and differentiation-defined medium (DDM, Table 5), and store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nCoating of culture dishes\n\t\nTo pre-coat the dishes to culture the GFP-It-NES cells during proliferation or differentiation, dilute poly-L-ornithine 1:100 in deionized water and add 5 mL of the solution to a T25 flask. Incubate overnight at RT.\nWash the poly-L-ornithine coated plates 1x with deionized water and 1x with PBS.\nFor GFP-It-NES cells in proliferation, dilute mouse laminin at 1:500 in PBS and incubate for at least 2 h at 37 °C. For GFP-It-NES cells in differentiation, dilute mouse laminin at 1:100 in PBS and incubate for at least 2 h at 37 °C.\nProliferation of the GFP-lt-NES cells\n\t\nWarm 5 mL (for washing) and 5 mL (for seeding) of basic medium in two different 15 mL tubes.",
    "Rapidly thaw one vial of GFP-lt-NES cells at 37 °C, transfer them to the washing tube, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the medium carefully without touching the pellet, and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of pre-warmed basic medium. Transfer the cell suspension to the seeding tube containing basic medium supplemented with proliferation factors: EGF (10 ng/mL), bFGF (10 ng/mL), and B27 (10 ng/mL). Seed the cells on a poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated T25 flask.\nFeed the cells with proliferation factors every day. Replace the medium if it turns yellow. Passage the cells every third or fourth day (1 day after they reach 100% confluency).\nSplitting the GFP-lt-NES cells for proliferation and differentiation\n\t\nPre-warm 5 mL of basic medium per flask (to collect the cells), plus the total volume needed to reseed them.\n\t\tNOTE: The passage is done at a 1:3 dilution to keep the cells in proliferation, requiring 15 mL of basic medium, and a 1:6 dilution to start differentiation, requiring 30 mL of basic medium.\nRemove the medium from the cell culture flask by aspiration, and add 500 µL of pre-warmed 0.025% trypsin. Incubate for 5-10 min at RT. The detachment of the cells can be confirmed under a standard light microscope at 10x magnification.\nAdd an equal volume of trypsin inhibitor (0.5 mg/mL final concentration) followed by 5 mL of warm basic medium. Detach and collect the cells by gently pipetting up and down. Transfer the cells to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.\nTo keep the cells in proliferation, replate at a 1:3 dilution in fresh basic medium supplemented with proliferation factors, and repeat step 2.3.4.\nCortical differentiation of the GFP-lt-NES cells",
    "On day 0, resuspend the cells (to be used for differentiation) in 30 mL of basic medium supplemented with proliferation factors, and plate them in six differentiation-coated T25 flasks (split 1:6).\nOn day 1, change half of the medium to DDM, and add proliferation factors at half of their concentration.\nOn day 2, change the medium completely to DDM supplemented with differentiation factors: BMP4 (10 ng/mL), Wnt3a (10 ng/mL), and cyclopamine (400 ng/mL).\nOn day 4, add the differentiation factors alone. Replace the medium if it turns yellow.\nOn day 6, change the medium to DDM supplemented with BMP4 and Wnt3a. The cyclopamine is removed at this step.\nOn day 7, detach the cells as stated in step 2.4.2 and step 2.4.3.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nBasic Medium,Stock concentration,Final concentration,Per 100 mL\nDMEM/F12 with L-Glutamine,1x,,98.7 mL\nN-2 supplement,100x,1:100,1 mL\nGlucose,45%,3.5 mL/L,350 µL\nTable 4: Composition of proliferation medium of lt-NES cells (basic medium).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nDDM medium,Stock concentration,Final concentration,Per 100 mL\nDMEM/F12 with L-Glutamine,,,96 mL\nN2,100 x,1:100,1 mL\nNEAA,100 x,1:100,1 mL\nSodium Pyruvate,100 mM,1:100,1 mL\nBSA V Fraction,7.5%,6.6 mL/L,660 µL\n2-mercaptoethanol,50 nM,7 µL/L,0.7 µL\nGlucose,45%,3.2 mL/L,320 µL\nTable 5: Composition of differentiation-defined medium (DDM) of lt-NES cells.\n3. Transplantation of the GFP-lt-NES cells into organotypic hACtx slices\nNOTE: The hACtx tissue should be cultured for 1 week prior to cell transplantation. To facilitate the transplantation procedure, it is necessary to remove 2 mL of the hACtx medium from the top of the insert to prevent the tissue from floating.\nResuspend the cortically primed GFP-lt-NES cells (from step 2.5.6) in cold pure basement membrane matrix (see the Table of Materials) at a concentration of 1 x 105 cells/µL and transfer the solution to a smaller sterile tube.",
    "NOTE: During the transplantation procedure, all the materials (pipette tips, tubes, capillary, etc.) should be pre-cooled to avoid gel solidification. Thaw the basement membrane matrix gel on ice for 30 min before its use.\nCollect the cell suspension into a cold glass capillary connected to a rubber teat for suction. Inject the cell suspension as small drops (approx. 1 µL each) by stabbing the semi-dry tissue slice at various sites.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min for the gel to solidify. Transfer the plate from the incubator back to the hood, and carefully add 2 mL of hACtx medium to the top of the insert to completely submerge the tissue.\nReplace the culture medium with fresh hACtx medium once per week.\n4. Validation\nStaining of the hACtx slices\n\t\nAt the desired time point, take out the slices from the cell culture lab, and remove them from the insert by immersing it in a Petri dish with PBS. Then, transfer the slices to staining vials using an inverted glass pipette (see the NOTE in step 1.3.5), and fix them with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4 °C.\nRinse 3x with KPBS for 15 min each time, and incubate overnight at 4 °C with permeabilization solution (0.02% BSA and 1% Triton X-100 in KPBS).\nThe next day, add blocking solution (KPBS with 0.2% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, sodium azide [1:10,000], and 10% normal donkey serum), and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter blocking, add the primary antibodies (see Table 6 for the dilutions) diluted in the blocking solution, and incubate for 48 h at 4 °C.\nWash 3x with blocking solution without adding serum for 15 min each. Add the secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution (see Table 6 for the dilutions), and incubate for 48 h at 4 °C.",
    "Wash 3x with blocking solution without serum, and incubate for 2 h at RT in Hoechst stain diluted in permeabilization solution (1:1,000).\nWash 3x with KPBS, mount the slices on glass slides using a paintbrush, and let them dry. Finally, rinse the slides with deionized water, remove excess water, add the mounting medium, and cover with a glass coverslip. Keep the slides for at least 24 h at RT, and store them at 4 °C until imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: For antibodies labeling nuclear epitopes, perform antigen retrieval prior to permeabilization (step 4.1.2) with sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 6.0) for 2 h at 65 °C.\nWhole-cell patch-clamp\n\t\nOn the day of recording, prepare 1 L of human artificial cerebrospinal fluid (haCSF), modified to better match the human brain environment (Table 7). Similar to the cutting solution, make approximately 900 mL of the solution with all the ingredients except CaCl2 dissolved in deionized water, and bubble it with carbogen for 15 min before adding the appropriate volume of 1 M CaCl2 solution. Fill up the volumetric flask to the 1 L mark, and continue bubbling at RT for an additional 15 min before starting the recording and throughout the experiment.\nTransfer the tissue slices from the culture plate to the recording chamber on the stage of an upright microscope that is constantly perfused with bubbled haCSF at a perfusion rate of 2 mL/min and warmed to 34 °C using a bath temperature controller.\nPull glass capillaries with a pipette puller to an average resistance of 3-5 MΩ, and backfill the capillaries with K-gluconate-based internal solution (Table 8) with a freshly added 2-4 mg of biocytin for the post-hoc identification of the recorded cells. The pH and osmolarity of this internal solution are 7.2-7.3 and 285-295 mOsm, respectively.",
    "In the case of host cell recording, get a rough overview of the slice with a 4x objective, and find a healthy-looking cell to patch with a 40x objective. Then, proceed with the standard whole-cell patch clamp.\nIn the case of grafted cell recording, identify the tissue area with the grafted cells using a 4x objective and an epifluorescence filter in the blue range (460 nm) by GFP reporter expression in the graft. Then, zoom in to the located area with a 40x objective, and find a grafted cell expressing GFP for a standard whole-cell patch clamp.\nCheck the resting membrane potential (RMP) immediately after breaking into the cell, and make sure that the quality of the recording is good. Record all the parameters of interest (e.g., membrane resistance [Ri], AP parameters, sodium and potassium currents, and synaptic activity) in the whole-cell voltage or current-clamp configuration.\nAfter collecting all the necessary data, carefully retract the recording pipette without further damaging the cell so that it can be identified with post-hoc immunostaining.\nTransfer the slice to the 4% PFA solution for further fixation and staining, as described in step 4.1. Streptavidin is used to immunolabel the cells filled with biocytin during the recordings.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nANTIBODIES,Dilution,Notes\nPrimary,,\nChicken anti-GFP,1:1000,\nChicken anti-MAP2,1:1000,\nGoat anti-AiF1,1:100,\nMouse anti-MBP,1:1000,Antigen retrieval needed\nMouse anti-SC123,1:2000,\nRabbit anti-NeuN,1:1000,\nRabbit anti-Olig2,1:500,\nRabbit anti-Tmem119,1:200,\nSecondary,,\n488-conjugated AffinityPure Donkey anti-mouse IgG,1:500,\n488-conjugated AffinityPure Donkey anti-rabbit IgG,1:500,\n488-conjugated AffinityPure Donkey anti-chicken IgG,1:500,\nCy3-conjugated AffinityPure Donkey anti-chicken IgG,1:500,\nCy3-conjugated AffinityPure Donkey anti-goat IgG,1:500,\nCy3-conjugated AffinityPure Donkey anti-mouse IgG,1:500,\nAlexa fluor 647-conjugated Streptavidin,1:500,\nTable 6: List of primary and secondary antibodies for immunohistochemistry.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nhaCSF,Stock concentration,Final concentration [mM],Per 1 L\nNaCl,Powder,129,7.54 g\nNaHCO3,Powder,21,1.76 g\nGlucose,Powder,10,1.80 g\nKCl,Powder,3,0.22 g\nNaH2PO4,Powder,1.25,0.17 g\nMgSO4,1 M,2,2 mL\nCaCl2,1 M,1.6,1.6 mL",
