    "Exosome production and purificationCulture human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the DMEM medium, enriched with 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 1% MEM-eagle non-essential amino acid, 0.04% heparin, and 10% exosome-free platelets lysate, for 3 days.Collect 10 ml medium per T75 flask when cells are at 80-90% confluency (3 x 106 cells/flask). Perform exosome isolation for a total of 110 ml medium using a standard differential centrifugation protocol, at 4 °C. In brief, centrifuge medium at 300 x g for 10 min. Centrifuge the supernatant at 2,000 x g for 10 min, re-centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 min, and then vacuum through a 0.22 μm filter. Centrifuge the collected supernatant at 100,000 x g for 70 min (rotor: TI-45 Beckman; 70 ml polycarbonate tubes). Wash the pellet in 70 ml PBS and centrifuge again at 100,000 x g for 70 min. Resuspend the final pellet in 200 μl sterile PBS.Exosome labeling with GNPs or PKH26Synthesize GNPsInto a single-neck round-bottom flask with stirring magnet, add 100 ml deuterium-depleted water (DDW) with a mixture of oleic acid (2.437 ml), palmitic acid (600 mg) and ethanol (15 ml, 99%).In a separate tube stir NaOH (200 mg) and DDW (30 ml) until the solution is dissolved and add into the mixture above.While stirring the solution add HAuCl4 (100 µl, 50 mg/ml), then add ascorbic acid (5 ml, 0.05 M) drop by drop, very slowly, wait additional 5 min while stirring.To the GNP solution add 15.O-(2-Carboxyethyl)-O′-(2-mercaptoethyl)heptaethylene glycol (PEG7, 2.26 x 10-3 g), followed by 1 h stirring.Achieve pH = 9 of the mixture by NaOH, and then stir for additional 1 h.Add n-hexane (80 ml), then stir the solution for 1 h.Adjust the pH to 7, using HCl solution (100 µl, 37%).",
    "In a funnel (Separatory funnel 250 ml/glass stopcock, Sigma), perform phase separation (aqueous and organic) of the mixture at room temperature (Figure 1).

Resuspend GNP-labeled MSC-Exo in 200 µl PBS.For PKH26 labeling. Label 2.8 x 1010 MSC-Exo with PKH26 dye for 5 min at 37 °C. Wash with 70 ml PBS using ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 100,000 x g, at 4 °C.
