    "1. Converting the HP DeskJet 500\nIt should be noted that this technique should work with many commercially inkjet printers. However, older printers tend to work better as they use ink cartridges with larger diameter nozzles, which do not clog as easily. In addition, older printers tend to use mechanical paper feed sensors that are easier to bypass. Printers with optical sensors can be tricked but using a small strip of paper on the far edge of the printer during each cycle, but is a bit more difficult than the mechanical system to \"trick\". The currently commercially available printers that work the best have low resolution (DPI).\nHigher resolution printers tend to clog more easily. The resolution of the HP Deskjet 500 is 300 DPI. There are many commercially available printers (HP Deskjet series and others) that have a resolution of 600 DPI. This type of printer can be used with only a small increase in nozzle clogging issues that can be alleviated using careful cleaning (section 3).\nRemove the top plastic case of the printer by unlocking several plastic clips from the bottom base of the printer and slowly lifting the top off.\nUnscrew button/display light panel from top of printer, leaving it connected to the printer's motherboard.\nClean the inside of the printer, especially the areas where the ink cartridge rests and where printing occurs.\nLocate the cables supplying power to the paper feed mechanisms and unplug them from the motherboard.\n\t\nIn the HP DeskJet 500, these are found just below the paper tray towards the left of the front.\nLocate paper detection mechanism. Bypass the mechanism by affixing a string or wire loop to serve as a manual pull handle.",
    "In the HP DeskJet 500, the paper detection mechanism is a gray plastic lever found above and behind the printing/paper feed mechanism.\nCreate a stage in front of the paper feed mechanism (where the paper would be fed from and deposited) in order to bring the desired printing slides to a level just below the cartridge print head.\n\t\nFor our experiments, the foam shipping holder for 15 mL centrifuge tubes was used with several microscope slides taped in place in the printing region to bring the final level of the slides to the desired height.\nTo maintain aseptic technique, the printer can be placed inside a standard biohazard cabinet or tabletop laminar flow hood.\nIt is important to note that modifying a commercially available ink-jet printer will usually void the printer's manufacturer warranty.\n2. Converting Stock HP Ink Cartridges (HP 26 Black ink cartridge)\nRemove the cartridge from its packaging, leaving the protective tape covering the printer contacts and print head for the time being.\nStabilize the body of the cartridge (black portion) either with a clamp or vise (simply firmly gripping the cartridge by hand usually worked as well), leaving the green top clear of any obstacle.\nUsing pliers or an adjustable wrench, grasp the green top of the cartridge and twist back and forth several times until it breaks free.\n\t\nThis should not take much force, but the top is no longer needed, so it is okay if it breaks when removing it.\nUsing screwdrivers, pry off the clear plastic piece now exposed.\n\t\nAgain, this should not take much force, but it will not be needed, so it is okay if it breaks during removal.\nEmpty any remaining from the reservoir.\nRemove the plastic protective tape covering the printer contacts and print head.",
    "Thoroughly flush the reservoirs with water.\n\t\nUse a pipette or syringe to push water through the channels.\nWater will likely leak from the print head during this process; this is acceptable, and does not cause any damage to the functionality of the cartridge.\nWhen the water runs clear, allow the cartridge to dry.\n3. Cleaning Ink Cartridge\nIn order to maintain a clean printing environment, the ink cartridge should be cleaned before and after use.\n\t\nThis also helps with avoiding crystallization of salts and other biological material in the cartridge that could cause blockages.\nFully submerge the cartridge in a beaker full of de-ionized water, and sonicate for 15 minutes before and after printing.\nAfter sonication, remove the cartridge from the water, and shake out excess water.\nSpray 70% ethanol into the cartridge to create a more aseptic environment.\n\t\nEnsure that the ethanol has dried before adding the bioink printing solution.\n4. Making Cell Suspension - \"Bioink\"\nCulture cells until ready to passage.\n\t\nFor 3T3 fibroblasts: Seed cells on T-75 flasks at approximately 1.3x104 cells/cm2 in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Culture cells for two days in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nMake fluorescent g-actin stock solution at concentration 50 μg/ml in Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS).\nPassage cells.\n\t\nFor 3T3 fibroblasts: Remove media from flask and rinse twice with PBS. Cover cells with 5 ml 0.25% Trypsin+EDTA and incubate for 5 mins.\nAdd 5 ml of fresh medium and pipette the cell suspension into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate spent medium.\nResuspend the cells in PBS with fluorescent g-actin stock solution to create bioink.",
    "Bioink should have a final concentration of g-actin of 10 μg/ml and a cell concentration of 1x105 cell/ml. This concentration has been optimized to limit amount of cells per drop and clogging of the printer head.8\nNote that 250 μl of bioink prints three cover slips with the pattern shown in Figure 2.\n5. Bioprinting\nPower on and let the printer warm up.\nPlace desired printing surface (here, we use 22 mm x 22 mm coverslips) on the center of the stage prepared in step 1.6.\nCreate a printing pattern file.\n\t\nOpen Microsoft Word (or any other drawing software), and draw the desired pattern.\nPick a desired print pattern for cell printing in the premade file.\nLoad the prepared cartridge with desired cell suspension.\n\t\nPipette suspension into the small circular well at the bottom of cartridge compartment. Use approximately 100-120 μl of solution. The printed drop size is around 130 picoliters.8\nPrint the file with the HP Deskjet 500 Printer.\n\t\nFor best results, print smaller patterns multiple times (5), by changing the amount of copies desired in the word processing program.\nPrinter will warm up again, then cartridge will move to the \"ready position\".\nWhen cartridge moves into the ready position (slightly to the left of the ink drip well below and stays there), pull up on the paper feed mechanism wire, and printing should commence.\n\t\nFor multiple copies of the printing, the paper feed mechanism will have to be released after every cycle or page printed. The cartridge will then return to the \"ready\" position, and the paper feed mechanism wire should be raised again.\nThe printer will print onto the coverslip placed on the center of the printing stage in step 5.2 (see Figure 2).\n6. Representative Results",
    "The representative results of the entire conversion process of a standard, off-the-shelf HP Deskjet 500, standard HP 26 series cartridges will create a printer with the capability of printing cell solutions for many types of analysis as stated before. The completed printer after conversion is shown in Figure 3, with a printing stage to place the microscope cover slip onto. The printer can be useful in analysis in many fields, including but not limited to: single cell mechanics, tissue engineering, gene transfection, biosensor micropatterning, and direct cell therapies. 1-10, 16-22\nIn this example, an HP Deskjet 500 printer and HP 26 series ink cartridges were modified for bioprinting. Using this printer setup with a bioink consisting of a fibroblast cell suspension in a g-actin monomer solution, cells were printed onto glass microscope coverslips. Figure 1 illustrates representative results of printed fibroblast cells, which show incorporated fluorescent actin monomers. The results were obtained in a controlled aseptic environment in which the cells were printed into customizable patterns.\nThe pattern used in this example was created in Microsoft Word (Figure 2). This pattern created a continuous line of the printing solution across the majority of the microscope slide. Figure 4 shows the straight line in which the bioink and cells are mutually deposited. It should be noted that immediately after printing, there is an increase of background fluorescence because the bioink solution, in which the cells are suspended, contains free excess fluorescent actin monomers. This background fluorescence significantly decreases after the addition of growth media on the cells (Figure 1), which washes excess monomer from the substrate.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3681/3681fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

This control is to show that monomers could not penetrate the cell membrane without membrane permeabilization by cell printing."
