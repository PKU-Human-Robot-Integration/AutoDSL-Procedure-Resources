Please refer to the GitHub repository for the latest versions.\n1. Experimental preparations\nCheck the required hardware before starting the protocol.\n\t​NOTE: The following hardware components are required: OT-2 pipettes, pipette tips, 4-in-1 tube rack set, aluminum block set, magnetic module, temperature module, 96-well 2 mL deep well plates (see Table of Materials).\n2. Mass spectrometry (MS) sample preparation with a single protein bovine serum albumin (BSA)\nOpen the NoSP3_digestion.py script in a text editor and specify the experiment-specific variables as needed in the CUSTOMIZE HERE ONLY section.\n\tNOTE: The experiment-specific variables include the number of samples and replicate; the sample concentration; the volume of reagents dithiothreitol - DTT, iodoacetamide - IAA, and trypsin; the DTT and IAA incubation time, and the starting tip for pipette P20/P50 and P300).\n\t\nOpen the Opentrons App and upload the script to the PROTOCOL tab in the Opentrons App.\n\t\tNOTE: The Opentrons App can be downloaded from Reference14 to a local computer. At the time of writing, the Opentrons P50 electronic pipette is unavailable for purchase in the Opentrons store. It has been replaced with the P20 single-channel electronic pipette compatible with the volumes specified in the protocol. Notes and instructions have been made in the script to replace the P50 pipette with the P20 pipette. Users may need to test and verify the particular pipette's compatibility with this protocol following Opentrons API instruction.\nOpen the ROBOT tab and perform robot deck calibration Calibrate Deck in the ROBOT tab following the step-by-step on-screen instructions in the Opentrons App.\n\tNOTE: This step is required only if it has not been previously implemented or the robot has recently been translocated.",

    "NOTE: The robotic pipette will dispense samples in the vertical order starting from A1 (first sample) until the last sample by default. Horizontal dispensing can be specified. Refer to15 for details. The total number of tubes that need to be prepared should equal the total number of samples (i.e., the number of biological samples multiplied by the number of technical replicates per sample).\nPrepare 1 mL of 60 mM DTT by dissolving 9.26 mg of DTT solids in mass spectrometry grade water to a total volume of 1 mL. Place the DTT in the A6 well of the 4-in-1 tube rack with the 2 mL tube holder top.\n\tCAUTION: DTT is harmful to human eyes, skin, and the respiratory system. Wear PPE and handle it under a chemical hood. Refer to the manufacturer's safety data sheet for proper procedures.\nObserve while the robot transfers an appropriate volume of ABC buffer to the sample tubes in the aluminum block.\n\tNOTE: The total volume of ABC and protein mix in each tube is 100 µL, and the volume of ABC buffer is calculated in the script (V = 100 µL minus the volume of 100 µg of protein sample).\nEnsure that the robot transfers 100 µg of BSA protein to each tube with ABC buffer.\n\tNOTE: A typical experiment may use up to 100 µg of proteins for protein digestion, i.e., 50 µL of 2.0 µg/µL for this BSA sample.",
