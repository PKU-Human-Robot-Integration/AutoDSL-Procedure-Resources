  "procedures": [
    "All procedures in this protocol were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing, in accordance with the governmental regulations of China.\n1. Construction of the Cry1 Fluorescence Reporter\nNote: Previous circadian studies using the bioluminescence system2,12,13 fuse a circadian promoter with a destabilized luciferase (dLuc) to induce rhythmic dLuc expression. To develop a fluorescence reporter, destabilized luciferase was replaced with destabilized fluorescence protein (dVenus) to induce rhythmic dVenus expression. The generation of the P(Cry1)-dVenus reporter is described below, the construct of which is currently being submitted to Addgene and will be available soon for academic use.\nAmplify the functional mouse Cry1 promoter (+328 to -1208 bp region of the Cry1 gene, transcription start site designated as ‘‘-1’’). Use the PCR enzyme (KOD Plus Neo), primers F1 and R1 (see Table 2), mouse genome as a template and the manufacturer’s PCR protocol to amplify the Cry1 promoter DNA fragment.\nAmplify intron 336 of the Cry1 gene, which is important for the circadian clock function of Cry114. Use the PCR enzyme, primers F2 and R2, mouse genome as a template and the manufacturer’s PCR protocol to amplify the intron 336 DNA fragment.\nAmplify Venus. Use the PCR enzyme, primers F3 and R3, pVENUS-N1 plasmid as a template and the manufacturer’s PCR protocol to amplify the Venus DNA fragment.\nAmplify the NLS-D2 DNA fragment. Use the PCR enzyme, primers F4 and R4, pcDNA3.3-d2eGFP plasmid as a template and the manufacturer’s PCR protocol to amplify the NLS-D2 DNA fragment.\nSynthesize DNA fragment 1 as exon 1.\nSynthesize DNA fragment 2 as the linker between intron 336 and the Venus DNA fragment.",
    "Cut the pAAV-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-HGHpA vector plasmid with the MluI and EcoRI enzymes. Use the Gel Extraction Kit to purify the larger DNA fragment. Use the manufacturer’s protocol.\nUsing a Gibson assembly mix and its standard protocol, assemble all of the DNA fragments together to produce the pAAV-P(Cry1)-intron336-Venus-NLS-D2-WPRE-HGHpA reporter. Use the manufacturer’s protocol.\n2. Production of Adeno-associated Virus15\nPrepare the following plasmid DNA stocks: 31.25 µg of pRV1, 31.25 µg of pH21, 125 µg of pFdelta6, and 62.5 µg of pAAV-P(Cry1)-intron336-Venus-NLS- D2-WPRE-HGHpA.\nPrepare five 15 cm dishes of 293T cells and wait until the cells become 90% confluent.\nTransfect the plasmids into the 297T cells following the transfection reagent protocol. For each dish, use 6.25 µg of pRV1, 6.25 µg of pH21, 25 µg of pFdelta6, 12.5 µg of pAAV-P(Cry1)-intron336-Venus-NLS-D2-WPRE-HGHpA, and 120 µL of transfection reagent.\n72 h after transfection, detach the cells from each plate using a pipette gun; harvest the cells into two 50 mL tubes.\nPellet the cells at 800 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant. Wash the cells by placing 20 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into each tube; pellet the cells at 800 x g for 10 min, and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend pellets in 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0; use 25 mL of solution/tube. Add 1.25 mL of freshly prepared 10% sodium deoxycholate (in dH2O) to each tube. Add benzonase nuclease to a final concentration of 50 units per mL, and mix thoroughly. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nRemove cellular debris by centrifuging at 3000 x g for 15 min. Further ensure that all debris has been removed by pushing the mixture through a 0.45 μm syringe filter; this step will help prevent blocking of heparin columns.",
    "Set up the heparin columns using a peristaltic pump; set the flow rate to 1 mL/min, ensuring that no air bubbles are introduced into the columns.\nEquilibrate the columns with 10 mL of a 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0. Add the solution containing the virus to each column. Wash the columns with 20 mL of a 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0. Then, using a 5 mL syringe, wash the columns with 1 mL of a 200 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris solution pH 8.0, followed by 1 mL of a 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0.\nUse a 5 mL syringe to elute the virus with 3 mL of a 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0, followed by 4 mL of a 450 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0, and finally by a 3 mL of a 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0. Collect the extracted materials.\nFor recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) concentration, load the extracted materials, 4 mL at a time, into centrifugal filter units with a 100,000 molecular weight cutoff. Centrifuge each 4-mL sample at 2000 x g for 5 min at room temperature, discarding the flow-through.\nWhen all extracted materials have been run through the centrifugal filter units, add 4 mL of PBS and centrifuge the mixture into approximately 250 μL. Remove rAAVs (viral titer should be about 2 - 8 x 1012 viral particles per mL) from the centrifugal filter units, aliquot and store at -80 °C until use. At this stage, the virus can be stored for several months.\n3. rAAV Injection and Optic Fiber Insertion into the Adult Mouse SCN\nInjection of circadian fluorescence reporter-carrying rAAVs into the SCN",
    "Load 5 µL of rAAV (the virus titer is about 2 - 8 x 1012 virus particles per mL) into a micro-syringe.\nAnesthetize an adult mouse (2- to 5-month-old, C57BL/6 background) with Nembutal (80 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Check for sufficient depth of anesthesia by the lack of a toe-pinch response.\nUse scissors to remove fur from the head of the mouse and then mount the mouse into a stereotaxic apparatus. Provide a heat source to anesthetized animals via a circulating hot water blanket or another heating device.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, use depilatory cream or electric hair clippers to remove the fur.\nClean the surgical site with the appropriate disinfecting agents. For example, this could include sterile water or alcohol and iodine, betadine, or dilute chlorhexidine in alternating scrubs. Repeat at least 3 times. Drape the surgical site.\n Use the scissors to make an incision in the scalp and expose the skull.\nAdjust the stereotaxic apparatus so that bregma and lambda are in the same horizontal plane; make two symmetrical points of bregma in the same horizontal plane.\nUse a sterile cotton swab soaked in 4% H2O2/H2O to corrode the brain periosteum. Then use a clean, sterile cotton swab to clear and dry the surface of the skull.\nUsing a micro drill, make a hole about 1 mm in diameter 0.46 mm posterior and 0.25 mm lateral to bregma.\nfiUse a clean cotton sterile swab with physiological saline solution to clear bone fragments from the exposed surface of the brain.\nInsert a micro-syringe into the brain, ensuring that the tip of the micro-syringe is 0.46 mm posterior and 0.25 mm lateral to bregma, and 5.7 mm deep from the surface of the skull.",
    "Inject 500 nL of rAAV (50 nL min-1) into the SCN, leaving the micro-syringe in place for 10 min after the injection to ensure complete diffusion of rAAV.\nSlowly withdraw the micro-syringe.\nInsert the optical fiber into the SCN area.\n\t\nUsing an optical fiber knife, cut a fiber 17-mm in length, making sure that each side of the optic fiber is smooth.\nInsert the optic fiber into the ceramic ferrule and fix the optic fiber to a ceramic ferrule with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (AB glue), ensuring that the surfaces of the optical fiber and ceramic ferrule are flush.\nClean the fiber with a cold sterilant solution or ethylene oxide.\nAfter rAAV injection (step 3.1.11), insert the ceramic ferrule-containing optic fiber into the SCN.\nFix the ceramic ferrule and optical fiber onto the skull using dental resin and allow to dry.\nSmear the surface of the dental resin with back nail polish. Repeat the procedures outlined in 3.1.2 to 3.2.5, omitting the actual injection of rAAV for control.\nPost-surgical care\n\t\nProvide mice with post-operative analgesics, such as buprenorphine 2 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously, twice a day.\nPlace mice in a recovery cage while they come out of anesthesia.\nHouse mice individually under a 12 h light/dark condition (light intensity ~100 lux at the bottom of the cage) with food/water available ad libitum. Eight days should be allotted before further experimentation to allow for sufficient recovery time and to ensure optimal fluorescence reporter expression.\n4. In vivo Fluorescence Signal Monitoring and Data Collection\nEight days after surgery, connect the fiber on the mouse head with the fluorescence signal monitor (e.g., Gene Observer). Check the fluorescence signal in the SCN of control mice to establish the background signal. Conduct the observation and measurement of this signal using fluorescence signal monitor.",
    "Evaluate the fluorescence signal of experimental mouse with the same operation of the control mouse. Exclude mice which have received the viral vector but which only display the background signal from analysis, as this likely indicates that the tip of the optic fiber has missed the SCN. After these initial measures, return mice to their home cages for another 3 weeks to allow the fluorescence signal to stabilize.\nAfter 3 weeks, connect the mice with the fluorescence signal monitor. Measure the fluorescence for 15 s every 10 min, at a frequency of 100 Hz. During these measurements, the mice are freely moving in their cages with food/water available ad libitum. Use a light intensity at the bottom of the cage of ~100 lux, and a the laser power at the tip of the optic fiber between 15 - 20 µW.\nAfter the completion of all recordings, perfuse mice with 4% paraformaldehyde, and remove and slice the brains to check placement of the optic fiber. Exclude mice from analysis if the optic fiber tip is not correctly implanted in the SCN.\n5. Data Analysis and Presentation\nMeasure fluorescence signal every 10 min for 15 s, at a frequency of 100 Hz, to yield 1500 data points. The average of these 1500 points translates to the fluorescence signal at any given time point. Plotting multiple averages over time produces a signal-to-time curve which corresponds to the transcriptional rhythm of Cry1 under a control light condition in the SCN of freely moving mice.\nSubscription Required.
