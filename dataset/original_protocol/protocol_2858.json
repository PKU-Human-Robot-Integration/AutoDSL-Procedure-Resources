However, the retrovirus can only infect cells actively dividing. Thus, it is important to ensure the quality of the starting cardiac fibroblast population to ensure the success of the protocol (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nOn day 0, thaw a new vial of 293T cells and seed them such that they will be sub-confluent on day 2.\nOn day 2, subpassage and reseed the 293T cells on 10cm dishes so that they will be 70% confluent on day 3.\nOn day 3, coat 10cm tissue culture dishes with 1 × poly-L-lysine by pipetting 5 mL of poly-L-lysine solution into each dish and incubate for 30 min in 37°C incubator. Determine the number of dishes needed for transfection on day 4 based on your experiment.\nPrewarm 293T culture medium and 0.05% Trypsin in 37°C water bath for 15 min.\nRetrieve the 293T cells from the incubator. For each dish, aspirate the culture medium, and gently replace with 1× DPBS.\nAspirate DPBS from each dish. Pipette 3mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA into each dish.\nIncubate dish(s) in 37°C incubator 5 min.\nObserve the dish under the microscope to ensure sufficient dissociation of cells from the plate surface.\nPipette 3 mL of warm 293T medium into each dish.\nCollect cell suspension from the dish(s) into a conical tube.\nCentrifuge conical at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWhile the conical is centrifuging, retrieve the poly-L-lysine-coated dish(s) from the incubator.\nAspirate the poly-L-lysin solution as much as possible.\nAfter centrifugation, resuspend 293T cells in warm 293T medium and count the cell number using a hemocytometer.",
    "Adjust the cell suspension to 4 × 105 cells/mL using warm 293T medium and seed 10 mL of the cell suspension onto the poly-L-lysin-coated dish(s).\nOn day 4, pre-warm viral transfection medium to room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nDetermine the number of dishes needed for each virus based on your experiment design. For each 10cm dish being transfected, prepare the below listed solutions in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2566_9.csv\nBriefly vortex Trans-IT before usage.\nAdd 50 μL of Trans-IT to each microfuge tube of plasmid/Opti-MEM mix. Immediately after adding Trans-IT to a tube, mix that microfuge tube by flicking it multiple times.\nIncubate tubes for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) to allow for Trans-IT/DNA complexes to self-assemble. Do not incubate for longer than 20 min.\nAdd each 850 μL of Trans-IT/plasmid mix to an individual 10cm 293T dish drop-wise to different areas of the well. Gently swirl the dishes in back and forth and side-to-side motion to ensure even distribution of the transfection mixture.\nIncubate the dishes in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 16–18 h.\nCritical: Changing medium after 18 h post-transfection could lead to reduced virus titer.\nReplace the medium with pre-warmed 293T medium.\n48 h post-transfection, collect retroviral containing medium from each 10cm dishes to 50 mL conical tube(s). Store at 4°C.\nReplace the collected medium with pre-warmed 293T medium, 8mL per dish. Return dish(s) to the incubator.\n72 h post-transfection, collect retroviral-containing medium from each 10cm dish and add to the same 50 mL tube from the 48-h collection.\nCentrifuge the virus supernatant at 3,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min to precipitate cell debris.\nUsing a sterile disposable syringe, filter the centrifuged virus supernatant through a 0.45 μm pore size cellulose acetate filter.\nTransfer the filtered virus supernatant to open-top polypropylene tubes for ultracentrifuge.",
    "Balance the tubes using by adding additional medium to the tubes.\nCentrifuge the virus supernatant with SW-28 adapter at 23,000 × g, 4°C for 1.5 h.\nAfter the centrifuging, remove all traces of liquid by aspiration.\nAdd 200 μL of cold, sterile DMEM into the tube and sit it on ice for 1 h.\nResuspend each viral pellet per tube by pipetting. The virus is now ready for use.\nPause point: If not used fresh, the virus can be aliquoted for single use and stored at −80°C for at least 1 month. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles, as this will substantially reduce the viral titer and the reprogramming efficiency.\nGeneration of mouse cardiac fibroblast\nTiming: 5 h\nPrimary cardiac fibroblasts are the target cell type for direct cardiac reprogramming. In this protocol, we isolate neonatal mouse cardiac fibroblast from neonatal mouse hearts. We also had success with reprogramming both mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using Ascl1 and Mef2c and fibroblasts derived from H9 human embryonic stem cells (H9Fs) using human ASCL1, MEF2C, and miR133.\nFor each of 40 neonatal mouse hearts or less, bring 5 mL of 10× collagenase II solution to room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nDetermine the number of 24-well plates for your experiment. Coat plates with 0.1% gelatin solution for seeding of fibroblasts in final step. Place plates in incubator at 37°C 5% CO2.\nDissect hearts out of P0-P3 mice and place them in a 10cm dish on ice with 1× DPBS.\nWash the hearts once with chilled DPBS to remove blood.\nMince the hearts into small pieces with a razor blade in the Biosafety Cabinet.\nCritical: Mincing the heart into too small pieces will lead to low isolation efficiency. Mincing one heart to 8–10 pieces is sufficient.",
    "If less than 40 hearts, transfer the minced hearts into a 15 mL conical tube with 10 mL pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin-EDT and incubate at 37°C water bath for 15 min.\nCritical: If more than 40 hearts are used, separate them into equal portions with less than 40 hearts per portion and process them as separate tubes.\nDuring the 15-min incubation, prepare 1× collagenase II solution by diluting the 10× stock with HBSS and filtering through 0.45 μm syringe filter.\nEquilibrate the 1× collagenase solution to 37°C in the water bath.\nAfter 15 min of incubation, aspirate the trypsin supernatant without disturbing the sediments.\nAdd 10 mL of warm collagenase II to each tube.\nVortex the tube(s) for 1 min at 40% of the vortexer power.\nIncubate the tube(s) in 37°C water bath for 7 min.\nVortex the tube(s) for 1 min at 40% of the vortexer power.\nLeave the tube upright and undisturbed for 1 min to allow the tissue pieces settle down.\nCollect the supernatant from each tube into a tube containing cold 5mL mouse fibroblast medium. Store the cell supernatant on ice.\nRepeat the previous six steps another for a total of 3–4 cell collections.\nCritical: If, after 4 collagenase II digestions, the cell supernatant still appears to be cloudy, you can perform additional tissue digestion and cell collection cycles.\nCombine all the cell collections and filter through a 40 μm nylon cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g, 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g, 5 min at 4°C.\nFor each portion of 40 hearts or less, prepare the following of antibody mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2566_10.csv",
    "Aspirate supernatant from cell pellet and resuspend in antibody mix. Incubate the cell-antibody mix at 4°C for 30 min with constant gentle mixing.\nAdd 10 mL of the MACS buffer to resuspend the cell and spin at 200 × g for 5 min, 4°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2566_11.csv\nFor each portion of 40 hearts or less, prepare one portion microbeads mix.\nAspirate supernatant from cell pellet and resuspend in microbeads mix. Incubate the cell-beads mix at 4°C for 30 min with constant gentle mixing.\nAdd 10 mL of the MACS buffer to resuspend the cell and spin at 200 × g for 5 min, 4°C.\nDuring centrifugation, set up a MACS separator in the biosafety cabinet and insert a LS column to the magnetic holder.\nAdd 3 mL MACS buffer to the LS column to equilibrate it.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL MACS buffer.\nPipette the cell suspension onto the equilibrated column and allow it to pass through the column by gravity.\nWash the column 2 times with 1 mL MACS buffer.\nTake the LS column off the separator and elute the cells with 5 mL of MACS buffer using the plunger provided with the column.\nSpin at 200 × g for 5min, 4°C.\nResuspend the cell in 5 mL FB medium and count the cell number with a hemocytometer.\nCritical: Use 0.4% Trypan blue solution to ensure counting of live cells, as cell viability can vary by batch.\nSeed 4 × 103 cells per well in the gelatin-coated 24-well plates. Place the plates in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for at least 8 h.\nNote: Mouse cardiac fibroblasts are seeded for reprogramming experiments immediately after isolation. Avoid freezing the isolated cells.\nCardiac reprogramming\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "The combination of Ascl1 and Mef2c is a minimal cocktail for inducing cardiac reprogramming from cardiac fibroblasts, and it does so with high efficiency. On Day 12 of the reprogramming, the reprogrammed cells show cardiomyocyte-like characteristics. These cells can be further cultured to improve the maturity of the reprogramming iCM.\nObserve the fibroblasts seeded yesterday under a microscope to ensure most of the cells survived and are attached to the plate.\nOn day 0, prepare infection medium for each well of seeded cardiac fibroblasts according to the following:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2566_12.csv\nAspirate the old medium from the cardiac fibroblasts and replace with infection medium. Incubate for 24 h in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nOn day 1, prepare new infection medium as above. Aspirate the old infection medium and replace with the new infection medium. Incubate for 24 h in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nOn day 2, aspirate the infection medium and replace with 500 μL/well of iCM medium supplemented with 1 μg/mL of puromycin.\nIncubate the cells for two days to select cells that have been infected with retrovirus.\nOn day 4, replace the iCM/puromycin medium with fresh iCM medium without puromycin.\nCulture the cells for another 8 days in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Change medium every other day.\nOn day 12, collect the reprogrammed cells for characterization of iCM phenotype and efficiency by immunostaining (anti-cTnT, MA5-12960, 1:500; anti- αActinin, ab68167, 1:500).\nOptional: The reprogrammed cells can be cultured in the iCM maturation medium for another 4 weeks for characterization of beating."
