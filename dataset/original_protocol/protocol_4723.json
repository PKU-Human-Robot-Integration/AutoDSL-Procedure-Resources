    "U. maydis teliospores can potentially be produced in any above ground, actively growing tissues. However, for research purposes two plant stages will be described, each with its particular advantages. These commonly used stages are:Seedlings (7 days old). Advantages: Seedlings are convenient for speed and for space conservation.Maturing ears. Advantages: Ears have the advantage of producing copious numbers of teliospores and, although the plants must be older, the time from inoculation to spore production period is similar to that of seedlings.Ear inoculation should be performed before pollination occurs; removing tassels may improve gall yield (Snetselaar et al., 2001).Plant inoculation for U. maydis teliospore productionStreak U. maydis compatible mating strains onto fresh potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates (from older PDA plates or glycerol stocks) and incubate at 30 °C until individual colonies appear (Figure 1). Pick a single colony of compatible mating strains into separate test tubes containing 5 ml of potato dextrose broth (PDB) and grow overnight in a rotary shaker set at 250 rpm and 30 °C. Carefully label each tube with the corresponding mating type strain growing in each tube. PDA U. maydis plates can be stored sealed with parafilm and upside down at 4 °C for 2-3 weeks. Re-streak onto fresh PDA plates prior to future use.Make 1/100 dilutions of the overnight cultures and estimate cell concentrations using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter. U. maydis cells are cigar-shaped and measure between 2 and 4 μm in width and 20 and 30 μm in length.Prepare 50 ml of cell suspension as follows. Dilute and combine each strain to a final concentration of 106 cells/ml using sdH2O. This mixture will be used to inoculate plants and it is important that compatible U. maydis strains are in roughly equal proportions in the cell mixture to achieve optimal teliospore yield.",
    "Cell mixtures are stable for inoculations for at least several hours.Inoculation of maize plantsMaize seedling inoculation (7 days old). One effective injection site per seedling should suffice. However, there is frequently a need to move the needle if injection flow is inhibited. Inoculate each seedling with the cell mixture using a 3 ml disposable plastic sterile syringe fitted with a 27 gauge needle. Insert the needle about half the diameter (ca. 2.5 mm) into the pseudo-stem (the internal cavity formed by growing leaves) about 1 cm above the soil line (Figure 2). Inject enough mixture until the liquid can be observed to rise to the top of the area where leaves begin to expand (between 1-2 ml of cell suspension).Maize ear inoculation. Grow ‘Tom Thumb’ maize plants in the greenhouse for approximately 40 days or until the ears begin to develop. Before inoculation, cut silks with scissors to top of ear husks and check young ear (by feeling the exterior of the ears to check if grains are present) to ensure that grain filling had not yet taken place. Using a 10 ml hypodermic syringe with a 22 gauge needle inject cell suspension at multiple locations in the ear until liquid is observed to overflow (3-10 ml) from the point where the silks were cut. Injecting liquid into an ear often requires more force than seedlings; move the needle around to find a suitable spot for efficient injections.For all inoculated tissues, allow galls to develop and teliospores to form. This step will take about 3-4 weeks for either tissue (Figure 3).Harvest fully developed darkly pigmented galls (coloration is from the teliospores).Teliospores can be extracted immediately, or alternatively galls can be let to dry in a paper bag at room temperature for later extractions.",
    "Teliospore isolationGrind and sterilize gall tissue [4-5 small or 1 large fresh or dried gall(s)] in a mortar containing 30 ml 1% CuSO4. Watch for the release of black teliospores during grinding. Teliospores cell walls are extremely tough and therefore will not be damaged during the grinding process.Filter the macerated tissue through several layers of sterile cheesecloth into a sterile 50 ml conical tube. Incubate flow-through for 30 min at room temperature to allow antibacterial action of CuSO4.Pellet teliospores in centrifuge set at 4,000 x g for 5 min.Resuspend the pellet in 50 ml sdH2O.Repeat steps B3 through B4 once more.Resuspend the washed teliospore pellet in 1 ml sdH2O.Spread roughly 50-150 μl of the spore suspension onto two PDA plates amended with 50 μg/ml each of streptomycin and ampicillin (PDA-Strep-Amp).Incubate overnight at 30 °C.When microcolonies are visible (<0.5 mm diameter) under a stereo microscope, add 1 ml of sdH2O to the plate. Slide a sterilized bent glass rod across the plate to suspend microcolony cells. Pipette the sporidial (cell) suspension into a sterile microfuge tube.Plate dilutions (10-1, 10-2, 10-3 dilutions work well) onto fresh PDA-Strep-Amp plates.Pick progeny colonies onto fresh plates and analyze for the segregation of the traits of interest.Mating assayThe plate mating assay is used during isolation of strains from teliospores to establish the mating type of progeny strains (Andrews et al., 2000). U. maydis has a tetrapolar mating system governed by two independently assorting loci: a and b (Bölker et al., 2012). Mating and further filamentous development require strains to differ at both mating type loci. This assay is also used to test the ability of mutant strains to mate.Pick genetically pure progeny colonies isolated from teliospores (described above) into 5 ml PDB and grow overnight as described above.Grow tester U.",
    "maydis strains of known mating type (e.g. a1b1; a2b1; a1b2; a2b2).Spotting strains onto charcoal plate.Tester strains are spotted first. For each tester spot 3-5 μl onto charcoal forming a column (Figure 4a).Let inoculum droplets dry (in a laminar flow hood).On top of each tester strain, spot 3-5 μl of each of the progeny strains to be tested (as shown in Figure 4a).Incubate plates in the dark at room temperature for 1-2 days. Positive mating events are evidenced by white fuzzy growth due to the development of short filaments indicative of the formation of the dikaryon after mating (Figure 4b). Occasionally, mutants are isolated which lose their potential to complete part or all of the mating process on charcoal plates. In those cases, confrontation (Snetselaar et al., 1996; Gold et al., 1997) and cytoduction assays (Trueheart and Herskowitz, 1992; Mayorga and Gold, 1999) can be used to test the ability of these strains to undergo the first stages of mating response."
