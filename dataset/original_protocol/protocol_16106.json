    "This protocol describes a method for the transient production of fluorescent proteins in tobacco leaf epidermal cells before FRET-FLIM data acquisition. First, cell suspensions of Agrobacteria containing the genes of interest fused to fluorescence proteins (eGFP or mRFP) are generated. The cells are suspended in infiltration buffer, which contains the necessary components to promote plant tissue infection by Agrobacteria. The suspensions are introduced into tobacco leaves via infiltration. Infiltrated plants are incubated for 48 to 72 hr in standard tobacco growth conditions to allow protein expression. These leaf sections transiently expressing the proteins can be used for several applications, including FRET-FLIM.\nMaterials\nAgrobacteria cultures transformed with proteins of interest (e.g., eGFP and mRFP)\nYeast extract beef (YEB) medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-rec-0001])\nAppropriate antibiotics\nInfiltration buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-rec-0002])\n4- to 6-week-old Nicotiana tabacum or N. benthamiana plants\n15-ml conical tubes (e.g., Thermo Fisher, cat. no 11889640)\n28°C shaking incubator\n2-ml microcentrifuge tubes with safe lock (e.g., Eppendorf, cat. no. 0030121880)\nMicrocentrifuge (e.g., Sigma 1-14 or equivalent)\nMicrovolume spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop 2000 or equivalent)\n1-ml syringe, sterile (without needle)\nPlant growth chamber\nCAUTION: The bacteria used and the plants after infiltration are genetically modified (GM) material and have to be handled and disposed of according to GM regulations.\nPreparation of Agrobacteria cultures\n1. Grow 3 ml overnight Agrobacteria cultures (e.g., RTN6-GFP; Kriechbaumer et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-bib-0019]) in 15-ml conical tubes at 28°C with shaking at 200 rpm in YEB medium with the appropriate antibiotics encoded in the vector for constructs to be tested.\nAgrobacteria are usually transformed with one construct at a time; expression of multiple constructs in the same leaf can be achieved by mixing the appropriate Agrobacteria cultures.",
    "Antibiotics depend on the bacterial strain and the vectors used, but commonly used antibiotics are 25 mg/L rifampicin combined with 50 mg/L kanamycin or 50 mg/L spectinomycin. Store antibiotics for up to 1 week at 4°C or up to 12 months at –20°C for long-term storage.\n2. Transfer 1 ml of each culture into separate labeled 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n3. Centrifuge 5 min at 2500 × g, room temperature, and remove supernatant.\n4. Add 1 ml infiltration buffer, and gently resuspend pellet by pipetting, avoiding creating bubbles.\n5. Centrifuge 5 min at 2500 × g, room temperature, and remove supernatant.\n6. Resuspend pellet in 1 ml infiltration buffer.\n7. Measure optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer.\n8. Prepare various construct mixes (i.e., eGFP and mRFP protein fusion construct) in individual tubes, and dilute resuspension with infiltration medium until the required OD600 is reached.\nThe optimum OD600 will vary according to the construct; thus different ODs have to be tested until sufficient expression levels are achieved. An OD600 of 0.1 is a good place to start with a new construct. After this, lower ODs (e.g., 0.03) or higher ODs (e.g., 0.2 to 0.3) can be tested.\nTobacco leaf infiltration\n9. For leaf infiltration, take up cells in a 1-ml sterile syringe (without needle).\n10. Using a 100-μl pipette tip, punch a small hole on the abaxial side of the tobacco leaf, avoiding leaf veins.\n11. Place syringe tip firmly against the underside of the leaf (abaxial) covering the hole, and press plunger down gently while exerting pressure against the other side of the leaf (adaxial) with your finger.\nThe liquid will diffuse throughout the mesophyll air space (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0a6c1168-03e9-434d-8f79-4f55a21e05e5/cpz1598-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

(B) The area filled with the Agrobacterium suspension is marked with a permanent pen. (C) Example confocal image for PmoA protein expression (green). Correct localization is shown by overlap with the endoplasmic reticulum marker mRFP-HDEL (magenta; Brandizzi et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-bib-0004]). Scale bars = 10 µm. PmoA, subunit A of the particulate methane monooxygenase enzyme complex.\n12. Repeat for all constructs in at least two tobacco plants to allow for biological replicates.\n13. Mark leaf upper epidermis with a permanent marker to keep track of transformation sites (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0002]).\nBe aware that some marker ink will fluoresce on laser microscopes, so limit use of the permanent marker to the edge of the infiltrated region.\n14. Place infiltrated plants back into growth conditions (21°C; 14 hr light, 10 hr dark; light intensity 120 μmol/m2/s; 50% humidity) for at least 30 hr to allow transformation and gene expression to happen.\nThis growth period depends on the construct and protein longevity, but 40 to 48 hr are mostly required before fluorescence can be observed. Common starting points for testing are 48 and 72 hr after infiltration. Expression can be checked by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0002]).\nExample data are shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0002].",
    "To perform FRET-FLIM experiments, a section (∼5 mm2) of transformed leaf expressing the proteins of interest is securely mounted onto a standard microscope slide with a coverslip and fastened down firmly with surgical tape. It is important to make sure there is enough water around the sectioned leaf piece before imaging. First, the eyepiece and white light is used to bring the leaf cells into focus. Second, the laser scanning system is engaged. Once protein expression is confirmed, the FRET-FLIM system is activated. Using a pulsed light source, the same laser can be used for both confocal imaging and FLIM. Some FLIM systems use a continuous-wave laser source for confocal imaging acquisition and a different pulsed-laser source for FLIM acquisition. As of now, the FLIM software is different from the FLIM acquisition software as the two techniques are generally provided by two different manufacturers. This situation is slowly changing so that FLIM is becoming embedded in the same software such as within the Leica Falcon and Tau instruments that provide confocal imaging and FLIM simultaneously. The acquisition of FLIM images requires a fast timing device on the picosecond time scale. This is provided by the TCSPC device. A sensitive detector will measure the time between activation of the donor fluorophore and arrival of the emitted photon at the other detector. This process is repeated rapidly (MHz) during the pixel dwell time and over a period of ∼10 to 120 s depending on the brightness of the sample under observation. This is one of the drawbacks of FRET and FLIM in general, where very weakly emitting samples need tens of seconds for acquisition, and therefore any fast dynamics are lost.",
    "The measurements are used to build a FLIM image, which can be interrogated for evidence of interaction between donor and acceptor molecules (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0003]). Control datasets measuring the fluorescence lifetime determined when only a donor but no acceptor is present are compared with combinations of donor and acceptor. This ensures the collection of statistically significant data for interactions and can also inform membrane topology of the tested proteins.",

A and E display the FRET-FLIM data, and the pseudocolored lifetime maps show the lifetime values for each point within the region of interest, whereas the distribution of lifetimes across the entire image is shown in B and F, with blue shades representing longer eGFP fluorescence lifetimes than green ones. C and G display representative decay curves of a single point with an optimal single exponential fit, where χ2 values from 0.9 to 1.2 were considered an excellent fit to the data points (binning factor of 2). D and H are the respective confocal images for the analysis showing the eGFP construct in green and the mRFP construct in red. This example of FRET-FLIM analysis shows that PmoA-eGFP interacts with mRFP-PmoC because the lifetime values for the eGFP/mRFP fusion pair (G; 2.2 ± 0.01 ns) are lower than those for the eGFP fusion alone (D; 2.4 ± 0.02 ns). eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FRET-FLIM, Förster resonance energy transfer with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; PmoA, subunit A of the particulate methane monooxygenase enzyme complex; PmoC, subunit C of the particulate methane monooxygenase enzyme complex.\nMaterials\nInfiltrated tobacco leaves (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-prot-0001])\nScalpel\nMicroscope slides and coverslips\nTwo-channel confocal and one- or two-channel FLIM setup (e.g., Nikon TE2000-U inverted microscope with modified Nikon EC2 confocal scanning system) with the following:\n               \nMode-locked titanium sapphire laser (e.g., Coherent Lasers, Mira)\nSolid-state, continuous-wave, 532-nm laser (e.g., Coherent Lasers, Verdi V18)\nHigh–numerical aperture objective (e.g., Nikon VC series)\nBG39 filter (e.g., Comar)\n633-nm interference filter\nTCSPC card (e.g., Becker and Hickl SPC 830 or SPC150 or equivalent)",
    "FLIM image analysis software (e.g., Becker and Hickl SPCImage NG Data Analysis software, v5.1, or the latest version)\nCAUTION: The detectors for FLIM are extremely sensitive, and care must be taken not to expose them to too much light. In our laboratory, all lights are switched off (using a switch on a remote control key fob), except for emergency lighting and luminescent guide strips for safety. The use of a remote light switch minimizes the user's movements in the darkened room.\nFLIM data acquisition\n1. With a scalpel, cut out samples of infiltrated tobacco leaves (∼5 mm2 leaf disc, avoiding veins in the tobacco leaf and the injection hole). Place sample on a microscope slide, and cover with a coverslip. Place slide on a confocal/multiphoton FRET-FLIM microscope system with the abaxial side facing the objective to collect confocal and FRET-FLIM data (Schoberer & Botchway, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-bib-0023]).\nFor the experiments here, a two-photon microscope built around a Nikon TE2000-U inverted microscope is used with a modified Nikon EC2 confocal scanning system to enable near-infrared laser wavelength (900 to 950 nm) for FLIM.\n2. Set laser light at a wavelength of 920 nm using a mode-locked titanium sapphire laser, with 200-fs pulses at 76 MHz, pumped by a solid-state continuous wave 532-nm laser.\n3. To illuminate specimens on the microscope stage, focus laser beam to a diffraction-limited spot using a high–numerical aperture (1.2) objective such as water-immersion objective.\n4. Collect fluorescence emission without pinhole (non-descan), bypassing the scanning system but instead passing through a BG39 filter to block the near-infrared laser light.\n5. Generate raw time-correlated single-photon data by using a TCSPC PC module SPC830. Analyze pixel-by-pixel TCSPC data to generate a FLIM image or map.",
    "Before FLIM data collection, eGFP and mRFP expression levels in the plant samples within the region of interest should be confirmed using a microscope with excitation at 488 and 543 nm, respectively (e.g., Nikon EC2 confocal microscope); emission for GFP and mRFP are at 520 ± 30 nm and 620 ± 40 nm, respectively.\n6. Use a 633-nm interference filter to reduce chlorophyll autofluorescence that will otherwise strongly obscure the mRFP and eGFP emissions.\nFLIM data analysis\n7. Analyze data by obtaining excited-state lifetime values on a region of interest on the nucleus, and make calculations using analysis software.\n8. Generate range of lifetime values (for each pixel) within a region of interest, and display as a distribution curve.\n9. Fit decay data to a single exponential parameter as f(t) = αε−τ/τ. To allow for optimal fit, consider only values with a χ2 between 0.9 and 1.4 for statistical analysis.\nThe intensity data provide the fluorescence decay function (f) at time t. Single-, double-, or triple-exponential analysis of the decay yields the excited-state lifetime (τ). The amplitude of the exponential components (a) defines the contribution to each lifetime component.\nχ2 describes the goodness of data fitted to the exponential function. Therefore, a value of 1 represents analysis that perfectly describes the decay data points.\n10. Produce range of lifetimes per sample by considering the median lifetime and the minimum and maximum values for one-quarter of the median lifetime values from the curve.\nThe donor fluorophore alone without a potential interaction partner is used as negative control. Proteins known to interact (e.g., AtRTN1 with AtRTN1; Kriechbaumer et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-bib-0019]; Sparkes et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-bib-0024]) can be used as positive controls.\n11. Analyze at least five cells from at least three independent biological samples (plants) per protein-protein combination.",
    "12. Take average and standard deviation of the ranges for interaction combinations and for negative and positive controls (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0004]).\nA reduction in lifetime of the donor fluorophore (eGFP) of >0.2 ns compared with the control is indicative of an existing protein-protein interaction (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0004]; Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-tbl-0001]). It is also the case that a statistically significant lifetime reduction of 0.1 ns may indicate a long-range protein-protein interaction because of either the size of the proteins and the position of the GFP/RFP chromophores or a nondirect physical interaction. Two proteins separated from each other but close enough (within 10 to 12 nm) may show a small lifetime change in donor lifetime.\nExample data are shown in Figures 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0003] and 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-fig-0004] and Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-tbl-0001].\nFor information about sample data, see Understanding Results.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3db6070f-5769-4d31-b09c-76c54d0d9ab5/cpz1598-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
    "FRET-FLIM interactions can resolve membrane topologies. (A) Schematic diagram of topology predictions for PmoC and PmoA. PmoC is predicted to feature six TMDs with both termini facing the cytosol. Predictions for PmoA differ between six and seven TMDs, and the C-terminus could therefore either face the ER lumen (top) or the cytosol (bottom).

Donor and acceptor protein constructs are listed together with the average fluorescence lifetime (in ns) for the donor fluorophore and the SD for each combination. The difference between control and test samples was calculated (Δ). It was previously reported that a reduction in excited-state lifetime of 0.2 ns is indicative of energy transfer (Stubbs et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.598#cpz1598-bib-0025]).
