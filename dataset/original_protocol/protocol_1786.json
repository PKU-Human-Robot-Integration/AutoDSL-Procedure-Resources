    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing cells for imaging\nTiming: 2 days\nDay 1: Preparation of poly-D-lysine coated coverslips\nCoating promotes cell adhesion and ensures cells are not washed off the coverslip during washing steps with imaging buffer and limits cell movement during lengthy imaging.\nAlternatives to coverslips are available. Culture dishes with pre-installed coverslips are convenient alternative provided thicknesses and coatings are suitable.\nImmerse 100 25 mm No1.5 coverslips in 70% ethanol one-by-one to ensure full contact with both sides. Cover and let soak for 1 h minimum.\nCoverslip thickness should be matched to the objective in use. For the Olympus UApo N 340 40×/1.35 Oil immersion objective used in this guide a thickness of 0.17 mm is specified, this corresponds to No 1.5.\nAllow coverslips to fully dry in sterile laminar-flow cabinet by propping them against the edge of individual open 35 mm cell culture dishes.\nCreate 0.1M sodium borate buffer\nDissolve 3.1 g boric acid 4.35 g sodium borate dissolved into 800 mL 18.2 MΩ water, check/adjust to pH 8.5, make up to 1 L. F\nFilter to 0.2 μm, store at 4°C for up to 6 months.\nDilute 5 mL 10× poly-D-lysine solution to 1× using (45 mL) sterile 0.1M Borate buffer, mix well.\nMove each dry coverslip to sit horizontally in the culture dish and add 500 μL 1× poly-D-lysine solution to each coverslip surface. Incubate for 15 min at RT.\nWash twice with 2 mL 18.2 MΩ water per coverslip before exposing to sterilizing UV for 1 h.\nReplace lids of coverslip-containing culture dishes, and store coverslips in a sterile environment at 4°C–25°C for up to 14 days.\nDay 2: Seeding cells for imaging\nSeed 30,000–40,000 in 300 μL cell culture medium per coverslip. Place in incubator for attachment.",
    "Confirm attachment at ∼4 h by microscopy and add standard cell culture media to a total of 2 mL/35 mm dish.\nTransfecting cells with interorganelle linkers with Lipofectamine TM 3000\nRemove Lipofectamine 3000 kit reagents from 4C and transfer to wet ice, read instructions.\nEnsure plasmid DNA is purified to a high standard and resuspended to a concentration >1 μg/uL. Low concentration DNA dissolved in TE buffer can lead to excessive EDTA.\nAdd a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA per coverslip to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Results improve when the DNA is biased toward the ER-surface targeted linker, e.g., 0.6g ER + 0.4g OMM.\nAdd 100 μL Opti-MEM per coverslip, gently mix before adding 1 μL P3000 per coverslip before mixing again.\nTo a second tube, add 100 μL Opti-MEM and 1 μL Lipofectamine 3000 per coverslip, mix well by vortex.\nCombine the contents of the tubes, mix by inverting and incubate for 15–30 min.\nAdd 200 μL transfection solution dropwise to the 2 mL media of each coverslip and incubate for a minimum of 24 h, preferably 36 h before imaging. No media changes are necessary with Lipofectamine 3000.\nDetecting redox signals using fluorescence microscopy\nTiming: 2 h Preparation. 2 h per coverslip imaging.\nPrepare calibration/stimulation solutions\n200 mM H2O2 solution in 1 mL water in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Store on ice up to 8 h.\nPrepare 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) solution in 1 mL water in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Store on ice, replace every 3 h.\nLoading cells with tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester (TMRM, ΔѰm indicator) and targeting Grx1roGFP2 to the ER-mitochondrial interface. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1375-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Probe targeting in HepG2 cells",
    "(A) HepG2 cells with TMRM loaded mitochondria (upper) expressing ER-surface and OMM-surface Grx1roGFP2 linkers (lower) before (left) and after (right) targeting to the ER-mitochondrial interface with rapamycin.\n(B) Enlarged region of A showing morphology rearrangement of ER-dominant Grx1roGFP2 signal in the lower cell with no response in the upper. Scale bar: 10 μm (A) & 5 μm (B).\nPre-warm pre-imaging/imaging solutions in 37°C water bath.\nCreate a 25 μM solution of TMRM in DMSO via serial dilution in a laminar flow cabinet.\nRemove cell culture media from coverslip and wash with 2% BSA pre-imaging buffer (3b).\nIncubate coverslip in 2 mL pre-imaging buffer containing a working concentration of 25 nM of TMRM for 30 m–5 mm above the water in a 37°C shaking water bath set at 25 spm.\nEnsure all subsequent washing/imaging solutions contain working TMRM concentration of 25 nM.\nClean Attofluor cell chamber and gasket with surgical instrument cleaner, 70% ethanol and distilled water to prevent contamination from previous experiments.\nWash coverslip with imaging buffer and transfer coverslip to cell chamber using fine forceps and add 1 mL imaging buffer including 25 nM TMRM.\nCarefully clean the lower surface of the coverslip with Kimtech wipes to ensure a completely contamination free surface and check for leaks.\nPlace the imaging chamber in a heated stage insert and add a drop of low fluorescence immersion oil to the objective.\nUse brightfield transmitted light to focus the microscope on the cell field then use the 480 nm excitation to locate cells with bright ER-dominant Grx1roGFP2 fluorescence.\nAdjust the Grx1roGFP2 fluorescence with intensity/duration so that 402 nm emission is ∼1/2, 480 nm is ¾ and TMRE approx. 1/6–1/4 (10–15,000) of the 65,535 dynamic range of the 16-bit camera.",
    "Using 2–6 s interval time lapse, record a baseline to establish the stable equilibration of TMRM.\nWhile recording remove ∼30% imaging solution, add 100 nM rapamycin and return to the imaging chamber and mix well.\nCells with ER-dominant Grx1roGFP2 distribution can be seen to re-arrange in in ∼80% cells indicating successful co-transfection with OMM-targeted Grx1roGFP2. In HepG2 cells 3 min rapamycin incubation generates robust targeting.\nStop linker reaction by removal of rapamycin and incubation with 2 μM FK506 for 5 min before replacing the imaging solution.\nAllow approx. 5 min to ensure imaging chamber/solution is up to temperature and recovered from the mechanical stimulation from solution changes.\nEpifluorescence imaging\nSet the time lapse imaging protocol to record image sets at <10 s intervals. Timing is experiment dependent, median oxidative burst duration is ∼15 s. Time resolution for kinetics etc. must be balanced with phototoxicity in long experiments. Similarly, 1 or 2× pixel binning may be chosen depending upon spatial resolution requirements. The Photometrics Evolve 512 camera has a pixel size of 16 μm which translates to a 400 × 400 nm pixel size with the 40× objective and no binning.\nOxidative bursts follow flickers, transient depolarizations of the ΔѰm. These may be stimulated with oligomycin (2.5 μg/mL) or staurosporine (2 μM) with onset ∼10 min post addition.\nCalibration of Grx1roGFP2 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1375-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. On Stage calibration of Grx1roGFP2",
    "Individual wavelength responses of a single HepG2 cell expressing ER-M Grx1roGFP2 & OMM-Grx1roGFP2 targeted to the ER-mitochondrial interface. Grx1 is fully reduced through addition of 1mM DTT. A second DTT addition is used to ensure complete reduction of the probe as shown by increase of the F480 emission signal and decrease of the F402 nm signal shown as fluorescence arbitrary units. The DTT containing imaging solution is replaced by multiple washes and addition of 200μM H2O2. A second pulse of H2O2 is added to ensure full oxidation as shown by a decrease of the F480 nm emission and increase of the F402 nm emission.\nAt the end of the experiment, Grx1roGFP2 should be subject to complete reduction and oxidation to calibrate the obtained data.\nTo reduce Grx1roGFP2, remove ∼300 μL media. add 1 mM DTT from 1M stock solution, add back with careful mixing and monitor Grx1roGFP2 emission wavelengths. When stable, add a second 1 mM pulse, if no further response is observed this verifies complete reduction of the probe.\nComplete oxidation requires wash-out of the DTT using 3–4 chamber volumes of 200 μM H2O2 made from 200 mM stock solution and pre-warmed imaging media. Once Grx1roGFP2 emission appears stable, add a second pulse of H2O2, if the probe is completely oxidized no further ratio change will be observed. TMRM concentration should be constant throughout.\nNormalization of TMRM signal.\nAfter calibration of Grx1roGFP2 (step 7) mitochondria should be depolarized by addition of 10 μM FCCP and 2.5 μg/μL oligomycin while 25 nM TMRM is maintained in all solutions.\nContinue to collect images to monitor TMRM fluorescence which should show an extremely rapid decrease in mitochondria.",
    "TMRM will move from mitochondria to the cytosol causing a temporary elevation in signal. Maintain image collection long enough so that the TMRM equilibrates across the plasma membrane to establish a lower limit.\nCritical: Successful calibration of Grx1roGFP2 is vital for comparison between experiments/cell models. Ensure DTT is fresh by replacing aliquots frequently as DTT degrades with exposure to oxygen. Application of DTT should generate Grx1roGFP2 fluorescence ratios slightly below the level maintained by the cell. Application of H2O2 should be carried out with multiple washes of 200 μM H2O2 to ensure removal/oxidation of DTT to allow full oxidation of Grx1roGFP2. Care should be taken to ensure wavelengths move in opposite directions in response to both DTT and H2O2.\nAnalyzing flickers and oxidative bursts\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step will process microscope time lapse image files to remove background noise and movement using Fiji (ImageJ). The processed images will be used to identify flicker events and subsequent oxidative bursts and assign regions of interest (ROIs) to extract spatiotemporal information from the events.\nConvert microscope files from each wavelength to .tif format using Fiji (ImageJ) and open as 3 independent image stacks derived from the 402 nm, 480 nm & 577 nm excitation wavelengths.\nEnsure ImageJ image is calibrated with microscope settings: Analyze>Set Scale. Our pixel size = 0.4 μm. Alternatively, many microscope software programs include metadata which will automatically set the scale when images are imported using BioFormat.\nAlthough whole cell fields can be processed, cropping the image stacks to a single cell area (∼150 × 150 pixels or 60 × 60 μm) aids simplicity.\nSubtract background\nUse a selection tool to select an area that is clear background in the entire time course of all three wavelength image stacks.\nRun the menu command Process>Subtract background for each image stack.",
    "Multiwavelength registration\nInstall MultiStackReg 1.45 by dragging and dropping “Multistackreg1.45.jar” into imageJ/FIJI “plugins” folder and restarting the program.\nSelect the brightest, most stable stack, usually the 480 nm emission of reduced Grx1roGFP2, and run the menu command Plugins>Registration>MultiStackReg (Thevenaz et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Ensure the correct stack is selected and using default “Rigid Body” and with “Save Transformation File” selected, save the file under a suitable name, and apply registration.\nApply the saved transformation parameters to the two remaining stacks by running MultiStackReg again and selecting “Load Transformation File”. This process will ensure image stability and prevent movement artifacts, particularly from experiments with multiple positions on movable stages.\nApply median filter. On each image stack select Process>Filters>Median3D. Selecting X:2 Y:2 Z:2.

Analyzing flickers, related to step 9 TMRM\nCreate a different image stack for flicker detection.\nCreate a copy of the 577 nm (TMRM) stack, convert to 8-bit, select Edit>Image Type>8 bit, and save with a suitable name, as information is lost when converting 16>8-bit.\nRun Analyze>Multi Kymograph>Stack Difference and select 1 frame difference. Rename/save the resultant stack.\nDenoise by running Process>Noise>Remove Outliers. A good starting point is Radius: 2 Threshold 5. Use preview function to check useful information is not lost. Example processed movie: Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Analyzing flickers, related to step 9 TMRM Difference image analysis\nMove through the image stack frame-by-frame to identify and draw ROIs for flicker events.\nAdjust brightness and contrast so that flickers are clearly visible.\nDraw ROIs manually using polygon selection tool or consider magic wand tool with careful adjustment.\nSave each ROI to the ROI manager (t) and save the complete ROI set at the end.",
    "Use ROI set to make measurements of flickers.\nThe ROI set can be used to make multiple measurements of the StackDifference image set, in the Results window, Set Measurements can be used to measure ROI area to indicate the mitochondrial area subject to depolarization.\nUsing Set Measurements>Results>Mean gray value is used to extract time-course raw data following selection of desired ROIs and More>Multi measure in the ROI manager. Other features of Set Measurements may also be used, e.g., Min & max gray value to ensure no part of the image data is saturated.\nTo normalize flicker’s fluorescence, first establish a local baseline (F0) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). This is the stable fluorescence of the target mitochondrion preceding the flicker. Then the local minimum fluorescence (Fmin) should be established i.e., the lowest fluorescence value in the target mitochondrion following depolarization. Then raw fluorescence values (F) should have Fmin subtracted, and divided by the baseline value (F0). Output is expressed by the following formula:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1375-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Examples of mitochondrial flicker analysis\n(A) two flickers of the same organelle, A and B identified by difference image analysis. Each have stable pre-flicker fluorescence values (F0A and F0B), maximum depolarization (FminA and FminB). Half-Max depolarization is calculated and marked for each flicker (Half-MaxA and Half-MaxB). Initiation for both flickers is derived from the time of Half-Max depolarization.\n(B) Fluorescence values and time points given for flickers A and B in panel A.\n    F − F m i n   (  F 0 − F m i n  )    \nUse ROI set to measure oxidative bursts.\nApply each ROI to the two processed image stacks derived from the 402 nm (oxidized) and 480 nm (reduced) excitation wavelengths of Grx1roGFP2.\nUse ROI manager>more>multi measure with Results>Set Measurements>Mean Gray Value checked.",
    "Copy and paste values into a spreadsheet and create ratio of F402/F480. In this configuration increased ratio, represents an increase in the GSSG:GSH ratio, an oxidation of the glutathione pool.\nCalibrate the Grx1roGFP ratio output using the values from the same ROI in fully reduced & oxidized conditions (step 7). Output should be expressed via the following formula:\n    R − R M i n   (  R M a x − R M i n  )    \nCritical: Regions of interest (ROIs) should be carefully checked to ensure that they consistently represent the underlying region of cell. Mitochondrial dynamics provide the possibility of mitochondria moving into/out of an ROI or undergoing fusion/fission that might compromise the fluorescence data and subsequent analysis. Slight movement of the target region can be somewhat offset by enlarging the ROI to cover the whole area pre/post movement."
