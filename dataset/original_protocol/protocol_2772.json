    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe step-by-step method details are divided into four main parts.\nInduction of colitis-associated CRC\nTiming: 15–17 weeks\nHere we describe the details of the colitis-associated CRC model in mice by using AOM and DSS. It takes about 15–16 weeks, but the exact time differs depending on the treatments and conditions. This protocol includes one dose of AOM injection, three cycles of DSS administration, and three cycles of regular drinking water (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Mice were monitored for weight loss twice a week and were detected for intestinal inflammation at the end of each DSS treatment cycle.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2466-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A schematic protocol of the AOM- and DSS-induced murine CRC model\nOn day 0, each mice was injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg (body weight) of AOM. Then each mice was providedwith 2.5% DSS-containing drinking water for 7 days, followed with normal water for 10 days. This cycle of DSS –containing water and normal water shall be repeated three times, and then the normal water treatment stays last to the experimental endpoint.\nOn day 0, mark and weight each mice.\nPrepare 1 mg/mL (1 μg/μL) AOM working solution in PBS, and inject each mouse intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg (body weight) of AOM (For example, a 20 g mouse shall be injected with 200 μL AOM solution).\nOn day 1, replace the drinking water with 2.5% DSS solution for 7 days (Always prepare at least 5 mL of DSS solution per mouse per day, changing fresh 2.5% DSS solution twice a week is recommended since DSS solution is not very stable at room temperature). This is cycle 1.\nMonitor the weight loss of the mice twice a week until they are euthanized.\nOn day 8, change the 2.5% DSS solution to normal water for another 10 days.",
    "On day 18, replace the drinking water with 2.5% DSS solution for 7 days. This is cycle 2.\nOn day 25, change the 2.5% DSS solution to normal water for another 10 days.\nOn day 35, replace the drinking water with 2.5% DSS solution for 7 days. This is cycle 3.\nOn day 42, change the 2.5% DSS solution to normal water until the mice are euthanized.\nDay 105–119 is a window phase to euthanize mice, but the exact endpoint of the experiment depends on the situation (recommended criteria can include weight loss of 10%–20%, occult blood in stool and energies).\nIn vivo imaging of intestinal inflammation\nTiming: 30 min\nIt has been shown that inflammatory microenvironment of the intestine promotes tumor establishment. Therefore, we also provide a noninvasively proposal by the usage of in vivo imaging technique to determine the degree of intestinal inflammation. Briefly, noninvasive imaging is achieved by using a luminol-based chemiluminescent probe, L-012, for the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Both ROS and RNS are closely associated with inflammation.\nInitialize the IVIS Spectrum system and start Living Image software according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAnesthetize mice in a chamber with the concentration of 2.0%–3.0% isoflurane.\nDuring anesthesia, intraperitoneally inject the mice with 25 mg/kg L-012 solution (For example, a 20 g mouse shall be injected with 500 μL L-012 solution).9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nPlace processed mice into the anesthesia manifold of the imaging chamber of the IVIS Spectrum system in a supine position.\n2 min after the injection of L-012, adjust the acquisition parameters and acquire bioluminescent images.\nPlace the mice back to the cages, and keep them warm for recovery.",
    "For quantitative analyses, use Living Image software to calculate the intensity of bioluminescent signals in the standardized regions of interest (ROI) for each mouse (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2466-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. In vivo imaging of murine intestinal inflammation at week 16 after AOM- and DSS-treatment following intraperitoneal injection of L-012 solution\nBioluminescent images were obtained under isoflurane anesthesia using an IVIS Spectrum CT system.\nIt is recommended to use L-012 to image the intestinal inflammation at the end of DSS cycle and in normal water, triweekly after DSS-normal water cycles.\nGeneration and fixation of a Swiss roll\nTiming: 2 days\nDay 1. At a selected time point, sacrifice the mice using an approved method.\nPosition the mouse supine on a surgical pad, perform a ventral midline incision with sterile surgical forceps and scissors, and remove the entire colorectum (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2466-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Separation of murine colorectum\n(A) Position the murine supine on a surgical pad.\n(B) Open the enterocoelia.\n(C and D) Expose the entire colon.\n(E and F) Remove the entire colon including cecum, colorectum and rectum.\nPlace the entire colorectum in a sterile dish (if further in vitro culture is required) or on any suitable surface if further culture is not required. Use a steel gavage needle attached to a syringe to flush the stools out with sterile PBS (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2466-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Cut open the colon longitudinally (avoid mechanical injury) and roll it into a Swiss roll using two capillary tubes (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4I).\nClamp the opened colon with two capillary tubes\nRoll them (capillary tubes-colon-capillary tubes) into a Swiss roll.\nFix the fresh Swiss roll by inserting a syringe needle in the space between two capillary tubes and place it in a 30 mm dish containing 4 mL 4% PFA for 24 h at 4°C (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J–4L).\nDay 2. Transfer the fixed Swiss roll samples to the 50 mL tube tissue processor for dehydration by a sequential incubation order as below:\nIn 50% ethanol for 25 min,\nIn 70% ethanol for 25 min,\nIn 80% ethanol for 25 min,\nIn 95% ethanol for 15 min, repeat this step one more time,\nIn 100% ethanol for 30 min, repeat this step one more time,\nIn ethanol and xylene mixture buffer (1:1 v/v) for 30 min,\nIn 100% xylene for 20 min, repeat this step one more time,.\nFinally, incubate them in paraffin tissue embedding medium at 60°C for 1.5 h, repeat this step one more time.\nTransfer the infiltrated tissues into the embedding workstation (working temperature: 60°C) and embed them with an appropriate embedding mold.\nGenerate 5 μm cross-sections using a microtome.\nFloat the tissue sections in a PBS bath and use glass slides to pick the tissue sections from the PBS bath.\nDry the slides on a 42°C slide dryer and then in a 56°C oven for 1 h.\nCritical: Fully processed slides can be stored at 4°C for up to 3 months.\nDeparaffinization and H&E staining of a Swiss roll\nTiming: 1 day\nDeparaffinization:\nIncubate the slides with 30 mL 100% xylene in a staining jar for 10 min,\nRepeat twice this incubation step in 30 mL xylene,",
    "Incubate the slides with 30 mL 100% ethanol for 10 min,\nRepeat this incubation step,\nThen proceed to 90% ethanol in water (v/v) for 5 min,\n80% ethanol in water (v/v) for 5 min,\n70% ethanol in water (v/v) for 5 min,\nAnd wash the slides in ddH2O for 5 min three times.\nStain the sections with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard H&E procedures.\nIncubate the slides for 5 min with hematoxylin solution to stain the nuclei using Weigert’s Hematoxylin Stain Kit,\nWash the slides for 10 min in running ddH2O.\nIncubate the slides for 30 s in Eosin Y staining solution.\nWash the slides three times in acidified water,\nAdd a coverslip.\nScore histological alterations using a digital pathology biopsy scanner (KFbio, KF-PRO-120) or Microscopy (Nikon, Eclipse 90i)."
