The approach depends on where in the GOI the\n        mutations are to be made, i.e., choose option a or b.\n        \n            Mutations are located within a small region of the GOI.\n            Your GOI must already be available in a plasmid suitable for\n            expression in yeast. Generate DNA fragments harboring the desired\n            point mutations, using PCR. Use a proofreading polymerase (such as\n            Promega Pfu DNA polymerase) and perform PCR reactions\n            following the\n            manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://worldwide.promega.com/resources/protocols/product-information-sheets/g/pfu-dna-polymerase-protocol/]\n            (link to protocol is\n            HERE[href=https://worldwide.promega.com/resources/protocols/product-information-sheets/g/pfu-dna-polymerase-protocol/]). The individual PCR reactions are as follows:\n            \n                For each mutagenesis, perform two PCR reactions in parallel,\n                using as template the uncut plasmid harboring your GOI. These\n                are PCR reactions PCR-1a and PCR-1b, as outlined in the next two\n                steps.\n              \n                One PCR reaction will contain the sense flanking primer and\n                antisense mutagenesis primer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A:\n                PCR-1a).\n              \n                The second PCR reaction will contain the antisense flanking\n                primer, and sense mutagenesis primer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, PCR-1b).\n              \n                Validate successful PCR amplification via DNA gel\n                electrophoresis.\nTroubleshooting #1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]: PCR reaction (PCR-1a\n                or PCR-1b) leads to no amplification, or to PCR products of\n                different sizes.\n              \n                For the subsequent fusion PCR reaction, PCR-2, use the flanking\n                primer pair, and as a template add 1/10th – 1/100th\n                of the reaction volume of each of the two PCR reactions, PCR-1a,\n                and PCR-1b (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, PCR-2) (purification",

In other words, there should be only\n                  growth at the intersections of the patches from both parents.\n                  On the YPD control plate the diploid as well as haploid cells\n                  have grown (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F, plate on the left).\n                \nTroubleshooting #5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]: The haploid strains\n                grow on medium selecting for diploid strains.\n              \n                With a sterile toothpick, take cells from the middle of the\n                grown patch of the diploid cells, and transfer each to a sterile\n                glass tube with lid, containing liquid medium that selects for\n                diploids (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G, lids not shown in the\n                image).\n              \n                Grow cultures until saturation at 30°C, agitating.

It is highly recommended to use\n                  some of these cells for permanent storage at −80°C. For this,\n                  for each diploid strain use a sterile toothpick to aseptically\n                  transfer cells directly from the plate into a sterile\n                  cryogenic tube containing 30% glycerol, vortex, and then\n                  transfer to −80°C.\n                \n                Using the saturated culture from step 6axii, commence with the\n                phenotypic screening starting with step 7 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\n                \nNote: The saturated liquid\n                  cultures need to be used within 1–2 days for the screening\n                  procedure (steps 7–15). Alternatively, make fresh liquid\n                  cultures, using cells from the master plate (step 6axiv).\n                \nPause point: The master\n                  plate harboring the diploids (step 6axiv) can be kept in the\n                  fridge for up to 1 week, do make sure the plate does not\n                  freeze.\n                \n            Mating in liquid medium.

    "the master plate (step 6bxviii).\n                \nCritical: The master plate\n                  harboring the diploids (steps 6axiv or 6bxviii) can be kept in\n                  the fridge for 1 week, do make sure the plate does not freeze.\n                  We highly recommend to immediately use some of these cells for\n                  permanent storage at −80°C.

    "with a colony of the respective strain. Grow the cultures for 39–48 h at\n      30°C, using the test tube rotator. To test whether the cultures are in the\n      stationary phase, check the OD600nm of the cultures after\n      33–42 h of incubation, and 6–12 h later. The OD should be the same at both\n      time points. If not, continue growing the cultures until there is no OD\n      change.\n    \nCritical: Strains used for the same\n      growth assay need to be inoculated into separate sterile glass tubes\n      containing the same batch of liquid medium, inoculated with similar\n      starting densities, and grown for the same time period and under the same\n      condition (e.g., temperature).\n    \n        In a microtiter plate, add to the wells in columns 2–5, 180 μL of SD\n        medium lacking glucose as carbon source and lacking supplements (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Fig6.jpg\n              Figure 6.

Then, using an 8-channel\n              pipette, 5 μL of the dilutions was transferred to solid medium\n              (steps 11–12). For this, a grid was taped to the back of the petri\n              plates, to aid in the transfer of cells onto petri plates, as\n              shown in the right image. For grids see\n              Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Mmc1.pdf]. To prevent puncturing of the agar surface by any of the 8 tips\n              of the multichannel pipette, best is to first align the two middle\n              tips with the respective intersections of the grid as shown, while\n              slowly moving closer to the agar surface, and then aligning the\n              outer tips with their respective intersections of the grid. When\n              the tips are 1–2 mm close to the surface, slowly press the button",
    "of the pipette until the resistance point, so that the content of\n              the tips will hang on the tips as they drop. Once the drops touch\n              the agar surface, they will transfer to the plate. At this point,\n              slowly press through the resistance point of the pipette to eject\n              any residual content of the tips. Then remove the pipette.\n            \n        In column 1 add 100–200 μL of the strains’ overnight cultures (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\n      \nNote: Eight strains can be investigated\n      per plate.\n    \n        Conduct 10-fold serial dilutions as follows (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C):\n        \n            Using an 8-channel pipette set to 20 μL, pipet up and down the\n            content of the wells in column 1, to mix the cells.\n          \nThen transfer 20 μL from column 1 to column 2.\n            Pipet up and down several times the content of the wells in column\n            2, to mix the cells.\n          \nThen transfer 20 μL from column 2 to column 3.\n            Repeat the process (steps 10c–10d), i.e., transfer cells from column\n            3–4, then column 4–5.\n            \nNote: The same pipette tips can be\n              used for steps 10a–10e.\n            \n            Place the lid on the microtiter plate to keep the samples sterile.\n          \n        Prepare plates with solid medium suitable for the growth assay:\n        \n            Select petri plates containing solid medium for scoring for\n            phenotypic effects, i.e., for scoring differences in growth rates\n            (for simplicity here dubbed growth-assay plates), and plates with\n            solid medium that do no elicit phenotypic effects (control plates).\n          \n            Add a grid (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Mmc1.pdf]) to the back of each plate as a guide when transferring 5 μL of\n            each dilution from the microtiter plates to the petri plates (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\n          \n        Transfer cells from the microtiter plate to the solid medium:\n        \n            Using an 8-channel pipette set to 50 μL, pipet up and down the\n            content of the highest dilution (column 5) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).",

This will help best with aligning all\n              tips with the respective intersections of the grid, without\n              puncturing the surface of the medium.\n            \nNote: If a frogger /\n              pin-replicator is available in the laboratory, this can be used\n              instead of the multichannel pipette for transferring cells from\n              the microtiter plate to the agar plates. Do determine how many μL\n              the frogger transfers (this depends on the diameter of the pins,\n              usually the volume transferred by a pin is 1 μL). The dilutions\n              were optimized for the transfer of 5 μL, but 1 μL likely is still\n              suitable for the growth assays.\n            \nLet the samples fully dry in.\nNote: Freshly poured plates stored for\n      2-3 days at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on the bench (and not in a bag),\n      are optimal for the growth assay, as the surface has slightly dried,\n      making the samples dry in quickly and giving the best growth images.\n    \nIncubate plates at 30°C, up-side-down.\nCritical: To prevent the media from\n      drying out during long-term growth experiments, place the plates into a\n      bag with small holes. Addition of a wet paper towel inside the bag is\n      recommended.\n    \n        Monitor the growth until all the highest dilutions have generated",
    "colonies of at least 1 mm diameter, this may take 2–3 weeks depending on\n        the medium used. Use a document scanner to document the growth as\n        follows:\n        \nPlace the plates right-side up on the scanner.\n            Take off the lids, as otherwise the lids will reflect the light when\n            scanning. Usually, a black background is placed over the plates.\n          \nScan the plates.\n            Place the lids on the plates again, and immediately return the\n            experiment back to 30°C.\n          \nCritical: Plates should be immediately\n      returned to 30°C as otherwise the growth difference may not become as\n      apparent.\n    \nNote: We experienced that the best results\n      were obtained when the lid of the scanner was left open, the plates were\n      not covered, and no bright light was directly shining into the scanner.\n      The scanner should be located on a bench with little airflow (low\n      foot-traffic). Even though the plates were opened while scanning, i.e., in\n      a non-sterile environment, we observed hardly any contamination on the\n      plates.\n    \n        In order to quantify and gauge more objectively any observed growth\n        differences between strains, growth rates can be calculated for each\n        strain and plotted in a bar graph. This requires converting the amount\n        of growth seen for each strain into a numerical value, by eye. An\n        example for the quantitation of the semiquantitative growth assay in\n        Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A is shown in\n        Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Mmc1.pdf], and the below instructions refer to this example in square brackets.\n        Steps for this evaluation are as follows:\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Sample result\n              (A) Following procedures from steps 1–5, yeast cells were\n              generated that express from a galactose inducible promoter the\n              RWDBD of Gcn1, each containing an amino acid substitution (labeled\n              a – h in the image). Substitution g is R2259A, shown previously to",
    "be required for Gcn2 binding (Sattlegger and Hinnebusch, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Mutation transformants were then subjected to semiquantitative\n              growth assays, using media containing glucose or galactose as\n              carbon source, and a plate containing galactose and\n              3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (starvation). The growth on plates\n              containing glucose or galactose was similar, suggesting the\n              overexpression of the RWDBD did not affect cell growth. Shown in\n              the figure are the plates containing galactose as carbon source\n              (control). 3AT causes His starvation, and only cells able to\n              activate Gcn2 can overcome starvation and grow (row 1,2,9,10). It\n              has been shown previously that the Gcn1-Gcn2 interaction is\n              critical for Gcn2 activation, mediated by a region in Gcn1 called\n              RWDBD (Rakesh et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5];\n              Sattlegger and Hinnebusch, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\n              Overexpression of the RWDBD itself disrupts the Gcn1-Gcn2\n              interaction, and the concomitant inhibition of Gcn2 is visible by\n              reduced growth on 3AT (rows 7,8,15,16). Single amino acid\n              substitutions in the GOI leading to cell growth comparable to that\n              of cells overexpressing wild-type (unmutated) GOI, would suggest\n              that the mutated RWDBD are still able to bind and inhibit Gcn2.\n              Hence the respective amino acids are not required for Gcn2 binding\n              (rows 3,5,11,12,14). Single amino acid substitutions b, d, g,\n              allowed better growth on 3AT, suggesting that the respective amino\n              acids are relevant for Gcn2 binding (rows 4,6,13). The more Gcn2\n              function is impacted, the weaker the growth on 3AT, hence cell\n              growth is indicative of the level of Gcn2 activity. Based on that,\n              the importance of amino acids is ranked g > d > b.\n            \n              (B) Illustration of protein-protein interactions occurring in the\n              respective strains.

The growth rates relative to the strain expressing GST alone\n              were then plotted in a bar graph.\n            \n            For the growth-assay plate, assign growth scores for each\n            strain at each of the five serial dilutions [Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Mmc1.pdf], cells D9 -H16 and D21 – H28].\n            \nNote: The growth-assay plate is\n              the plate containing the medium where the mutated GOI potentially\n              alters the growth rate of the cell [in our example this is the\n              starvation medium, Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A, right images\n              labeled ‘starvation’].\n            \nNote: Growth scores range from 0\n              for no growth whatsoever, to 10 for full growth. The assigned\n              growth scores may differ between experimentalists, however, if the\n              same criteria are applied to the entire experiment and by the same\n              experimentalist, this will cancel itself out [Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C shows an example for growth score criteria].\n            \n            For each strain determine the sum of the five scores, to obtain the\n            overall growth score [Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Mmc1.pdf], cells J9-16 and J21-28].\n          \n            Determine the growth scores for each strain on the control\n            plates [Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A, left images labeled\n            ‘control’], as done in step 16a [Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Mmc1.pdf], cells N9 -R16 and N21 – R28].\n          \n            Then determine the overall growth score for the control\n            plates as done in step 16b [Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Mmc1.pdf], cells T9 -16 and T21 – 28].\n            \nNote: The control plates contain\n              medium where the mutated GOI does not affect strain growth.\n            \n            Determine the adjusted growth score for each individual\n            strain, by dividing the overall growth score from the\n            growth-assay plate by that of the control plate [Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2450-Mmc1.pdf], cells V9 -16 and V21 - 28].\n            \nNote: This allows for\n              consideration of any growth defects that are unrelated to the\n              effects elicited by the medium on the growth-assay plate.",
