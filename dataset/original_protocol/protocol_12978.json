    "The UQAM ethics committee has approved these protocols, which are in accordance with the guidelines of the ethics committee of St-Luc Hospital of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Montréal (Montréal, Canada). Participants signed an informed consent form.\n1. Medium Preparation and Isolation of Primary Villous Cytotrophoblasts\nPrepare culture medium for human primary villous cytotrophoblasts by supplementing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 25 mM HEPES, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Filter the prepared medium through sterile 0.22 µm filter and store in a -20 °C freezer in aliquots of 50 ml.\nIsolate primary villous cytotrophoblasts from fresh placentas following standard protocols 3.\n\t\nUsing pliers, remove the fetal membrane from the tissue by gently scratching it off, while being careful not to remove villous tissue. Cut the remaining placental villi in cubes of about 3 x 3 cm using scalpel and scissors. Thoroughly wash with water containing 0.9% NaCl to remove maternal blood.\n\t\t\nHolding each cube with pliers, carefully remove the villous tissue from remaining vessels and fibrous tissue using scissors.\nFor 15 to 30 mg of villous tissue, digest four times in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing trypsin (from 9.6 x 105 to 1.8 x 106 U; final concentration 1.2 mg/ml) and deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) (final concentration 200 µg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath with continuous shaking.\n\t\t\tNote: Use 150 ml total volume for the first digestion, 100 ml for the second digestion and 75 ml for the two remaining digestions.\nCollect the supernatant containing dispersed cells and centrifuge at 1,250 x g for 15 min without brake. Remove the supernatant and the resuspend cells in 1 ml of prewarmed DMEM containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin.",
    "Layer the dispersed cells on top of a discontinuous 5% - 70% polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silica gradient (see Table 1 for gradient preparation) and centrifuge for 23 min at 507 x g without brake. Remove the density layer between 1.017 to 1.033 by aspiration and collect the layers between 40% and 50% in the gradient with a new pipette. Wash cells extensively with 10 ml of prewarmed DMEM containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\n\t\tNote: The collected fraction corresponds to densities between 1.048 and 1.062, which harbors trophoblasts.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer. Briefly, mix cells and add 10 µl in a new microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 µl of trypan blue and mix gently again. Draw up the cell suspension and fill the hemocytometer chambers. Count the cells under 10X objective.\nPlace 1 x 106 and 4.5 x 106 cells into separate tubes for use in sections 1.3 and 2, respectively. Seed the remaining cells at a density of 1.5 x 106 cells/well in supplemented DMEM medium and culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for a maximum of 4 days for other experiments.\nEvaluation of the purity of isolated primary villous cytotrophoblasts\n\t\nSpin 1 x 106 of the freshly isolated cytotrophoblasts in microcentrifuge tubes at 300 x g.

    "Incubate cells in PBS containing FBS (1:50 [v/v] dilution) and a FcR blocking reagent (1:10) for 45 min at room temperature to eliminate nonspecific binding.\nWash twice with 500 µl of room temperature PBS, centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min and remove PBS by aspiration. Resuspend cells in 100 µl room temperature PBS.\nIncubate cells with a mouse monoclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human cytokeratin-7 antibody clone LP5K (1:200) or a control isotype-matched non-specific antibody in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Wash cells in PBS.\nAnalyze the cells by flow cytometry 3. Use cell preparations, which demonstrate a minimum of 96% CK-7-positive cells by flow cytometry for further experiments.\n2. siRNA Transfection of Human Primary Villous Cytotrophoblasts\nTransfection of human primary villous cytotrophoblasts using a microporation device\n\t\nPrepare 6-well plates containing 2 ml of supplemented DMEM medium for the incubation of microporated cells.\nAfter isolation of primary cytotrophoblasts (see section 1.2), take an aliquot of cells in suspension and determine cell number using a hemocytometer.\nTransfer 1.5 x 106 cells to a microcentrifuge tube and pellet cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.
