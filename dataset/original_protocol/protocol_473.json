    "Prepare Standard Solution:\n1. prepare working standard BSA  solution of 200ug per ml from the standard BSA solution \\(1mg per ml)\n  2. Take 200 ul, 400 ul, 600 ul, 800 ul and 1000 ul of standard solution.\n  3. Take 100 ul of test protein solution.\n  4. Make up the volume to 1 ml in all the tubes.\n  5. Make up the volume upto 1 ml in all the tubes.\n  6. Take 1 ml of diluent as a blank.\n  \nTest Proper:\n1. Add 5 ml of Reagent C to all tubes including blank and mix vigorously.\n  2. Mix well and allow to stand for 10 minutes.\n  3. Add 0.5 ml of reagent D \\(freshly diluted 1:1) and mix all the tubes vigorously.\n  4. Incubate the tubes in dark for 30 minutes.\n  5. Read the absorbance at 660 nm.\n  6. Calculate the concentration of protein in the test solution by making a standard graph."
