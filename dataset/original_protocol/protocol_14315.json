    "All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD ASP1378-15).\n1. Procedure Setup and Preparation\nSterilize all instruments by ethylene oxide in the beginning of the experiment. Between animals, clean instruments using bead sterilization.\nLoad the solution containing viral gene therapy into a micropipette on the micro-injector. The viral vector used in this study was AAV2/8-whirlin (1 x 1013 genome copies per milliliter, see the table of materials).\n\tNOTE: Typically, 1.1 µL total volume is loaded into the micropipette.\n2. Anesthesia\nNOTE: The mouse strain used in this study is the whirler mouse. Both homozygous mutants (Whrnwi/wi) and heterozygous littermates (Whrn+/wi) were used.\nPlace the mother in a separate cage (separate from the litter).\nPlace the home cage containing the litter (P0 - P5 pups) on a recirculating heat pad (set at 37.5 °C) to keep the mice warm.\nCut out the thumb portion of a latex glove, and place a pup in it.\nPlace the pup in latex glove thumb into a bucket of ice for ~2 min.\nPlace the anesthetized pup on a large square commercial plastic freeze pack with a 4\" x 4\" gauze between the pup and the pack's surface.\nFill a heavy-duty latex glove with crushed ice, and place the ice glove around the pup.\nCheck to see if the pup is adequately anesthetized by the complete lack of any response to various stimuli (including a firm toe pinch). Leave the pup on the ice pack for the duration of the surgery (approximately 5 - 10 min).\n\tNOTE: We recommend leaving the pups on the ice pack for no more than 15 min during the surgery.\n3. Surgical Approach (Figure 1)",
    "Clean the skin behind the ear with an iodine wipe and an alcohol wipe once the animal is anesthetized.\nMake a postauricular incision ~2 mm behind the ear using micro-scissors, and divide the sternocleidomastoid muscle with micro-scissors.\nIdentify the facial nerve and the bulla. The bulla is cartilaginous and semi-transparent at this age and it lies medial to the facial nerve. The stapedial artery can be seen through the bulla at this age, which is a useful landmark.\nFollow the facial nerve superiorly and posteriorly to locate the posterior semicircular canal (PSCC). Remove the muscle fibers and soft tissue overlying the posterior semicircular canal using micro-scissors.\n\tNOTE: The PSCC is cartilaginous at this age.\nPenetrate the PSCC using a glass micropipette (~10 μm in diameter) on the micro-injector.\nInject viral gene therapy into the inner ear.\n\tNOTE: Typically, a total of 20 injections of 49 nL of the gene therapy are delivered into the posterior semicircular canal over ~40 s (total volume ~1 µL). The viral titer used was 1 x 1013 genome copies per mL.\nClose the skin incision using a 5-0 polyglactin suture.\n4. Postoperative Care\nPlace the pup on a warming pad to restore a normal body temperature during recovery from anesthesia with constant manual stimulation/rolling with gloved human fingers.\nOnce the pup is awake, place it back into its home cage.\nCaress each pup with a cotton swab that has been exposed to the home cage bedding.\n\tNOTE: The purpose of this is to have the mice smell as they did prior to surgery, which increases the likelihood of the mother re-accepting her litter post-surgery. If possible, urine from the mother can be collected and rubbed on the pups using a cotton swab to further decrease the likelihood of rejection.",
    "Apply mineral oil to the mother's nose to desensitize her8, and reintroduce the mother into the home cage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
