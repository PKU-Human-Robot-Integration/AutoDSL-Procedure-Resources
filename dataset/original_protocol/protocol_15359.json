    "1. Anesthesia\nSet the flow rate of the anesthetic machine at 2L/min. Connect the exhaust to vacuum suction.\nCharge face mask with anesthetic gas (Isoflurane) at 5% (˜3 min).\nNewborn piglets will be induced with inhaled Isoflurane 5% in 100% oxygen (˜3 min).\nMaintain anesthesia at 2-3% of Isoflurane. Fine adjustment of Isoflurane by 0.5% as appropriate, however, it may range from 0.5 to 5% depending on the condition of piglets.\nOnce the vascular access has been established, the inhalational anesthesia can be switched to intravenous anesthesia using fentanyl (5-50 mcg/kg/h) and midazolam (200-500 mcg/kg/h) infusions. Pancuronium (50-100 mcg/kg/h) may be required to control excessive muscle movements during the surgery, whilst the ability to observe animal's state is preserved for the adjustment of anesthetic medications.\nThe piglet is monitored by pulse oximetry (percutaneous oxygen saturation at 95-100%) and ECG (heart rate at 130-170 beats/min).\nThe piglet's rectal temperature is maintained at 38-40°C with heating blanket and radiant warmer.\nThe anesthetic state of piglet is being regularly evaluated throughout the experimental period using neurological (pupil size, tearing, body movements), behavioral (agitation), cardiovascular (tachycardia and hypertension) and respiratory (tachypnoea) parameters as appropriate. Minimal paralysis is given. Previous experience of anesthesia in piglets with and without paralysis would be useful for evaluation.\nThe protocol is a non-survival procedure with euthanization of the animal at the end of experiment with an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) intravenously.\n2. Surgical placement of vascular catheters at the groin (Figure 1)\nMake a long 2-3cm incision in the right groin.\nDissect 1cm of the right femoral venous and 1cm right femoral artery. Put two 3-0 strings around each vessel.",
    "Right femoral venous catheterization: Ligate the distal of the vein. Insert an Argyle catheter (3.5 or 5 French, double- lumen)(Covidien, Mansfield, MA) to 15cm and this will place at the right atrium. Tie both strings to secure the catheter. The catheter can be used for maintenance fluid and medications infusion (secondary port) and central venous/right atrial pressure measurement (primary port).\nRight femoral arterial catheterization: Ligate the distal of the artery. Lift up the proximal string to stop the blood flow. Insert an Argyle catheter (3.5 or 5 French, single-lumen) to 5cm. This will place the arterial catheter at the infra-renal aorta for continuous mean arterial pressure measurement and blood sampling. Tie both strings to secure the catheter.\nClose the skin.\n3. Establish mechanical ventilation (Figure 2)\nMake a long 2-3cm horizontal incision in the neck.\nDissect and expose 1cm of the trachea. Put two 1-0 strings around the trachea.\nInsert an endotracheal tube (3.0 or 3.5) at 1cm into the trachea. Connect to a ventilator and commence mechanical ventilation. Secure the endotracheal tube.\nDissect and expose the common carotid artery. Encircle the vessel with a transit time ultrasound flow probe (2SB or 2RB, Transonic Systems Inc., Ithica, NY) to continuously measure the blood flow.\n4. Placement of flow probes at superior mesenteric (Figure 3) and left renal (Figure 4) arteries\nExtra doses of fentanyl (5-10 mcg/kg) and acepromazine (0.01-0.02 mg/kg) are required prior to skin incision.\nMake a long subcostal-flank incision and carefully dissect muscle layers.\nExpose the abdominal aorta.\nMinimize vascular handling (vasospasm) and lymphatic injury.\nDissect 0.5-1cm superior mesenteric artery and put a Transonic flow probe (3SB) around it.\nDissect 0.5-1cm left renal artery and put a Transonic flow probe (2SB) around it.\nClose the skin and secure the flow probe.",
    "5. Placement of pulmonary artery catheter (Figure 5) and flow probe (Figure 6)\nExtra doses of fentanyl (5-10 mcg/kg) and acepromazine (0.01-0.02 mg/kg) are required prior to skin incision.\nLie the animal at the right lateral position.\nThoracotomy at the left 4th intercostal space.\nWatch out for the internal mammary artery and vein, ligate if needed.\nUse a dental swab to press down the left lung and increase oxygen as needed.\nOpen the pericardium.\nIdentify the ductus arteriosus which runs from the pulmonary artery to the aorta.\nDuctus arteriosus may be ligated by placing a clip or by a thick \"3-O silk\" tie at its origin.\nFree the main pulmonary artery and pass a vascular sling using a thick \"0\" tie.\nPerform a purse string (5-0 prolene) suture at the base for the placement of pulmonary artery catheter.\nInsert a 20G Angiocath (with 3 side holes at less 1 cm from the tip of the catheter) through the purse string to a maximum of 1 cm.\nCheck for free flow of venous blood.\nConnect to pressure transducer, check for pulmonary artery pressure and waveform.\nTighten the purse string and secure the pulmonary catheter.\nPlace a Transonic flow probe (6SB) around the main pulmonary artery.\nPlace ultrasonic gel between the flow probe and artery to allow for optimal signal transduction.\nCover the wound with moist saline gauze.\n6. Hypoxia and reoxygenation protocol\nDecrease the inspired oxygen concentration to 10% by increasing the concentration of inhaled nitrogen gas to induce hypoxemia.\nAdjust the inspired oxygen concentration between 10% and 15% to obtain a PaO2 of 20-40 mmHg or SaO2 of 30-40% for 2h.\nPerform arterial blood analysis to assess PaCO2 and adjust ventilator rate accordingly.",
    "With the induction of hypoxemia, the first hour is dedicated to steadily inducing a tachycardic (and cardiac output) response.\nContinue to monitor for changes in blood flow at the common carotid, superior mesenteric and left renal arteries.\nDuring the second hour of hypoxia, the hypoxic stress is increased to steadily lower cardiac output to 30-40% of baseline, mean arterial pressure to 30-35 mmHg and arterial pH 6.95-7.05.\nHypoxic stress may be prematurely terminated or extended by 15 min as appropriate.\nIncrease inspired oxygen concentration abruptly to 100% abruptly by discontinuing nitrogen gas, while continuing pure oxygen.\nMonitor cardiac output, mean arterial pressure and other hemodynamic parameters for rapid recovery.\nResuscitation with 100% oxygen can be continued for 0.5h. Following this time period, reduce the inspired oxygen concentration quickly to 21%.\nContinue reoxygenation with 21% oxygen for the remaining period of experiment. The inspired oxygen concentration can be titrated to 25% if needed.\nFluid boluses of 10 ml/kg Ringer's lactate solution may be needed as appropriate during the experimental period. Its use has to be protocolized.\n7. Representative Results:",
    "The induction of hypoxemia in the newborn piglet over the first hour of hypoxia should increase the cardiac output (pulmonary arterial flow) to 120%-130% of baseline (Figure 7A) and heart rate (Figure 7B). Typically, cardiac output should reach its peak compensation between the first 0.5h and 1h of hypoxia. Further, blood flow should become centralized resulting in decreased mesenteric and renal perfusion but a preserved or increased common carotid arterial flow (Figure 8). During the second hour of hypoxia, there is a steady decrease of cardiac output, development of hypotension (Figure 9A), slowing of heart rate with or without arrhythmia occurred. Hypoxia should induce pulmonary hypertension with increased pulmonary artery pressure (Figure 9B), which may sometimes lower in the final 30 min of hypoxia as the cardiac output decreases.\nUpon resuscitation, all hemodynamic parameters will immediately recover to normoxic baseline, except for the renal blood flow which gradually recovers over the first hour of reoxygenation. However, the hemodynamic parameters especially for the cardiac output and mean arterial pressure will gradually deteriorate over the first 2 hour of the reoxygenation to about 70-75% of normoxic baseline and 35-45 mmHg, respectively. This cardiovascular dysfunction is at least in part for myocardial stunning and warrants cardiovascular supportive therapies such as vasoactive and inotropic agents.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3166/3166fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Groin incision with the placement of femoral arterial and venous catheters\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3166/3166fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Neck incision with the placement of an endotracheal tube and a flow probe around the common carotid artery\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3166/3166fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Flank incision with the isolation of superior mesenteric artery\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3166/3166fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Flank incision with the isolation of left renal artery\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3166/3166fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Thoracotomy with the placement of pulmonary artery catheter\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3166/3166fig6.jpg\nFigure 6: Thoracotomy with the placement of a Transonic flow probe around main pulmonary artery\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3166/3166fig7.jpg",
