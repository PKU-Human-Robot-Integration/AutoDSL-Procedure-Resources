    "Human tissues and blood-related work in this protocol follows the guidelines of the Rutgers University Institutional Review Board (IRB)\n1. NK cell expansion from liver tissues (Day 0), as shown in Figure 1.\nNOTE: Initial cell number and viability are strongly correlated with the time since organ removal and the initial tissue sample amount. However, if tissues are placed in 30 mL of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and kept on ice or in the fridge at 4 °C overnight, NK cells can still be expanded at high purity and viability up to 24 h later.\nIdentify viable tissue areas to obtain lymphocytes from tissues and sections using sterile surgical equipment.\nPlace tissues in 30 mL of HBSS (w/o calcium or magnesium) and keep on ice until ready to prepare for isolation.\nMince the tissue into <0.5 cm cubes using sterile razor blades or scissors and forceps inside a biosafety cabinet.\nPrepare a 1x collagenase IV solution (1 mg/mL) by diluting a 10x stock in HBSS (10x Collagenase IV: 10 mg/mL or ~200 U/mL).\nPlace the minced tissue pieces in the tissue dissociator tubes. Fill the tubes with no more than 4 g of tissue and immerse the tissue pieces in ~10 mL of 1x collagenase IV.\n\tNOTE: Using DNase I is not recommended as it may slightly decrease NK viability and yield. Please refer to the Table of Materials for the specific tissue dissociator tubes used.\nPlace the tissue dissociator tubes into a tissue dissociator and blend at 37 °C to mince the tissue thoroughly.\n\tNOTE: For liver tissue, this may take over 30 min. For more friable tissue, around 15 min may be sufficient. Please refer to the Table of Materials for specific tissue dissociator tubes and the tissue dissociator used.",
    "Remove the tissue dissociator tubes and triturate through 40 µm nylon cell strainer using the backend of a 5 mL syringe. Collect the eluent and discard the large undigested fragments.\nSpin down the eluent at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 30% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated silica to remove fat cells that will otherwise contaminate the final lymphocyte fraction.\n\t\nTo prepare 1x PVP-coated silica, use 9:1 dilution of PVP-coated silica in 10x PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for the specific PVP-coated silica used.\nTo prepare 30% PVP-coated silica, dilute 1x PVP-coated silica with PBS/HBSS.\nSpin down the cell pellet at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 9 mL of R-10 media.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for the composition of R-10 media\nCarefully layer the cell suspension over 4 mL of Ficoll or lymphocyte separation media to separate lymphocytes from red blood cells and polymorphonuclear cells.\nSeparate the layers by centrifuging at 400 x g for 23 min at room temperature with the acceleration and brakes off or at the lowest setting. Carefully decant the upper-medium layer and harvest the interphase containing tissue-infiltrating lymphocytes.\nRinse the cells with 10 mL of media and proceed to cell counting, flow cytometry, aliquoting and freezing of cells, or primary NK expansion protocol.\n2. Primary NK cell expansion from PBMCs (or CB or organ tissues) (Day 0), as shown in Figure 2.\nThaw the frozen PBMC and the frozen, irradiated feeder cells in a 37 °C water bath.\nWash the PBMC and 100 Gamma-irradiated (Gy-irradiated) 221-mIL-21 cells by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min with 10 mL of R-10 media separately.",
    "Save 1 x 106 cells of PBMC for flow cytometry.\n\tNOTE: The initial NK cell purity is an important factor in calculating NK cell expansion rate.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of R-10 media. Count the cells using Trypan Blue.\nMix 5x 106 cells of PBMC with 10 x 106 cells of 100 Gy-irradiated 221-mIL-21 cells in a special 6-well plate (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 30 mL of R-10 media supplemented with human IL-2 (200 U/mL) and human IL-15 (5 ng/mL) (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate the special 6-well plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nReplace the media with R-10 media supplemented with human IL-2 (200 U/mL) and human IL-15 (5 ng/mL) to maintain NK cells every 3-4 days.\n\tNOTE: Maintain less than 20 x 106 cells per well for further expansion at each media change. For the best viability, ensure that the total cell number in each well does not exceed 100 x 106 cells.\nRecord the total cell number, viability and perform flow cytometry every 3-4 days to calculate the NK cell expansion rate.\n3. Attachment of 293T cells (Day 2), as shown in Figure 2.\nSplit 1.8 x 106 293T cells in 11 mL of D-10 media per treated 100 mm plate.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for the composition of D-10 media\nIncubate 293T cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n4. Retrovirus transfection (Day 3)\nIn a 1.7 mL tube, mix 470 µL of reduced serum media with 30 µL of transfection reagent.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for the specific reduced serum media and transfection reagent used.",
    "In a separate 1.7 mL tube, add 2.5 µg of pRDF plasmid, 3.75 µg of Pegpam3 plasmid, and 2.5 µg of CAR construct in SFG vector into the reduced serum media so that the final volume is 500 µL.\nMix the solutions in steps 4.1 and 4.2 dropwise.\nIncubate the tube at room temperature for 15 min.\nAdd 1 mL of the mixture from step 4.4 to 293T cell plate on Day 1 in a dropwise manner.\nIncubate the plate(s) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48-72 h.\n5. Retronectin plate-coating (Day 3)\nDilute retronectin protein with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 50-100 µg/mL.\nAdd 500 µL of the diluted retronectin into each well of an untreated 24-well plate (5 wells per CAR construct). Seal the plate using parafilm and incubate the plate at 4 °C overnight.\n6. Transduction (Day 4)\nCentrifuge the retronectin plate at 2103 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.\nBlock each well of the 24-well plate with 1 mL of R-10 medium.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nPre-warm the centrifuge to 32 °C while the retronectin plate is being blocked.\nCollect the retrovirus supernatant by filtering the transfected 293T cells using a 0.45 µm filter.\nAliquot 2 mL of the filtered retrovirus supernatant into each well.\nCentrifuge the 24-well plate at 2103 x g for 2 h at 32 °C.\nDuring plate centrifugation, collect the expanded PBNK cells from Day 0 and count the cells using Trypan Blue.\n\tNOTE: Continue expanding PBNK cells by adding R-10 media supplemented with IL-2 (200 U/mL) and IL-15 (5 ng/mL).",
    "Dilute the expanded PBNK cells with R-10 media supplemented with IL-2 (200 U/mL) and IL-15 (5 ng/mL) to 2.5 x 105-5 x 105 cells/mL (0.5 x 106-1 x 106 cells per well).\n\tNOTE: Record the total cell number, viability, and save 5 x 105 expanded PBNK cells for flow cytometry as these values are important in determining the NK cell expansion rate.\nAfter centrifugation, partially aspirate the retrovirus supernatant from each well.\n\tNOTE: Do not completely aspirate, i.e., leave approximately 100 µL of retrovirus supernatant per well, as this will decrease the transduction efficiency.\nAliquot 2 mL of the diluted expanded PBNK cells from step 6.8 to each well.\nCentrifuge the plate at 600 x g for 10 min at 32 °C. Incubate the plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48-72 h.\n\t​NOTE: Do not parafilm the plate.\n7. CAR-NK cells collection (Day 6 or 7), as shown in Figure 2.\nGently collect the cells from the 24-well plate and transfer the cells to a 50 mL centrifuge tube\n\tNOTE: Try not to generate bubbles, as this will result in a decrease in cell viability.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL of R-10 media and count the cells using Trypan Blue.\n\tNOTE: Save 5 x 105 cells for flow cytometry to determine the transduction efficiency.\nTransfer the resuspended cells to a special 6-well plate containing 30 mL of R-10 media supplemented with IL-2 (200 U/mL) and IL-15 (5 ng/mL).\nIncubate the special 6-well plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nReplace R-10 media supplemented with IL-2 (200 U/mL) and IL-15 (5 ng/mL) to maintain NK cells every 3 - 4 days.",
    "NOTE: Maintain less than 20 x 106 cells per well for further expansion at each change. For the best viability, ensure that the total cell number in each well does not exceed 100 x 106 cells.\nRecord the total cell number, viability, and perform flow cytometry every 3-4 days to calculate the NK cell expansion rate.\nUse the cells for appropriate in vitro or in vivo assays.\n\tNOTE: The ex vivo expanded PBNK, and CAR-NK cells can be cultured in a 37 °C incubator for approximately 4 weeks.\nExamine the NK cell number and purity at day 7, day 11, day 14, day 18, and day 21 by flow cytometry."
