    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGenomic DNA extraction from “ER-AsiSI” U2OS\nTiming: 2.5 days\nOn this day, AsiSI-mediated DSBs are induced in cells, after which genomic DNA is extracted.\nNote: This protocol is described for cultured U2OS cells grown in 150 mm dishes, containing ∼12–18 × 107 cells per dish. Genomic DNA is purified in agarose plugs to prevent DNA breakage or mechanical shearing.\nCritical: Always count cells and use an accurate and consistent cell number for all the samples to obtain the same amount of genomic DNA.\nIn the biosafety cabinet, remove media from each 150 mm dish of cells by tipping the dish towards the vacuum aspirator.\nGently wash the cells once by adding 20 mL 24°C sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nNote: Aim the pipettor to the wall of the dish to avoid dislodging the cells.\nRemove the PBS by vacuum aspiration.\nNote: These approaches for applying and aspirating solutions from cells should be maintained for the rest of the protocol.\nNote: PBS can be stored for up to 1 year at 4°C upon autoclaving or filter sterilization with a 0.2 μm filter.\nInduce DSBs. To induce DSBs in ER-AsiSI U2OS cells, replace the dish with 20 mL 37°C (DMEM + 10% charcoal-stripped FBS) containing 300 nM 4-OHT for 4 h.\nCritical: Keep the cells incubating at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for the duration of the induction.\nIf multiple dishes are being treated, prepare a master mix of pre-warmed DMEM + 10% charcoal-stripped FBS with 300 nM 4-OHT to be split over all the dishes. This will prevent variations in 4-OHT concentration between samples.\nAvoid introducing air bubbles to the media. Please avoid vigorous vortexing, rough handling, and harsh pipetting during genomic DNA isolation.",
    "Critical: A 4 h incubation is required to quantify optimum DNA end resection. In our hands, we found that 4 h is better than the 2 h to monitor and measure DNA end resection during HR repair. To measure initial end resection, 2 h is enough, but 4 h is typically better to measure extensive resection.\nDSB induction can be verified in cells using immunofluorescence staining against DNA damage response proteins known to form ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) such as γH2AX.\nRemove media by vacuum aspiration and wash each dish twice with 20 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nNote: Keep the bottle of refrigerated PBS on ice for the washes.\nHarvest cells by using 2 mL of trypsin enzyme and incubate the cells for 5 min at 37°C, monitoring the cells periodically under the microscope.\nCritical: To avoid DNA degradation, keep the cells at 4°C after the trypsin digestion until the cells embedded in LMP agarose plugs are in a lysis buffer.\nOnce the cells round up, stop the trypsin digestion immediately with 5 mL of ice-cold DMEM media containing 10% FBS to prevent cells from lysing.\nTransfer all cells to 15 mL centrifuge tubes and spin down at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nWash cells once with 10 mL cold PBS, then suspend cells in ice-cold PBS at a concentration of 1.5 ×106 cells/mL.\nCentrifuge tubes at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the PBS and resuspend the cells in 37°C 0.6% LMP agarose (Invitrogen™) in PBS at a concentration of 1.5 ×106 cells/mL (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: 0.6% LMP agarose was prepared by dissolving 0.06 grams of LMP agarose powder in 10 mL PBS, melted by boiling.",
    "Critical: The agarose solution should be maintained in the melted form at a 37°C water bath. It is advisable to use LMP agarose, as regular agarose solution may begin to harden at 37°C.\nMoulding cells. Drop 50 μL of the cell suspension onto a piece of Parafilm (Pechiney) and place it at 4°C for 5–10 min to solidify. Repeat for the rest of the solution.\nCritical: Cells are embedded in LMP agarose ball before cell lysis to avoid mechanical shearing of genomic DNA during extraction.\nMixing cells with agarose solution must be done quickly before the solution begins to solidify.\nAvoid having air bubbles in the agarose ball.\nImmediately after the hardening of the agarose balls, transfer all of them, one at a time, into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube using a spatula.\nAdd 1 mL of ESP Buffer to the agarose balls in the tube. Ensure that the agarose balls are entirely immersed in the buffer to avoid the repair of DSBs.\nNote: Prepare fresh EPS buffer.\nLeave the tube for 20 h at 16°C on a mini rotary shaker at a rotation rate of 100 RPM.\nRemove the ESP Buffer carefully from the agarose ball and add 1 mL of HS buffer to the tube for 20 h at 16°C with rotation (100 RPM).\nCritical: Just before use, add Proteinase K to the ESP buffer.\nNote: Prepare fresh HS buffer.\nRemove the HS buffer and add 1 mL ice-cold PBS buffer to the tube, then incubate for 1 h at 4°C with rotation (40 RPM).\nCritical: The temperature of his step is critical and must be done at 4°C to prevent the DNA from degradation.\nRemove PBS buffer after 1 h incubation and repeat this wash step 6 times.",
    "Note: HS buffer was used to achieve high purity of DNA without degradation of DNA.\nPlace the tube containing agarose balls in a 70°C heat block for 10 min to melt the agarose balls.\nCritical: Gently flick the tube after the gel is melted until you get the solution to the bottom of the tube.\nDilute it 15-fold with 70°C ddH2O, mix the solution well, and wait until it cools down to 24°C.\nCritical: Always mix the solution with gentle pipetting and do not vortex the solution to avoid shearing the genomic DNA.\nAdd an equal volume of appropriate 2× rCutSmart™ NEB restriction enzyme buffer.\nNote: Store the buffer at 4°C for future use.\nMeasure DNA concentration. Determine the DNA concentration for all samples by measuring the absorbance of the samples at 260 nm using a spectrophotometer (we use the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer). TE buffer should be used to blank the spectrophotometer.\nPause point: Genomic DNA can be stored at −20°C for at least 12 months. To avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles upon proceeding with qPCR, the sample can be aliquoted into multiple tubes before freezing.\nMeasurement of DNA resection by qPCR amplification\nTiming: 12–18 h\nAs mentioned earlier, we measured DNA end resection adjacent to two AsiSI cut sites on Chromosome 1. To analyze the proximal DSBs, we used a procedure described by Zhou et al. (2014)2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] with the following modifications:\nWe purified gDNA from cells using the Qiagen DNeasy kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit/] according to the manufacturer’s instructions and recommendations to add the RNase A incubation step.",
    "To digest or mock digest our gDNA, we added 20 units of restriction enzymes BsrGI-HF enzyme for DSB1 or BanI enzyme for DSB2 (New England Biolabs) to a 20 μL gDNA sample (140 ng in 1× NEB restriction enzyme buffer) as described below at 37°C for 12–16 h. Samples were heat-inactivated at 65°C and analyzed by qPCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2166_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2166_7.csv\nUse 3 μL of mock or BsrGI / BanI digested samples as templates in 10μL of a qPCR reaction to measure resection at loci 335 nt to Chr 1 DSB and 231 nt to Chr 22 DSB. The following qPCR reaction and cycling program was used for all reactions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2166_8.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2166_9.csv"
