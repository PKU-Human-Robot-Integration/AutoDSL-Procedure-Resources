    "**Cell culture medium preparation**\n• Gelatin solution: 0.1% gelatin in PBS. Then the solution is autoclaved.\n• FDMEM: 89% DMEM high glucose, 10% Foetal Bovine Serum, 1% GlutaMAX Supplement, 0.5% Penicillin/Streptomycin.\n• KSR medium: 77.8% DMEM/F-12, 20% Knockout Serum Replacement, 1% NEAA, 1% GlutaMAX, 0.5% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 0.2% 2-Mercaptoethanol \\(55 mM). Then medium is filtered by Stericup-GP.\n• MEF-conditioned KSR medium: Feed 40 mL of KSR medium to 10 million Mouse embryonic fibloblast cells in T175 flask for a day. Collect the medium next day and feed another 40 mL of KSR medium. After repeating this 6 times, collected and pooled medium is filtered by Stericup-GP. \n• APEL: Supplement a bottle of STEMdiff APEL \\(100 mL) with 0.5 mL of Antibiotic-Antimycotic.\n**Seed Feeders \\(Day -8)**\n1. Coat a T25 flask with 3 mL of 0.1% gelatin solution by 30 min incubation at 37 °C.\n  \n2. Thaw frozen vial of mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(MEFs) by warming vial at 37 °C until a small ice pellet remains. Add pre-warmed 5 mL FDMEM in a drop wise manner to vial and gently mix. Collect into 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 400 xg for 3 min.\n  \n3. Remove supernatant and resuspend MEFs in FDMEM. Seed onto a T25 flask at 12,000 cells per cm<sup>2</sup> in FDMEM and culture overnight in a 37 °C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.\n  \n**Thaw hESC/iPSC \\(Day -7)**\n4. Thaw frozen vial of iPSC/hESC onto the prepared T25 flask containing mitotically inactivated MEFs by warming vial at 37 °C until a small ice pellet remains. Add pre-warmed 5 mL KSR medium in drop wise manner to the vial and gently mix. Collect into 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 400 xg for 3 min.",
    "5. Remove supernatant and resuspend iPSC/hESC in KSR medium containing 10 ng/mL bFGF. Seed onto flask and culture in a 37 °C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 4 days.\n  \n6. Daily, aspirate spent KSR medium and replenish with 5 mL fresh KSR medium containing 10 ng/mL bFGF.\n  \n**Matrigel adaption of hESC/iPSC \\(Day -3)**\n\\(For optimal results, cells should be approximately 80-90% confluent at this day. If cells are not confluent, allow another day for incubation or do a lower split ratio.)\nMatrigel Coating:\n7. Aliquot 3 mL of cold DMEM/F-12 into a 15 mL tube.\n  \n8. Add 25μL of hESC qualified Matrigel to DMEM/F-12. Mix well and transfer into a T25 flask. \\(Handle Matrigel on ice as it solidifies when warmed.)\n  \n9. Keep the flask at room temperature for at least 30 min to allow Matrigel to coat the surface.\n  \nPassaging cells:\n10. Wash cells in T25 flask with 3 mL PBS twice.\n  \n11. Add 2 mL TrypLE Select to cells and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.\n  \n12. Pipette 5 mL DMEM/F-12 to cells, mix and ensure cells have lifted off from the plastic surface. \\(Pipette cells no more than twice as they hESC/iPSC are very sensitive.)\n  \n13. Collect cell suspension at a 1:3 split ratio in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 400 xg for 3 min.\n  \n14. Remove supernatant and add 5 mL MEF-conditioned KSR medium containing 10 ng/mL bFGF to cells. Mix gently.\n  \n15. Aspirate Matrigel-containing DMEM/F-12 from prepared T25 flask and seed cells.\n  \n16. Culture in a 37 °C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 2 days.\n  \n17. Daily, aspirate spent MEF-conditioned KSR medium and replenish with 5mL fresh MEF-conditioned KSR medium containing 10 ng/mL bFGF.\n  \n**Seeding hESC/iPSC for differentiation \\(Day -1)**\n18. Wash T25 flask with 3 mL PBS twice.",
    "19. Add 2 mL TrypLE Select to cells and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.\n  \n20. Pipette 5 mL DMEM/F-12 basal medium to cells, mix and ensure cells have lifted off from the plastic surface. \\(Pipette cells no more than twice as they hESC/iPSC are very sensitive.)\n  \n21. Collect cell suspension into 15 mL tube. Count cell number by hemocytometer.\n   \n22. Calculate cell suspension volume to achieve 375,000 cells.\n  \n23. Aliquot cells into a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge at 400 xg for 3 min.\n  \n24. Resuspend cells in 4mL of MEF-conditioned KSR medium, containing 10 ng/mL bFGF. Seed cells into a T25 matrigel coated flask \\(final 15,000 cells per cm<sup>2</sup>) and culture at 37 °C overnight. \n  \n**Differentiation stage one \\(Day 0)**\n25. For a freshly opened APEL bottle \\(100 mL), add 0.5 mL of Antibiotic-Antimycotic.\n  \n26. Cells should reach to 40-50% confluent. Aspirate MEF-conditioned KSR medium from T25 flask.\n  \n27. Add 4mL of APEL containing 8 μM CHIR99021 to cells.\n  \n28. Culture at 37 °C for 2-5 days, refreshing the medium every 2 days. Duration of CHIR99021 determines the ratio of collecting duct/nephron in the organoid. 3 or 4 days of CHIR99021 is recommended to obtain both compartments. \n  \n**Differentiation stage two \\(Day 2-5)**\n29. Aspirate spent APEL containing CHIR99021 from T25 flask.\n  \n30. Add 6 mL of APEL containing 200 ng/mL FGF9 + 1 μg/mL Heparin to cells.\n  \n31. Culture at 37 °C until day 7, refreshing the medium every 2 days.\n  \n**Making kidney organoids \\(Day 7)**\n32. Aspirate the culturing medium and wash with 3 mL PBS.\n  \n33. Aspirate the PBS.\n  \n34. Add 1 mL trypsin EDTA \\(0.25%) to cells.\n  \n35. Incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.",
    "36. Monitor under the microscope to make sure all cells have lift off from the surfaces. If the cells are still attached to the surfaces, gently pipette the cells with trypsin and place back into the incubator for further 2 min.\n  \n37. Neutralize the trypsin with 9 mL of FDMEM.\n  \n38. Aliquot the entire culture into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\n  \n39. Centrifuge the cells at a speed of 400 xg for 3 min.\n  \n40. Aspirate the medium off till just a pellet of cells left.\n  \n41. Resuspend the cells with 3 mL of APEL.\n  \n42. Take out 10 μL of cell suspension and perform a cell count with a hemocytometer.\n  \n43. Each organoid will have roughly 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells, aliquot the required amount of cell suspension into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\n  \n44. Centrifuge the tube at 400xg for 2 min.\n  \n45. Aliquot 1.2 mL of APEL containing 5 μM CHIR99021 into the 6 well Transwell polyster membrane cell culture plate. The transwell filter attaches on the surface of the medium.\n  \n46. Pick the pellet up by using a P1000 or P200 wide bore tip.\n   \n47. Carefully place the pellet onto the transwell filter with minimal medium carry over.\n  \n48. Incubate pellets at 37 °C for 1 h.\n  \n49. After 1 h, remove the medium of APEL containing 5 μM CHIR99021, and use 1.2 mL of APEL containing 200 ng/mL FGF9 + 1 μg/mL Heparin.\n  \n50. Culture for 5 days with refreshing the FGF9 medium every two days.\n  \n**Withdrawing FGF9 \\(Day 7 + 5)**\n51. After 5 days, change the medium of FGF9-containing APEL to APEL only.\n  \n52. Culture the organoids for further 6 to 13 days in APEL only medium with refreshing the APEL every two days.\n  \n**Kidney organoids \\(Day 7 + 11 to 18)**",
