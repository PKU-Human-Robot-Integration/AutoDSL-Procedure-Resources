    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCulture of Dendra2 strains\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes the culture of the Dendra2 strain before microscopy.\nWe assume that colonies have already been grown on a plate (rich medium, Yeast Extract–Peptone–Dextrose (YPD) and Agar)(Amberg et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). If not, streak cells from a glycerol stock onto a plate and incubate at 30°C for 3 days.\nDay 1\nInoculate 5 ml of synthetic medium with the carbon source of choice with a single yeast colony of a strain with Protein of Interest fused to Dendra2. Incubate overnight (∼16hrs) in an incubator shaker at 30°C and 220 rpm.\nDay 2\nMeasure the OD600 of the culture and inoculate 20 mL of the same synthetic medium with the appropriate volume of the overnight (∼16hrs) culture so that the OD600 is ∼0.3 the next day (see calculations below). Incubate overnight (∼16hrs) at 30°C and 220 rpm\nOD600 = 0.5 corresponds to 107 cells/mL, as measured with our spectrophotometer\nThe inoculation volume of the initial culture needed to obtain a culture with the desired OD600 after a defined time interval is calculated with the following formula:\n    O  D 600  f i n a l  × V f i n a l    2  t g    × O  D 600  i n i t i a l   = V i n i t i a l  \nwith:\nt = time of exponential growth (it needs to be adjusted for lag time before exponential growth starts: t=ttotal-tlag; tlag is typically one generation time so t=ttotal-g)\ng = generation time\nDay 3\nThe next day: check that the OD600 is around 0.3.\nLet yeast grow at 30°C, 220 rpm until OD600 ∼0.5–0.8\nOptional: Do the following step only if G2/M arrest is needed for the experiment.",
    "Add nocodazole (15 μg/mL final) for 3 h.\nPreheat table top centrifuge to 30°C. Spin cells for 2 min at 3000×g in table top centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor and remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 20 mL of fresh synthetic medium.\nLet yeast grow for 45 min at 30°C, 220 rpm.\nMicroscopy slide preparation\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nThis step describes the preparation of the microscopy slide (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/681-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Microscopy slide preparation (steps 6 to 10 of the protocol)\n(A–D) Fill all 8 wells with liquid agarose solution (~350μL per well) and let the gel solidify in the wells.\n(E–G) Use a sterile 10 μL pipette tip to carefully lift the gels and place them vertically on the side of each well. Wait a few minutes for the bottom of the well to dry.\n(H and–I) Put 3 μL of yeast cell suspension into each well and spread the liquid with the pipette tip. Let dry 10 s to 2 min.\n(J–L) Carefully put the agarose gel back on top of the cells without trapping bubbles. Cover the slide with its lid.\nPrepare 10 mL of 0.8% agarose in synthetic medium with a desired carbon source, for e.g., glucose or galactose, (0.08 g agarose + 10 mL medium).\nWarm up the suspension in a microwave oven until agarose is dissolved.\nCritical: Do not boil the agarose solution to avoid concentrating the solution because of water evaporation.\nDo all the following steps next to a flame to avoid contamination.\nFill all 8 wells with agarose solution (∼350 μL per well) and let the agarose solidify.\nUse a 10 μL sterile pipette tip to carefully lift the gels and place them upright on the side of the well.",
    "Wait a few minutes for the bottom of the well to dry.\nMeasure the OD600 of the yeast culture before spinning the entire culture for 2 min at 3000×g in a swinging bucket rotor of a tabletop centrifuge preheated at 30°C. Remove supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in synthetic medium to a final OD600 ∼2.2. This density is optimal for microscopy. Cells are well spaced in the field of vision and their numbers are high enough for statistically significant quantitative analysis. The total number of cells analyzed from five positions in each well and all 8 wells is typically ∼300.\nPipette 3 μL of re-suspended yeast cells into each well and spread them with the pipette tip.\nLet dry until there are no more visible liquid droplets on the bottom of the well (10 s to 2 min). This is to avoid “floating” cells during microscopy.\nCarefully put the agarose gel back down, on top of the cells and avoid trapping bubbles. Cover the plate with its lid.\nTake your slide to the microscope\nHi-Lo microscopy\nTiming: 9–12 h\nThis step describes the microscope settings for optimal yeast growth and image acquisition.\nAdjust the laser power and LED lamp (Lumencor system) parameters to:\n488 nm laser: ∼360 μW\n561 nm laser: ∼300 μW\nLED photo-conversion (390 nm): ∼2.30 mW\nSet the temperature of the thermostatic chamber surrounding the microscope stage to 30°C. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/681-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Hi-Lo/TIRF microscope\n(A) Microscope set-up.\n(B) Custom made water dispenser for the 60× water objective. A bottle of water placed in the thermostatic chamber (30°C) supplies the water for the pump, which continuously dispenses a drop of water onto the lens of the 60× objective. A beaker connected to the water dispenser collects the excess water coming from the pump.",
    "(C) The microscopy slide attached to the water dispenser\nNote: These parameters are optimal for live cell microscopy.\nUse the following equipment (or equivalent) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]):\nNikon inverted microscope for epifluorescence and TIRF microscopy in the Hi-Lo mode (60% angle).\nCamera EMCCD 512 Photometrics (512∗512, 16 μm pixel size)\n60× water objective, NA 1.2 (Nikon)\nWater dispenser (custom made)\nMetamorph software\nChoose 5 positions per well (40 positions in total) and set Z stack parameters (5 stacks separated by 1 μm between each pair).\nTake one image at each position in the Led Trans mode and at 488 nm and 561 nm excitation wavelengths before photo-conversion. Dendra2 emits green (488 nm excitation) or red (561 nm excitation) light before and after photo-conversion, respectively.\nNote: The excitation wavelengths have to be adapted to the type of photo-convertible fluorescent protein used.\nPhoto-conversion is done by exposing cells at each position for 1 min to 390 nm UV light from the LED Lamp at 60% capacity with Neutral Density filters ND4 or ND8. The photo conversion process for all positions in all 8 wells takes ∼40 min. The efficiency of photo-conversion can vary from cell to cell but it is mostly greater than 50%. See problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section on how to maximize photo-conversion efficiency.\nSet-up automated time-lapse image acquisition:\nFor each position, take one photo each in the LED Trans mode, and at 488 nm and 561 nm excitation wavelengths (200 ms exposure) with GFP and TAMRA emission filters, respectively. We use a camera gain of 300 for abundant proteins. The camera gain and exposure times have to be adapted empirically for your laser and camera specifications to avoid signal saturation. The camera gain may also need to be increased for low abundance proteins.",
    "Take photos every 6.5 min for 6.5 h, or adjust the time intervals to the speed of your microscope (for example every 8 min for 8 hrs) to obtain 61 photos for each position.\nNote: The microscope is equipped with the Nikon Perfect Focus System (PFS), which maintains and adjusts focus during the entire time course.\nImage processing\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis step describes the Image processing steps before quantitative analysis.\nDay 4\nProcess images with ImageJ using a custom made macro (enclosed in the supplementary file: Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/681-Mmc1.zip]_image-process-macro-forBudJ_related_to_step21.ijm) that:\nmerges the 5 Z stack projections into one image and keeps the maximum intensity pixels from each stack.\nmerges the LED Trans, 488 nm and 561 nm channels and displays them by “color”.\nconcatenates all 61 time points into one file.\nYou can find an example of the image output after using the macro in the supplementary file Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/681-Mmc2.pdf]_H4_Pos_11_input_images_for_BudJ_related_to_step21.tiff. This tiff file is used as input for BudJ analysis in step 22. We have added the following examples of movies for the red, green and LED trans channels that were generated after the image processing step: Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]:H4dendra2_red, related to step 21, Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]: H4dendra2 green, related_to_step 21 and Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]: H4dendra2_LED-Trans, related step 21.\nImages are further analyzed with the BudJ (Ferrezuelo et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) plugin as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. The link to download BudJ is provided in the Key resources table.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/681-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. BudJ analysis",
    "(A and B) Start BudJ after opening the image and choose the parameters. The parameters shown in b are optimal for our experimental conditions, they should be adjusted for cell size and image quality. Note that we use a scale factor of 1 micron/pixel instead of the actual scale factor for our microscopy set-up of 0.267microns/pixel to speed up BudJ analysis (using the real scale factor dramatically slows down processing speed). Consequently, the max cell radius parameter of 20 «microns» actually corresponds to 5.34 microns (20∗0.267), which is within the radius range of an average sized mother cell. Note also that if you keep the artificial scale factor of 1 and need to use the cell dimensions measured by BudJ, you will have to scale them according to the real scale factor (rsf) calculated for your specific microscope set up (rsf= ([camera pixel size(mm)] ∗ [binning / [objective magnification]]) / {lens factor]; for our microscope rsf=(16mm∗[1/60])/1=0.267).\n(C and D) Choose one cell. This will be the Mother cell that BudJ will track in all 61 frames (left panel: 561 nm channel, right panel: LED Trans channel of the same field and time point). The red squares indicate the zoomed area shown in e.",
    "(E) Top row: Identify the time points (magenta arrow) when the fluorescent signal has been fully transferred from the mother (left panel, red arrow) to daughter 1 (middle panel, red arrow) and daughter 2 (right panel, red arrow). Middle and bottom rows: Click on the mother at time 1 (this is cell 1), the first daughter at time 11 (this is cell 2) and the second daughter at time 22 (cell 3) (white arrows). BudJ will now track all three cells until the last frame and record the red and green fluorescence intensities in each cell in every frame.\n(F) Output table with fluorescence data.
