    "The principle of Golden Gate cloning consists of using a type IIS restriction enzyme and ligase in a restriction-ligation to assemble several DNA fragments in a defined linear order in a vector in a single step (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0002]). Type IIS restriction enzymes cleave DNA outside of their DNA recognition site sequence. For example, the restriction site of BsaI (GGTCTC N ↓N1N2N3N4) consists of a DNA recognition site sequence (GGTCTC) and a DNA cleavage site (↓) leading to a 4-nt single-stranded DNA overhang (N1N2N3N4) after digestion. To be suitable for Golden Gate cloning, all DNA fragments must be flanked by restriction sites for a type IIS restriction enzyme, with an inward orientation such that the DNA recognition site sequences are cleaved from the DNA fragments during the digestion step (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0002]). The destination vector must also contain two restriction sites for the same type IIS enzyme, but with an outward orientation such that the DNA recognition sites are also cleaved from the vector by the digestion step. Finally, all single-stranded 4-nt overhangs (also called fusion sites) at the ends of the DNA fragments and vector must be unique and complementary to allow annealing to the end of the next fragment or the vector. Because the expected circular recombinant DNA molecule does not contain restriction sites for the enzyme used, it cannot be re-digested, allowing restriction and ligation to be performed in the same reaction mix. This allows DNA fragments that were ligated back in their initial plasmid backbone to be subject to more cycles of digestion and ligation until they finally become incorporated into the desired recombinant product (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0002]). This is useful for transfer of a fragment from one vector to the next, but is increasingly important when several fragments need to be cloned in a single step.",
    "This is because the number of possible ligation events increases exponentially with the number of plasmids in the ligation mix, while the chance of getting a correctly ligated product in a single step becomes increasingly unlikely (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0002]). The restriction-ligation leads to a high cloning efficiency and allows up to 24 fragments to be ligated in a single cloning reaction (Potapov et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-bib-0024]).",

(A) In this example, four DNA fragments, cloned in spectinomycin-resistant (SpecR) plasmid backbones and flanked by orthogonal pairs of user-defined BsaI-generated overhangs, are assembled in a user-specified order using the GGAG, TACT, AATG, GCTT, and CGCT overhangs in an ampicillin-resistant (AmpR) vector. The vector has two BsaI sites compatible with the assembly (GGAG and CGCT). (B) Sequence features of DNA fragment 1 showing inward-facing BsaI sites, the recipient Golden Gate vector showing outward-facing BsaI sites, and the desired recombinant plasmid. All BsaI binding sites are eliminated from the recombinant plasmid when all four DNA fragments are integrated in the user-specified order. BsaI is a type IIS restriction enzyme that cuts a defined amount of nucleotides away from its binding site, resulting in exposure of a single-stranded overhang that can be user-defined. (C, D) After digestion of the vector and fragment plasmids, the fragments can be re-ligated in their original plasmid backbones (RL) or ligated in a new configuration. Only the desired ligation product contains no BsaI sites and is therefore stable. All other ligation products are re-digested by BsaI (red outline). When many fragments need to be ligated in the vector (D), obtaining the desired product may require several digestion-ligation steps, as the number of possibilities for incorrectly ligated products increases exponentially with the number of fragments.\nThe DNA fragments used can be linear fragments obtained by PCR, but can also be sequences cloned in a circular plasmid.

Add equal amounts of each insert and vector to the reaction mix. Use 20 fmol of each plasmid in a total reaction volume of 15 or 25 µl as follows:\nFor one to three fragments:\n         \nx1 µl vector DNA\nx2 µl insert 1\nx3 µl insert 2\nx4 µl insert 3\n1.0 µl T4 DNA ligase\n0.5 µl type IIS enzyme\n1.5 µl 10× ligation buffer",

If the calculated volume is too low for accurate pipetting (<0.3 µl), the plasmid should be diluted 10-fold in water, and a 10-fold larger volume should be added from this dilution.\n3. Incubate the mix in a thermal cycler with the following conditions:\nFor one to three fragments:\n         \n37°C for 2-4 hr\n50°C for 5 min\n80°C for 10 min\n16°C\nFor more than three fragments when using BsaI or BsmBI:\n         \n50 cycles: 37°C for 2 min, 16°C for 5 min\n50°C for 5 min\n80°C for 10 min\n16°C\nFor more than three fragments when using BpiI:\n         \n50 cycles: 37°C for 2 min, 16°C for 5 min\n37°C for 5 min\n80°C for 10 min\nWhen BsaI is used, the final 5-min digestion step is performed at 50°C, as BsaI can digest at both 37°C and 50°C. In contrast, when BpiI is used, the final digestion step is still done at 37°C, as this is the optimal digestion temperature for this enzyme.\nTransform product into E. coli\n4. Add the entire ligation mix (15 or 25 µl) to 50 µl competent E. coli cells and incubate on ice for 30 min.\n5. Heat shock at 42°C for 90 s. Let cells recover on ice for 2 min.\n6. Add 500 µl LB or SOC medium and shake cells for 45 min at 37°C in a ThermoMixer.",
    "7. Plate on LB plates containing the appropriate antibiotic and X-gal. Incubate overnight at 37°C.\nFor cloning reactions with one to three inserts, plate 10-20 µl. Plate larger volumes for increasing numbers of inserts, because the number of colonies obtained will be lower. For example, plate 50 µl or more for constructs consisting of more than three fragments.\nPick colonies and assess clones\n8. Pick individual colonies and inoculate 5 ml LB medium. Incubate overnight at 37°C in a shaker incubator.\nGolden Gate cloning vectors usually contain a LacZ fragment for blue-white screening (a carotenoid biosynthesis operon is sometimes used as a marker for red-white screening). White colonies are picked. For cloning reactions that did not require PCR for preparation of the fragments, picking two colonies is generally sufficient. For cloning reactions made from fragments amplified by PCR, more than two clones may be required to find one that does not contain any PCR-induced mutations.\n9. Prepare DNA using a miniprep kit, eluting in a volume of 50 μl.\n10. Digest 1 µl eluate in a 10-µl reaction using an appropriate enzyme (often BsaI or BpiI when using the MoClo system; see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0004]) to confirm correct assembly by DNA fingerprinting.\n11. If PCR amplification was used to prepare the DNA fragments, sequence the plasmid.",
    "Golden Gate cloning requires that the DNA fragments and recipient vector conform to specific requirements, such as the presence of type IIS enzyme restriction sites at the ends of the fragments and vector, and a lack of the same restriction sites in internal sequences of the fragments and vector. Many vectors suitable for Golden Gate cloning are available from several research groups, and the number of vectors available will likely grow in the future. Nevertheless, converting a standard cloning vector into a Golden Gate cloning vector is sometimes required for a user's specific needs. There are many strategies to do that, including using Gibson DNA assembly or Golden Gate cloning.",
    "An example is provided here for converting the pET-28b (+) vector for use with Golden Gate cloning. In this example, a LacZ alpha fragment flanked by two BsaI sites is inserted in the vector, replacing the multicloning site (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0003]). The LacZ fragment will be used later for blue-white screening. Here, the two fusion sites flanking the LacZ fragment are AATG and GCTT, corresponding to the MoClo standard for cloning of coding sequences (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0004]). However, they can be any other sequences that a user might want, as long as they are different from each other and non-palindromic. Indeed, overhangs consisting of palindromic sequences can anneal to the same overhang of an additional copy of the same fragment in the other orientation, leading to stable ligation products that are nevertheless incorrect and resulting in a significant reduction of the cloning efficiency. In the example provided here, the ATG that is part of the first fusion site corresponds to a methionine start codon, which is cloned in-frame with a His tag present in the upstream vector sequences. The vector and the LacZ fragment are obtained by PCR, and assembly is performed using a second type IIS enzyme, BpiI. Since there are four BpiI sites in the vector, they are removed using primers designed to insert single-nucleotide mutations in the DNA recognition sequences.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5ab06bb9-bf7e-4051-a67a-eae1aaf15793/cpmb115-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Portions of both vectors are amplified with primers as indicated, resulting in one PCR product from pUC19 and six from pET-28b. These are assembled by Golden Gate cloning using the type IIS restriction enzyme BpiI and T4 DNA ligase to give the Golden Gate–compatible vector pET-28bGG. (B) Primers used to for creating the vector. Sequences in bold are BpiI and BsaI restriction sites. BpiI sites (gaagac) are used to prepare the Golden Gate–compatible cloning vector (pET-28bGG) and are removed during vector preparation. BsaI sites (gagacc) remain in the vector for subsequent cloning of the desired DNA fragments.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001])\nGene-specific primers from commercial vendor (e.g., Eurofins Genomics)\nPlasmid template for amplification of LacZ cassette (e.g., pUC19, New England Biolabs, cat. no.

Design primers to amplify LacZ fragment.",
    "Primer locations and sequences for this example are shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0003]. The first two primers, Pr1 and Pr2, are designed to amplify the LacZ fragment from pUC19. pUC19 is selected as a template because it has a different antibiotic resistance gene (AmpR) from the recipient vector (KanR). This reduces the probability of obtaining incorrect constructs by carryover of the undigested template vector when screening clones after transformation. The amplified fragment contains a functional unit for the LacZ marker for blue-white screening. Primers Pr1 and Pr2 have BpiI restriction sites (gaagac in Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0003]) with 4-nt fusion sites corresponding to sequences AATG and GCTT, respectively. The fusion sites in the two primers are followed by BsaI restriction sites in opposite orientation (reverse complement of ggtctc = gagacc in Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0003]). The BsaI sites will become part of the resulting vector and will be used for Golden Gate cloning once the vector is made.\nThe pET-28b vector contains four BpiI restriction sites in internal sequences, which need to be removed by making single-nucleotide substitutions (a process called domestication). Eight primers are needed for this purpose (Pr3 and Pr6-14). Silent mutations are made for restriction sites located in coding sequences (in this case, the Lac I repressor, which has two BpiI sites). A final pair of primers (Pr4 and Pr5) is made to avoid having to amplify fragments larger than 2 kb; this pair of primers is optional. Primers Pr3-14 all have a BpiI site with a fusion site selected to be compatible with the fusion site of the fragment to which it will be ligated.\nWhen ordering, it is sufficient to get the lowest amount possible (i.e., 0.01 µmol) with minimal purification (salt free).\n2. Perform amplification.",
    "Set up one 50-μl PCR reaction with primer pair Pr1-2 using pUC19 as a template.\nSet up six 50-μl reactions with primers pairs Pr3-4 to Pr13-14 using pET-28b (+) as a template.\n3. Run 5 μl from each reaction on a gel to see if the PCR was successful.\n4. Purify the remaining 45 μl from each reaction using a column-based kit (i.e., Macherey Nagel NucleoSpin DNA Clean-up kit).\nThis will separate the PCR product from any remaining DNA polymerase and dNTPs, as well as primer dimers that are produced at various levels in most PCR reactions.\n5. Quantify purified PCR products using a spectrometer such as a Nanodrop.\n6. Perform the Golden Gate cloning reaction (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001]) using the enzyme BpiI. Transform the product into E. coli (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001]) and select blue colonies.\nIn this particular example, transformants should be plated on LB containing kanamycin and X-gal. Correct colonies should not be white, but blue.\n7. Prepare DNA using a miniprep kit.\n8. Digest 1 µl with BsaI in a 10-µl reaction.\nTwo fragments of 5.3 kb and 506 bp are expected for this particular construct.\n9. Sequence the plasmid.",
    "Sequencing the entire plasmid with primers designed at various positions within the plasmid is desirable because PCR was used for amplification of the entire vector. However, since some regions required for replication or expression of the LacZ marker should be functional if the plasmid replicates and the colonies are blue, the entire plasmid may not need to be sequenced. At a minimum, all elements that will later be required for expression of the gene should be sequenced, including the region extending from the T7 promoter to the terminator. Sequencing of the region containing the two introduced BsaI sites is essential to make sure that the sequence of the two fusion sites is as expected.\nThe cloning vector can now be used for Golden Gate cloning.",
    "This protocol explains how to design primers to accommodate a sequence of interest to Golden Gate cloning and then clone the amplified fragments in a Golden Gate destination vector. An example is given for cloning the coding sequence of an Arabidopsis thaliana isoflavone reductase amplified from an Arabidopsis cDNA template (Genbank accession NM_106183).\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0002])\ncDNA or DNA template for PCR (here, cDNA from Arabidopsis)\nPlasmid DNA of Golden Gate destination vector\n1.

It is removed in silico by a single-nucleotide substitution, resulting in a silent mutation (shown in red in Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/95cc49b2-1647-4a3e-a6b1-32c39289ca3b/cpmb115-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nAccommodating an insert to Golden Gate cloning. (A) Example using the Arabidopsis thaliana isoflavone reductase (IFR) coding sequence. Two primers are made at the beginning and end of each DNA fragment (Isof1 and 4), and two more are made for each restriction site to be mutated (Isof2 and 3). After amplification and column purification, the two PCR fragments (I and FR) are assembled in the Golden Gate cloning vector. (B) Sequence modifications made to the IFR open reading frame for compatibility with Golden Gate cloning are shown in red. Sequences in yellow and blue are selected fusions sites for assembly of the sequences after PCR amplification with the indicated primers (boxed sequences). (C) Primers for PCR amplification of fragments.\n2. Add to the coding sequence two flanking fusion sites for compatibility with the vector.\nIn this case, add one A before the start codon to give AATG, and add GCTT after the stop codon.",
    "The added sequence is shown in red in Figure 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0004], and fusion sites are shown in blue.\n3. Select a fusion site at the site of the mutation.\nTwo PCR fragments will be amplified, one on each side of the mutation (I and FR in Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0004]), and then assembled via a fusion site that overlaps or is near the mutated nucleotide. The fusion site needs to be different from the other fusion sites (AATG and GCTT) and should not be palindromic. It should contain at least one G or C (more, if possible), as sites containing only As or Ts may work less well for DNA assembly (Potapov et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-bib-0024]). When many fusion sites are needed, the Ligase Fidelity Viewer program (New England Biolabs, http://ggtools.neb.com/viewset/run.cgi[href=http://ggtools.neb.com/viewset/run.cgi]) can be used to check the suitability of all sites. In the present example, a single sequence, GGAC, is selected (shown in yellow in Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0004]).\n4. Design primers starting at all fusion sites. Select two primers in opposite orientation for each mutated site (in this case, only one site). Make the primers long enough to give an appropriate melting temperature for PCR amplification.\n5. Add the sequence of the BsaI recognition site (tt ggtctc a) to the beginning of all primers.\nThe final list of primers is shown in Figure 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0004].\n6. Amplify the two PCR fragments using the appropriate primers pairs (Isof1-2 and Isof3-4; Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0004]) from the Arabidopsis cDNA template in a 50-µl reaction. Run 5 µl on a gel to check that the correct fragment was amplified. Purify the remaining 45 µl using a column-based kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\n7. Set up and perform the assembly reaction as described (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001]).",
    "Because this example describes a simple cloning with only two fragments cloned into the vector, a simple incubation at 37°C for 2 hr, 50°C for 5 min, and 80°C for 10 min should be sufficient.\n8. Transform the ligation mix into competent E. coli, plate on LB containing kanamycin and X-gal, and screen the resulting colonies.\nMinipreps are digested with two enzymes with restriction sites flanking the insert, or with enzymes that have sites in the vector in insert. Because PCR was used for cloning, the cloned insert must be sequenced using primers for sequences in the vector flanking the insert.",
    "Assembly of DNA fragments from plasmids using Golden Gate cloning can be done quickly and efficiently. In contrast, assembly from PCR products requires more work, because PCR products often contain primer dimers formed by mis-annealing of primers during PCR amplification. Because primer dimers are flanked by the same type IIS restriction sites as the PCR products, they can be cloned, resulting in incorrect constructs and lowering the cloning efficiency (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0005]). Even if no primer dimers are made, the cloned constructs need to be sequenced to make sure that they do not contain PCR-induced mutations. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to have a system where cloned and sequenced DNA parts can be reused in different constructs. For example, parts that contain regulatory sequences such as promoters and terminators can be reused in many different constructs.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5487bbef-40bd-4021-bfd6-ea7c435753fb/cpmb115-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nGolden Gate cloning of PCR products can result in incorrect clones that contain primer dimers. Primer dimers are frequently produced during PCR amplification. Although column purification should remove most of them, some may remain in the purified product and be cloned, resulting in incorrect clones.

    "The modular cloning system MoClo was designed to facilitate the reuse of cloned parts in different constructs (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0006]). It is based on the use of basic parts that are put together using Golden Gate cloning. The basic parts are cloned as level 0 modules and assembled in level 1 cloning vectors to make transcription units. The level 1 constructs are then assembled to make level M and P multigene constructs. Basic parts contain the coding sequence of a basic genetic element flanked by two BsaI restriction sites in opposite orientation (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0007]). Cloning of the basic parts requires amplification from DNA or cDNA as a template. The amplified product is cloned in a recipient vector using Golden Gate cloning. The cloning steps consist of defining the part type, design primers containing BsaI restriction sites at the ends of the fragments, removing sites from internal sequences, and cloning the amplified fragments in a vector.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cb442316-6e27-42d7-8f89-d5b95dd62afc/cpmb115-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nOverview of modular cloning system MoClo, a standardized hierarchical expansion of Golden Gate cloning.

Level 0 basic parts are flanked by standard fusion sites (shown in Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0007]).

Other module types include 5′-UTR sequences (5UTR1 and 2); coding sequences with and without a stop codon (CDS1 and CDS1ns, respectively); coding sequence fragments lacking a signal sequence (CDS2 and CDS2ns); signal peptide sequences (SP); C-terminal fusion tags (CT); 3′-UTR sequences (3UTR); and a terminator (Ter). A stop codon is shown as a star. (B) Sequence detail of the ends of a basic part, using a CDS1 module as an example. Sequences of the level 0 module CDS1 can be released with BsaI. (C) Sequence of the CDS1-specific level 0 cloning vector, which is linearized with BpiI. (D) Sequence of the level 0 universal cloning vector pAGM9121, which can be used to clone parts of any type.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0002])\ncDNA or DNA template for PCR (here, cDNA from Arabidopsis)\nUniversal level 0 cloning vector pAGM9121 (Addgene, plasmid #51833)\n1. Define the type of level 0 module (part).",
    "Parts can consist of promoters, coding sequences with or without a stop codon, C- or N-terminal fusion tags, and terminators (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0007]). Each part is flanked by two BsaI sites in opposite orientation (Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0007]). The 4-bp sequences of the BsaI cleavage sites (fusion sites) are specific for each type of module and define which parts can be fused together. For example, a promoter module with TACT as the 3′ fusion site (Pro in Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0007]) can be fused only to an untranslated leader sequence with the same fusion site at the 5′ end (5UTR2 in Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0007]). For each part type, a specific cloning vector is available with compatible fusion sites. Alternatively, all part types can be cloned into the universal level 0 cloning vector pAGM9121 (Figs. 7D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0007] and 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0008]) as described in this protocol. Level 0 modules may also be composites of several basic parts. For example, constructs containing a complete transcription unit can be cloned directly as level 0 modules between fusion sites GGAG and CGCT. Other types of genetic elements, such as a phage recombination site or a matrix attachment region, can also be cloned as level 0 modules between fusion sites GGAG and CGCT.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b0a0411d-d9bc-4fbf-9cde-f2fd8c9f674a/cpmb115-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nCloning of level 0 modules using the universal level 0 cloning vector pAGM9121.

Introduce silent mutations in the gene sequence in silico.",
    "Basic parts should not contain restriction sites for the type IIS enzymes that are used with the MoClo system (BsaI, BpiI, and optionally BsmBI). Restriction sites are removed by introducing single-nucleotide mutations, which is first performed in silico. Removal of internal sites in coding sequences can always be done with a silent mutation. Removal of sequences in promoter regions is more difficult, because sequences important for promoter function are not always known. Therefore, after domesticating promoter sequences, it will be necessary to validate experimentally in the host organism that the promoter still works as intended. Domestication of the Arabidopsis UGT78D2 gene (GenBank accession NM_121711) is presented here as an example. This gene contains one BsaI site, two BpiI sites, and one BsmBI site (Fig. 9A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0009]), which are removed by introducing four silent mutations (red in Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0010]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ffd548ba-f972-4968-99cd-fff339e58a1e/cpmb115-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nSchematic of direct cloning of the open reading frame of the Arabidopsis UGT78D2 gene as an example of CDS1 module construction for MoClo.

Sequences in blue are fusion sites for the final level 0 module.\n3. Add the two standard fusion sites flanking the part.\nBecause this module will be a coding sequence with a stop codon (CDS1), one A is added before the start codon to give AATG, and the sequence GCTT added after the stop codon (both fusion sites are highlighted in blue in Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0010]).\n4. Add sequences for compatibility with the universal cloning vector.\nIn this example, the part will be cloned into the universal level 0 cloning vector pAGM9121. Therefore, CTCA and CGAG are added at the beginning and end of the fragment to provide the necessary compatibility (highlighted in green in Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0010]).

They need to be different from each other and from the fusion sites that will be used in the vector (CTCA and CTCG for the universal cloning vector, or AATG and GCTT for the CDS1-specific cloning vector). They also need to be different from the reverse complement of any of the selected fusion sites to avoid inappropriate fragment ligation. The selected sequences are highlighted in yellow in Figure 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0010].",
    "6. Design primers starting at all fusion sites, standard and nonstandard.\nFor fusion sites at sites mutated to remove restriction sites, primers are designed in both orientations. The primers should be long enough to have an appropriate melting temperature. This can be calculated using any of the many programs available online or can be done manually.\n7. Add the type IIS enzyme recognition sequence.\nBecause BpiI is used for assembly, the sequence tt gaagac aa is added to all primers. Primer sequences and locations are shown in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0009].\n8. PCR amplify the fragments.\nAmplify five fragments from Arabidopsis cDNA in separate 50-µl reactions using primer pairs Gtpr1-2 to Gtpr9-10 and a proofreading polymerase. Run 5 µl on a gel to check that each fragment was amplified as expected.\n9. Column purify the fragments.\nThe amplified fragments need to be purified to remove remaining polymerase, primers, and dNTPs, and most of the primer dimers that are often present in the reaction. If a single fragment was amplified, using a DNA purification kit (e.g., Macherey Nagel DNA purification kit) is sufficient. Gel extraction of the PCR fragments of the correct size may be necessary if several DNA fragments were amplified.\n10. Set up cloning in the universal level 0 vector pAGM9121 as described (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001]).\n11.

Additional sequencing primers have to be designed within the part to sequence its middle section. To facilitate sequencing without the need for custom sequencing primers for each part, an alternative strategy consists of cloning part fragments (sub-parts) that are no more than 1-1.2 kb long, sequencing the sub-parts using vector primers, and then assembling the sequenced sub-parts using a second assembly reaction to make the final level 0 module (Fig. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0011]).

    "Assembly of multigene constructs using the MoClo system is done hierarchically (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0006]). The first step is assembly of level 0 parts in level 1 destination vectors to make constructs that usually contain a transcription unit. The second is assembly of multigene constructs which is done in alternating stages using level M and P vectors. Up to six transcription units can be assembled in a level M cloning vector to make a level M multigene construct. Then, up to six level M constructs can be further assembled into a level P vector to make a level P construct containing up to 36 transcription units. Level P constructs can themselves be further assembled into level M vectors to make even larger constructs. This process can be repeated indefinitely, until constructs become too large to be cloned as plasmids in E. coli. Level M and P assembly use BsaI and BpiI in an alternating fashion.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001])\nLevel 0 parts\nLevel 1, M, and P destination vectors from MoClo Toolkit (Addgene, kit #1000000044)\nAssemble transcription units in level 1 vectors\n1.

All contain two BsaI sites and the fusion sites GGAG and CGCT to provide compatibility with level 0 modules. They also contain two BpiI sites for excision of the assembled transcription unit in the next step of assembly. The BpiI fusion sites are designed to provide compatibility from one vector to the next. In an example where four transcription units are cloned in the forward orientation, vectors for positions 1 to 4 for the forward orientation (pL1F-1, pL1F-2, pL1F-3, and pL1F-4) are selected.\nThe BpiI fusion site at the end of vector 7 (TGCC) is the same as the site at the beginning of vector 1, allowing one to clone more than seven genes in a multigene construct by reusing the same seven vectors indefinitely. Thus, an eighth transcription unit is cloned using vector 1, a ninth transcription unit is cloned using vector 2, and so on (Fig. 13C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0013]).\nIn the example in Figure 13C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0013], two transcription units are cloned in reverse orientation, and therefore vectors for cloning in the reverse orientation are selected.

    "Seven level M vectors and seven level M end-linkers are available (Fig. 15A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0015]). The vectors contain two BpiI restriction sites in opposite orientation for insertion of level 1 modules. The upstream fusion site defined by the first BpiI site (e.g., ACTA for pLM-3) is compatible with fusion sites flanking the upstream fusion sites of level 1 vectors of the corresponding position (Fig. 15B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0015]). The downstream fusion site has of a universal sequence (GGGA). The end of the last transcription unit is fused to the vector using the compatible end-linker (Fig. 15B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0015]). This system of vectors and end-linkers provides the possibility to clone up to six transcription units in the same vector, avoiding the need for a considerably larger number of level M vectors for all possible cloning combinations. A maximum of six transcription units can be assembled in a level M construct in one step because the last fusion site of level 1 vector 7 (TGCC) is the same as the first fusion site of the first level 1 vector (Fig. 13A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0013]).",
    "Using more genes in this step would lead to incorrect clones, because the same fusion site would be present on different modules. Therefore, cloning than six transcription units requires making at least two level M constructs. For example, to clone thirteen transcription units, at least three level M constructs must be made. In such a case, it is important to plan the cloning strategy carefully, because not all combinations are compatible with level P cloning. For example, one option would be to clone six, five, and two transcription units into vectors pLM-1, pLM-7, and pLM-5, respectively (Fig. 16B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0016]). The fusion sites that flank a level M construct are the same as the fusion sites that flank the first and last assembled transcription units. Therefore, fusion sites flanking a level M construct position 1 containing six transcription units are TGCC and GAGC. Fusion site pairs flanking the next two level M constructs of five and two transcription unit are GAGC/CAGA and CAGA/GAGC (Fig. 16B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0016]). This combination is not viable, because GAGC would used twice in the level P assembly. Alternative strategies using groups of four, four, and five or five, six, and two would be compatible with level P cloning (Fig. 16B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0016]).\nIn the present example, the four transcription units can easily be assembled in one step in level M vector pLM-1 using the end-linker pELM-4. This would be the final construction step. However, as an example of the use of level P constructs, the four transcription units can be cloned in groups of two in two level Mvectors:\n         \nTU1 and TU2 in vector pLM-1 with end-linker pELM-2 (Fig. 17A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0017])\nTU3 and TU4 in vector pLM-3 with end-linker pELM-4 (Fig. 17B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0017])\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/225bcbf4-2ca9-40c5-ba6f-a31c5a120d98/cpmb115-fig-0015-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 15",
    "Level M and P vectors and end-linkers. (A) Seven level M vectors are flanked by seven fusion sites on the left that are compatible with the left external fusion sites of the seven level 1 vectors, and by a common fusion site (GGGA) on the right. Seven level M end-linkers are flanked by seven fusion sites on the left that are compatible with the right external fusion sites of the seven level 1 vectors, and by the same common fusion site on the right. Level P vectors and end-linkers are identical to level M vectors and end-linkers except that BsaI sites are replaced by BpiI sites and vice versa, and the SpecR marker of level M vectors is replaced by KanR in level P vectors. (B) Examples for cloning one to six level 1 constructs (each containing a transcription unit, TU) in a single level M vector (in this case, pLM-3 at bottom). For each level M vector, up to six level 1 constructs can be assembled by choosing the end-linker that provides compatibility between the last level 1 TU and the right fusion site of the level M vector.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/96a662d6-9238-4e0b-82c1-5ca5a9943289/cpmb115-fig-0016-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 16",
    "Planning a cloning strategy for compatibility of level M constructs in level P assembly. (A) Level P is used for assembly of one or more level M constructs. The level M constructs must have compatible overhangs. Several examples are shown for the level P vector pLP-3. The appropriate end-linker is chosen provide compatibility between the last level M construct and the right fusion site of the level P vector. (B) Some subsets of level M constructs may not be suitable for level P cloning. For example, assembly of three level M constructs with six, five, and two assembled TUs cannot be cloned as a level P construct, because the fusion site GAGC would be used twice. Two alternative strategies enable this construct to be made by using level M constructs bearing TUs in groups of four, four, and five or five, six, and two.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/201d0699-19b4-46df-beaa-7921957403e8/cpmb115-fig-0017-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 17\nAssembly of level M constructs. Two level M constructs are assembled from the selected level 1 constructs, a compatible level M end-linker, in a compatible level P vector using separate BpiI Golden Gate cloning reactions. (A) TU1 and TU2 are cloned into pLM-1 using end-linker pELM-2. (B) TU3 and TU4 are cloned into pLM-3 using end-linker pELM-4. Level M constructs are selected as white colonies on spectinomycin-containing X-gal plates and are used for subsequent P level assembly.\n5. Assemble level M constructs.\nThe two level M constructs are assembled in separate Golden Gate reactions using BpiI and ligase as described (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-prot-0001]). Because level M vectors contain a LacZ fragment for blue-white selection and spectinomycin resistance, cells are grown on spectinomycin-containing X-gal plates and two white colonies are picked for each construct. As assembled transcription units are flanked by BsaI sites, miniprep DNA is checked with a BsaI digest.",
    "Assemble larger constructs in level P vectors\n6. Select level P constructs.\nSeven level P vectors and seven level P end-linkers are available (Fig. 15A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0015]). Level P vectors and end-linkers are similar to level M, except that all BpiI sites and BsaI sites are reciprocally exchanged, and level P vectors have a kanamycin resistance gene instead of a spectinomycin resistance gene. As with level M constructs, cloning level P constructs requires selection of suitable vectors and end-linkers. In the example, where our current example with two level M constructs containing two transcription units each, vector pLP-1 and end-linker pELP-4 are used (Fig. 18[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0018]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fc745570-308b-4f3c-ac90-3631ff2cdf01/cpmb115-fig-0018-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 18\nAssembly of a level P construct.

    "Level P constructs are flanked by two BpiI restriction sites and thus have a similar structure to level 1 constructs (except for the selectable marker). Like level 1 constructs, several level P constructs can be assembled into level M vectors using BpiI. As an example, the level P construct above can be subcloned in a level M vector using a suitable level M end-linker (Fig. 19A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0019]). Level P and compatible level 1 constructs can also be assembled in a level M vector (Fig. 19B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.115#cpmb115-fig-0019]). As discussed for level M constructs, it is important to be sure that all level P vectors are compatible with respect to their fusion sites. The suitability of the fusion sites has to be determined at the beginning of the project, before starting to make level M constructs.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53bca18a-27c4-4659-875b-d39dc401310c/cpmb115-fig-0019-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 19\nAssembly of level M constructs from level P and 1 constructs. (A) One or several level P constructs can be assembled in a compatible level M construct using a compatible level M end-linker. In this example, one level P construct is subcloned in a level M vector. (B) Level P and level 1 vectors can be cloned together in a level M vector. In this example, one transcription unit (TU5) in a level 1 vector position 5 is combined with the level P vector containing four transcription units."
