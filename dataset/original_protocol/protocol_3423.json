    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMost of the steps require maintaining sterile conditions and using a laminar workbench. Any steps that can be performed outside of the laminar workbench are specifically mentioned.\nSeed surface sterilization of jute\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThis step describes how to remove contamination from the jute seeds. Fungal and bacterial contamination of the seeds needs to be controlled at the very beginning of the experiment without damaging the jute seeds. This step describes the protocol of jute sterilization by the application of Bavistin (carbendazim 50%) fungicides, ethanol, sodium hypochlorite and Tween-20.\nExamine JRC212 and JRO524 jute seeds to select only those that are filled and healthy.\nImmerse 150 jute seeds in 5 mL of 0.1% Bavistin solution, a commercially available fungicide, for 10 min.\nCritical: For steps 3–8, perform the procedures within a laminar workbench to maintain aseptic conditions. Proper care should be taken to avoid any contamination during the process.\nRemove seeds from the Bavistin solution.\nWash the selected seeds twice with sterile water for 2 min in a 100 mL conical flask.\nImmerse seeds in 70% ethanol for 4 min with continuous stirring.\nWash seeds with sterile water for 2 min to remove residual ethanol.\nPrepare a mixture (50 mL) of 2% sodium hypochlorite with 2–3 drops of Tween-20.\nImmerse seeds in this solution for 15 min with continuous stirring.\nCover the conical flask with aluminum foil or use an amber-colored conical flask to avoid light exposure.\nNote: Seal the flask's mouth with Parafilm to prevent contamination when stirring using a magnetic stirrer outside of the laminar.\nAlternatives: Instead of a magnetic stirrer, a shaker incubator can also be used, but with a magnetic stirrer, better results are observed.",
    "Critical: Adjust the stirring speed to prevent excessive seed coat detachment from the jute seeds (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Surface sterilization of jute seeds—Demonstrates the surface sterilization process for jute seeds in preparation for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, related to step 7\n    \nNote: The change in solution color from pale yellow to light brown is due to the leaching of seed coat color in the solution.\nWash seeds 3–4 times with sterile water for 5 min each to thoroughly rinse off the sodium hypochlorite solution.\nNote: Continue rinsing thoroughly such that no more foaming (developed by Tween-20 remains) is visible and ensuring that no foam is produced during the final wash, also, getting rid of any residual smell of sodium hypochlorite solution.\nPlace the sterilized seeds on sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper (GE Healthcare, USA Cat# 1001-090) to remove excess water.\nNote: Remove any damaged seeds or any seeds with detached cotyledons in this step.\nJute seed germination\nTiming: 12–24 h\nThis step describes explant preparation for the Agrobacterium-mediated jute transformation. Here the explant is germinated jute seeds. Only water is required as germination medium for the jute seeds.\nCritical: Perform the following steps in a laminar workbench to maintain aseptic conditions.\nPlace the sterilized jute seeds on a filter paper within a petri plate (100 mm).\nAdd 3 mL of sterile water to the petri plate containing the seeds.\nSeal the petri plate with Parafilm.\nCover it with aluminum foil to prevent exposure to light.\nNote: The amount of water required for germination depends on the quantity and size of seeds used in the experiment. For 100–150 seeds, 3 mL is sufficient, and it should be increased as the number of jute seeds increases.",
    "Put the petri plate in an incubator (Being Scientific, USA THZ-98A) at 37°C for a duration of 12–24 h.\nNote: The duration of incubation may vary based on the specific seed cultivars. Tossa jute (C. olitorius) typically requires more time compared to white jute (C. capsularis) cultivars.\nAlternatives: Incubation can also be carried out at 22°C–25°C temperature. However, in such cases, a slightly longer incubation period might be necessary.\nPreparation of bacterial culture media\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes the process of culture media preparation for Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The Luria broth (LB) powder is weighed, dissolved in water and divided into glass tubes. The tubes are sealed and autoclaved. Later kanamycin is added to the media before it solidifies. At the end of this step, we will receive a medium where the Agrobacterium can be selectively grown.\nWeigh 2.0 g of LB powder (HiMedia, India).\nDissolve it in 100 mL of distilled water.\nDistribute 10 mL of the media into each glass tube (Borosil, India Cat# 9820U08).\nSecurely seal the tubes with cotton plugs.\nAutoclave the tubes at 121°C for 20 min at 15 lbs pressure (using a Jeio Tech ST-65G).\nAfter autoclaving, add 10 μL of kanamycin (HiMedia, India) to the 10 mL LB media.\nNote: Add the kanamycin antibiotic to the autoclaved media after it reaches around 45°C.\nPause point: Store the autoclaved LB media-containing tubes at 4°C and use them within 2 weeks.\nCulture of Agrobacterium LBA4404 cells harboring pCAMBIA1301 plant transformation vector\nTiming: 8–12 h\nThis step highlights the process of Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 culture in the above-mentioned LB media. Kanamycin containing LB media is used to grow Agrobacterium cells harboring pCAMBIA1301 plasmid which contain the kanamycin resistant maker gene (nptII).",
    "Add 10 μL of Agrobacterium LBA4404 primary culture to 10 mL of LB media containing kanamycin.\nIncubate the mixture in an incubator shaker at 28°C for 12 h.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) of Agrobacterium LBA4404 culture at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Germany, Model: Biophotometer Plus).\nTransfer the culture to a sterile 50 mL centrifuge falcon tube (Tarsons, India Cat# 546041).\nCentrifuge it at 2600 × g for 5 min at 10°C in a centrifuge (Eppendorf, Germany, Model# 5810R) to pellet the Agrobacterium cells.\nResuspend the pellet in fresh LB media to achieve an OD 0.3; this is equivalent to approximately 1.5 × 108 cells/mL.\nAlternatives: A full loop of Agrobacterium culture from a 4°C stored culture plate can be directly resuspended in fresh ‘infiltration and co-cultivation medium’ to achieve OD 0.3. In this case, there is no need for a 12–14 h grown culture, which is a time saver.\nThe imbibed seed piercing method (ISPM) of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT)\nTiming: 2 months\nThis major step describes Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in jute. Germinated jute seeds are used as explant. A tiny hole is made by piercing the seeds. This facilitates penetration of Agrobacterium cells into the seeds during the vacuum infiltration process. At the end of this step T0 plants will be developed and grow in the greenhouse.\nCritical: Perform the following step 25 to 33, step 35 to 42, and step 44 to 45 in a laminar air flow work bench to maintain aseptic conditions\nPierce imbibed jute seeds with a sterilized needle near the apical meristematic zone of the plumule (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2. Piercing of imbibed jute seeds—Illustrates the technique of piercing imbibed jute seeds, a crucial step in the transformation protocol, related to step 25",
    "Critical: Needles must be flame sterilized and allowed to cool periodically before each piercing. Each seed can be pierced a maximum of two times without permanent damage.\nSoak the pierced seeds in the 'infiltration and co-cultivation medium'.\nCover the soaked seeds with aluminum foil and incubate for 30 min to 1 h in a laminar workbench at 22°C–25°C temperature.\nNote: The 'infiltration and co-cultivation medium' contains Agrobacterium cells (OD 0.3), therefore gentle agitation is necessary during incubation to ensure the cells remain suspended and make contact with the pierced seeds.\nNote: Acetosyringone should be added to the 'infiltration and co-cultivation medium' before introducing the pierced seeds. To ensure proper mixing, pipette the medium 10–20 times.\nNote: The volume of media required depends on the number of seeds used. Typically, 25 mL is suitable for a 100 mm petri plate (Corning, USA Cat# BP94A-01), while 6 mL is sufficient for a 35 mm plate (Tarsons, India Cat# 460035-35MM).\nPut the petri plates, which contain pierced seeds submerged in medium, into a vacuum desiccator chamber, and vacuum infiltrate for 10 min at a pressure of 550 mm Hg (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3. Vacuum infiltration method of Agrobacterium transformation—Provides a visual guide to the vacuum infiltration method used for introducing Agrobacterium into pierced jute seeds during the transformation process, related to step 28\n    \nNote: Ensure that the desiccator is properly cleansed with 70% ethanol and exposed to UV light for 30 min under laminar airflow before use.\nCritical: Vacuum infiltration should not exceed 20 min, to avoid the risk of tissue damage.\nPlace the inoculated seeds on sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper to remove excess Agrobacterium infiltrate.\nAlternatives: Sterile blotting paper can also be used in place of filter paper",
    "Incubate for 5 min to achieve a semi-dry state (until the excess liquid medium is removed from the seed surface).\nTransfer seeds to a 100 mm petri plate on Whatman No. 1 filter paper.\nSaturate the filter paper with 3 mL of co-cultivation medium.\nSeal the petri plate with Parafilm and cover with aluminum foil.\nIncubate at 28°C in the dark for 72 h for co-cultivation.\nNote: The co-cultivation medium here is the same as that in step 26, but without Agrobacterium cells.\nCritical: Ensure that the amount of media is neither excessive nor scarce. Excess media can lead to seed browning and death, while a shortage of media can cause seeds to dry out and die.\nAfter co-cultivation, transfer the seeds to a fresh 100 mm petri plate.\nWash the seeds four times for 5 min each, using only 'Agro-washing medium' without any antibiotic.\nNote: While sterile water can be used for this washing step, using media is recommended as it yields better results.\nSubmerge the seeds in 'Agro-washing medium' with timentin antibiotic (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# PCT1113-2G).\nAlternatives: 1 g/L cefotaxime (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# MB134) can be used as an alternative to timentin for this step.\nIncubate the seeds for 20 min.\nVacuum infiltrate the seeds for 5 min at a pressure of 550 mm Hg.\nCarefully remove the seeds from the antibiotic-containing medium and place them on sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper.\nIncubate the seeds for 45 min to ensure proper drying.\nTransfer the seeds into round screw-cap phyta jars (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# PW1125) containing hygromycin-B (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# PCT1503) in the 'selection medium'.",
    "Cultivate them for a duration of 14 days under controlled culture room conditions: a temperature of 27 ± 2°C, a photoperiod of 16 h of light, and 8 h of darkness.\nAlternatives: Cultivation can be done in petri plates, but it is preferable to use transparent screw-cap bottles or phyta jars for this step, as plants may touch the lids and become bent in the petri plates.\nCritical: The sub-lethal selection concentration of hygromycin-B may vary depending on the cultivar used and should be optimized accordingly. Use 15 mg/L hygromycin-B for JRC212 seeds, and 18 mg/L hygromycin-B for JRO524 seeds.\nNote: The selection media should be freshly prepared, and hygromycin-B should be added after the autoclaved media cools down (around 45°C) but not solidifies.\nTransfer the surviving seedlings once more to the freshly prepared 'selection media' for an additional 14 days as a second round of selection.\nNote: These plants should continue to grow under the same conditions as step 43.\nCritical: It is recommended to transfer five or six plants to each magenta box (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# PW1138) during this step. This ensures that the plants have sufficient space and nutrients for optimal growth.\nTransfer the surviving seedlings once again, this time for a third round of selection in media containing hygromycin under the same conditions as step 43 for another 14 days.\nNote: Performing three rounds of selection significantly increases the chances of selecting the most transformed plants. However, if time is a concern, minimize the duration of the selection process by performing only up to the second round. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to conduct three rounds of selection, each lasting 12–14 days, as hygromycin-B effectiveness diminishes over longer periods, increasing the risk of selecting false-positive plants.",
    "Allow the plants to grow for 10 days in a medium that does not contain hygromycin-B.\nNote: This step is primarily to encourage root development.\nAlternatives: This step is optional and can be skipped if the plants have already developed a healthy root system during the selection process.\nClean the roots of the plants thoroughly using sterile water.\nPlant them in soil in the greenhouse to facilitate further growth and maturation.\nCritical: Take care when cleaning the roots to avoid any damage. Transferring plants to soil with media stuck to roots, increases the risk of fungal contamination.\nJute genomic DNA isolation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step highlights the process of genomic DNA isolation from greenhouse grown transgenic and control jute plants. This is a kit-based plant DNA isolation method but as alternative method of jute DNA isolation the Miniprep12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] method can also be used.\nCollect fully opened young leaves from each plant for genomic DNA isolation.\nWash the leaves twice with ddH2O and blot dry.\nUse a commercial plant DNA isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany Cat# 740770) and isolate genomic DNA by following the kit’s instructions.\nNote: The kit’s instructions (DNA isolation protocol) are available at the link[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/NucleoSpin%20Plant%20II%20Genomic%20DNA%20Purification%20User%20Manual%20%28PT5028/NucleoSpin%20Plant%20II%20Genomic%20DNA%20Purification%20User%20Manual%20%28PT5028-1%29_Rev_09.pdf].\nMeasure the concentration of isolated DNA using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA NanoDrop 2000C).\nPCR primer design\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step highlights PCR primer design for hptII gene (hygromycin phosphotransferase) of pCAMBIA1301 using the online tool-PrimerQuest (free access). The accession number for the gene sequence to be downloaded is provided below. After this step the primer sequences are generated.\nDownload the sequence of the hygromycin-B-resistant hptII gene of pCAMBIA1301 using GenBank: AF234297 (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3188-Mmc1.extension]).\nUse the hptII gene sequence as the input for primer design in the PrimerQuest Tool, available at the link[href=https://sg.idtdna.com/pages/tools/primerquest?returnurl=%2FPrimerquest%2FHome%2FIndex].",
    "Run the tool using its default settings for the PCR primers.\nAlternatives: Primer3web (https://primer3.ut.ee[href=https://primer3.ut.ee/]) is another (free access) software for primer designing.\nSelect a primer set from the list of multiple suggestions provided in the PrimerQuest Tool.\nOrder the forward (5′-GAAATTGCCGTCAACCAAGCTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCGAGAGCCTGACCTATTGCATC-3′) primers for synthesis from IDT, USA.\nAlternatives: Primers can be ordered from any reliable service provider.\nScreening of hptII gene in transformed jute plants though PCR\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes the PCR conditions for the process of amplification of the hptII gene. This is a validation step for the transgenic integration of the hptII gene in the jute genome.\nIn a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, mix the following reagents. Thaw reagents on ice and keep reagents on ice until use.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3188_6.csv\nNote: Prepare a working stock of 100 ng/μL of plant genomic DNA to use as a sample in the PCR reaction mixture.\nNote: Mix all the components by repetitive pipetting and give a pulse spin before putting into the thermal cycler.\nDistribute 24 μL of PCR master mix into 0.2 mL PCR tubes.\nIn each PCR tube, add and mix by pipetting 1 μL of genomic DNA (100 ng/μL) from the tested plant.\nSet the program as follows in a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA Proflex PCR System) for 35 cycles.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3188_7.csv\nRun the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel using an electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad, USA Model: PowerPac Basic).\nDetermine the band size by comparing it with a 1 kb DNA ladder (Thermo Scientific, USA Cat# SM0311).\nIn the agarose gel, a 599 bp amplified product of the hptII gene should be visible."
