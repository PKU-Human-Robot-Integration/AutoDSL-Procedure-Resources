    "The study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee in Guangzhou First People’s Hospital in China. Signed informed consent forms were received from healthy volunteers and participants prior to participation. All of the studies were conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Subject Preparation\nEnsure that each participant meets the following criteria for chronic spinal cord compression: a) a history of loss of significant neurological function, b) a positive myelopathy physical examination, and c) MRI evidence of cervical cord compression. \nNOTE: The exclusion criteria are a) incapability of providing written consent and b) inability to obtain DTI parameters of artifacts. For controls, inclusion criteria are a) no history of significant back or neck injuries, neurological disorders, or spine surgeries; b) no MRI evidence of cervical cord compression.\nsk each participant to complete and sign a consent form that lists MRI safety guidelines and the imaging protocol. Specifically, patients with chronic spinal cord compression are examined by MRI preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively.\nrovide earplugs for each participant. Place them in a supine position with a head/neck coil enclosing the cervical region, and a landmark at the thyroid cartilage level. Ensure that each participant is in a comfortable position that effectively reduces movement.\n2. Structural MRI Parameters \nNOTE: Anatomical T1-weighted (T1 W) images, T2-weighted (T2 W) images, and DTI acquired on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner with a 16-channel head coil.\nUse fast perturbation gradient echo (FPGR) for localization scanning to obtain axial, sagittal, and coronal position maps.\nPosition the sagittal positioning line with the coronal position maps to ensure that the positioning baseline is parallel to the spinal canal (spinal cord); first locate the sagittal plane T2 W, then copy and paste the sagittal T1 W positioning line to the T2 W positioning line.",
    "Use the following imaging parameters for T1 W and T2 W sagittal imaging: field of view (FOV) = 240 mm x 240 mm, voxel size = 1.0 mm x 0.8 mm x 3.0 mm, slice gap = 0.3 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, number of excitation (NEX) = 2, fold-over direction = feet/head (FH), and time of echo (TE)/time of repetition (TR) = 10/700 ms (T1 W) and 101/2,500 ms (T2 W). Obtain nine sagittal images covering the entire cervical spinal cord. \nPosition the axial positioning line on the sagittal T2 W image and cover the intervertebral disc from C2/3 to C6/7, centering on the anteroposterior diameter of the intervertebral space. Use the following imaging parameters: FOV = 180 mm x 180 mm, voxel size = 0.7 mm x 0.6 mm x 3.0 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, fold-over direction = anterior/posterior (AP), NEX = 2, and TE/TR = 120/3,000 ms.\nPosition the axial positioning line on the sagittal T2 W image, centering on the anteroposterior diameter of the intervertebral space, with 45 slices covering the cervical spinal cord from C1 to C7.\nObtain DTI via the following sequence: single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) with 20 orthogonal directions. Non-coplanar diffusion directions with b-value = 800 s/mm2. \nUse the following imaging parameters: FOV = 230 mm x 230 mm, acquisition matrix = 98 x 98, reconstructed resolution = 1.17 x 1.17, slice thickness = 3 mm, fold-over direction = AP, NEX = 2, EPI factor = 98, and TE/TR = 74/8,300 ms. Provide a time course summarizing the steps in the MRI protocol, as shown in Figure 1. \nNOTE: The time course summarizing the MRI and DTI protocol is shown in Figure 1.\n3. Image Postprocessing and Data Measurement Indexes",
    "Automatically convey all scanning images to the Syngo MR B17. Load the T2 W sagittal and axial imaging of the intervertebral space in the filming interface and find the most compressed portion of the cervical spinal cord.\nIn the 2:1 viewing interface, load the FA image and click the Position Display: Series tab. Count and record the level of highest compression from the top to the bottom of the location map.\nClick the File tab to select the tensor image, then use the applications toolbar at the top left of the screen to select Neuro 3D(MR) to automatically create ADC and FA colormaps.\nTurn to the level of the highest compression site, and create spherical regions of interest (ROIs) of identical volumes (with a size of 6 mm3) using the Start Evaluation Mode tab. The ROIs must be selected, including the inner spinal cord to exclude the partial volume effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nCalculate and display the FA and ADC values at the bottom right of the screen automatically. Display the E1, E2, and E3 values by clicking the Diffusion toolbar and choosing them.\nNOTE: All measurements were performed by two radiologists blinded to the patients’ clinical details. The final results were determined as the average of the two.\nPerform image processing of the DTI datasets using a Syngo MR B17 Advantage Workstation, following the steps in Figure 2.\nSubscription Required.
