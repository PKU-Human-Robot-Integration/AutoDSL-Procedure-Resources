    "1. Enucleation and Post-Fixation\nThis protocol assumes that the subject has been implanted unilaterally with a suprachoroidal electrode array.\nPrepare postfix solutions in glass Schott bottles.\n\t\nDavidson's fixative solution, 2x 100 ml\n\t\t\n2 ml formalin (37% formaldehyde)\n10 ml glacial acetic acid (99.7%)\n35 ml ethanol (98%)\n53 ml distilled water\n50% ethanol, 2x 100 ml\n70% ethanol, 2x 100 ml\nTranscardially perfuse subject with warm (37 °C) heparinized saline followed by cold (4 °C) neutral buffered formalin (10%).\nTie sutures at the superior limbus (or a location that is remote from the suprachoroidal array) of both eyes - in line with a rectus muscle, to serve as a landmark.\nEnucleate eyes, maintaining any external leads from the implanted eye.\nPlace each eye in 100 ml of Davidson's fixative solution and leave to post-fix at room temperature.\nAfter 18 - 36 hr in Davidson's fixative, transfer to 50% ethanol (room temperature) for 6 - 8 hr, then finally to 70% ethanol (room temperature).\nRefrigerate samples at 4 °C and store until dissection.\nIntact and pressurized eye globes have been stored in this manner for up to 3 months without adversely affecting the resultant histology.\n2. Identification and Tissue Mapping\nThe above fixation protocol (step 1) has rendered the sclera translucent and the array is now visible - including the individual electrode sites (Figure 3).\nRemove the implanted globe from ethanol and carefully trim away excess tissue, including conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule. Trim optic nerve to a 2 - 3 mm length (Figure 3A).\nUsing a histological dye marking scheme, label the electrodes with a predefined color code, taking care not to smudge the dye.",
    "We chose a commercially available suite of specialized histological dye (refer to appendix). Small amounts of the dye were carefully applied with a fine tipped paint brush (Roymac size 00) to the tissue and allowed to air dry for up to 5 min.\nFor our purposes, we have chosen: green for the active electrode(s) that was(were) stimulated maximally, at suprathreshold levels, for the duration of the study; red for other active electrodes; yellow for the larger diameter return electrodes; and blue for additional guides and/or anatomical distance markings (Figures 3B and 3C).\nSome trial and error may be required to find a dye that is stable throughout the subsequent steps. For example, in Figure 4, it can be seen that the green dye was more resilient than the red dye. Diluting the dye in 70% ethanol helps improve lipid penetration and tissue coating.\nIt is useful to sketch or photograph the dyed globe for future reference.\nReturn to 70% ethanol to dehydrate the dye.\nRepeat step 2.1 for the unimplanted control globe.\nUsing the sutures from step 1.3, align the control eye and the implanted eye as a mirrored pair.\nPlace a silicone template (with the same dimensions as the electrode array) in the mirrored location on the control eye as the implant is located on implanted eye (N.B. the translucent sclera and the dye markings from step 2.2 allow ready visualization of the implanted array position).\nPerform steps 2.2 and 2.3 for the control eye, so that each implanted electrode site has a control pair in an anatomically comparable (i.e. mirror matched equivalent) location.\n3. Dissection and Embedding\nRemove the implant array from the eye and remove the front of the eye (including the cornea, iris and lens). Remove the vitreous fluid from the remaining eye cup (posterior chamber).",
    "Dissect the implanted eye into multiple representative strips (~2 mm thickness) each containing a subset of the dye marked regions (Figure 3D). Note that the orientation of the strips should be selected to assist in assessing various aspects of the tissue response to the implant7.\nIt is useful, for future reference, to make a record of which dye regions are present on each strip and their relative locations (and colors).\nPlace the strip on its side into a shallow pool of liquefied agar (4%; 80 - 90 °C) with the side to be cut first facing downwards (Figure 3E).\nOnce the agar has set, cut around the sample and place into a tissue cassette supported by foam inserts (Figure 3F).\nRepeat steps 3.1-3.3 for the control eye - taking care to dissect mirror-matched strips.\nProcess all cassettes via standard (automated overnight) paraffin processing technique.\nEmbed processed tissue in paraffin with the side to be cut first facing downwards.\n4. Cutting and Staining\nCut paraffin blocks into 5 μm sections referring regularly to the notes from Steps 2 and 3.\nCollect sections from each of the dyed regions and mount on slides.\nThe region immediately adjacent to each dyed spot of sclera can now be assessed with confidence that it was in closest proximity to the corresponding electrode in the array (Figure 4).\nStain or perform immunofluorescence as desired. Example stains and immunohistochemistry shown in Figure 5 are: H&E; Luxol fast blue (LFB); cresyl violet; Masson's trichrome blue; periodic acid schiff (PAS); Perls' Prussian blue stain; anti-glutamine synthetase (GS); anti-neurofilament protein (NF); anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).\nStandard and special stains were performed as detailed:\n\t\nH&E staining was performed according to the protocol provided by Leica multistainer bath array ST5020 (Leica Biosystems).",
    "LFB and cresyl violet (modified from 11):\n\t\t\nDewax in 3 changes of xylene (3x 2 min) and 2 changes of ethanol (100%, 100%) (2x 1 min) and rinse in tap water (45 sec).\nHydrate sections to 95% ethanol.\nPlace in LFB solution 11 at 37 - 42 °C (overnight).\nRinse off excess stain with 70% ethanol.\nRinse in distilled water.\nPlace in dilute lithium carbonate (8%) (few seconds).\nDifferentiate in 70% ethanol (few seconds).\nRinse in distilled water.\nRepeat steps 4.4.2.6 to 4.4.2.8, if necessary, until background is colorless.\nPlace in cresyl violet acetate working solution at 37 °C (10 min).\nDo not wash in water.\nDehydrate in 3 changes of absolute alcohol (1x 30 sec, 2x 20 sec) and 3 changes of xylene (1x 1 min 30 sec, 2x 1 min).\nMount and coverslip with DPX.\nMasson's trichrome blue (modified from 11):\n\t\t\nDewax as per 4.4.2.1.\nBring sections to water (2 min).\nStain the nuclei using Weigert's iron haematoxylin (2 min).\nWash in tap water, rinse in distilled water.\nStain in Biebrich scarlet-acid fuchsin solution (5 min).\nRinse in distilled water.\nDifferentiate in phosphomolybdic-phosphotungstic acid until collagen is pale pink (6 min).\nRinse in distilled water.\nCounterstain in aniline blue (1 min).\nWash well in 1% acetic acid (1 min).\nDehydrate, mount and coverslip as per 4.4.2.12 and 4.4.2.13.\nPAS (modified from 11):\n\t\t\nDewax as per 4.4.2.1.\nOxidize in 1% periodic acid (15 min).\nWash in running water then distilled water.\nStain in Schiff's reagent (15 min).\nWash in water (5 min).\nCounterstain with Harris haematoxylin (1 min).\nWash briefly in tap water.\nDifferentiate in 0.5% acid alcohol (1 dip).\nWash well in tap water.\nBlue in Scott's tap water (1 min).\nWash well in water.\nDehydrate, mount and coverslip as per 4.4.2.12 and 4.4.2.13.",
