    "Labeling of nascent transcripts The following steps achieve labeling of nascent transcripts with bromouridine to enable isolation of these transcripts via immunoprecipitation in Section D. 5-bromouridine is incorporated by all RNA polymerases actively transcribing during incubation of cells with 5-bromouridine.Grow cells in 10 cm culture plates in a total of 10 mL of culture medium. For section C, 250 μg of total RNA is required. Scale the number of plates according to the type of cell line and yield from the protocol of total RNA extraction. For HEK293 cells, use a total of 3 × 10 cm plates or a single 15 cm plate per condition (~20 × 106 cells).When the cell population has reached approximately 70% confluency, remove the cell medium and replace it with 10 mL of fresh cell medium containing 400 μL of 50 mM 5-bromouridine (2 mM 5-bromouridine final concentration). If using a 15 cm plate, scale up accordingly by using 20 mL of fresh cell medium containing 800 μL of 50 mM 5-bromouridine.Place plate with cells in a humidifying incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min (see Note 1).Obtain a no-bromouridine negative control sample to rule out unspecific enrichment of RNA after immunoprecipitation. Perform the labeling protocol with the number of plates used per condition, excluding 5-bromouridine from the fresh cell medium in step A2.Remove cell medium, add 1 mL of TRIzol reagent to dissociate cells from the culture plate, and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. If using a 15 cm plate, harvest in at least 3 mL of TRIzol reagent.Pipette the lysate up and down to homogenize.The following sections should be performed with special care to not contaminate RNA samples, which could result in RNA degradation by RNases. Use RNase-free certified plasticware and filter tips.",
    "Total RNA extraction Add 0.2 mL of chloroform per 1 mL of TRIzol lysate, securely cap the tube, and thoroughly mix by shaking for ~30 s.Centrifuge the sample at 12,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube by angling the tube at 45° and pipetting the solution out.Add an equal volume of isopropanol to the aqueous phase, mix by pipetting up and down, and incubate for 10 min at 4 °C.Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Total RNA precipitate forms a white, gel-like pellet at the bottom of the tube.Remove the solution by pipetting. Avoid removing the RNA pellet, which should be located below the hinge of the microcentrifuge tube as a white pellet.Gently add 1 mL of ice-cold 80% ethanol and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the 80% ethanol solution by pipetting out and pulse-spin the 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube in a mini-centrifuge, to bring any residual ethanol from the sides of the tube down to the bottom.Using a P20 pipette and tip, remove the remaining solution.Resuspend the RNA pellet in 100 μL of RNase-free water, or in 300 μL if starting from a 15 cm plate.Quantify the concentration of RNA using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.We suggest ruling out RNA fragmentation during the extraction of total RNA by analyzing RNA quality by your method of choice (i.e., Bioanalyzer, TapeStation, or RNA gel electrophoresis analysis). For RNA gel electrophoresis, we load 2 μL of the total RNA sample and 3 μL of GeneRuler 1 kb Plus DNA ladder into a 1% agarose gel in 1× TBE buffer and apply 140 V for 1 h (Figure 2A) (see Note 2).",
    "Store the RNA samples in a freezer at -80 °C or continue with Section C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4828/bioprotoc-13-18-4828-g002.jpgFigure 2. Gel electrophoresis of MNase digested total RNA. Nascent transcripts of HEK293 cells were pulse-labeled with 5-bromouridine for 30 min and total RNA was extracted. Shown is the purified total RNA sample before (A) and after fragmentation with MNase (B), for three biological replicates.RNA fragmentation with MNase Fragmentation of total RNA with MNase before immunoprecipitation results in enrichment of only the region of pre-mRNA molecules that is labeled with 5-bromouridine. In addition, MNase digestion creates RNA molecules of a suitable size for library preparation in Section G.The procedures described in Sections C and D have been performed uninterrupted. Before starting, consider that this protocol does not include a stopping point between these sections. If a stopping point is necessary, we propose to complete step C4 in this section and place the fragmented RNA on ice until this sample is used in step D6 within 24 h.Mix 250 μg of total RNA, 25 μL of 5 M NaCl, and 50 μL of 10× MNase reaction buffer in a 1.7 mL tube and bring to a total volume of 500 μL with nuclease-free water. Mix by pipetting up and down.Incubate samples at 37 °C for 5 min.Add 5 μL of a 1:20 dilution of MNase (100,000 gel units/mL), mix by pipetting up and down, and incubate for 1 min.Stop the reaction by adding 10 μL of 0.5 M EGTA. Mix well and place sample on ice until completing step D5.Evaluate RNA fragmentation by performing a gel electrophoresis using 2–4 μL of fragmented RNA (1–2 μg). RNA fragments should range from ~1.5 kb to ~100 bp in length. (Figure 2B).",
    "Immunoprecipitation of nascent transcripts The following steps enrich bromouridine-labeled nascent RNA transcripts via specific binding to a mouse BrdU antibody conjugated to protein G magnetic beads while washing away unlabeled RNA.Wash protein G magnetic beads with IP buffer. Transfer 50 μL of well-mixed protein G magnetic beads–containing solution into a 1.7 mL tube and follow the steps below to wash the beads:Place the 1.7 mL tube on the magnet stand to immobilize the beads.When the solution has cleared completely and all beads are immobilized on the wall of the tube, remove the supernatant by pipetting out and add 500 μL of IP buffer.Remove the tube from the magnet stand and resuspend beads by pipetting up and down gently until all beads are dissociated and no clumps of beads are observed. Place back on the magnet stand.When the solution has cleared completely and all beads are immobilized on the wall of the tube, remove the supernatant by pipetting out.Add 1 mL of IP buffer to the washed beads and remove from the magnet stand.Conjugate mouse anti-BrdU antibody to protein G magnetic beads. Add 8 μL of antiBrdU antibody (4 μg) to the 1 mL of IP buffer containing the protein G magnetic beads, mix by pipetting up and down, and incubate the sample at 4 °C rotating end-to-end for 1 h. If the stopping point proposed in section C is included, this incubation can be performed overnight.Wash conjugated anti-BrdU antibody and beads with IP buffer by performing the wash procedure described in step D1 (a–d) three times.Add 1 mL of IP buffer to the beads and remove tube from the magnet stand.",
    "Add the fragmented RNA from step C4 to the tube containing the beads, mix by pipetting up and down, and incubate the sample at 4 °C rotating end-to-end for 1 h (see Note 3).Wash beads with IP buffer by performing the wash procedure described in step D1 (a–d) three times. Leave the tube on the magnet stand after the last wash.Without disturbing the beads, add 500 μL of RNase-free 1× PBS, incubate for 30 s, and remove the supernatant by pipetting out.Remove tube from the magnet stand, add 20 μL of nuclease-free water, resuspend beads by pipetting up and down, and transfer to a PCR tube.Place the tube on a thermal cycler and run the following program to elute the antibody and nascent transcripts from the beads: 90 °C for 5 min, 12 °C for 30 s, with heated lid at 105 °C.Vortex and transfer the sample to a 1.5 mL tube.Place the 1.5 mL tube on the magnet stand and, when the solution has cleared, transfer the supernatant into a clean 1.5 mL tube.Measure the RNA concentration of the sample using the QubitTM RNA High Sensitivity Assay kit. The expected concentration of specific enrichment of nascent transcript from HEK293 cells following this protocol is ~9–15 ng/μL with a total RNA yield of ~180–300 ng. The no-bromouridine negative control sample should not contain detectable signal by the Qubit Assay (< 0.2 ng/μL). Detection of RNA in this negative control suggests low efficiency of the washes after the immunoprecipitation.Repair of MNase-fragmented RNA 3′-end RNA fragmentation by MNase creates 3′ phosphate groups (Alexander et al., 1961). These can be converted to 3′OH RNA ends by T4 polynucleotide kinase, required for ligation to a 3′ adaptor during library preparation in section G.",
    "This reaction is performed in the absence of ATP, precluding installation of non-native 5′-PO4 groups on RNA molecules by this enzyme.Transfer 150 ng of nascent transcripts into a 1.5 mL tube, add 5 μL of 10× reaction buffer A, add RNase-free water to bring the solution up to 49 μL, and mix by pipetting up and down.Add 1 μL of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 U) and incubate at 30 °C for 30 min.In-column RNA purification Purify the RNA from the in vitro reaction using any affinity micro-column purification protocol that elutes the RNA in a small quantity (< 20 μL). We used the RNA Clean & ConcentratorTM-5 cleanup kit described below.Add two volumes of RNA binding buffer to each sample and mix by pipetting up and down.Add an equal volume of ethanol (95%–100%) and mix by pipetting up and down.Transfer the sample to the Zymo-SpinTM IC column in a collection tube and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 30 s. Discard the flowthrough.Skip the DNase I treatment step, add 400 μL of RNA prep buffer to the column, and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 30 s. Discard the flowthrough.Add 700 μL of RNA wash buffer to the column and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 30 s. Discard the flowthrough.Add 400 μL of RNA wash buffer to the column and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min. Ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Carefully, transfer the column into a RNase-free tube.Add 15 μL of DNase/RNase-free water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min to elute the RNA.Measure the RNA concentration of the sample using the QubitTM RNA High Sensitivity Assay kit (expected to be approximately 6 ng/μL). Continue to section G or freeze the RNA sample at -80 °C.",
    "Preparation of 5′-PO4 Bru-Seq libraries Preparation of 5′-PO4 Bru-Seq libraries can be achieved using a library preparation protocol to detect miRNAs. In this protocol, we employed the QIAseq miRNA library kit, including 10-base UMIs. Transcripts with 5′ ends other than a monophosphate, including cap structures, are excluded because they cannot be ligated to the 5′ adaptor. Follow the steps in the manufacturer’s protocol with the specific conditions described below:Prepare reagents required for the 3′ ligation reactions. Thaw QIAseq miRNA NGS 3′ adapter, QIAseq miRNA NGS 3′ buffer, 2× miRNA ligation activator, and nuclease-free water at room temperature (15–25 °C). Mix each solution by flicking the tubes.

    "Incubate for 1 h at 50 °C.Incubate for 15 min at 70 °C.Hold at 4 °C for at least 5 min.Prepare QIAseq miRNA NGS beads (QMN beads). Thoroughly vortex QIAseq beads and QIAseq miRNA NGS bead binding buffer to ensure that the beads are in suspension and homogenously distributed. Do not centrifuge the reagents. Important: QIAseq beads need to be homogenous. This necessitates working quickly and thoroughly resuspending the beads immediately before use. If a delay in the protocol occurs, simply vortex the beads again.Carefully add 400 μL of QIAseq beads (bead storage buffer is viscous) to a 2 mL microfuge tube. This quantity of beads is sufficient to perform “Protocol: cDNA Cleanup” and the cleanup associated with library amplification for one sample. Briefly centrifuge and immediately separate beads on a magnet stand.When beads have fully migrated, carefully remove and discard the supernatant.Remove the tube from the magnet stand and carefully pipette (buffer is viscous) 150 μL of QIAseq miRNA NGS bead binding buffer onto the beads.

Remove the ethanol with a 200 μL pipette first, and then use a 10 μL pipette to remove any residual ethanol.With the beads still on the magnetic stand, air-dry at room temperature for 10 min. Residual ethanol can hinder amplification efficiency in the subsequent library amplification reactions. Depending on humidity, extended drying time may be required.With the beads still on the magnetic stand, elute the DNA by adding 17 μL of nuclease-free water to the tubes. Subsequently close/cover and remove the tubes/plates from the magnetic stand.Carefully pipette up and down until all the beads are thoroughly resuspended, briefly centrifuge, and incubate at room temperature for 2 min.Return the tubes to the magnetic stand for ~2 min or until the beads have fully migrated.
