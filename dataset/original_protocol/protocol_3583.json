The exact instrumental configuration described here may be different from instruments made by other manufacturers. For the imaging software, we used Prairie View (Bruker).\nTune the laser to 925 nm and image the sample using the 60× objective lens, such that the cell body of the neuron of interest can be located and visualized based on the dim baseline fluorescence of PA-GFP (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/508-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Photo-labeling individual neurons or groups of neurons\n(A) Under a broadly expressed transgenic line in the Drosophila brain, many neurons express the native form of PA-GFP (gray arrows).\n(B) In addition to the native form of PA-GFP expression driven by the same transgenic line as in (A), A red fluorescent protein, DsRed, is expressed in the mushroom body to visualize its dorsal accessory calyx (white dashed outline); (inset) the dorsal accessory calyx is outlined by white dashed lines and targeted for the photo-labeling procedure.",
    "(C) A single PLPPN was photo-labeled by targeting its soma (white arrow) and imaged using two-photon microscopy. The entire morphology of the photo-labeled neuron is clearly distinguishable from other neurons that also express PA-GFP, but were not photo-labeled (gray arrow). The morphological features of the photo-labeled neuron — such as its axonal projections and presynaptic boutons (yellow arrows) are clearly visible.\n(D) A group of PLPPNs (white arrows) was photo-labeled by targeting the dorsal accessory calyx of the mushroom body (white dashed outline) and imaged using two-photon microscopy.\n(E) The sample with the photo-labeled PLPPN in (C) was immuno-stained using the nc82 antibody (magenta) and imaged using confocal microscopy.\n(F) The sample with a group of photo-labeled PLPPNs in (D) was immuno-stained using the nc82 antibody (magenta) and imaged using confocal microscopy. The morphological features of the photo-labeled neurons, including their dendritic branches, axonal projection, and presynaptic boutons (yellow arrows), were visible once the photo-labeling procedure was complete. The following genotype was used in this figure: yw/yw; MB247-DsRedunknown, UAS-C3PA-GFPunknown/UAS-C3PA-GFPattP40; UAS-C3PA-GFPattP2, UAS-C3PA-GFPVK00005, UAS-C3PA-GFPVK00027/R19H07-GAL4attP2;. Scale bar, 20 μm in all panels. Figure reprinted with permission from Li et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nDefine a region of interest (we used the ROI function that is available with the Prairie View software) around or within the cell body of the targeted neuron (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/508-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Defining a region of interest (ROI) for the photo-labeling procedure on the targeted neuron\nFirst, image the targeted neuron (white) at the highest magnification possible, until its soma almost occupies the entire imaging window. Then select the ROI function tab (cyan arrow) on the imaging software, then create a small area (cyan square) on the center of the soma of the targeted neuron. This small area (cyan square) is the region targeted for the photo-labeling procedure.",
    "In live scan mode, image the sample at the highest magnification, such that the cell body of the neuron of interest occupies most of the imaging window (we used 32× digital zoom).\nSelect a z plane in which the PA-GFP signal is the strongest; acquire a single scan at that plane; on the acquired scan, define a 1.0 μm by 1.0 μm region of interest in the center of, or around, the cell body.\nStop the live scan mode.\nSet up the photo-labeling cycle (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/508-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Setting up the photo-labeling cycle for photo-labeling an individual neuron on the imaging software user interface\nSee step 4 under photo-label individual neurons[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] for setting up the parameters for the photo-labeling procedure.\nTune the laser to 710 nm.\nConfigure the imaging software using the parameters listed for photo-labeling individual neurons (see the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nPerform a timed sequence acquisition of the region of interest defined in step 3b; set the number of repetitions in the sequence to 70 and the period — the resting time between each repetition — to 10 s.\nCritical: To obtain optimal results, it is important to photo-convert a sufficient number of PA-GFP molecules in the neuron of interest, while preventing the neuron from being damaged. The laser power required for photo-labeling individual neurons varies from sample to sample and should be adjusted accordingly. For example, we used a total laser power value that was within the range of 11 to 22 mW.\nRun the photo-labeling cycle.\nWait 15 min after the completion of the photo-labeling cycle to allow the sample to recover; repeat the photo-labeling cycle once or twice, depending on the results but always allow for a 15-min recovery period in between cycles.\nImage the photo-labeled neuron:\nTune the laser to 925 nm.",
    "Configure the imaging software using the listed parameters for the live scan mode, such that the entire brain volume encompassing the photo-labeled neuron can be imaged (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nAcquire the image sequence (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nImmunolabel the brain for confocal imaging\nTiming: 3 days\nThis procedure can be used to immuno-stain samples in which individual neurons were successfully photo-labeled.\nNote: The time required for the following steps may be different from other experiments that also require fixing a Drosophila brain for confocal imaging. We do the following for fixing a brain sample for imaging photo-labeled neurons under the confocal microscope.\nNote: Each row of the culture plate is numbered, from 1 to 12, and each column is labeled with a letter, from A to F. We refer to each well by its respective number and letter. For example, the first well in the first row is referred to as “well 1A.”\nDay 1. In a 72-well culture plate add 12 μL 2% PFA solution in well 1A.\nTransfer the brain sample from the imaging dish to well 1A; incubate for 45 min at room temperature (22°C–28°C).\nNote: Use a CryoLoop to avoid damaging the brain while transferring it between wells.\nNote: For optimal results, do not store more than one brain in the same well. Each column can be used for treating a brain.\nNote: To prevent the brain from dehydrating, keep it completely submerged in the solution at all times; to keep the humidity high in the culture plate, place a damp piece of tissue paper, such as KimWipes, in the plate, but not over the sample, and keep the plate covered in between steps.\nAdd 12 μL of PBST in well 2A to 6A.\nWash the brain 5 times by sequentially transferring the brain between wells:",
    "Wash the brain for 1 min for the first 3 washes (well 2A, 3A, and 4A).\nWash the brain for 15 min for the last 2 washes (well 5A and 6A).\nMeanwhile, add 12 μL of stocker blocker solution to well 7A; once the last wash is completed, transfer the brain to well 7A; incubate for 30 min at room temperature (22°C–28°C).\nMeanwhile, prepare the primary antibody solution by diluting the mouse anti-nc82 antibody in the stocker blocker solution (1:20).\nNote: For optimal results, make the primary antibody solution on the same day when it is used. Store the solution at 4°C.\nAdd 12 μL of the primary antibody solution to well 8A and transfer the brain to this well when step 12 is complete.\nCover the culture plate and seal it with parafilm; incubate overnight (at least 24 h) at 4°C.\nNote: For optimal results, incubate the brain in the primary antibody solution for 24 h.\nDay 2. Using a vacuum line, remove any remaining solution from wells 2A to 5A; refill these wells with 12 μL PBST.\nWash the brain 4 times by sequentially transferring the brain between wells:\nWash the brain for 1 min for the first 2 washes (well 2A and 3A).\nWash the brain for 15 min for the last 2 washes (well 4A and 5A).\nMeanwhile, make the secondary antibody solution by diluting the Alexa Fluor 633 goat-anti-mouse antibody in stocker blocker solution (1:500); store the solution at 4°C in the dark until it is used.\nNote: For optimal results, make the secondary antibody solution on the same day when it is used. Store the solution at 4°C in dark.\nAdd 12 μL of the secondary antibody solution to well 9A; incubate overnight (at least 24 h) at 4°C in the dark.",
    "Day 3. Wash the sample by repeating steps 16 and 17.\nMount the brain on a glass microscope slide:\nStack two reinforcement stickers on top of each other and place the stack in the center of a glass microscope slide.\nAdd a small drop of VECTASHIELD mounting medium to the center of the stack of reinforcement stickers.\nTransfer the brain to the mounting medium and place it in the desired orientation.\nPlace a round, glass coverslip on top of the stack of reinforcement stickers.\nSeal the edge of the coverslip to the slide with nail polish. Keep the slide in the dark until the nail polish hardens.\nNote: When placing the coverslip on top of the stack of reinforcement stickers, avoid creating large air bubbles within the mounting medium, as they may displace the brain.\nImage the brain with the photo-labeled neuron under a confocal microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nPhoto-label a group of neurons\nTiming: 45–75 min\nThis protocol can be used to photo-label a group of neurons that project to a common brain area.\nConfigure the imaging software on the two-photon microscope using the live scan parameters outlined in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nTune the laser to 925 nm and image the sample using the 60× objective lens, such that the brain area of interest can be located and visualized (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: The brain area of interest is visualized by expression of an independent fluorophore.\nDefine a region of interest around or within the brain region of interest (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/508-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(A) After taking a z series of the brain region targeted for the photo-labeling procedure (green dashed outline, here only showing a single plane of the z series), select the PA mask function tab on the imaging software (green arrow).\n(B) On each plane of the z series, define an area of the targeted brain region (green) for the photo-labeling procedure. Save the mask (red arrow) after a ROI is defined in every plane of the z series.\nIn live scan mode, image the sample at the highest magnification such that the brain region of interest occupies most of the imaging window (we used 5× digital zoom).\nAcquire a series of scans that span across the volume of the region of interest.\nDefine the area within the series of scan that is to be photo-labeled (we used the “PA Mask” function that is available with the Prairie View software).\nSet up the photo-labeling cycle (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/508-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Setting up the photo-labeling cycle for photo-labeling neuronal groups on the imaging software user interface\nSee step 26 under photo-label a group of neuron[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] for setting up the parameters for the photo-labeling procedure.\nTune the laser to 710 nm.\nConfigure the imaging software using the parameters listed for photo-labeling groups of neurons (see the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nPerform a timed sequence acquisition of the region of interest defined in step 25; set the number of repetitions in the sequence to 30 and the period — the resting time between each repetition — to 30 s.\nNote: For optimal results, use a z series that is comprised of 5 to 10 planes. The distance between each plane should be at least 2 μm but not more than 5 μm.",
    "Critical: As when photo-labeling individual neurons, it is important to photo-convert a sufficient number of PA-GFP molecules in the neurons of interest, while avoiding causing damage to these neurons.
