    "The care and treatment of animals in this protocol were performed under the supervision and approval of the Tel Aviv University Committee for Animal Ethics.\n1. MFC preparation\nPDMS casting in primary molds (Figure 1)\n\t\nPurchase or create primary molds (wafers) following a detailed protocol9.\nUse pressurized air to remove any type of dirt from the wafer platform before proceeding to the coating step. The surface of the wafers should look smooth and clear.\nFill a container with 50 mL of liquid nitrogen. Prepare a 10 mL syringe and 23 G needle.\n\t\tNOTE: All procedures from this step forward must be performed in a chemical hood.\nIn the chemical hood, use the syringe and needle to pool 2 mL of liquid nitrogen. Though it may seem like air was drawn, the syringe is filled with nitrogen (Figure 1A). Place the wafer-containing plate in a sealable container.\nScrew open a chlorotrimethylsilane bottle, pierce the rubber cap using the nitrogen-filled syringe, and inject the entire contents of the syringe into the bottle. Without pulling out the needle, turn the bottle upside down and draw back 2 mL of chlorotrimethylsilane.\n\t\tNOTE: Because of the syringe pressure, a small amount of chlorotrimethylsilane is sprayed out of the needle. To avoid a hazard, point the needle toward the inner wall of the hood (Figure 1B).\nSpread chlorotrimethylsilane uniformly in the container (from step 1.1.4), but not directly on the wafer or wafer-containing plate. Close the container and incubate for 5 min per wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: If this is the first time the wafer is coated with chlorotrimethylsilane, a 1 h incubation should be allowed for each wafer.\nDo not take the wafers and container out of the chemical hood for 30 min.\n\t\tCAUTION: Chlorotrimethylsilane is highly volatile.",
    "Weigh the PDMS base (see Table of Materials) in a 50 mL tube and add PDMS curing agent at a ratio of 16:1 respectively (e.g., 47.05 g of base and 2.95 g of curing agent). Mix for 10 min using a low speed rotator.\nPour PDMS into each wafer-containing plate to the desired height (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: Using thin microfluidic chambers (up to 3-4 mm) improves adherence to the culture dish and prevents leakage.\nPlace all plates together inside a vacuum desiccator for 2 h (Figure 1E). This process removes the air trapped within the PDMS, thus eliminating air bubbles and forming a clear, uniform mold.\nPlace the plates inside an oven for 3 h (or overnight) at 70 °C (Figure 1E).\n\t\tNOTE: The plates should be level when placed in the oven.\nPDMS casting in epoxy molds\n\tNOTE: Because wafer preparation is expensive, requires special equipment, and may damage the fragile wafers, it is possible to generate epoxy replicas of wafers. The replicas are cheaper, more durable, and can be used for mass production of microfluidic chambers.\n\t\nCast and cure PDMS (as described in 1.1.8-1.1.11) into the original wafer.\nRemove and cut off excess parts of PDMS leaving only the microfluidic elements and the functional area required for processing them into microfluidic chambers.\nImmediately wrap the PDMS with thick, sticky tape to prevent it from accumulating dust.\nChoose a tissue culture grade plastic dish that fits the entire PDMS inside and leave room for epoxy around it. The distance from the PDMS to the plastic dish should be less than 5 mm.\nPrepare a small amount of PDMS mixed in a ratio of 10:1 (base:curing agent). The fresh liquid PDMS will be used to glue the solid PDMS onto the bottom of the plastic plate.",
    "Apply a minimal amount of the liquid PDMS to the center bottom of the plastic plate and then remove the sticky tape from the PDMS and adhere it to the plastic dish bottom. Make sure that the microfluidic elements are facing upwards.\nLet the PDMS cure for 30 min in a 70 °C oven.\nPrepare the epoxy resin by mixing the base and curing agent in a ratio of 100:45 respectively in a test tube. Different epoxy resins may have different mixing ratios. The required volume for a regular 100 mm plate is approximately 40 mL.\nLet the epoxy mix well for 10 min in a rotator until the mixture becomes visibly homogenous (i.e., there are no visible fiber-like artifacts in the liquid).\nCentrifuge the epoxy mixture at 400 x g for 5 min to remove air bubbles caught inside.\nDuring centrifugation, spread a thin layer of silicone grease around the walls and all other exposed plastic parts of the culture dish. This will prevent the epoxy from polymerizing with the dish plastic and will enable removal of the cured epoxy easily at the end of the protocol.\nPour the epoxy slowly into the dish until it completely covers the PDMS and goes beyond it by at least 5 mm. Prevent the formation of any bubbles within the epoxy by keeping zero distance between the tube and the plate. Place the plate in a secure place so it will not be moved for the next 48 h.\nAfter 48 h the epoxy should be completely cured. Insert the plate into a preheated oven at 80 °C for 3 h for final curing.",
    "Remove the cured epoxy from the plate and the original PDMS mold by gently yanking the plastic wall of the plate until it breaks. It should then easily separate from the epoxy and peel off.\nOnce extracted, wipe the remaining grease off the new epoxy replica and inset it upside down (i.e., with the replicated microfluidic elements facing up) into a new culture dish. The epoxy replica is now ready for PDMS casting.\nUse pressurized air or N2 to blow any remains of PDMS or dirt off the epoxy mold and rinse it 2x with isopropanol. Fill it a third time and incubate for 10 min on an orbital shaker plate. Rinse the mold again 3x with isopropanol and discard the remaining liquid. Blow dry with air or N2 or place in a 70 °C oven until dry.\n\t\tNOTE: Follow safety procedures when working with and discarding isopropanol.\nKeep the mold plates closed until casting. Follow steps 1.1.8.-1.1.11.\nPunching and sculpting the PDMS into an MFC (Figure 2)\n\t\nCut and remove the PDMS mold from the plate by following the (+) marks on the wafers using a scalpel. Do not use force, as the molds are fragile (Figure 2A).\nFollow the instructions drawn on the sketch to punch and cut the chambers depending on the experimental setup (Figure 2B-F).",
    "For spinal cord explant culture (Figure 2C,E), punch two 7 mm wells in the distal side of a the large MFC. Locate the wells in a way that they will overlap with the channel edges. On the proximal side, punch one 7 mm well in the middle of the channel, with minimal overlap so that sufficient space will be left for the explants. Punch two additional 1 mm holes in the two edges of the proximal channel. Turn the MFC with the microfluidic elements facing upwards, and using a 20 G needle, carve three small explant caves on the punched 7 mm well.\nFor dissociated MN culture (Figure 2D,F), punch four 6 mm wells in the edges of the two channels of a small MFC.\nSterilizing the MFC for tissue culture use\n\t\nSpread 50 cm long sticky tape bands on the bench. Press and pull back the chamber to face the sticky tape (both upper and lower faces) and remove crude dirt. Place the clean chambers in a new 15 cm plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not press directly on the microfluidic elements when these are facing upwards.\nIncubate the chambers in analytical grade 70% ethanol for 10 min on an orbital shaker.\nDispose of the ethanol and dry the chambers in a tissue culture hood or in an oven at 70 °C.\nPlacing the MFC on a glass bottom dish\n\t\nPlace the chamber in the center of a tissue culture grade 35 mm/50 mm glass bottom dish and apply minor force on the edges to make the PDMS and dish bottom bind. To avoid breaking the glass bottom, always apply force on top of a solid surface.\nIncubate 10 min in 70 °C. Press the chambers to strengthen adherence to the plate.\nIncubate under UV light for 10 min.",
    "Coating and culturing\n\t\nAdd 1.5 ng/mL poly-L-ornithine (PLO) to both compartments. Make sure the PLO is running through the channels by pipetting the coating media a few times directly in the channel entrance.\nExamine the microfluidic chamber under a light microscope with 10x magnification to check for the presence of air bubbles. If air bubbles are blocking the microgrooves, place the MFC in a vacuum desiccator for 2 min. Later, remove the excess air that got caught in the channels by pipetting the coating media through them. Incubate overnight.\nReplace PLO with laminin (3 µg/mL in DDW) for overnight incubation in the same manner.\nPrior to plating, wash the laminin with neuronal culture medium.\n2. Neuronal culture plating\nDissociated motor neuron culture\n\t\nUsing straight scissors and fine forceps, dissect a spinal cord out of an E12.5 ICR-HB9::GFP mouse embryo. Work in an 1X HBSS solution with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) (Figure 3A-C).\nUsing microdissection scissors, remove the meninges and the dorsal horns (Figure 3D).\nCollect the spinal cord pieces and transfer to tube (#1) with 1 mL HBSS + 1% P/S.\nCut the spinal cords to small pieces using curved scissors and wait for the pieces to settle.\nAdd 10 µL of trypsin 2.5% and place in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min. After 5 min, mix by tapping the tube. The pieces should form a helix-like clump.\nTransfer the clump into a new tube (#2) containing 800 µL of prewarmed L-15, 100 µL of BSA 4%, and 100 µL of 10 mg/mL DNase. Grind 2x, then wait for 2 min to let undissociated pieces settle. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube (#3).",
    "Add 100 µL of BSA 4%, 20 µL of 10 mg/mL DNase, and 900 µL of complete neurobasal medium (CNB, see Table of Materials and Table 1). Grind 8x and wait 2 min. Collect supernatant to tube #3.\nRepeat step 2.1.7 and grind 10x. Collect supernatant to tube #3. A small amount of tissue should be left at the bottom of the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: If a large clump still remains at the bottom of tube #2, repeat step 2.1.8.\nAdd 1 mL of BSA 4% cushion to the bottom of tube #3.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet by gently tapping the tube, then add 1 mL of CNB medium. Pipette 6x and add 20 µL of 10 mg/mL DNase.\nSupplement with an additional 5 mL of CNB medium and transfer 3 mL to a new tube (#4).\nAdd 1 mL of 10.4% density gradient medium (see Table 2) to the bottom of each tube (#3 and #4). A sharp phase separation between the two interfaces should appear.\nCentrifuge at 775 x g for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Centrifuge deceleration should be set to a low level to avoid breakdown of the phase separation.\nCells should be floating, appearing as a cloudy interphase between the media. Collect the cells from both tubes into a new tube (#5) already containing prewarmed 1 mL CNB medium.\nAdd an additional 4-6 mL of CNB medium.\nAdd 1 mL of BSA 4% cushion to the bottom of the tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at RT. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet gently with 1 mL of CNB medium.\nCount the cells. A yield of 0.75-1 x 106 MN per spinal cord is expected.",
    "NOTE: Ventral spinal cord also contains other neuronal subtypes besides motor neurons (e.g., interneurons). MN purity depends mostly on the removal of dorsal areas during dissection and the ability to reach MN enriched rostral areas. To ensure the imaged neurons are MNs, use of a mice strain with an endogenous MN marker, such as HB9::GFP mice, is recommended. To achieve pure MN culture (but with decreased cell yield), use of FACS purification15 is possible.\nPlating dissociated MN culture in the MFC\n\t\t\nConcentrate 150,000 MNs per chamber by centrifuging at 400 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the cells in rich neurobasal medium (RNB) at 4 µL per MFC. RNB is CNB supplemented with additional 2% B27 and 25 ng/mL BDNF.\nRemove the medium from both compartments, leaving a low volume equivalent to ~10 µL in the wells of the distal compartment. It appears as a thin ring of medium in the well perimeter.\nSlowly load 4 µL of cells into the channel. Take out 4 µL of the well in the other side of the channel, and slowly load them back directly into the channel to reverse the current flow and maximize cell density in the channel.\nVerify that the cells have entered the channel using a 10x light microscope and place the chamber in the incubator for 30 min without adding more media.\nSlowly add ~10-15 µL of RNB into the proximal and distal wells and place the chambers in the incubator for another 15 min.\nFollowing this incubation, slowly add ~75-80 µL of RNB into each well.\nDissociated MN culture maintenance\n\t\t\nOne day after plating (DIV1), replace medium with RNB supplemented with 1 µM cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) to inhibit glial growth.",
    "Two days after Ara-C application (DIV3) replace medium with fresh CNB medium in the proximal compartment (without Ara-C).\nIn order to enhance crossing of axons through the microgrooves, apply RNB supplemented with 25 ng/mL of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and 25 ng/mL of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) only to the distal compartment. Maintain a volume gradient of at least 10 µL per well between the axonal distal wells (higher volume) and the proximal wells.\nRefresh the medium every 2 days. It can take the axons up to 4-6 days to cross distally.\nSpinal cord explant culture\n\t\nUsing straight scissors and fine forceps, dissect a spinal cord out of an E12.5 ICR-HB9::GFP mouse embryo. Work in an 1X HBSS solution with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) (Figure 3A-C).\nUsing microdissection scissors, remove the meninges and the dorsal horns (Figure 3D).\nCut the spinal cord into 1 mm thick transverse sections (Figure 3E). Dispose of all medium from the proximal compartment of the MFC.\nPick up a single spinal cord explant with a pipette in a total volume of 4 µL. Inject the explant as close as possible to the cave and draw out any excessive liquid from the proximal well via the lateral outlets (1 mm punches). The explants should be sucked into the proximal channel.\nSlowly add 150 µL of spinal cord explant medium (SCEX, see Table of Materials and Table 3) to the proximal well.\nSpinal cord explant culture maintenance\n\t\t\nAdd SCEX medium in the proximal compartment, and rich SCEX medium (SCEX with 50 ng/mL of BDNF and GDNF) in the distal compartment. Maintain a volume gradient of at least 15 µL per well between the distal wells (higher volume) and the proximal well.",
    "Refresh the medium every 2 days. It can take the axons up to 3-5 days to cross distally.\n3. Axonal transport (Figure 4A)\nLabeling of mitochondria and acidic compartments\n\t\nPrepare fresh SCEX medium (or CNB for dissociated MN) containing 100 nM Mitotracker Deep Red FM and 100 nM LysoTracker Red. Incubate for 30-60 min at 37 °C. Other colors can be used as long as their fluorophores do not overlap.\nWash 3x with warm CNB/SCEX medium. The plates are ready for imaging.\nLive imaging\n\t\nAcquire 100 time-lapse image series of axonal transport at 3 s intervals, with a total of 5 min per movie.\n\t\tNOTE: The imaging system used in this study included an inverted microscope equipped with spinning disc confocal, controlled via propriety cell imaging software, 60x oil lens, NA = 1.4, and an EMCCD camera. Movies were acquired in a controlled environment at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: Longer or shorter time-lapse movies can be imaged, dependent on the experiment. Even overnight movies can be recorded if needed. However, it is critical to try and reduce the exposure time and laser power, as well as the number of total images, to decrease phototoxicity and bleaching during movie acquisition.\n4.
