    "C2C12 cell line maintenance and seedingMaintain cultured C2C12 cells in 100 mm culture plates in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and split cells when confluence reaches 80–90%. Use regular culture medium containing phenol red (see Recipes section).Two to three days before BRET measurement, trypsinize, collect and seed cells according to the plate format (see below). Typically, 150 × 103 cells/well in a 6-well plate before dispatching in white 96-well plates for BRET in cell populations, and 10 × 103 to 15 × 104 in an IbiTreat µ-slide for BRET imaging.C2C12 transfectionFor BRET in cell populations, we routinely transfect with JETPEI, but any other efficient approaches can be used.Day 1, seed 150 × 103 cells/well in 6-well plates.Day 2, the following amount and volumes are given to transfect one well of a 6-well plate: In 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube A: mix 50 ng of AIMTOR DNA with 100 µl of sterile NaCl (150 mM). Use a non-coding plasmid (pBluescript or other) to normalize the DNA amount to 1 µg.In 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube B, combine 4 µl of JETPEI transfection reagent (4 µl/μg of DNA) with 100 µl of sterile NaCl (150 mM). Vortex the tube for 10 s.Add the JETPEI reagent mixture in microcentrifuge tube B dropwise into microcentrifuge A (containing the DNA mixture). Vortex the tube for 10 s and centrifuge briefly.Incubate for 20 min at room temperature.Add the content of the combined JETPEI-DNA mixture dropwise into the wells.Centrifuge the 6-well plates for 5 min at 280 × g.Incubate cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h.Day 3:Wash each well with 1 ml PBS.Add 300 µl Trypsin/EDTA.Incubate 5–10 min at 37 °C.Add 1 ml complete medium without phenol red.Resuspend cells with a 1-ml micropipette and collect them in a 15-ml tube.",
    "Centrifuge cells for 5 min (500 × g).Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 2.5 ml of culture mediumDispatch the cells in a 96-well plate: 100 µl/well in triplicate wells × the number of conditions for each transfection.Incubate for 24–48 h before proceeding to plate BRET reading.For single-cell BRET imaging via microscopyNote: We use the HelixIN transfection protocol, but any other efficient transfection protocol can be used. Day 1: Seed 10 × 103 to 15 × 103 cells in each well of an 8-well untreated or polylysine-treated ibidi slide.Thaw HelixIN and HB100X stock reagents and vortex them briefly.Dilute HelixIN reagent 5× in Milli-Q sterile water (1 µl of HelixIN + 4 µl of H2O).For a single well of the 8-well ibidi slide, combine in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube: 1 µl (50 ng) of AIMTOR DNA (stock 50 ng/µl), 1.5 µl (250 ng) of non-coding plasmid (stock 200 ng/µl), and 30 µl of serum-free DMEM.Add 3.5 µl of diluted HelixIN.Mix gently, but do not vortex!Wait 30 min at room temperature.Add the total 36-µl dropwise into one well of an 8-well ibidi slide.Add 3.3 µl of HB100×.Incubate the cells for 24–48 h in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.Proceed to BRET imaging via microscopy (see below).BRET monitoring in cell populationsTurn on the Synergy 2 (or equivalent) plate reader and open the Gen5TM Reader software.Program the protocol for BRET plate reading:Select wells to be read in the “plate read mode” allowing several readings of the plate (lasting 20 min to 1 h max).For each plate reading, program two successive 1-s readings at wavelengths of 485 nm and 530 nm, allowing the calculation of BRET intensity based on the ratio of the light unit emission at 530 nm to the light unit emission at 485 nm.",
    "Set up the dynamic range and other parameters according to the plate reader.Prepare 10× furimazine [200 µM] in a 1.5-ml tube by diluting furimazine stock in BRET reading medium.Remove the 96-well plate containing cells expressing AIMTOR from the CO2 incubator.Aspirate culture medium and replace with 90 µl of fresh BRET reading medium (phenol red free) immediately before plate reading.Add 10 µl of furimazine (200 µM) diluted in BRET reading medium (20 µM final concentration) to each well containing cells using a multichannel pipette or a repipetor (Eppendorf).Perform plate reading for a maximum of 1 h (allowing successive readings of each well depending on the number of wells to be read and the speed of the plate reader).Export an Excel file with the raw experimental data showing the light unit emission at 530 nm and 485 nm for each well over time.BRET imaging via microscopyTurn on the microscope system and open the Metamorph image acquisition software (Figure 1). Wait approximately 1 h until the camera temperature has reached -80 °C.During that time, take one 8-well µ-slide out of the incubator and remove the culture medium from the wells you want to image without drying the cells. Wash the cells once with 300 µl of PBS and fill each well with 200 µl of BRET experiment culture medium (see Recipes section). Change the medium at least 30 min before imaging because this procedure can affect mTOR signaling.Place the dish on the microscope stage and secure it so it cannot move.Collect a background dark image using the same experimental conditions that you will use for imaging. For your first acquisition, you will have to perform this step after BRET recording, and without the dish.",
    "Focus the image on a field of cells using epifluorescence illumination to detect Y-PET and collect an image to capture the localization of the AIMTOR biosensor (Figure 2A).If your setup is equipped with a multi-position stage, save the position and repeat this step for the number of positions you wish to use. Note that the more positions you save, the longer the delay will be between consecutive time points for each field.Prepare a fresh mixture consisting of 3 µl of furimazine with 57 µl of BRET experiment culture medium. Carefully add 50 µl of this mixture on top of the cells to achieve a final concentration of 50 µM furimazine. Wait for 1 min to allow furimazine to diffuse in the well.Make sure to turn off all microscope illumination and room lighting. Close the dark box.Image channels at wavelengths of 460 nm and 530 nm (determine the appropriate exposure time so that none of the channels are over-exposed).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3989/bioprotoc-11-08-3989-g002.jpgFigure 2.
