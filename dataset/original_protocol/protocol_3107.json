The degree of photo-crosslinking correlates with the depth of the blue. Thus, the local stiffening of the desired pattern was successful.\n(F) Surface coating of a thin layer of Matrigel via photo-crosslinking of Sulfo-SANPAH. Photoactivated nitrophenylazide group in sulfo-SANPAH attack toward polyacry-lamide independently of pH. After incubation with the Matrigel solution (4.4 μL/mL, 1 mL), primary amine in matrigel proteins slowly interact with the N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of Sulfo-SANPAH at 37°C in the absence of CO2.\nNote: This section (day1) summarizes the protocols for synthesizing polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels with mechanical patterns via photoinitiated radical polymerization (Day 1, Steps. 1–6) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Reaction solutions are composed of the monomer (acrylamide), crosslinker (N, N′-methylene bis(acrylamide)), and photosensitive initiator (Omnirad 2959). Irradiation with UV light (λ = 365 nm) initiates the photo-crosslinking reaction; thus, a mechanical pattern can form according to the intensity of the light irradiation. However, there is a limited number of protocols demonstrating PAAm gels with mechanical \"gradients\" for guiding \"isolated\" cell locomotion.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nRecently we successfully assessed various mechanical \"patterns\" for the \"self-organization of cells\".3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Therefore, we describe the preparation protocols for PAAm hydrogels with various mechanical patterns.\nPlace glass slides (≤ 6 slides) in a glass container, and place glass slips (φ = 12 mm) in a 50 mL beaker.",
    "Note: The beaker should be fixed with a metal weight to avoid spilling during ultrasonication. Harmful organic and inorganic gases are evaporated during RCA cleaning (classically RCA inc. developed); thus, all procedures should be performed in a draft chamber. Although the original RCA cleaning method used hydrofluoric acid,12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] in this study, we eliminated hydrofluoric acid (i.e., SC-I cleaning), and ensured the protocol is user-friendly, even for young scientists and students. Especially, SC-I cleaning dedicates to eliminating organic contaminants from the glass surface and exposing slilanol group (-OH) for subsequent silanization reactions. All the solvents should be treated (discarded) according to institutional rules.\nAdd acetone and ensure that the glass slides and slips are immersed.\nPerform ultrasonication at 25°C for 3 min.\nAfter removing the acetone solution, repeat Step b-c, using ethanol, methanol, and distilled water, in that order.\nImmerse glass slides and slips in a solution of 28% ammonia water, 30% hydrogen peroxide, and deionized water in a 1:1:5 ratio, and incubate in a hot water bath at 60°C for 30 min.\nRinse the glass slides and slips, ten times with deionized water, after the temperature drops to room temperature (20°C).",
    "Pause point: It is important that the glass surfaces (hydrophilicity) be freshly cleaned to enable the silane coupling between the exposed -OH groups of the glass substrate and the -Cl groups of allyl trichlorosilane (ATCS). Additional RCA cleaning is recommended if more than 1 week elapses after the initial RCA cleaning. The cleaned glass slips and slides should be stored in deionized water. [optional] The glass slips and slides can also be stored under a vacuum after drying in an oven (∼ 60°C for 3 h). If the added deionized water does not easily coat the glass surface, repeat the RCA cleaning. It should be noted that contact angle (  θ  ) measurement provides pre-cleaned (  θ   ∼ 40°) and cleaned (  θ   ∼ 20°) surface of the glass, which is possibly the criteria to repeat the cleaning.\nAllylation of glass slips (1 h) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPlace the RCA-cleaned glass slips on a clean Teflon dish (ø = 7.5 cm).\nImmerse the glass slips in 10 mL of ethanol, then rinse ultrasonically for 3 min at 25°C.\nGently remove the ethanol (possibly via a glass syringe or decantation).\nAdd 10 mL of chloroform to the dish, and immediately sonicate it (1 min at 25°C).",
    "Note: These steps are to eliminate the water from the surface of glass substrate. Thus, if the glass substrate was completely dried under a vacuum oven (see procedure 1, pause point), the dried glass was directly immersed in the reaction solution of procedure 2-d. The water remaining in the chloroform solution suppresses the allylation of the glass slips, leading to inhomogeneous wettability. During wet summers, the condensation of water due to the evaporation of chloroform (a decrease in the temperature of the glass leads to the condensation of water), suppresses the reaction. [Optional] Therefore, we recommend using a dehumidifying device with air conditionor (∼ 30%, ∼ 20°C). In the case of heterogenous silanization of glass were happened, it is generally advisable to first prepare a homogeneous reaction solution (chloroform, ATCS, and TEA), then immerse the glass slips into it. Dehydration process for the organic solvent just before the reaction (e.g., use of molecular sieves) may improve the reaction. Operation of the reaction under dried air (inert gas such as nitrogen) at the glove box also improves the reaction.\nAfter gently removing the chloroform in a draft chamber, add 10 mL of fresh chloroform, 80 μL of triethylamine (TEA), and mix gently.\nAdd 80 μL of allyl trichlorosilane (ATCS) and mix gently.\nNote: The classical combination of NaOH and APTES (aminopropyl tri ethoxy silane)11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] is not recommended for this protocol, because -OH groups are exposed by the evaporation of the NaOH solution; the evaporation leads to undissolved powder remaining on the glass surface, which may prevent the light passing through the substrate (during inverted microscopy). For reflection interference imaging, as in our previous study,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] it is critical to use a transparent glass substrate. Currently, the ATCS silane coupling is recommended. These ATCS protocols have been described by the Discher group.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]",
    "Perform ultrasonication for 3 min at 25°C.\nPlace a glass Petri dish on the Teflon dish to prevent evaporation of the solution and allow the solution to stand for 30 min.\nIf allylation does not occur when the glass slips overlap each other; use aluminum tweezers to separate the glass slips .\nDiscard the solution and rinse the coverslips at least three times with chloroform, ethanol, and deionized water.\nConfirm the completion of allylation of the coverslip by checking the wettability after washing with distilled water.\nNote: Water drops on the surface should exhibit large contact angles owing to the strong hydrophobicity of the substrate surface (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B inset). It should be noted that contact angle (  θ  ) measurement provides the untreated (  θ   ∼ 20°) and ATCS-treated (  θ   ∼ 50°) surface of the glass.\nHydrophobic treatment of glass slide by silane coupling (40 min) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nRemove the moisture from the surface of the RCA-washed glass slides by drying them with nitrogen gas.\nTransfer the two glass slides to a glass Petri dish.\nTransfer dichloro dimethyl silane (DCDMS, 150 μL) onto one of the glass slides (in a draft chamber).\nPlace the cleaned side of the other glass slide onto the original slide, and allow the slides to stand for 10 min.\nAdd sufficient water to cover the glass slides (this is a process for stopping the reaction of DCDMS to glass); rinse the slides at least twice with distilled water.\nIf the two glass slides have firmly adhered to each other, separate them with aluminum tweezers.",
    "Critical: Ensure that the glass slides are placed on surfaces that have not been exposed to nitrogen gas. The HCl gas that is produced during silane coupling is harmful; therefore, the reaction should be performed in a draft chamber. A hydrophobic slide should be used immediately after incubation.\nPreparation of reaction solutions for PAAm hydrogel (15 min).\nTo prepare the photoinitiator solution in 50 mL plastic tubes, add 50 mg of Omnirad 2959 to 0.5 mL of ethanol, followed by 3.5 mL of distilled water.\nNote: The solution should be heated by shaking in a hot water bath (60°C) until the powder dissolves completely.\nTo prepare the complete reaction solution of PAAm hydrogel, mix together 0.6 mL of 40% acrylamide, 0.6 mL of 2% bis-acrylamide, and 0.8 mL of Omnirad 2959 solutions.\nCover the beaker containing complete reaction solutions of PAAm hydrogel with aluminum foil and immediately degass for 6 min in a vacuum chamber.\nNote: Degassing removes any dissolved oxygen that reacts with radicals and inhibits gel polymerization; this process is critical for the reproducibility of the gelation.\nPreparation of hydrogels by local stiffening (30 min–2 h) using a custom-built UV illumination system (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) (Irradiation intensity: 20 mW, irradiation times: Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2880_2.csv\naPre-illumination below 30 s does not complete the gelation at the surroundings.\nbA sufficient degassing time (6 min) leads to a faster reaction; an insufficient degassing time (1 min)∗ leads to a slower reaction. Therefore, an optimal degassing time should be established.\ncTo achieve a milder mechanical gradient, the appropriate pre- or main- illumination times should be selected.\nTransfer the prepared acrylamide gel solution (25 μL) dropwise onto a DCDMS-treated glass slide (hydrophobic),\nCover the slide with an allylated cover glass.\nPre-UV illumination promotes the curing of the entire substrate.",
    "Primary UV illumination via a photomask or aperture induces a local curing area.\nNote: Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] indicates the representative recipes for mechanically patterned hydrogels with optimized illumination conditions. Here the intensity of UV was ∼ 20 mW (  λ   = 365 nm, measured by 3664 optical power meter, Hioki inc, Japan). The photo-illumination pattern is prepared using a photomask printed on acetyl cellulose films (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] top). The films are covered with monochromatic ink using a laser color printer. Adobe Illustrator software controls the depth of the monochromatic color; however, conventional software such as Microsoft PowerPoint may also be used.\nStain the prepared PAAm Immediately after the illumination.\nTransfer the glass slide and slip with the PAAm gel to a plastic Petri dish (ø = 10 cm).\nThe Petri dish is then filled with distilled water to stop the reaction.\nUse tweezers to carefully move the cover glass to the edge of the glass slide; remove the cover glass carefully.\nStains the hydrogels with trypan blue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E bottom) to determine the local stiffening of the hydrogels.\nNote: Conventional trypan blue is a positively charged stain; thus, the small molecules can interact with the hydrogels.\nPause point: The prepared PAAm gel can be stored in distilled water at 4°C for one month. For long-term storage, the addition of a penicillin–streptomycin solution (x 1000 dilution) is recommended.\nExtracellular matrix (ECM) modification of PAAm hydrogel substrate (> 16 h) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nAdjust the pH of a solution of 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) in deionized water (20 mM) to pH 8.5 with a potassium hydroxide solution (1 M).\nFilter the solution with a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate membrane (Advantec). The solution (100–200 mL) can be stored at 4°C for three months.",
    "Transfer the gel substrates to a glass plate (24 well, Iwaki) and rinse several times with HEPES buffer.\nAdd 1 μL of (Sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(4′-azido-2′-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate) (sulfo-SANPAH) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution to 250 μL HEPES solution(250-fold),\nLoad the mixture (0.2 mg/mL in final) onto the gel substrate.\nIrradiate the gel substrate with UV light (365 nm, Spectro LINE ENF-280C combined with voltage transmitter TI-28) for 20 min using a UV lamp (Sigma, Z169633-1EA).\nNote: Install the UV light so that the distance between the bottom of the UV light and the surface of the gel is 35 mm. Remove the top cover of the glass well plates at a clean bench, because the plastic absorbs UV light.\nAfter 20 min, rinse the PA gel substrate with HEPES buffer until the orange color of the Sulfo-SANPAH disappears (approximately three rinses).\nAdd 4.4 μL of Matrigel to 1 mL of the HEPES buffer solution (4.4 μL/mL), then cover the gel substrate with the solution.\nIncubate the mixture at 37°C for at least 16 h in the absence of CO2. Place a 10 cm dish filled with distilled water in the incubator to prevent the drying out of the gel substrate and Matrigel mixture.\nCritical: When preparing the Matrigel-diluted HEPES solution, cool the Matrigel and HEPES buffer before mixing. After adding Matrigel, use a vortex mixer (< 1 min) to mix the solution. The cooled solution may be used as is. Warming the Matrigel-diluted HEPES solution accelerates crosslinking to form aggregates but the aggregates dissolve slowly during the cooling process.\nWash the Matrigel-coated gel substrate with the culture medium and use immediately.",
    "Note: Immediate usage is recommended because the Matrigel coating dissolves easily at the 4°C storage temperature (i.e., the adhesion of cells will be suppressed). If a longer storage period (one week) is required, the gel and the reaction solution of Matrigel (after procedure 6-g) must be stored at 4°C.\nThere are two reaction steps to complete the surface modification of ECM: (1) the photoactivation of nitrophenyl azide and its covalent binding to PAAm, and (2) the reaction between NHS esters and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Regarding the photochemical reaction of nitrophenyl azide in sulfo-SANPAH, two types of reactions are known: (i) ring insertion of nitrene followed by the formation of didehydroazepine and subsequent reaction with nucleophilic amines, and (ii) insertion into C-H bonds via nitrene’s intersystem crossing.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] The carbonyl oxygen of the amide group reduces the reactivity of the amine in PAAm leading to support scenario (2).",
    "For the reaction of NHS esters and ECM, the pH of the sulfo-SANPAH-HEPES solution is critical for the reaction between NHS esters of sulf-SANPAH and primary amines in ECM. Thus, the pH of the HEPES buffer should be optimized and incubation should proceed in the absence of CO2 (CO2 easily dissolves in the solution to decrease the pH). It should be noted that higher pH levels accelerate the hydrolysis of NHS esters of sulfo-SANPAH, thus reducing the reaction efficiency with ECM (which is a potential limitation of the reaction system.). The conditions under which sulfo-SANPAH is stored is also important. Sulfo-SANPAH is easily hydrolyzed at ambient temperatures. Thus, DMSO solvent is used for the dissolution and the stock should be stored at − 80°C. The diluted stock for the ECM modification should be freshly prepared prior to use. Based on the previous reports,11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] HEPES was chosen as a buffer agent, but the buffering capacity is typically 6.8–8.2. Thus, the careful tuning of pH was necessary, we recommend using other Good’s buffers.\nMechanical characterization of the hydrogel using atomic force microscopy, AFM\nTiming: Day 2\nAFM cantilever calibration.\nNote: This step provides a summary of the protocol for the mechanical characterization of hydrogels using AFM. AFM applies force (F) to materials via a cantilever with a measured indentation (δ); the analysis of the force-indentation curves (F-δ curves), based on the Hertzian and its modified contact theory,15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] provides the mechanical properties (Young's modulus, kPa) of the cell culture substrate. In our work, we used an AFM from JPK instruments (now Bruker) for the measurement and followed the supplied instructions for calibration, measurement, and analysis. For further details, please consult the instrument manual or our next coming paper summarizing the details of the AFM analysis.",
    "Turn on the AFM systems (controller, PC, JPK software) and optical devices (Nikon-Ti2E with CMOS camera).\nAdjust the cantilever position on a holder, then attach it to the AFM devices.\nPlace a glass-bottom dish (ø = 27 mm, Iwaki, No1S, Cat:3970-035) containing 2 mL of deionized water on the manual stage.\nAccording to the manufactured instruction, warm-up operation of equipment (switching of laser, controller, AFM) for at least 30 min until they get stabilized.\nFocus a laser beam onto the cantilever using a calibration camera.\nAdjust the laser position to ensure that the vertical and lateral deflection becomes zero.\nPosition the cantilever near the surface of the glass substrate using the instrument software.\nNote: The following conditions should be used: Approaching speed for obtaining back or forward force curves = 0.5 s, P gain = 0.001, iGain = 50.0 Hz, SetPoint = 1 V\nCalibrate the sensitivity using the calibration manager in the software.\nMove the cantilever to a position 100 μm above the glass surface by tuning the stepping motors of the AFM device.\nCalibrate the spring constant using the calibration manager in the software.\nAFM measurement and analysis.\nAcquire the force curves of the PAAm gel in a phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution.\nNote: Use the following conditions: Approaching speed = 5.0 μm/s, P gain = 0.001, iGain = 50.0 Hz, Setpoint ∼ 27 nN (∼ 1 V).\nCheck the quality of the force curves (plateau baseline and single-force curves without cracks). If the quality is poor, please reoptimize the parameters in Step 8 a.\nNote: Force maps with a defined area (xy, 100 × 100 μm) are restricted by the potential piezo movement inside the AFM device.\nObtain mechanical profiles.",
    "Note: Mechanical mapping can be acquired (between 0.5 mm pitch) for this experiment by moving the stage of the AFM using a vernier micrometer.\nUse conventional analysis software (i.e., JPK data processing).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2880-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Mapping with 0.5 mm pitches obtains the data point. The error bar shows the standard deviation of Young’s modulus (n = 16) of hydrogels (analysis area: 10 μm × 10 μm area).",
    "Note: Theoretical background (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The force curve is obtained by bringing the needle of the cantilever into contact with the sample; initially the needle does not touch the sample; it is then inserted into the sample. Here, the vertical axis of the force curve represents the force [nN], and the horizontal axis represents the indentation [μm]. Several models are available for calculating the Young's modulus (E [kPa]) of a sample; in this study, we used the modified Hertz equation without relying on Sneddon’s model.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] The model is used to ascertain the relationship between the force applied to the sample and its displacement. As shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, the probe tip is approximated as a cone, and it is assumed that the needle tip and sample are in surface contact. The following equation expresses the relationship between the force applied on a sample and its displacement:   F =  E  1 −  υ 2      2  tan  α  π   δ 2  ,   where F [N] is the force applied to the sample, α [°] is the half angle of the probe at the tip of the cantilever, ν is Poisson's ratio, E [Pa] is the Young's modulus of the sample, and δ is the indentation amount. Here, α is a constant term because it is probe-specific, and v is sample-specific. In other words, when the obtained force curve is fitted with the model, it becomes a quadratic function in the indentation range > 0; the Young's modulus (E) of the sample is the value that makes this quadratic function valid.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nIf some representative force curves fit well with the Hertzian contact theory, proceed to the batch fitting procedures to obtain mechanical maps.",
    "Note: Representative force curves are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B for different crosslinker concentrations (i.e., Young’s modulus, S1 (E ∼ 1.5 kPa), S2 (E ∼ 1.7 kPa), and S3 (E ∼ 105 kPa)). The force curves should first be analyzed to determine the fitting region. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C shows the Young’s modulus of PAAm hydrogels (without matrigel coating), which was calculated using different fitting regions (with different indentation depths). For a small indentation depth, the Young’s modulus sometimes increases owing to the adhesiveness of the hydrogels that breaks the model (point of contact); this occurs due to the strong adhesion of the hydrogel to the cantilevers tip (i.e., increase in the area of the adhesion region). Since the cantilever gradually distorts in the tip's height direction, it is typically challenging to apply the same models for deeper indentation depth. However, fitting at the region above 1 μm reaches equilibrium and smaller deviation between different batches (data not shown), thus the indentation depth (∼ 1 μm) would be valid for the analysis(which is also a comparable range of a previous report18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) .",
    "AFM topological analysis revealed that there are thin layers of matrigels (order of several tens of nanometers, data not shown) on the hydrogels. Our previous reports indicated that matrigel coating does not influence the stiffness of PAAm hydrogels.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Cells are capable of sensing the stiffness of objects that are more than 1 μm below the substrate surface.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Combining these facts indicate that cells can sense and respond to the mechanical properties of the gels evaluated here. If the synthesis protocols are optimized in the laboratory, the deviation in stiffness should be as that displayed in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D. If the cell experiment is sensitive to the variations in stiffness, prepare the PAAm gel on the same day and store one PAAm hydrogel for the AFM measurements.\nPause point: It is best not to perform the cell adhesion experiments after measuring the PAAm gel, because the AFM measurements are performed under atmospheric conditions.\nTime-lapse imaging of self-condensation of cells\nTiming: Day 3\nExpansion of target cells (rat-skeletal muscle cells, L6 for this protocol) before time-lapse imaging (>1 week).\nNote: This step provides guidelines for the time-lapse imaging of the self-condensation of cells on the hydrogel with a mechanical pattern using fluorescence confocal microscopy. We optimized the use of a Nikon confocal microscope (Nikon C2 or A1) for multiple-point imaging and stacking; however, a Leica (SP5, SP8) may also be used.",
    "Critical: It is necessary to optimize the mechanical gradient and Matrigel coating on the surface, depending on the types of targeted cells. To test the self-condensation of cells on the PAAm hydrogels, we first recommend using mesenchymal cell types, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and C2C12. We have previously shown that MSC are key in the self-condensation of liver organoids.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Therefore, if mixing the mesenchymal cells to enhance condensation is acceptable, the density of mesenchymal stem cells to be mixed is ∼ 10% (recommendation).\nPrepare the medium from Nissui RPMI approximately 30 min before seeding/dispensing and warm in a 37°C incubator.\nAspirate the medium with an aspirator and wash the cells once with PBS (4°C).\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin (4°C) and incubate at 37°C with CO2 for 3 min.\nDspese the clumps formed by the cells by tapping the wall of the dish, and ensure cell detachment by minimal pipetting (The trypsin action time is short).\nAfter confirming the cell detachment under a microscope, add a minimum of 4 mL of medium to stop the action of trypsin.\nTransfer the solution to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 4°C, 200 G for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant, add 1 mL of the culture medium to count the number of cells.\nWash the incubating gel substrate once with the warmed medium and seed the cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well.\nTime-lapse fluorescence confocal imaging of multiple points of cells on the PAAm gel (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2880-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

(a glass well plate is recommended e.g., Iwaki glass well plate).\nAdd warm culture medium (which matches targetted cells).\nPlace the glass well plate in a chamber attached to a 5% CO2 regulator (Tokai Hit). Set the air pressure to 50 mL/min (flow ratio).\nImaging by confocal and epifluorescence microscopy.\nNote: We recommend the use of confocal microscopy to obtain the axial structures of the obtained cell condensates; however, other stereomicroscopes (e.g., LED5000 SLI, Leica) may also be used. Note that a stereotypical microscope usually cannot provide fine axial information. Therefore, tiling of the wells and/or a lower magnification lens such as 1× (Plan) and another lens (4× plan apo numerical aperture, NA = 0.20), are recommended. In this protocol, we typically use a 4× plan apo lens.\nSet up a glass well plate, seeded with cells, for transmission images and fluorescence microscopy with a 561 nm laser (acquired at 30 min intervals for 24 h).\nAfter obtaining the microscopic images, we recommend obtaining the axial topography of the condensates.\nThereafter, fix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min for further immunostaining.\nCritical: Note that the condensate spheroids are hydrophobic; thus, prolonged drying in air leads to their detachment from the gels."
