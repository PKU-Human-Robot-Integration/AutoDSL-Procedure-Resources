    "This study followed the Declaration of Helsinki on medical protocol and ethics and the Institutional Ethical Review Board approved the study.\n1. Segmentation using a segmentation software\nNOTE: The import process of the DICOM files requires the orientation of the axial, coronal and sagittal planes in the pop-up window to finish the setup.\nIn the Bone Segmentation menu, choose the General feature. Use the marker \"-\" for unwanted segments and \"+\" for the segment of interest. Add markers on the 3D reconstructed model or on the different cross sections when scrolling and moving throughout the scan.\nChoose the Set button that demonstrates the segmentation. At this point, correct the markings and add new ones for better accuracy. Press Apply to create the new segment. Multiple segments can be created this way.\nAfter segmentation is complete, export the files as stl 3D files for 3D printing or planning of 3D reconstruction implants in 3D design CAD programs.\n2. Designing reconstruction implants using 3D design software\nAfter preforming the bone segmentation using the segmentation software, import the stl files into the 3D design software (see Table of Materials).\nIf further separation is needed (e.g., if one part is intended to be moved separately), do so here. In the Sculpt Clay menu, use the shave tool to separate the bone into two parts. In the Select/Move Clay menu, select the clay and mark the part to work on. Then, copy this part and create a new identical object in the object list in order to manipulate its position as observed in the next stage.",
    "Perform segment movement at this stage. Make sure that the axis of rotation is set on the part of the bone to stay in the same position. In the Select/Move Clay menu, select Reposition and set the rotation axis as planned.\nAs the human skull is mostly symmetrical, use the healthy side for guidance to obtain the right positioning/replacement of the missing/mal-positioned segment. Use a mirroring technique to create a mirroring image of the normal side. In the Construct Clay menu, use the Mirror Clay option and set the plane at the center of the skull.\nBased on the mirrored half, perform segment rotation if needed and reconstruct the avulsed bony part using the Add Clay tool in the Construct Clay menu. This reconstruction is performed in order to build a patient specific reconstruction implant in the next stages, which will reconstruct the correct facial contour.\nAfter reconstructing the bony segment, create the patient specific reconstruction implant. In the Curves menu, use the Draw Curve option and create a continuous outer shape of the desired implant.\nAt this stage, duplicate the bony segment as it will be needed to perform a Boolean function to separate the constructed implant. This is performed in the object list window by right clicking the segment and pressing the Duplicate option.",
    "Work in the new duplicated segment. In the Detail Clay menu, use the Emboss With Curve option to create the volume of the reconstruction implant. Pick the outer form of the sketched implant, and then place the circle-shaped cursor inside the sketched implant, on the surface of the bone. Note that the emboss will work outwards or on the inside of the bone, depending on the placement of the cursor. Then, choose the desired parameters - most importantly, the distance option that controls the thickness of the implant.\nSeparate the implant from the bony segment. In the object list, choose the previously duplicated object from step 2.7, right-click and select Boolean → Remove From. Then choose the object containing the created implant.\nIn case holes for screw fixation or for allowing angiogenesis are required, select Planes Category → Create Plane to create a parallel plane in which the holes for the plate are designed. Using manual manipulation, place the planes in maximum parallelism to the implant. In the Sketch menu, choose a circle and create circles in the desired size and position. A second larger circle can be created, which will serve as the countersink for the head of the intendent screw.\nIn the Curves menu, use the Project Sketch option and choose the sketches designated to be transferred from the plane to the implant.",
    "To generate the countersink for the screws, In the Detail Clay menu, use the Emboss With Curve option. Pick the outer circles of the sketch, place the circle-shaped cursor inside the marked circular area on the surface and enter the distance that controls the depths of the countersink (e.g., 0.3 mm). To complete the process, press Apply and Lower to make sure that the emboss is performed in a subtraction manner and not an additive one.\nTo complete the holes, in the SubD Surfaces menu, use the Wire Cut SubD option to create rods perpendicular to the implant based on the small circles created in step 2.10.\nTo create the holes using the rods, use Boolean > Remove From as in step 2.9. Choose one rod after the other, right click in the object list → Boolean → Remove From → Created Implant.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the desired screws can be created/scanned and the Boolean function can be used to create the desired holes.\nTo create a mesh in the implant (allowing for angiogenesis for instance), first generate a sketch (using the curve option) of the planned mesh as in step 2.6.\n\t\nIn the Detail Clay menu, use the Emboss with Wrapped Image option. Choose an image according to which the mesh will be created (there are several templates which come with the program). The white parts of the image will be subtracted in the mesh, and the black parts will be spared.\nUsing manual control, adjust the direction and size of the design. Set the distance that represents the thickness of the holes generated and press Apply. The patient specific implant is ready for production.\nSubscription Required.
