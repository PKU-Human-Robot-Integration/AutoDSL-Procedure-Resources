    "1. Immunofluorescence\nThe following protocol is performed on coronal brain cryosections obtained from transcardially perfused mice (20 ml of PBS, 0.1 mol/liter, pH 7.4, followed by 50 ml of chilled paraformaldehyde 4% in PBS). After perfusion, brains are carefully removed and transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C overnight for cryoprotection. The brains are then rapidly frozen by immersion in isopentane at - 45 °C for 3 min before being sealed into vials and stored at -70 °C until use. Coronal brain cryosections (20 μm) are cut serially and subjected to immunofluorescence protocol 11, 6.\nBring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use. Please note that the presented working dilutions of antibodies and serum resulted from trials made in order to obtain the best performance. When different antibodies and serum are used, the protocol needs to be validated.\nNote that because both anti-CD11b and anti-CD68 primary antibodies are made in rat, to avoid cross signal by anti-rat Alexa 546, we used a high dilution of anti-CD11b followed by fluorescent signal amplification with TSA kit (Cy5 Tyramide). We have set up the optimal working dilution for anti-CD11b by performing the described protocol except for step 1.17 and using at least 7 different dilutions of anti-CD11b as reported in table 1. As a result, 1:30,000 has been chosen being the only dilution achieving: 1) visible signal with Cy5 at excitation wavelength 646 nm; 2) no signal with Alexa 546 at excitation wavelength 532 nm. In this way, Alexa 546 fluorescent signal is selectively associated with CD68 expression.\nThe optimal dilutions for anti-CD11b and anti-CD68 antibodies may vary depending on the type of tissue and must be defined prior to start the co-labeling protocol.\nWash brain cryosections twice with PBS.",
    "Incubate cryosections for 5 min in PBS containing 1% H2O2 (step required since the fluorescent amplification needs incubation with horseradish peroxidase, streptavidin-HRP, see step 1.12).\nWash cryosections 2x with PBS.\nIncubate cryosections for 60 min in PBS containing 10% NGS and 0.3% Triton.\nIncubate cryosections at 4 °C overnight in PBS containing primary Ab Rat anti-CD11b [1:30,000], 10% NGS and 0.3% Triton.\nWash cryosections 2x (5 min) with PBS.\nIncubate cryosections for 60 min in PBS containing biotinylated secondary anti-Rat Ab [1:200] and 1% NGS.\nWash cryosections 2x with PBS.\nWash cryosections with TNT (Tris-HCl, NaCl, Tween: 0.1 M TRIS-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20).\nIncubate cryosections for 1.5 hr in TNB (Tris-HCl-NaCl-Blocking buffer: 0.1 M TRIS-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Blocking reagent from appropriate kit (see table of reagents)).\nWash cryosections 3x times with TNT.\nIncubate cryosections in TNB containing streptavidin-HRP [1:100].\nWash cryosections 3x with TNT.\nIncubate cryosections for 8 min in Amplification Diluent containing Cyanine 5 Tyramide [1:300].\nWash cryosections 3x with PBS.\nIncubate cryosections for 60 min in PBS containing 10% NGS and 0.1% Triton.\nIncubate cryosections at 4 °C overnight in PBS containing primary Ab Rat anti-CD68 [1:200], 3% NGS and 0.3% Triton.\nWash cryosections 3x with PBS.\nIncubate cryosections for 60 min in PBS containing fluorconjugated secondary Ab Alexa 546 anti-Rat [1:500] and 1% NGS.\nWash cryosections 3x with PBS.\nIncubate cryosections for 10 min in PBS containing Hoechst 1 μg/ml.\nWash cryosections 3x with PBS.\nMount cryosections in Prolong Gold.\n2. Acquisition of Three-dimensional Images by Confocal Microscopy\nThe microscope used here was a IX81 microscope equipped with a confocal scan unit FV500 with 3 laser lines: Ar-Kr (488nm), He-Ne red (646nm), and He-Ne green (532nm) and a UV diode.",
    "Select the excitation lasers depending on the wavelengths of the fluorescent dyes to be excited (He-Ne red for Cy5, CD11b; He-Ne green for Alexa546, CD68 and the UV diode for Hoechst, nuclei).\nSelect the best dichroic mirror combination for light signal collection.\nSet up image resolution at a minimum of 800 x 600 pixels.\nIdentify an area of interest by using epi-fluorescence and progressively increase the magnification to the 40X objective.\nSwitch to Laser Scanning Microscopy (LSM) modality.\nRun repetitive scans to adjust the photomultiplier (PMT) and the gain for each channel. Lasers may be turned on individually to facilitate the set up. Keep gain as low as possible to avoid unwanted non-specific signals.\nWith repetitive scan running, move the focus control to define lower and upper extremes of the z-axis (total z-axis length = 10 μm).\nStop repetitive scan.\nDefine step size. It should be as close as possible to pixel size (0.225 μm) to obtain a standard 1:1 size ratio over the z-axis.\nActivate Kalman filter at least 2 times.\nActivate sequential scanning mode to avoid bleed-through effects.\nGo half-way along the z-axis and run a xy sequential scan. Check the set-up of PMT and gain (good signal/noise ratio). If not satisfactory, repeat step 2.6.\nRun xyz acquisition.\nExport data as multitiff file. Each multitiff file typically contains 3 color channels (blue, green and red) and 44 focal planes.\n3. Three-dimensional View of Confocal Acquisitions and Three-dimensional Rendering\nUpload multitiff files to Imaris software and process them as follows:\nOpen software.\nSelect the surpass view.\nUpload the multitiff file.\nSelect the desired color for each channel.\nRemove noise from background by increasing the minimum value on the display adjustment panel. Adjust each channel individually.\nGo to the section view. Move along the z-axis looking for co-localization (yellow pixels).",
    "Click on a yellow area to see whether the colocalization is present along the z-axis (i.e. belongs to a solid object). Z-axis projections are visible in the right and bottom part of the figure.\nTake a snapshot.\nGo back to surpass view.\nCrop 3D to isolate a cell or a cluster of cells.\nSelect one channel on the display adjustment panel.\nSelect the surpass/surfaces algorithm builder. Algorithm steps:\n\t\nSelect channel.\nDefine threshold (use the same minimum value in the display adjustment panel).\nDefine resizing.\nDefine smoothing (best = 0.200).\nDefine color appearance.\nEnd algorithm.\nRepeat step 3.12 for each channel.\nDeselect fluorescence channels on the display adjustment panel and select all the three surfaces.\nMove the volume to find the best view.\nTake a snapshot.\nSubscription Required.
