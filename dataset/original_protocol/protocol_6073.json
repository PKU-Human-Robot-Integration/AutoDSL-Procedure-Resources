  "procedures": [
    "Metabolic labeling of S. cerevisiae culturePrepare 96% ethanol for fast inactivation of cells. Prepare for each culture 1x culture volume of ethanol in a centrifuge bucket (or flask) that can accommodate 2.5x or more of culture volume. Pre-chill these flasks to around -70 °C in a box with plenty of dry ice. Use 100 ml culture in URA- media for a standard experiment.Grow cells to an optical density (OD600) of 0.4 to 0.8.Add 1/10,000 culture volume of 100 mM 4tU (i.e., final concentration of 10 µM) and mix thoroughly. Note: If you process several cultures in parallel, prepare and follow an exact time schedule to be able to precisely adhere to the desired labeling times. Remember to prepare one culture that has not been treated with 4tU (negative control) and process it as the other samples. Continue to grow for desired metabolic labeling time (usually 2 min to enrich strongly for nascent RNA). Note: Time of labeling can be optimized by testing several time points, e.g., 1, 2, 5 and 10 min and comparing the enrichment of desired targets (see [Optional] Quality Control section). Quickly inactivate cells by pouring culture into 1x volume of deep-chilled ethanol prepared in Step A1. Leave on normal ice until all samples ready to centrifuge. Note: The idea behind this approach is that simply putting cells on ice or the like will allow metabolic activity for an uncontrollable amount of time, whereas pouring into deep-chilled ethanol will instantaneously stop all activity and allow for precise control over labeling time. Spin at 1,500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant, resuspend in 3 ml of ice-cold ddH2O and split the suspension into 3 x 2 ml Eppendorf tubes.",
    "Spin cells in Eppendorf tubes at full speed for 12 s, and wash cells another 2 rounds each with 1 ml ice cold ddH2O.Carefully remove supernatant. Store pellet at -70 °C or continue with RNA extraction.Extract total RNANote: The 3 aliquots from above are handled separately, and all phenolizations and precipitation in this section are done in 2 ml tubes. You will need 15 tubes per sample.Resuspend cells in 800 µl TES. Add 800 µl acidic phenol and shake vigorously for 1 h at 65 °C in a thermomixer.Spin for 5 min at full speed and 4 °C. Transfer top phase to a new tube and phenolize with another 700 µl acidic phenol by shaking vigorously for 5 min at 65 °C in a heated block.Spin for 5 min as above.Take top phase to a new tube and extract with 700 µl chloroform by vortexing vigorously for 20 s at room temperature. Spin for 1 min as above.Take top phase to a new tube and extract with 600 µl chloroform by vortexing vigorously for 20 s at room temperature. Spin for 1 min as above.Take 500 µl of the top phase to a new tube and precipitate RNA by adding 50 µl 3 M NaOAc and ice-cold 1.4 ml 96% ethanol.Spin immediately for 20 min at full speed at 4 °C.Wash pellet twice with 1 ml 70% ethanol each.Resuspend RNA in 100 µl RNA storage solution per tube. Note: Be careful to avoid overdrying the pellets, as very dry pellets are hard to dissolve. This can be done by first removing most ethanol with a pipet, re-spin briefly, remove any remaining ethanol with a pipet P200 and then leave tubes open for ca. 1 min open at RT before resuspension.",
    "Resuspension should be fast and require only a bit of shaking and/or pipetting up and down. Combine RNA from 3 aliquotes and measure the RNA concentration of a 1:5 dilution using, i.e., a Nanodrop. Note: RNA concentration of the undiluted sample should be > 1 µg/µl. Biotinylate 4sU RNAPrepare coupling reaction by buffering 500 µg RNA with 4 µl 1 M HEPES-KOH pH 7.5 and 0.8 µl 0.5 M EDTA and fill with RNA storage solution to 400 µl. Note: If 500 µg RNA is not available, the protocol is doable with 300 µg or even less. Optional: Add spike-in RNA. We usually use 3-5 µg (1/100 w/w) S. pombe spike-in RNA (see Recipes and Data analysis).Add 10 µl of the 5 mg/ml MTSEA-biotin stock, vortex to mix and incubate for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark.During this incubation prepare Zeba columns, place Zeba columns in 15 ml Falcon tubes. Drain and wash each column 3 x with 2 ml RNA storage solution each. For each wash: apply liquid and spin 2 min at 1,000 x g.Apply MTSEA coupling reactions onto drained Zeba columns, let liquid soak in resin for 2 min, add then another 130 µl RNA storage solution, spin for 2 min at 1,000 x g in a fresh 15 ml Falcon and recover the flow-through which contains biotin-coupled RNA devoid of free MTSEA-biotin coupling reagent. Precipitate the flow-through (~500 µl) with 50 µl 3 M NaOAc and 1.4 ml 96% ethanol. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C or overnight at -20 °C. Spin for 20 min at 4 °C, full speed.Wash 2 x 1 h at RT each with 1 ml 80% ethanol in the dark. Spin for 15 min at 4 °C, 16,000 x g between washes.",
    "Note: As above, take care to void overdrying the pellet, i.e., simply leave tubes with pellet open at RT for 1 min and then resuspend. Resuspend RNA in 250 µl RNA storage solution.Take 10 µl of input (‘Total RNA’) aliquot.Isolation of the biotinylated RNAAdd to 240 µl RNA sample: 30 µl 10x NaMg, 30 µl 1 M NaPi, 3 µl 10% SDS.Note: This results in the RNA sample in ~300 µl with a solvent composition equivalent to 1x NaPSMg. Prepare magnetic streptavidin-coupled beads (adjust the amount depending on number of samples):Use 50 µl Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 slurry per sample.Drain beads by applying on magnet and pipetting off the liquid.Wash first 1 x with 400 µl 1x NaMgPS.Block beads with 200 µl 1x NaMgPS + 10 µl 20 mg/ml glycogen.Rotate for 20 min at RT.Remove blocking solution from magnetic beads.Wash 1 x with 400 µl NaMgPS.Drain beads and add RNA immediately.Let the RNAs bind to beads for 30 min at room temperature by gentle agitation, i.e., on a rotating wheel in the dark.Remove supernatant from magnetic beads.Wash 5 x with 400 µl 1x NaMgPS each.Wash 1 x with 400 µl TEN1000.Elute biotinylated RNA by incubating 2 x with 50 µl β-mercaptoethanol. Incubate for 5 min at RT before removing eluate at each step.Combine eluates and precipitate RNA with 10 µl 3 M NaOAc, pH 5, 2.5 µl 20 mg/ml glycogen and 250 µl 96% ethanol.Incubate on dry ice for 30 min or -20 °C overnight.Spin for 30 min at full speed, 4 °C.Wash RNA pellet 2 x with 75% ethanol, to remove β-mercaptoethanol as much as possible.Resuspend in 20 µl RNA storage solution.DNase-treat 2 µl (4 µg) of the total RNA aliquot and 17.",

And it is also applicable to other similar products (e.g., RNA-seq kit).Carry out ribo-depletion using Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit for Yeast (Illumina) essentially as per the manufacturer’s instruction but using a downscaled version.Mix 18 µl of eluate with 2 µl reaction buffer, 2 µl of removal solution and 8 µl of RNase-free ddH2O. Incubate for 10 min at 65 °C and cool to room temperature for 5 min.Add 65 µl of rRNA magnetic beads to the reaction mix from Step F3 and first incubate for 5 min at room temperature and then 5 min at 50 °C.
