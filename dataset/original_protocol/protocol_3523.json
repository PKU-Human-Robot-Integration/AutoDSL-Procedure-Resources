Therefore, investigators should utilize cells lacking their gene of interest and optimize the amount of plasmid DNA used during transfection to minimize spontaneous stress granule formation while also providing a wide dynamic range for analysis.\nThe day before transfection, seed cells such that they will be 40% confluent on the day of transfection.\nInvestigators should determine the optimal confluency at the time of transfection.\nFor G3BP knockout U2OS cells, seed 20,000 cells per well in a 4-well chamber slide 16–24 h before transfection.\n16–24 h after seeding, dilute 200 ng of plasmid DNA containing GFP-G3BP1 or your GFP-tagged gene of interest in Buffer EC from the Effectene Transfection Reagent kit for a total volume of 60 μL.\nAdd 1.6 μL of Enhancer from the Effectene Transfection Reagent kit, vortex for 1 s, and briefly spin down the mixture.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 2–5 min.\nAdd 5 μL of Effectene Transfection Reagent, vortex for 10 s, and briefly spin down the mixture.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 5–10 min.\nMeanwhile, remove cells from the incubator, gently aspirate growth medium, and add 350 μL of fresh growth medium.\nAdd 350 μL of growth medium to the transfection complex, mix well by pipetting, and add the transfection complex dropwise onto cells.\nGently swirl the slide to distribute the transfection complex and return cells to the incubator.\n24 h later, remove cells from the incubator, gently aspirate growth media and add 400 μL of fresh growth medium.",
    "Return cells to the incubator for an additional 24 h.\nNote: Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for troubleshooting. Alternative transfection methods can be used.\nLive-cell imaging\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes how cells should be visualized to measure relative GFP intensity and stress granule initiation time for intracellular threshold determination.\nEquilibrate the microscope to 37°C and 5% CO2.\nThe use of an objective heater (Bioptechs) can help to maintain the temperature at 37°C.\nSet the 488 nm laser to 80 power and 100 ms frame exposure time using a 35 μm slit.\nAn average power of 0.37 mW and irradiance at the sample of 2 W/cm2 was used; however, investigators should optimize the imaging parameters.\nIdentify cells for imaging.\nTransient transfection of your gene of interest should result in cell-to-cell variation in expression levels. Select cells with varying intensities of GFP (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/445-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Scale bar, 10 μm.\n(B) Time-lapse imaging of cells treated with sodium arsenite. Cells were transfected as in (A) and were treated with 500 μM sodium arsenite. Images were collected for 2 h; select images depicting stress granule initiation are shown. Yellow arrows indicate stress granules. Scale bar, 10 μm.\n(C) Quantification of GFP intensity. The GFP intensity of each cell before sodium arsenite treatment was quantified using ImageJ. Scale bar, 10 μm.\n(D) Live-cell and immunofluorescent imaging of transfected cells. Cells were transfected as in (A), subjected to live-cell imaging (left), and subsequently fixed and immunostained for G3BP1 (right).",
    "(E) Live-cell and immunofluorescent imaging of wild-type cells. Wild-type cells (left cell) lack GFP (left panel) but exhibit signal from G3BP antibody staining (right panel), whereas transfected cells (right cell) can be visualized by both GFP and antibody staining.\nCells with GFP-G3BP1 intensities ranging from 700 to 5000 RFU were selected.\nAvoid cells with spontaneous stress granules. Cells should not exhibit stress granules prior to treatment with sodium arsenite. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nWithin Prairie View, the selected fields can be stored as stage locations in the “XY-Stage” tab.\nTake a multipoint time-lapse, imaging each field every 40 s for two iterations.\nWithin Prairie View, a time-lapse “T-Series” can be set up to “Run at all XYZ stage locations.”\nThese initial images will be used to quantify GFP intensity for each cell prior to stress granule induction and to ensure proper stage movement and focus between selected stage locations.\nTreat cells with sodium arsenite (t = 0) for a final concentration of 500 μM.\nDilute the 50 mM stock solution of sodium arsenite to 1 mM with growth medium.\nAdd 400 μL of the 1 mM sodium arsenite solution to cells (cultured in 400 μL of growth medium) to allow for sufficient mixing without disturbing the slide.\nCritical: Do not disturb the slide when treating cells. Slight perturbations can shift cells out of the saved stage locations. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nImmediately begin a multipoint time-lapse and collect images for 2 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nInvestigators should optimize the duration of the experiment for the specific cell line used.\nPause Point: The next steps can be performed at any time.\nQuantification of GFP intensity and stress granule initiation time\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes how to measure GFP intensity and stress granule initiation time on a cell-by-cell basis.",
    "Import image files for analysis into ImageJ.\nCreate an XY table in GraphPad Prism with one row for each cell. GFP intensity will be entered as the X value and stress granule initiation time will be entered as the Y value.\nSelect a region of interest from the background and use the Analyze > Measure command to measure the mean intensity for background correction.\nQuantify the GFP intensity of each cell from the frame before sodium arsenite addition.\nWithin ImageJ, use the “Freehand Selections” tool to outline a cell (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUse the Analyze > Measure command to determine the total cell integrated density, area, and mean intensities.\nTo measure the GFP intensity of the cytoplasm only, use the “Freehand Selections” tool to outline the nucleus and use the Analyze > Measure command to determine the integrated density and area of the nucleus. These values can be subtracted from the total cell measurements to determine the average intensity from the cytoplasm.\n((Total cell integrated density − Nuclear integrated density)/(Total cell area − Nuclear area)) − Mean background intensity = Corrected mean cytoplasmic intensity\nInvestigators should determine the appropriate region of interest selection method.\nTo measure the stress granule initiation time of each cell, identify the time after sodium arsenite treatment when two stress granules form (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nThe associated graph should have GFP intensity on the X-axis and stress granule initiation time on the Y-axis with each cell plotted as a single point. Using this graph, investigators can determine the threshold for intracellular phase separation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/445-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(A) G3BP1 expression correlates with SG initiation time. G3BP knockout U2OS cells were transiently transfected with GFP-G3BP1. GFP-G3BP1 protein levels were determined at single-cell resolution by live-cell imaging before stress. Cells were then treated with 500 μM sodium arsenite to induce stress granule assembly and the time at which stress granule assembly initiated was quantified and correlated to GFP-G3BP1 protein levels (n = 3, total 168 cells analyzed). GFP-G3BP1 expression beyond a threshold (dotted red line) results in enhanced stress granule formation. Figure adapted from Lee et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\n(B) Correlation between GFP-G3BP1 fluorescent intensity from GFP and immunofluorescent intensity from G3BP1 antibody staining. G3BP knockout cells were transfected with GFP-G3BP1. 48 h post transfection, GFP intensity was determined at single-cell resolution by live-cell imaging. Cells were then immunostained for G3BP1 and fluorescence from the G3BP1 immunostaining was correlated to the previously measured GFP intensity on a cell-by-cell basis (n = 3, total 76 cells analyzed). Figure adapted from Lee et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\n(C) MAGE-B2 knockout increases G3BP1 protein levels beyond the threshold (dotted red line determined from A) for enhanced stress granule formation. The relative amounts of endogenous G3BP1 in either wild-type or MAGE-B2 knockout U2OS cells was determined in relation to GFP-G3BP1 in (A) (n = 3). p value ≤ 0.05 was determined by t test. Figure adapted from Lee et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nPause Point: The next steps can be performed at any time.\nDetermination of endogenous protein levels\nTiming: 4–5 days\nThis section describes how to seed and immunostain cells in order to measure endogenous protein levels relative to the determined threshold concentration.",
    "Note: In our case, we sought to quantify G3BP1 protein levels in wild-type cells or in cells lacking a translational repressor of G3BP relative to the identified threshold. To do so, we transfected G3BP knockout cells with GFP-G3BP1 as described in steps 1–9 and seeded either wild-type or mutant cells. Then, we used live-cell imaging to measure GFP intensity and subsequently fixed and immunostained cells to measure G3BP1 immunofluorescent intensity in wild-type, mutant, or transfected G3BP knockout cells.\nNote: As noted previously, this portion of the experiment can be performed at any time.\nUse a gridded chamber slide or simply mark X- and Y-axes on the bottom of the slide with an oil-resistant marker.\nU2OS cells are highly adherent, however, cell types that do not readily adhere to tissue culture plates may benefit from coating plates with a binding agent (e.g., poly-lysine).\nCritical: It is essential that investigators are able to relocate cells because transfected cells will be visualized by live-cell imaging to measure GFP intensity and subsequently immunostained to measure immunofluorescent intensity at single-cell resolution.\nTransfect knockout cells with your GFP-tagged gene of interest as described in steps 1–9.\n24 h after transfection, aspirate the growth media and gently wash cells.\nSeed 500 μL of wild-type (or mutant) cells in the same well as the transfected cells.\nInvestigators should determine the optimal number of cells to seed after transfection.\nFor wild-type U2OS cells, seed 10,000 cells per well in a 4-well chamber slide 24 h after transfection.\nReturn cells to the incubator for an additional 24 h.\nThe next day, perform live-cell imaging as described in steps 12–14.\nCapture images of the selected cells.\nSave the stage locations of the selected fields to assist in cell relocation after immunostaining.\nPrepare fresh Fixing Solution for immunostaining.",
    "Gently wash cells with 1 mL of PBS.\nCritical: Use caution not to lift off cells in subsequent steps, particularly with poorly adherent cell lines. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nFix cells with 500 μL of Fixing Solution for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nMeanwhile, prepare fresh Blocking Solution.\nWash cells 2× with 500 μL of PBS for 5 min.\nPermeabilize cells with 500 μL of Blocking Solution for 20 min at 4°C.\nMeanwhile, dilute primary antibody in Blocking Solution and spin down at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDilute G3BP1 antibody 1:200. For other cell lines or genes of interest, investigators should optimize the amount of primary antibody used.\nAdd 250 μL of diluted primary antibody to cells and incubate 12–18 h at 4°C or 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nFor 12–18 h incubations, place the slide in a container with a wet paper towel as a humidifier. If necessary, increase the volume of diluted primary antibody to prevent cells from drying out.\nWash cells 3× with 500 μL of Wash Solution for 5 min.\nMeanwhile, dilute secondary antibody 1:500 in Blocking Solution and spin down at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAdd 500 μL of diluted secondary antibody to cells, cover with foil to prevent photobleaching, and incubate for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash cells 3× with 500 μL of Wash Solution for 5 min.\nAdd 500 μL of PBS to cells.\nReturn the slide to the microscope in the same orientation as it was previously imaged.\nSet the 488 and 561 nm lasers to 80 power and 100 ms exposure time using a 35 μm slit.\nInvestigators should optimize the imaging parameters.\nRelocate cells for immunofluorescent imaging (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nEach cell that was previously imaged for GFP should now be imaged for antibody staining.",
    "Identify and image cells that lack GFP but exhibit signal from antibody staining (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nThese are the wild-type (or mutant) cells that were seeded after transfection.\nPause Point: The next steps describe image analysis and can be performed at any time.\nImport image files for analysis into ImageJ.\nCreate an XY table in GraphPad Prism with one row for each transfected cell.
