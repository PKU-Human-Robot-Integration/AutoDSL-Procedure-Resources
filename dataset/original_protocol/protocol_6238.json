    "General notes on samples handling: Sample fixation is best performed in tightly sealed RNase free containers, such as Eppendorf or Falcon tubes.  Once samples are re-hydrated, they can be transferred to RNase free in situ hybridization baskets (shown in Figure 1A). The density of samples might affect the in situ hybridization results: overfilled vials/baskets often yield poorly stained/damaged samples, and too little amount of sample (e.g., one embryo) might become over-stained (possibly due to unbalanced ratio probe/target). Sample fixation/dehydration (Table 1)Notes: Fixatives should be handled and disposed of according to laboratory safety guidelines. Fixation (choice of fixative, duration of fixation) must be adapted to sample types.  Two alternative types of fixation are provided, for colorimetric in situ hybridization (CISH), and for fluorescent in situ (FISH).Table 1.

Rehydrationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190829/20190829031529_0117.jpg(Optional) Permeabilization; proteinase K treatment permeabilize tissues (Table 3)Notes:Treatment time should be titrated for each new batch of enzyme, as strength might vary. A useful rule of thumb is treating a test sample until tissue damage appears, and halving the resulting time (see Figure 3 in Notes section for further details). This step might prove unnecessary for very delicate tissues.Table 3. Permeabilization imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190829/20190829031548_5535.jpg (Optional) Acetylation (Table 4)Note: This step might help reducing non-specific signal, due to probes binding to positively charged surfaces.Table 4. Acetylationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190829/20190829031609_1149.jpg (Optional) Re-fixation (Table 5)Notes: Depending on sample type (e.g., fragile invertebrate embryos), an additional re-fixation step prior to hybridization might be required.  Generally, it is advisable to re-fix after proteinase K treatment.  Glutaraldehyde might be omitted: it is recommended to test several options while setting up the protocol for the first time. Glutaraldehyde penetrates tissues slowly, and its use is preferable for samples thinner than 1 mm (Eltoum et al., 2001). Table 5.

    "jpg Hybridization (Table 6)Notes: Do not let the temperature drop during the pre-hybridization/hybridization phase. Transfer of baskets or addition of probe might take long time. When working on multiple samples, set up manageable batches. The urea-based hybridization buffer tends to be viscous, and evaporation can be an important issue, leading to the formation of crystals that will damage the samples. Seal vials/multi-well plate carefully (Figure 1C). Be aware that some sample types might become temporarily transparent while in heated hybridization buffer. In this phase, they will be also more fragile. Table 6. Hybridizationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190903/20190903233248_7084.jpgBlocking (Table 7)Table 7.
