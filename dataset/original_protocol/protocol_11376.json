  "procedures": [
    "All procedures have been approved by the local ethics committee (Human Research Ethics Committee, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice/Tumorothèque BB-0033-00025).\nNOTE: This protocol is specifically adjusted for the use of the 22C3 antibody concentrate on a commercially available automated IHC stainer (referred to as autostainer here, see the Table of Materials) for tumor biopsies and cytology samples.\n1. Preparation of Tumor Tissue Samples\nFix tumor tissue in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) in a cassette.\n\tNOTE: Tumor tissue from proximal lung tumors is generally obtained by bronchoscopy, performed under moderate sedation by a pulmonologist, or lung specialist. For peripheral lesions and diffuse lung disease, a transbronchial or needle biopsy is indicated. These procedures are usually done in a surgery room or intensive care unit.\nEmbed the cassette in paraffin.\n\tNOTE: Fixation can be achieved by perfusion or immersion immediately following dissection, and typically requires 8–10 h. The fixative volume should be 15–20x higher than the specimen volume. It is not recommended to fix biopsy tissue for more than 10 h, because overfixation can cause masking of the antigen. The fixation speed is about 1 mm/h at room temperature.\nInfiltrate the fixed tissue sample with wax in the tissue processor (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Dehydration is performed in three alcohol baths with increasing concentrations 70%, 85%, and 90%. Water is finally removed by three final absolute alcohol baths. The clearing is performed in three toluene baths, and the wax infiltration in hot wax baths (44–60 °C).\nEmbed the tissue inside a mold filled with molten paraffin (see Table of Materials) and wait for solidification.\nSection the paraffin-embedded tissue at a thickness of 3 μm on a microtome.\nTransfer the paraffin ribbon to a positively charged microscope glass slide (see Table of Materials).",
    "Dry the slide for 1 h at 37 °C.\n\tNote: Store the tissue sections at 2–8 °C (preferred) or at room temperature up to 25 °C to preserve antigenicity, and stain within 15 d of sectioning.\n2. Preparation of Cytology Samples\nCollect bronchial washings in a preservative solution (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: For this, standard bronchoscopy technique is used.\n\t\nLavage the distribution of the bronchus to be sampled. Collect the wash in a clean container. Label the container with the patient’s first and last name, date of birth, and specimen source.\nTransfer the bronchial washings to a 50 mL conical tube and add 2 g of DL-Dithiothreitol powder (see Table of Materials), vortex the tube for 30 min, and then centrifuge it at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and add 10 mL of a mucolytic solution (see Table of Material).\nShake the sample for 20 min at medium speed (level 9) and centrifuge it at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and deposit the cell pellet in collection tubes containing 10% NBF.\nAdd 4 drops of a cell block preparation reagent (see Table of Materials) to the cell pellet.\nTransfer the cell pellet to a cassette, fix it in 10% NBF, and paraffin-embed it for cell block preparation and sectioning (see steps 1.1–1.7).\n3. PD-L1 Staining Assay\nSwitch on the autostainer and the computer.\nDouble-click on the autostainer icon and choose the user.\nClick on 'Create label' and then on 'Protocol'.\nDouble-click on the 22C3 protocol.\n\tNOTE: The protocol is first installed on the autostainer’s computer by clicking on 'Create Protocol'. The full protocol is provided as Supplementary File 1.\nWrite the patient’s ID on the label and click on 'Print'.",
    "Stick the label on the slide.\nOpen the slide drawer by pressing on the button of the drawer that has been chosen.\nPlace the labeled slide on the thermal pad with the label facing up- and inward.\nClose the slide drawer.\nRemove the caps from the dispensers and load the reagents on the reagents’ racks.\nOpen the hood of the stainer and place the racks on the reagents’ carrousel making sure that they fit and hold in position.\nClose the hood.\nOn the software, click on the instrument that will be used and click on 'Running'.\nAt the end of the IHC procedure, rinse the slide for several seconds with tap water and one drop of a cleaning solution.\nRehydrate the slide with one bath of ethanol 100% and a second bath of ethanol 95% for several seconds.\nPlace the slide into the coverslipping machine for an automated loading of the coverslip.\n4. Interpretation of the PD-L1 Staining\nNOTE: A qualified pathologist should perform the interpretation of the PD-L1 IHC test.\nAssess the quality of the PD-L1 staining by analyzing the positive and negative controls before the examination of the patient’s specimen.\n\tNOTE: The results obtained on the patient’s specimen are considered invalid if the staining of the controls is not acceptable.\nConfirm the presence of a minimum of 100 viable tumor cells under a microscope.\n\tNOTE: Report when the patient’s specimen has less than 100 tumor cells.\nAt a low magnification of 4X, evaluate all well-preserved positive and negative tumor areas.\n\tNOTE: At a low magnification, partial membrane staining or membrane staining of weak intensity (1+) may be difficult to recognize.\nScore partial or complete cell membrane staining.\n\tNOTE: The cytoplasmic staining has to be excluded from interpretation.",
    "Calculate the TPS by assessing the proportion of PD-L1 positive tumor cells relative to all tumor cells present in the well-preserved tumor areas.\n\tNOTE: Only viable tumor cells should be examined. All other cellular elements, such as immune cells, necrotic cells, normal cells, and artifacts, have to be excluded from the examination.\nSubscription Required.
