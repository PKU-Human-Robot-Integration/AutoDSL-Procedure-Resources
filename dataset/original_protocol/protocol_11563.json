    "Ethics Statement: The following protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Delaware.\n1. Developmental Exposure (or Model of Binge-like Ethanol Exposure)\nOn PD3, determine the sex of each animal and cross-foster any animals if necessary to keep litter size (8 animals) and sex distribution (4 males : 4 females) consistent within each litter.\n\tNOTE: It is important to keep litter size and sex distribution as consistent as possible to avoid experimental confounds. Although this protocol uses 8 pups (4 males and 4 females) per litter, alternative litter sizes or sex distributions may be tailored to the needs of the experimental design.\nSubcutaneously inject a small amount of black India ink into the paws to identify animals within each litter.\nPseudo-randomly assign litters as experimental (containing 50% alcohol-exposed (AE) and 50% sham-intubated control (SI) pups) or suckle control (SC) (animals that do not undergo any intubation, tail clipping, or separation protocols from PD 4 - 9 except for daily weighing and ear-punching).\n\t\nTo retain consistent group size, assign twice as many experimental litters as SC litters.\nWeigh each animal then return it to its home cage. Animal weighing should occur daily during the intubation period (PD 4 - 9).\n\t\nRemove the whole litter from the dam.\nPlace pups on heated pad.\nRecord the weight of each individual pup.\nOn PD4, after weighing each animal calculate the necessary alcohol amount for a total of 5.25 g/kg/day per each animal (based on pup weight from step 1.4)8.\n\t\nAdminister alcohol as 11.9% ethanol-in-milk substitute (vol/vol).\nStarting at 9 AM, remove one litter's pups from the mother at a time.\nAdminister the ethanol-in-milk to each AE pup34.\nSham-intubate each SI pup8.\nRepeat steps 1.5. through 1.8. for each experimental litter.",
    "Two hours following the first dose, repeat the dosing procedure (steps 1.5 through 1.8) for a second alcohol dose.\nOne and a half hours after the second alcohol dose (the point at which peak daily blood alcohol content is achieved), collect and centrifuge blood from the AE and SI pups via tail clipping for future blood alcohol content analysis35.\n\t\nCollect 60 µL of blood.\nPlace blood in a 1 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge blood at 1.5 x g for 25 min.\nCarefully collect the supernatant serum from the centrifuge tube and save for future blood alcohol content analysis.\nRepeat the dosing procedure (steps 1.5 through 1.8) using milk instead of ethanol-in-milk to prevent nutritional deficits from nursing inability in AE pups.\n\t\nPerform a total of 2 supplemental milk doses 2 h apart on PD 4.\nRepeat steps 1.4 through 1.12 (except for step 1.11) on PD 5 – 9.\nFollowing the final supplemental milk dose on PD9, ear punch all pups for identification in the EC cage.\n\t\nCoordinate punched ear with some measure of litter number or identifier (e.g., odd numbered litters within a cohort would get their left ear punched while animals from even numbered litters would get their right ears punched). This will make it easier to identify animals in the EC cage should multiple animals from different litters have the same pawmark pattern.\n2. Weaning\nOn PD 23, house all animals in cages of 2 - 3.\n\t\nEnsure that all animals housed in the same cage are the same sex.\nInclude one SC, one SI, and one AE animal per cage when possible.\nMinimize the number of cage mates that are from the same litter.\nMake sure all animals are capable of accessing food and water.\n3. Wheel Running",
    "On PD30, allocate half of the cages with animals to WR. House these animals in cages with a free access to attached stainless steel running wheel.\n\t\nEnsure that wheels have a counter to assess the total number of revolutions.\nWeigh all animals on PD 30 and PD 36.\nCheck the number of revolutions of each wheel at 9 AM every day.\nLeave animals in their respective housing condition for 12 days.\n4. Environmental Complexity\nPrepare the EC cage before 9 AM on the day that corresponds to PD 42 for experimental animals.\n\t\nGet a 30 \" x 18 \" x 36 \" galvanized steel cage.\n\t\tNOTE: The cage should have multiple levels, be capable of supporting the weight of multiple rats, be filled with standard bedding, and have multiple locations to attach water bottles and food dispensers.\nPlace novel, colorful objects of variable sizes and shapes in the cage.\n\t\t\nPlace 6 large toys in the EC cage. Ensure that each toy is big enough for 3 or more rats to interact with concurrently.\nPlace 6 medium toys in the EC cage. Ensure that each toy is big enough for 3 - 4 rats to interact with concurrently.\nPlace a lot (at least 20) of smaller toys in the EC cage.\nUse toys of varying colors, shapes, size, etc. Novelty is critical to this intervention (see discussion).\nPlace two dishes of food at opposite ends of the cage.\nPlace two bottles of water at opposite ends of the cage.\nAt 9 AM on PD 42, weigh all animals and relocate the WR animals to the EC cage. Each EC cage should contain 9 - 12 animals.\n\t\nMake sure that no animals have both the same pawmark and ear-punch patterns.\nCheck all food and water daily.",
    "Every two days, remove the toys from the EC cage and replace them (according to step 4.1.2.).\nEvery three days, clean the EC cage.\n\t\nRemove the animals from the EC cage and put them in temporary holding cages of 2 - 3 animals.\nRemove all of the bedding from the bottom of the cage.\nReturn the same toys to the cage unless this day coincides with the toy replacement schedule (according to step 4.4.).\nReplace all of the food and water.\nReplace the rats into the EC cage.\n5. Collect Tissue\nNOTE: Tissue collection (e.g., perfusion with paraformaldehyde) and storage (e.g., freezing, paraffin embedding) can be performed with a variety of methods. The following will explain the process of perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS) solution8.\nCaution: Paraformaldehyde is carcinogenic and may also cause skin irritation, allergic skin reaction, or eye damage. Use appropriate eye/skin protection.\nExpose one rat at a time to isoflurane to lightly anesthetize the animal.\nIntraperitoneally inject the rat with 2 mL/kg of Ketamine/xylazine mixture (1.5 mL xylazine mixed with 10 mL of ketamine).\n\tNOTE: Ketamine and xylazine are both at stock concentrations of 100 mg/mL before combining for injection mixture.\nOnce rat is no longer responsive, perfuse the animal with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH = 7.2) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH = 7.2).\nRemove brain and store in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 48 h.\nAfter 2 days, transfer to solution of 30% sucrose added to 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C.\nSubscription Required.
