    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollect tissue or cells\nTiming: 30 min\nMice are injected intraperitoneally with Ketamine/Xylazine mixture. When toe pinch response is lost, tissues are harvested, placed in histology cassette and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nTissue collected in liquid nitrogen can be stored at −80°C for at least 3 months.\nFor in vivo negative and positive controls, mice were injected with siRNA against KHK or adeno associated virus containing mouse KHK-C plasmid under TBG promoter, respectively.\nNote: KHK siRNA was published previously (Softic et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). The AAV containing the mouse KHK-C gene was generated by Boston Children’s Hospital Viral Core.\nWild type and KHK overexpressing HepG2 cells are washed with PBS and lysed on ice with lysis buffer.\nNote: To obtain KHK overexpressing cells, HepG2 cells were infected (MOI=5) with a lentivirus containing the mouse KHK-C gene fused to GFP. After 5 days, cells were sorted for GFP and cultured for 3 weeks to obtain a colony of cells overexpressing KHK.\nCritical: Tissues should be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvesting.\nPreparation of tissue and cell lysate\nTiming: 120 min\nTissue lysate\nMake enough tissue lysis buffer (300 + 750 μL per sample) and keep on ice.\nPre-label 2 mL tubes, place a steel bead into each tube, and chill on dry ice.\nCut frozen liver pieces (30–40 mg) on dry ice and place them into pre-cooled 2 mL tubes.\nHomogenize tissues in 300 μL lysis buffer for 1.5 min at 1,200 rpm using tissue homogenizer.\nAdd 750 μL of lysis buffer and homogenize again for 1.5 min at 1,200 rpm.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 g (15,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer 900 μL of tissue lysate into a new 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Note: Ensure to avoid fatty top layer and cell debris pellet.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: This centrifugation step helps further remove lipid contamination.\nTransfer 700 μL into a new 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: Again, ensure to avoid fatty top layer.\nQuantify the amount of protein in each sample.\nCell lysate\nSeed HepG2 wild type and KHK overexpressing cells at a density of 250,000 cells in a 6-well plate.\nAfter two days of culturing, wash cells with 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nAdd 300 μL of lysis buffer on ice.\nScrape cells into a pre-cooled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSonicate the cells on 30% power for 10 s.\nCentrifuge the cells for 15 min at 16,000 g, 4°C.\nUse the cell supernatant and quantify the amount of protein in each sample.\nCritical: All processes need to be completed on ice.\nPrepare KHK enzyme substrate reaction\nTiming: 240 min\nPrepare 0.025 μg/μL protein homogenate for each sample in 1× assay buffer or 1× assay buffer negative control.\nNote: 1× assay buffer contains 150 mM of K+\nNote: 1× assay buffer negative control does not contain K+\nPrepare 2× substrate solution.\nNote: 2× substrate solution contains fructose and ATP.\nNote: 2× substrate solution negative control does not contain fructose or\nNote: 2× substrate solution negative control contains 3-O-methyl-d-fructose.\nTransfer 2.5 μL of 0.025 μg/μL protein homogenate or 0.27 ng/μL of recombinant human KHK-C protein in 1× assay buffer or negative control into 384 well plate.\nAdd 2.5 μL of 2× substrate solution or negative control immediately using electronic pipette.\nCover 384 well plate with microplate sealing film.\nSpin plate down for 1 min at 650 i (2000 rpm).\nIncubate for 1 h at 22°C–25°C.\nAdd 5 μL of ADP-Glo reagent to each control and sample wells.",
    "Spin plate down at 650 g.\nIncubate for 40 min at 22°C–25°C.\nAdd 10 μL of developer solution from ADP-Glo assay kit to the control and sample wells.\nSpin down the plate at 650 g.\nIncubate for another 40 min at 22°C–25°C in the dark.\nRead luminescence signal using plate reader.\nCalculate the relative amount of KHK activity by dividing ADP relative light unit (RLU) by ng of protein and by the time of the reaction. Subtract the background ADP RLU in samples treated with no fructose or 3-O-methyl-d-fructose.\nCritical: All processes need to be completed on ice."
