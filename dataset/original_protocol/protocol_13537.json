    "For all procedures involving human tissue, approval by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU Leuven (EC research) was acquired. All research was performed with informed consent and/or assent from parents, representatives, and/or patients.\nNOTE: All procedures involving rectal biopsies and organoids should be performed in a laminar flow to protect the researcher from any biological hazard and to minimize the risk of contamination of the cultures. As for any lab procedure, researchers should at all times wear lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles to manipulate samples.\n1. Rectal biopsy, isolation of adult stem cells from crypts, and organoid culture\nFor this initial part of the protocol, including media production and usage, organoid culture, splitting, expansion, and freezing for biobanking, follow the two previously published protocols8,12.\nIn short, the following steps have to be taken:\n\t\nTake three to four rectal biopsies with a forceps or suction device and collect in a sterile container (e.g., 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube) with the Ad-DF+++ medium as described in the protocol mentioned above.\nTransport biopsies to a central lab on ice or at 4 °C. Transport to other centers is possible, and quality is not significantly affected even when transport takes up to 48 h. If transport is expected to take over 6 h, use a 15 mL conical tube with 6 mL of Ad-DF+++ medium instead of a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nWash the biopsies in cold PBS until the supernatant is clear to remove the debris and non-epithelial tissues such as fat tissue.\nIncubate the biopsies with EDTA (final concentration 10 mM) to detach the crypts. Plate the crypts in a basement membrane matrix. Add broad-spectrum antibiotics (gentamicin 50 µg/mL and vancomycin 50 µg/mL) to the medium in the first week of culturing to prevent bacterial contamination.",
    "When the crypts have budded and are closed and proliferated, perform mechanical splitting, usually after 7 days.\nSplit the resulting organoids approximately every 7 days. This way, expand the culture, freeze backup samples in a biobank, or use the organoids for assays.\n2. Organoid plating for ROMA (day 1)\nMechanically split the organoids for plating\n\t\nCollect organoids from three well-grown wells from a 24-well plate by washing twice with cold Ad-DF+++ medium, collect them in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and assess them under the microscope12.\nEnsure that organoids are viable and of high quality, which can usually be achieved after 5-7 days of growth after being split previously (Figure 1).\nMechanically split the organoids according to the aforementioned protocol8,12. Repeat until the majority of the organoids, as assessed using the brightfield microscope, are small enough compared to the initial observation.\nCollect the smaller organoids, usually corresponding to the collection of about the top 4/5 of the organoid-medium solution in a new microcentrifuge tube, as big organoids sink to the bottom of the tube due to gravity and small organoids stay suspended in the upper part of the medium column.\nCentrifuge the sample of smaller organoids at 0.3 x 1000 g for 2 min and discard the medium.\nDilute the pellet of smaller organoids in 130 µL of 40%-50% basement membrane matrix (diluted with Ad-DF+++ medium12).\nResuspend well using a 200 µL micropipette.\nPlate the organoids in a 96-well plate\n\t\nUsing a 20 µL pipette, plate organoids in 32 wells of a pre-warmed 96-well plate. Ensure that each well contains one 4 µL drop of the organoid-matrix solution produced in the previous step.",
    "The organoids in the solution tend to form a pellet at the bottom of the tube due to gravity-dependent downwards displacement. To prevent this and ensure uniform plating, regularly resuspend the organoid-matrix solution using a 200 µL micropipette (e.g., every time after plating four to eight wells).\nPlate each drop in the center of the well to prevent the drop from running toward the edges of the well, which would reduce image quality later.\nAim for around 30 organoids per well (minimum 15, maximum 90) without overlapping organoids.\nKeep in mind that these organoids will have to be incubated overnight and will grow slightly during this time, and might start overlapping if the plating density is too high.\nCheck plating density using a brightfield microscope with a 5x magnification objective after plating the first one or two wells.\nIf the plating density is too high, dilute the organoid-matrix solution stepwise with the addition of the basement membrane matrix until the desired plating density is reached (Figure 2).\nAfter plating, gently tap the plate on a flat surface to ensure that the majority of organoids are in the same focal plane.\nIncubate the plate\n\t\nIncubate the 96-well plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 during 8-10 min to allow gelation of the basement membrane matrix.\nAdd 50 µL of human colon organoid medium +/+12 in each well and incubate overnight for 16-24 h.\nAdd no forskolin nor CFTR modulators, so the organoids grow under basal conditions.\n3. Organoid imaging using confocal microscopy (day 2)\nStain the organoids with calcein green\n\t\nPrepare a 1 mM stock solution of calcein green by adding 50 µL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to one vial containing 50 µg of calcein green.",
    "Prepare a working solution of calcein green by adding 1.2 µL of the stock solution to 200 µL of Ad-DF+++ (concentration 6 µM).\nAdd 5 µL of this calcein mixture to each well of the 96-well plate in which organoids were plated (final calcein concentration 0.6 µM). Do not touch and dislocate the matrix drop inside the well when performing this step.\nRotate and slightly tilt the plate with the lid on a few times to ensure homogenous distribution of the calcein green in the whole well.\nIncubate the plate again for 15-30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to ensure staining of all organoids in the wells.\nTransfer the plate to the confocal microscope\n\t\nTransfer the plate to the confocal microscope with an automated stage and integrated incubator. Ensure that the plate is well fixed in the plate holder.\nIncubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 is optional but not necessary, given the short duration (about 10 min) of the imaging process.\nFocus on the organoids (Figure 3)\n\t\nUsing the confocal microscope, determine the optimal x/y position and focus (z position) of the organoids in each well manually, and save these positions in the imaging software.\nThe best focus implies the sharpest possible delineation of the organoids and visualization of the largest possible part of the organoid drop. If the distribution of the stain is not adequate, repeat steps 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 (incubate, for example, for an extra 5-10 min).\nUse live-cell imaging settings with emission at 488 nm and excitation at 515 nm (specific for visualization of calcein fluorescence) and a 5x LD magnification objective.\nAcquire organoid pictures of the 32 wells with the confocal microscope (Figure 3 and Figure 4).",
    "Take images in a unidirectional way with a resolution of 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels (pixel size 2.5 µm x 2.5 µm) and depth of 16 bits.\nChoose the laser intensity and master gain for optimal visualization of morphological differences between CF and non-CF organoids (e.g., discrimination between a non-stained water-filled central lumen (if present) and a stained cellular border).\n\t\tNOTE: Organoids will not be delineated correctly when the master gain and thus the fluorescence signal are too low; setting the master gain too high will result in images with organoids with homogenous very high signal intensity, preventing imaging of more subtle morphological differences (Figure 2).\nSave one picture per well for all 32 wells in the microscope format and export them as TIFF files.\n4. Image analysis (Figure 5)\nLoad the TIFF files in the image analysis software.\nPerform the first quality check based on exclusion criteria determined by the operator (Figure 2): many differentiated or dead structures or debris, inadequate plating density, too many (e.g., overlapping) or too few organoids, and inadequate fluorescence distribution (organoids not clearly delineated, background signal too high).\n\tNOTE: This step can also be performed before exporting images as TIFF files in step 3.4.\nPrepare images for analysis\n\t\nRecalibrate images, so 1 pixel corresponds to 2.5 µm x 2.5 µm.\nCreate and open one Network Data (.ND) file of all 32 pictures for each organoid culture, enabling simultaneous analysis of all 32 pictures per subject.\nDelineate the organoids\n\t\nDelineate structures using a lower intensity threshold of 4,500 and an upper threshold of 65,535 (Smooth and Clean functions off; Fill Holes function on; Separate function at x3).\n\t\tNOTE: This delineates fluorescent structures, with Fill Holes including the lumen in the delineated structure if present.\nCount the organoids\n\t\nSelect all structures ≥40 µm.",
    "Click the Update ND Measurement button (every time a measurement is needed); the counted organoids will be numbered.\n\t\tNOTE: This equals the total number of organoids in the 32 wells, while small debris, such as dead cells, is excluded.\nMeasure intensity and circularity for calculation of the indexes\n\t\nSelect all structures ≥60 µm and count.\n\t\tNOTE: This counts the organoids large enough to show morphology typical to either CF or non-CF. Organoids >40 µm and <60 µm are small and dense, both in non-CF and in CF.\nRemove all structures touching the borders of the picture. Do this to remove organoids that are not completely visible, as their morphology cannot be accurately quantified.\nErode 1 pixel (= 2.5 µm) from the border of each ≥60 µm structure. This removes the halo of diffused calcein fluorescence surrounding the organoids.\nMeasure the mean intensity of each structure. This way, the mean fluorescence of the organoids is measured.\nSelect all structures ≥60 µm again and remove all structures touching the borders.\nErode 10 pixels (= 25 µm) from the border of each ≥60 µm structure.\n\t\tNOTE: In non-CF organoids, this erodes the cellular border and leaves only the lumen. In CF organoids, this erodes the outer part of the organoid, which has roughly the same fluorescence as the inner part that remains.\nMeasure the mean intensity of each eroded structure. This way, the mean fluorescence of the central part of the organoids is measured.\nMeasure the circularity of each structure. This corresponds to the mean circularity of the organoids.",
    "Perform the second quality check: exclusion criteria determined by the software. Exclude the set of pictures when less than 50% of organoids (defined as structures ≥40 µm) are ≥60 µm, as enough organoids should be large enough to show morphology typical to either CF or non-CF. Also exclude when <500 or >3,000 organoids (defined as structures ≥40 µm) are present in the 32 wells.\n5. Measure the indices in the imaging software (Figure 6)\nMeasure the circularity index (CI).\n\tNOTE: This corresponds to the mean circularity measured in step 4.6, which is the mean circularity of all organoids in all 32 wells. CI quantifies the roundness of the organoids, defined as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63818/63818eq01.jpg, which is lower in CF than in non-CF organoids\nMeasure the intensity ratio (IR)\n\t\nCalculate the IR by dividing the mean of the intensity measurement after eroding 25 µm from the border of each ≥60 µm structure by the mean of the intensity measurement after eroding 2.5 µm from the border of each ≥60 µm structure.\n\t\tNOTE: IR measures the presence or absence of a central lumen. IR is equal to imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63818/63818eq02.jpg, and is higher in CF than in non-CF organoids.\nSimplify the analysis process\n\t\nPrepare a standard worksheet using spreadsheet software to automatically calculate these indices upon copying the data (Figure 7).\nTo calculate the IR:\n\t\t\nTake the intensity measurement after eroding 2.5 µm from the border of each ≥60 µm structure. Use the mean for the calculation (denominator).\nTake the intensity measurement after eroding 25 µm from the border of each ≥60 µm structure. Use the mean for the calculation (numerator).\nTo calculate the CI, take the circularity of all organoids in all wells. The mean corresponds to the CI.",
    "NOTE: When analysis of large batches of images is required, the image analysis process as described in section 4 can be semi-automated, starting from the calibrated ND files and running a macro with all steps combined.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
