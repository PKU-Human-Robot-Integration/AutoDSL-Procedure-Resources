    "The protocol has been approved by the La Trobe University (09-28P) and RMIT University Animal Ethics committees (1315).\n1. Electrode Preparation and Preliminary in vitro Testing\nPrepare electrode coating deposition solutions; for instance 10 mM 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and 0.1 M sodium para-toluene sulfonate (Na2pTS) to form poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-pTS (PEDOT-pTS).\nConnect the electrode array to a potentiostat.\nCarefully place the electrode array into the deposition solution and clamp into place.\nPlace a platinum mesh counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode into the deposition solution and connect to a potentiostat.\nUsing the potentiostat, deposit coatings onto the desired electrodes. Deposition conditions (potential, current and time) will vary depending on the desired coatings. For PEDOT-pTS coatings, an applied potential of 1 V for 15, 30, 45, or 60 sec has been used.  Four electrodes on the array should be coated with the coating in a staggered configuration (Figure 1).\nRemove the electrode array from the deposition solution and gently rinse with deionized water.\nRepeat the coating procedure with other materials as desired.\nPrepare in vitro testing solution (0.3 M di-sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) in deionized water).\nConnect the electrode array to a potentiostat.\nCarefully place the electrode array into the testing solution and clamp into place.\nPlace a platinum mesh counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode into the testing solution and connect to a potentiostat.\nUsing the potentiostat, perform sequential electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (potential offset 0 V, amplitude 10 mV, frequency range 10-100,000 Hz) and cyclic voltammetry (1 cycle, potential range 0.8 to -0.8 V, scan rate 100 mV/sec) on all electrodes. Untested electrodes are kept at open circuit potential and a quiet time of 1 sec is used between each test. All 32 electrodes are in contact with the solution for the full testing session of 1 hr.",
    "Remove the electrode array from the testing solution and gently rinse with deionized water.\nPerform any other desired analyses such as optical microscopy.\nStore probes in a dry protective container to prevent damage and degradation of the electrode surfaces.\n2. Electrode Implantation\nWeigh the rat.\nInject urethane (20% w/v in distilled water, 1.3 g/kg i.p.) for nonrecovery anesthesia.\nEnsure anesthesia onset by testing for a toe pinch withdrawal reflex. If anesthesia is not sufficient, supplementary doses of urethane should be administered (0.3 g/kg i.p.).\nApply eye lubricant, and then shave the head of the animal.\nPlace the animal in the prone position on a homeothermic plate and insert a rectal probe (37.5 °C).\nPlace one ear bar into the approximately expected final position within the stereotaxic frame, and then adjust the animal to position the ear bar in the external acoustic meatus.\nAlign the second ear bar into the contralateral external acoustic meatus. Shift the animal in the ear bars to align with the tooth holder.\nUsing rat-tooth forceps, open the animal's jaw, hook the upper incisors over the tooth holder and clamp the nose in place.\nCreate an incision in the skin of the head, approximately 1 mm to the right of the midline and from 10 mm rostral to 10 mm caudal of lambda.\nRetract the skin and muscle laterally from the incision to expose the parietal and interparietal bones Using 20% hydrogen peroxide solution and a gauze pad, scrub the surface of the exposed bone.\nDrill a hole approximately 3 mm2 in the interparietal bone as close to lambda and the midline as possible and remove the bone plug. Using sterile saline, flush the hole to remove any bone dust or fragments which may damage the electrode.",
    "Using blunt-blunt scissors, dissect below the scruff of the neck and create a cavity. Wrap a Ag/AgCl wire in cotton wool, saturate it with saline and then insert the reference electrode into the cavity.\nMake an incision in the dura mater on the sagittal plane using the tip of a needle.\nAttach the electrode array to the electrode manipulator and adjust its position over the opening with a 19° rostro-caudal angle. Manually insert the electrode approximately 2 mm into the brain towards the inferior colliculus.\nAttach the speaker to the left hollow ear bar.\nEnsure the amplifier is turned on. Then verify animal anesthesia before sealing the recording chamber.\n3. In vivo Testing\nDeliver white noise bursts, (Gaussian distributed noise, 1-44 kHz; 10 msec rise-fall time) and monitor the activity on each electrode. The maximum rate at which bursts should be delivered is one burst every 200 msec.\nUsing the motorized microdrive, slowly insert the electrode array until acoustically driven activity is recorded on the 3 most distal electrodes on each shank (the number and position of electrodes recording activity may vary with electrode placement or electrode design).\nPerform the acoustic stimulation protocol using 300 repetitions of 50 msec white noise bursts (Gaussian distributed noise, 1-44 kHz; 10 msec rise-fall time) with a 1 sec repetition rate at 70 dB, and record the multiunit activity at each electrode (24.4 kHz sampling rate).\nSlowly insert the electrode array another 200 μm into the IC to position each electrode in roughly the same position as the more distal electrode from the initial recording position.\nRepeat the acoustic stimulation and neural recording protocol.",
    "Continue inserting the electrode array in 200 μm steps and performing the acoustic stimulation and neural recording protocol until all electrodes have recorded acoustically driven activity from at least 3 positions (typically 8-12 electrode positions overall).\nRetract the electrode array in 200 μm steps and continue performing the acoustic stimulation and neural recording protocol until the initial electrode array position is achieved.\nCarefully retract the electrode array manually.\nInject an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone (Lethobarb; 200 mg/kg i.p.) to euthanize the animal.\nGently rinse the electrode array with distilled water.  Then store probes in a dry protective container to prevent damage and degradation of the electrode surfaces.\n4. Post-implantation in vitro Testing\nGently rinse the electrode array with distilled water to remove any contamination.\nConnect the electrode array to a potentiostat.\nCarefully place the electrode array into the testing solution and clamp into place.\nPlace a platinum mesh counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode into the testing solution and connect to the potentiostat.\nUsing the potentiostat, perform sequential electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (potential offset 0 V, amplitude 10 mV, frequency range 10-100,000 Hz) and cyclic voltammetry (1 cycle, potential range 0.8 to -0.8 V, scan rate 100 mV/sec) on all electrodes. Untested electrodes are kept at open circuit potential and a quiet time of 1 sec is used between each test.  All 32 electrodes are in contact with the solution for the full testing session of 1 hr.\nRemove the electrode array from the testing solution and gently rinse with deionized water.\nPlace the electrode array into an enzymatic cleaning solution for 24 hr.\nRemove the electrode array from the solution and rinse with distilled water.\nConnect the electrode array to a potentiostat.\nCarefully place the electrode array into the testing solution and clamp into place.",
