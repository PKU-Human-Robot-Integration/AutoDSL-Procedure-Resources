    "1. Odor (Conditioned Stimulus) Cartridge Setup\nAt the beginning of the experiment, setup multiple odor cartridges for all the different odors needed for the conditioning trials.\n\t\nUse a fume hood for odor dilution and odor cartridge preparation. Never open bottles of odors outside of that fume hood, since the odors will spread rapidly throughout the lab and potentially expose the honey bees to the odor before conditioning. Also, wear gloves while setting up the odor cartridges and wash thoroughly afterward to avoid exposing the honey bees to odors while handling them.\nMake sure each odor cartridge is clearly labeled with a color-coded label of the odor for which it is first used. Never use an odor cartridge (syringe barrel or plunger) for more than one odor, since there may be residual odor on the cartridge.\nPreparing Odors and Odor Mixtures\n\t\nDilute odors in either hexane or mineral oil to the desired concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: Altering the concentration of the odor or presenting mixtures of two or more odorants can allow for investigation of additional aspects of how bees sense odors and learn the conditioned association. Odor mixtures can be as simple as a 50:50 binary mixture or as complex as several odors that mimic natural olfactory stimuli. Reducing the concentration of the odor also increases the difficulty of the task.\n\t\t\nOdors will become depleted with reuse of the cartridge (Figure 2). To avoid problems from depletion make enough cartridges to be able to switch to a new cartridge every 10-12 uses.\nPreparing Odor Cartridges\n\t\nMethod 1\n\t\t\nFor this method, use 20 ml plastic syringes with a 15 mm diameter circle of filter paper pinned to the rubber end of the plunger for odor cartridges.",
    "Remove the plunger from the syringe and use a pushpin to attach the piece of filter paper to the end of the plunger.\nUse a micropipette to place 10 μl of the odor onto the filter paper, and reinsert the plunger into the syringe barrel. Push the plunger to the 15 ml mark on the syringe barrel.\nMethod 2\n\t\t\nFor this method, use 1 cc glass or plastic tuberculin syringes (or modified pipettes of similar volume and shape) with a strip of filter paper inside and a rubber or silicone restrictor in the wide end of syringe barrel for the odor cartridges.\nRemove the plunger from a 1 cc tuberculin syringe barrel. The syringe barrel will be the body of the odor cartridge.\nRemove the black rubber tip from the syringe plunger and cut off the closed end of the rubber tip.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This rubber ring will act as a restrictor to reduce suction from the airflow in the arena, which will prematurely draw odor out of the cartridge and over the restrained honey bee. Alternately, silicone tubing (4.8 mm outer diameter) cut into 5 mm sections work as restrictors.\nRinse the inside of the syringe barrel and the rubber/silicone restrictor with 70% ethanol (to remove much of the residual odor from previous use) and let them air dry.\nPlace a 0.2 x 4 cm strip of filter paper into the wide opening of the barrel so the paper extends 1-2 cm beyond the opening.\nUse a micropipette to place 3-10 μl of the odor onto the filter paper without letting the odor touch the end of the syringe barrel. The pipette tip may be reused for the same the odor, but make sure to use a fresh tip to set up the next odor.",
    "Turn the wide opening of the syringe barrel upward so the filter paper slides rapidly into the tube. Insert the restrictor into the wide opening of the syringe barrel.\n\t\t\nMake sure each odor cartridge is clearly labeled with a color-coded label of the odor it is first used for. Never use an odor cartridge (syringe barrel or restrictor) for more than one odor, since there may be residual odor on it.\nBall up the end of a lint-free tissue, soak it with 70% ethanol, and use it to thoroughly wipe the outer surface of the cartridge to remove any residual odor on the outside of the cartridge.\n2. Collecting, Restraining, and Feeding the Bees\nPreparing Bee Restraining Harnesses\n\t\nMake simple restraining harnesses for honey bees out of plastic soda straws, hard plastic tubing, or machined metal tubing (all are approximately 0.9 cm inner diameter and have 1-2 mm wall thickness). Use sturdier harnesses for procedures involving surgery.\nCut 3 cm sections of the tubing. Then, partially trim away approximately half of the upper 1 cm of the harness to make it easier to hold the bee in place while fastening the harness.\nCut a 0.2 x 6 cm strip of duct tape and attach one end to one side of the bee harness, leaving the other end free.\nCollecting Worker Bees\n\t\nCollect workers from the entrance to the colony as they pause before departing from the colony or as they return from foraging.\n\t\tNOTE: Placing a piece of wire mesh, with holes just large enough for worker bees to crawl through, over the entrance slows the returning workers down and makes it easier to capture them before they enter the colony.",
    "Place a scintillation vial over the bee until it flies up into it. Hold the vial with its opening horizontally or facing down while the lid is fastened so the bee doesn’t fly up out of the vial. Place only one bee in each vial. Make sure the lid has a hole in it to allow for adequate gas exchange.\nCollect the bees quickly to minimize the time they spend in the vials. Keep the vials with bees in them in a small box in the shade.\nTransfer the box with the vials and bees to the lab, and place the vials into an ice-water slurry until the bees stop moving. Once a bee is immobile, remove the vial from the ice immediately to avoid overexposure to cold, and place the bee into a restraining harness.\n\t\tNOTE: We do not recommend placing the bees in the refrigerator or freezer since it is difficult to monitor when the bees become immobile, resulting in excessive exposure to the cold. When harnessing more than 10 bees, transfer only a few bees to the ice-water slurry at a time.\nRestraining the Bees\n\t\nPlace the bee in the harness with its dorsal thorax facing the cut-away portion of the tubing and its head just above the top of the tubing. Gently press the bee close to the tubing so its mouthparts extend beyond the edge of the tubing. Slide the strip of duct tape in between the head and the thorax on the dorsal side of the bee and firmly attach the free end to the side of the harness.",
    "Make sure the tape on the harness is smooth and taut. There should be no noticeable gaps between the front of the bee harness and the tape, and the tape should lay flat on the top of the harness. If there are gaps the bee may not be able to extend its proboscis properly or it may escape. Also, make sure the bee’s front legs are not protruding between the front of the harness and the duct tape.\nFeeding the bees and the Feeding to Conditioning Interval\n\t\nAbout 30 min following harnessing – after the bees have recovered from the initial setup – feed the bees 3-4 μl 0.5 M sucrose (in water). This amount will be sufficient for a feeding-to-conditioning interval of 3-4 hr.\n\t\t\nIn general, feed 1 μl 0.5 M sucrose for approximately each hour of wait time between feeding and conditioning to ensure the bees survive the interval yet are hungry enough at the beginning of conditioning to be motivated to learn the conditioned association. In a laboratory kept at a warm temperature or if using a different concentration of sucrose, adjust the amount fed or the time interval accordingly.\n\t\t\tNOTE: With a feeding to conditioning interval of 24 hr, make sure all the bees are fed to satiation with 0.5 or 1 M sucrose at least 24 hr before conditioning will begin. At room temperature, bees require approximately 24 hr before they are motivated enough to respond well in a conditioning protocol.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use a lower concentration of sucrose solution for feeding the bees than the concentration used as a reward during conditioning to prevent the bees from becoming less sensitive to the concentration of sucrose used during conditioning, which may reduce learning performance18.",
    "Feed the bees in an area well away from the training area. Exposure to the unconditioned stimulus (sucrose) in the conditioning context before conditioning might influence subsequent conditioning to the odor.\nDuring the interval between feeding and conditioning place the bees on the countertop in a quiet area of the lab to avoid unnecessary disturbance. If the laboratory has low ambient humidity, place bees in a plastic container with wet paper towels during the time interval. This prevents desiccation, since the bees may die if they are exposed to low humidity for prolonged time periods.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not change the harnessing and feeding protocol within an experiment! Use only one specific time interval between setting up and feeding the bees and beginning conditioning for each experiment so the bees are all treated exactly the same way.\n3. Conditioning\nTesting for Sucrose Sensitivity\n\t\nA few minutes prior to beginning conditioning, test the bees’ motivation to feed by touching their antennae with a small droplet of 0.5 M sucrose solution (the same concentration used during feeding). Do not allow them to feed during this test. If they respond by extending their proboscis, they are probably sufficiently motivated to learn and can be used for the protocol.\nExperiment Design",
    "NOTE: This protocol can be modified to fit a vast array of learning protocols in order to investigate many aspects of honey bees’ learning and memory capabilities. Among the many parameters that can be adjusted are the: Inter-trial interval, number of bees trained at a given time, inter-stimulus interval, type and concentration and number of odors, type and concentration of the unconditioned stimulus, the number and sequence of trials (Figure 1; Table 1)19-21. When designing the exact protocol for each conditioning trial, it is very important to keep the inter-trial interval consistent across individuals. An inter trial interval that is too short, too long or inconsistent will impair the bees’ performance. See the discussion for a full treatment of this topic.\n\tNOTE: Bees will learn the task more quickly if they are in a warm environment. Therefore, keep the temperature of the training environment consistent and warm (29-30 °C if possible).\nDelivering the Odor (Conditioned Stimulus)\n\t\nMethod 1\n\t\t\nSetting up the Odor Delivery System\n\t\t\t\nMount the plastic 20 ml syringe loaded with the odor-treated filter paper so it is stable and the small end is facing directly at the bee’s antennae. Set the plunger at the 15 ml mark and position the syringe so the plunger is easily accessible.\nPresenting the Odor Stimulus\n\t\t\t\nAt the beginning of each trial, place the bee in the harness on the peg in the conditioning arena with its antennae pointed directly toward the odor cartridge. Let the bee acclimate to the arena for 15–25 sec before beginning the odor stimulus to reduce disruption caused by the abrupt change in its visual surroundings during the odor stimulus.",
    "If the bee begins to respond to the odor cartridge immediately after it is placed in the conditioning arena, there may be odor on the cartridge’s tip. Remove the contaminating odor by washing the cartridge off with a lint-free tissue soaked in 70% ethanol. If that does not solve the problem, replace the cartridge.\nPress the plunger of the syringe at a steady rate so the plunger is completely depressed within 4 sec. Monitor the bee’s response to the odor before presenting the unconditioned stimulus.\nFollowing each trial, allow the bee to rest in the conditioning arena for another 15–25 sec. Moving the bee too soon following the trial will significantly reduce the effectiveness of each conditioning trial.\nMethod 2\n\t\t\nSetting up the Odor Delivery System\n\t\t\t\nAirflow Source and Flow Rate\n\t\t\t\t\nAs the source airflow for odor delivery use an aquarium aerator pump or a lab bench pressurized air supply, if the laboratory is equipped with it.\n\t\t\t\t\tNOTE: A typical aquarium aerator pump will have an airflow rate near 400 ml/min (7 ml/sec); over the 4 sec odor stimulus, 28 ml of air will flow through a 1 ml cartridge.\nUse a flowmeter in line with the tubing of the air delivery apparatus to regulate the rate of flow for the air supply. Adjust the flow meter until the rate of flow is 400 ml/min. Check the flow rate at the opening of the odor cartridge with a separate flowmeter.\nConnect the airflow to the odor cartridge through a system of plastic tubing and valves.\n\t\t\t\t\tNOTE: The timing device discussed below opens the valves at the appropriate time in the trial. Plastic connectors attach the airflow system to the odor cartridge through a Luer type attachment to the cartridge’s syringe barrel.",
    "Regardless of the airflow source, check the flow rate periodically to make sure the line is intact and the flow rate is maintained at the desired rate.\nAutomated Odor Delivery\n\t\t\t\nUse a programmable logic controller (PLC) to automate the delivery of the odor.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The PLC is programmed to open the valves to the odor delivery air flow 6 sec after initiating the program (initiated by pushing a button), keep the valves open for 4 sec, and sound an audible feeding signal, via a small speaker, 3 sec after odor stimulus onset to signal the experimenter to deliver sucrose.\nUse a small LED to indicate the timing of the odor stimulus during each trial. If possible use a red LED, since bees’ photoreceptors are shifted away from longer [red] wavelengths and toward shorter [uv] wavelengths so they cannot see it well. Position the LED behind and below the bee, outside of their visual field, so the light will not become an inadvertent conditioned stimulus.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The light also helps verify that the PLC is operating properly and is useful in analyzing video recordings of the bees’ responses during testing trials.\nThe Exhaust System\n\t\t\t\nSet up an exhaust system behind the bee to help pull the air past the bee and to evacuate the odor-laden air from the conditioning arena to maintain a discrete timeframe for each presentation of the odor.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: If there is a vacuum system in the laboratory, modify the vacuum port and attach a conduit of dryer tubing to provide the airflow required to evacuate the conditioning arena. If there is not a vacuum system, a small electric fan housed in line with the dryer tubing led to a fume hood or through a window will suffice.",
    "At the beginning of each day, check the electrical and air connections of the odor delivery system and the exhaust system. Press the start button on the odor delivery system and track the time between pressing the button and when the valves open (a quiet click and the LED light comes on) and when the cue to present the unconditioned stimulus (an audible tone) sounds. Check the air delivery by placing a moist fingertip in front of the connector that will be attached to the odor cartridge. There should be a strong air stream only when the valves are open. Check the exhaust system by holding a lint-free tissue up to the opening of the exhaust system to make sure the airflow is strong enough to properly evacuate the air from the conditioning arena.\nMounting the Odor Cartridge\n\t\t\nPlace some modeling clay either on the countertop or on a small Plexiglas stand to position the bee and odor cartridge directly in front of the exhaust system. Place the glass odor syringe in the clay and adjust it so the opening in the wide end is pointed at the bee's head. The end of the syringe should be 1-2 cm from the bee. Pick a distance within this range and be constant.\nSecurely place the fitting connecting the cartridge to the air tubing and valve system over the narrow ground glass end of the syringe.\nPresenting the Odor Stimulus\n\t\t\nAt the beginning of each trial, place the harnessed bee on the peg in the conditioning arena with its antennae pointed directly toward the odor cartridge. Let the bee rest in the arena for 15–25 sec before beginning the odor stimulus to allow it to become accustomed to its new surroundings.",
    "NOTE: If the bee begins to respond to the odor cartridge immediately after being placed in the conditioning arena, there may be odor on the cartridge’s tip. Remove the contaminating odor by washing the cartridge off with a lint-free tissue soaked in 70% ethanol. If that does not solve the problem, replace the cartridge.\nPress the start button to initiate the timing mechanism for odor delivery. Monitor the bee’s response to the odor after stimulus onset and before presentation of the unconditioned stimulus.\nFollowing each trial, allow the bee to rest in the conditioning arena for another 15–25 sec to allow for initial memory formation. Moving the bee too soon following the trial will significantly reduce the effectiveness of each conditioning trial.\nDelivering the Sucrose (Unconditioned Stimulus)\n\t\nMethod 1\n\t\t\nFor this method, use a toothpick to deliver the sucrose.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is best to use a plastic toothpick since the wooden toothpicks can have an odor that will influence the bees’ responses to the conditioned stimulus.\nDip the tip of the toothpick into the sucrose solution, and, when it is time to present the unconditioned stimulus, hold the toothpick in front of the bee and allow the bee to lick the sucrose from the toothpick for approximately 1 sec.\nReplace the toothpick regularly to avoid buildup of sucrose.\nMethod 2\n\t\t\nSucrose Delivery System\n\t\t\tNOTE: A more accurate way to deliver the unconditioned stimulus is through use of micrometer syringes, which can accurately deliver small amounts (tenths of a microliter) of the sucrose reward.",
    "Wind the micrometer of the syringe back as far as possible. Load the micrometer syringe barrel with the sucrose solution. Make sure there are no bubbles in the glass portion and assemble the syringe. Fill the hub of the needle with the sucrose solution before placing it on the narrow end of the syringe barrel. To make sure the fluid in the needle is actually sucrose and not water from washing the needle, wind the micrometer forward 1–2 μl before beginning the experiment.\nSucrose Presentation\n\t\t\nHold the tip of the needle approximately 2 cm from the bee while the odor is presented. Use the edge of the training arena to prevent shaking the syringe as the movement can distract the bee. Do not get the needle too close in anticipation of the feeding signal, since that will also prematurely shift the bee’s attention from the odor to the sucrose.\nAs soon as the feeding signal sounds, lightly touch the antennae until the bee extends its proboscis, then feed the bee. This should require only a very light touch or two to the antennae.\n\t\t\t\nUse a reward amount between 0.2 and 0.8 μl. The bee should easily consume the entire droplet within the time period allotted for the unconditioned stimulus (~1-2 sec). Do not use “ad libitum” feeding from a large droplet, which the bee feeds on for several seconds but cannot entirely consume.\nWatch for sucrose build up on the antenna, which will reduce the bee’s response to subsequent presentations of the reward. Modify the feeding procedure if this occurs.\nTo ensure accurate pairing of the odor cue and the sucrose reward, make sure to present the droplet of sucrose solution to the bee as soon as possible after the tone.",
    "NOTE: Timing between the onset of the CS (odor) and US (sucrose) is critical. Ideally, the odor presentation and sucrose presentation should briefly overlap. If more than a few seconds elapse between the end of the CS and delivery of the US, conditioning performance will diminish.\n4. Testing\nFollowing conditioning use unreinforced test trials to assess how well the bees learned and/or remember the conditioned association.\n\tNOTE: See the discussion for a detailed explanation of the importance of analyzing the bees’ responses to unreinforced test trials in addition to the bees’ performance in the conditioning trials and an explanation of the purpose of number of test trials and test odors.\nConsolidation Time\n\t\nFollowing conditioning, either administer an immediate test trial or allow the bees to rest through a consolidation period.\n\t\tNOTE: The length of the consolidation period, the time interval between conditioning and testing, will depend on the goal of the experiment. If the purpose is to investigate learning differences or short-term memory, the bees’ performance on test trials can be evaluated immediately following or several hours after conditioning. If the experiment involves investigating long-term memory, the test trials should be given at least 24 hr following the end of conditioning.\nIf the test trials are more than 24 hr following conditioning, feed the bees to satiation with 0.5 M sucrose following conditioning and at least once per day afterward until 12-24 hr before the test trials.\n\t\t\nTo make sure the bees have reached satiation, feed each of them several different times until they no longer extend their proboscis in response to touching their antennae with sucrose. They can consume as much as 40 μl to reach satiation.\nKeep the bees in a humidified container to prevent their desiccating and dying during the consolidation period.\nTest Trials",
    "Use only newly prepared odor cartridges for testing.\n\t\tNOTE: The cartridges used for acquisition may be differentially depleted, so the test stimulus will not be consistent across trials, odors, and individual bees and, therefore, could significantly affect the consistency and robustness of the results.\nDuring testing, maintain the same inter-trial interval and other parameters as used in the conditioning phase of the experiment.\nDo not present the unconditioned stimulus during test trials, since the presence of a reward will alter the bees’ response to the conditioned stimulus, potentially masking more subtle effects of the conditioning protocol or a treatment.\nRecord videos of all of the test trials to be able to later measure multiple aspects the bees’ responses to the odor(s).\n5. Recording the Bees’ Responses\nBinary (Presence/Absence) Scoring of PER\n\t\nUse a binary scoring system of PER during conditioning trials and during testing trials. Score responses as either positive or negative; this is satisfactory for many kinds of analyses with a sample size of 20-40 bees per treatment group. The precise topology of responses can be complex22. It is important to establish an easy to see and score criterion for a positive response.\n\t\t\nScore a bee’s response as positive (+) when the bee extends its proboscis beyond the line made by connecting the tips of the opened mandibles. Only score a positive response when the bee extends its proboscis after odor onset but before odor offset.\nScore a bee’s response as negative (−) when there is no extension of the proboscis during the trial or if the proboscis is extended after the offset of the odorant.\nAvoid trying to score partial responses. To make finer distinctions in the bees’ behavior, use the video analysis technique outlined below.\nVideo Analysis of Additional PER Measurements (Movie 1)",
    "Gather additional information from behavior tests by analyzing videos of a bee’s responses to an odor.\n\t\tNOTE: These measurements can also provide a higher temporal resolution for examination of the bees’ responses to the odors, particularly when there is not a difference in the presence/absence scoring of PER between treatment groups.\nRecording the videos\n\t\t\nAlways use unreinforced test or extinction trials for video recordings. The presence of the reward will alter the bees’ response to the odor, modifying the duration of proboscis extension.\nSet a video camera on a tripod above the training arena and focus the camera on the front of the bee’s head, so the antennae and proboscis are in sharp focus.\nPosition the small LED light, which indicates odor stimulus presentation, in an area behind the bee that is visible in the video in order to use it to identify odor onset and offset during analysis.\nBegin recording 20 sec before odor onset and continue recording for at least 20 sec after odor offset before disturbing the bee.\nVideo Analysis\n\t\t\nUpload the videos into video editing software, such as iMovie or Final Cut Pro, with the capability of measuring time intervals between specific frames in the video.\nAnalyze the bees’ response to the odor for a discrete time period beginning at the onset of the odor stimulus (e.g., 10 or 20 sec).\nUse the following common measurements for evaluating PER:\n\t\t\t\nMeasure the duration of proboscis extension, which is the total time that the proboscis extends beyond the mandible-to-mandible line (described above).\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: A bee may extend and retract its proboscis multiple times during the 10-20 sec time window. Measure each proboscis extension individually, and calculate the total duration. Analyzing the number and duration of each individual proboscis extension can also provide valuable information.",
    "Measure the latency of proboscis extension, which is the time between odor onset, when the LED light comes on, and the first proboscis extension.\nCount and time Glossal extensions relative to the onset of odorant, the first extension, or other timing parameters.\nTrack Antennal movements23, which also show characteristic odor-oriented changes.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: In Movie 1, the antennal movements have been tracked with video tracking software to illustrate the change in antennal movements in response to an odor stimulus."
