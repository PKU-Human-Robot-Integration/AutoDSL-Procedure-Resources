  "title": "Using an Ingestible Telemetric Temperature Pill to Assess Gastrointestinal Temperature During Exercise",
  "procedures": [
    "The steps described in the following section are in line with and accepted by the medical ethical committee of the Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. To our knowledge, 3 different commercial systems of ingestible temperature pills are currently available for researchers. The user manual of the ingestible temperature pills is brand-specific (Table of Specific Materials), but all systems are suitable for measurements during exercise and under resting conditions.\n1. Exclusion Criteria and Subject Instruction\nAsk subjects in written or verbal form for the exclusion criteria for using the telemetric temperature pill: 1) body weight below 36.5 kg, 2) obstructive gastro-intestinal disease, 3) history of gastrointestinal surgery, 4) an implanted medical device, and 5) a scheduled MRI scan during the experimental period.\nWrite down the serial and calibration number of the temperature pill.\nInstruct the subjects how to use the temperature pill (see section 2).\nGive the pill to the subject together with a short instruction manual, which contains the information shown in section 2. If subjects receive the temperature pill well ahead of the experiment, remind the subject the day preceding the experiment to ingest the temperature pill.\n2. Temperature Pill Instructions\nInstruct the subject to ingest the temperature pill at least 6 hr prior to the experiment, to avoid any interaction with fluid ingestion. Follow the subsequent steps to ingest the temperature pill correctly.\nInstruct the subject to remove the magnetic strip from the pill, to activate the battery and enable measuring.\nInstruct the subject to ingest the temperature pill preferably with a glass of water to enhance pill ingestion.\nAsk the subject to return the pill wrapping material to the research team, so they can check serial and calibration numbers prior to the start of the experiment.",
    "Instruct the subject that the temperature pill will leave the body through its natural way (faeces) and it can be flushed through the toilet.\n3. Experimental Protocol I: Cross Sectional Mode\nNote: In the cross sectional mode it is possible to measure up to 99 subjects simultaneously.\nAdjust the recorder to the desired settings for the cross sectional measurement prior to the measurement.\n\t\nTurn on the recorder, connect the recorder with the computer with a transfer cable and push the ‘F2-PC Link’ button to enable the recorder to connect with the computer.\nOpen the Tc software on the computer, which can be used to define the right settings. Note: The software is supplied by the company with the order of the temperature pill and recorder.\nTo adjust the settings, click on ‘Program’ in the home screen of the software, and subsequently use the ‘open PC link’ button to make a connection with the recorder and select the correct settings.\n\t\t\nSelect the cross sectional measurement mode by selecting ‘Sports mode ON’.\nSelect the correct temperature measurement scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit). Use the ‘Write Config to Recorder’ button to copy the settings to the recorder.\nAdd the serial and calibration number of all individual subjects to the external recorder, which enables the option to switch users during the experiment. Push the ‘Sensor/Barcode Display’ button in the software and add all the serial and calibration numbers. Push the ‘Write Sensors to Recorder’ button to copy the data to the recorder.\nCheck the battery of the recorder prior to the measurement, to avoid a discharged battery during the measurement and therefore missing data. Note: Normally, a battery state of 75% is sufficient to measure for >10 hr.",
    "Once all preparations are completed and the predefined settings are checked, start the experiment. To do so, return to the home screen of the recorder and use the ‘F2-Sport’ button to start data acquisition.\nWhen Player XX appears on the screen, push the ‘Read’ button to measure Tgi. Use the ‘Read’ button again for an extra measurement of Tgi.\nTo switch users, push on the correct number on the recorder and subsequently measure the Tc by pushing the ‘Read’ button.\nStop the data collection by pushing the ‘Stop’ button.\nWhen the measurement is finished, turn off the recorder in the correct way to prevent data loss. To do so, use the ‘Enter’ button and ‘Exit’ becomes visible on the home screen. Push the ‘F1-Exit’ button and the recorder shows ‘turn of recorder’. Subsequently, use the power switch to turn off the recorder.\nExport and store the raw data from the external recorder to a computer (see section 5; data handling).\n4. Experimental Protocol II: Continuous Mode\nNote: The continuous mode enables to continuously measure and save the Tgi of an individual subject on a predefined constant time interval, for example every 20 sec. In the next section, the step sequence used to perform this type of measurement is described.\nAdjust the recorder to the right settings for the continuous measurement mode prior to the measurement (see section 3, steps 3.1.1-3.1.3).\nSelect the continuous measurement mode by selecting ‘Sports mode OFF’.\nSelect a measuring frequency by adjusting the ‘Read Interval’ to the right constant time interval (hh:mm:ss), with a minimal sampling interval of 10 sec.\nSelect the correct temperature measurement scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit). Use the ‘Write Config to Recorder’ button to copy the settings to the recorder.",
    "Check the battery of the recorder prior to the measurement, to avoid a discharged battery during the measurement and therefore missing data. Note: Normally, a battery state of 75% is sufficient to perform a 24 hr measurement.\nOnce all preparations are completed and the predefined settings are checked, start the experiment. Start data acquisition by pushing the ‘Run’ button on the home screen of the recorder.\nSubsequently, attach the recorder in a waist bag close to the abdominal area of the subject (maximal 30-40 cm between the abdominal area and the recorder) to avoid measurement errors.\n\tNote: After the start of the experiment, every predefined time interval a measurement of Tc will be taken. With the ‘Read’ button extra sampling points can be added.\nStop the Tc measurement by pushing the ‘Stop’ button.\nUse the ‘F1-Exit’ button to get the message ‘turn off unit’ and then use the power switch to turn off the recorder.\nExport and store the raw data from the external recorder to a computer (see section 5; data extraction).\n5. Data Extraction\nConnect the recorder to the computer to complete data export (section 3, step 3.1.1).\nOpen the software and click the ‘Download’ button in the home screen of the software.\nEnter a file name and push the ‘OK’ button. Note: The data will now be stored as a .cvt file, which can be opened using spreadsheet software.\nOpen the data file and visually check the collected data for missing data and outliers. Note: A large decrease or increase of the Tgi (≤1 °C) within a short time interval (±1 min) is very unrealistic and may be caused by a disturbance of the radio signal. As a result, the unrealistic data point can be removed for further analysis.",
    "Interpolate the missing values by averaging the previous and next valid value. Note: Interpolation of the data is possible with a maximum of three missing values in a row.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
