    "Ethic Local animal ethics regarding animal housing and animal experiment need to be followed. In order to induce anesthesia, put the mouse in the plastic chamber where 5% isoflurane is provided through a tube to the dispenser (Figure 1). It takes approximately 30 sec. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425204212_8866.jpgFigure 1. Inhalational anesthesia with isoflurane. The mouse was anesthetized via an inhalation mask using 2-3% isoflurane.Anesthetize the mouse with 2-3% inhaled isoflurane by setting on the board with the head placed into a mask connected to the dispenser (Figure 1).Make sure that the mouse is adequately anesthetized by applying pressure on the mouse toe with forceps (toe pinch).Remove hair from the proper region of the back of the mouse with electric clippers, and make a small incision with a fine scalpel from the lumbar L3 to the sacral S1 vertebra after cleaning with 75% ethanol (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425204301_7083.jpgFigure 2. Small incision on the back skin. A small incision from the lumbar L3 to the sacral S1 vertebra was made with a fine scalpel after removing the hair.Spread the tissue underneath the skin with an agricola retractor, and scratch off the muscle lying on the transverse process of the lumbar L5 vertebra (highlighted in green) with micro spatula to keep it visible (Figure 3, Video 1). Normally the transverse process of the lumbar L5 vertebra is located underneath the muscle within 5 mm from the tip of the iliac crest (Figure 3, left). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425204337_9388.jpgFigure 3. Exposure of the transverse process of the lumbar L5 vertebra. The transverse process of the lumbar L5 vertebra was exposed by scratching off the muscle.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Spinal nerve injury. This video shows how the L4 spinal nerve injury is performed.",
    "Drill the root of the transverse process of the lumbar vertebra at the blue line at a speed of 3,000 rpm (Figure 4) and remove it.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425204435_7399.jpgFigure 4. Removal of the transverse process of the lumbar L5 vertebra. The transverse process of the lumbar L5 vertebra (highlight in green) needs to be removed after drilling the root of it (highlight in blue).Expose the parallel-lying L3 and L4 spinal nerves by removing the paraspinal muscle and fat from the L5 transverse process with forceps (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425204530_3052.jpgFigure 5. Exposure of L4 spinal nerve. L4 spinal nerve was exposed by removing the paraspinal muscle and fat from the L5 transverse process.Carefully isolate the L4 spinal nerve with fine forceps and cut it with spring scissors without injuring the L3 nerve (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425204712_7067.jpgFigure 6. Cut of L4 spinal nerve. L4 spinal nerve was cut with spring scissors.After making sure there is no bleeding from the lesion site (see Notes), suture the wound and the surrounding skin with 5-0 silk sutures (Figure 7). Keep the mouse on a heating pad after the operation until the mouse wakes up (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170425/20170425204752_2314.jpgFigure 7. Suturing the wound. The wound and the surrounding skin were sutured, and the mouse was placed on a heating pad."
