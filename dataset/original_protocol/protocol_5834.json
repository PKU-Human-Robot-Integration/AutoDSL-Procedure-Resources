    "Note: To prepare BMV inoculum, previously infected barley or Chenopodium have to be available. BMV propagation in Hordeum vulgare Set up a set of pots (25-50 pots) filled with soil mixture (mix garden soil:sand, 1:5).Plant about 10 Hordeum vulgare seeds per pot, cover with a 1 cm layer of soil and water the seeds.Place the garden tray with pots in the Fitotron® plant growth chamber (22 °C, 40 % humidity and 16/8 photoperiod, light intensity 600 μmol m-2 sec-1)Water the plants every 2-3 days for 2 weeks.Inoculate Hordeum vulgare plants 2 weeks after seeding (plants should have just one leaf):Grind 1 g of previously infected Chenopodium or barley leaves with visible infection symptoms (white or pale yellow dots in Chenopodium or white or pale green mosaic in barley) with a mortar and pestle. It is important to keep low temperature during grinding and to chill the mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen before and during grinding (every 2-3 min). After grinding place on ice. Add 2 ml of inoculation buffer and mix with the pestle. Ground leaf solution is a green liquid with small, visible bits. Dust young plant leaves with carborundum.Put 10 μl of BMV suspension from Step A5a on every young barley leaf and rub in gently with a gloved hand all over the leaf (beware of crushing the leaves).Water the plants once every 2-3 days. Two weeks after inoculation harvest all infected leaves (with visible white or pale green mosaic), divide into 5 g aliquots, wrap in aluminum foil and freeze in liquid nitrogen, store at -80 °C.BMV extraction from plantsPlace frozen leaves in a mortar and grind the tissue with the pestle until they become powder.",
    "Use liquid nitrogen (preferred) or dry ice to keep plant tissue frozen (pour liquid nitrogen directly into the mortar over 2-3 min). Add BMV extraction buffer to crushed tissue (4 ml of buffer per 1 g of plant tissue).Transfer the virus suspension with an appropriate pipette into PPCO centrifuge tubes. Take as much suspension as possible. Place the PPCO centrifuge tubes with BMV suspension on ice. Add 1/5th volume chloroform to the suspension.Vortex for 30 sec, 2,500 rpm.Centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, 5,000 x g. Transfer the supernatant into a new PPCO centrifuge tube (be careful, not touch the pellet; discard the precipitate), and add 1/3rd volume 30% PEG (water solution). Vortex for 30 sec, 2,500 rpm.Incubate on ice for 30 min without shaking.Centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C, 12,000 x g. Discard supernatant. Suspend the precipitate in 2 ml of cold 1x L buffer and shake it using vortex overnight, 4 °C, 750 rpm.The BMV suspension can be stored for one week at 4 °C.BMV purificationIon Exchange ChromatographyTo the sample from Step B10 add glycerol to 5% final concentration. Mix the sample and place it on ice.Prepare DEAE cellulose.Suspend 10 ml of DEAE cellulose in deionized water. Pour DEAE cellulose in CrystalCruz® chromatography column.Attach the column to a peristaltic pump.Settle the DEAE cellulose with the 0.5 ml/min flow rate. Discard the flow through.Wash DEAE cellulose with 5 volumes of deionized water at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Wash the DEAE cellulose with 2 volumes of 1x L buffer. Don’t let cellulose dry. Leave a 2 mm layer of buffer over DEAE cellulose surface. Place the sample from Step C1a on DEAE cellulose. Filter the BMV sample through DEAE cellulose with 0.2 ml/min flow rate.Wash DEAE cellulose with NaCl gradient (0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.",
    "2 M, 0.3 M, 0.4 M and 0.5 M) in 1x L buffer. Use 20 ml of buffer per 1 fraction. Collect all the flow through volume. Store at 4 °C up to one week.Place 50 μl from each fraction in Eppendorf tubes, add SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, denature at 95 °C in thermoblock for 5 min and separate by SDS-PAGE to confirm the presence of BMV virions (see Step D1). The exemplary SDS-PAGE result is shown in Figure 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716015602_7662.jpgFigure 1. BMV after ion-exchange chromatography with NaCl gradient and separation by SDS-PAGE. The particular fractions eluted with NaCl gradient are as follows: 0.05 M NaCl–lanes 1-3, 0.1 M NaCl–lanes 4-6, 0.2 M NaCl–lanes 7-9, 0.3 M NaCl–lanes 10-12, 0.4 M NaCl –lanes 13-15 and 0.5 M NaCl–lanes 16-17, lane marked with M refers to Protein tricolor ladder). The 20 kDa band represents BMV capsid protein, while 55 kDa band represents protein contamination. To obtain pure BMV, fractions with the highest concentration of the virus (2 and 3) were concentrated and subjected to SEC.Combine BMV-containing fractions and concentrate to 2 ml by centrifugation in Amicon Ultra-15 Filters at 4 °C, 4,700 x g (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716015706_7918.jpgFigure 2. DLS results recorded for BMV preparation after the complete purification procedure. The sample is 100% monodisperse and contains the particles with a diameter of approximately 31 nm which corresponds to BMV dimensions.Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)All buffers used for SEC should be filtered through 0.45 μm membrane and degassed. Use HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-500 High Resolution column connected to the ÄKTAprime plus system to purify BMV virions. When not in use, column should be filled with 20% ethanol. All buffers used for SEC should be filtered through 0.45 μm membrane and degassed. All runs should be performed at max pressure limit of 0.5 MPa.",
    "Wash the sample loop with at least two sample loop volumes of the deionized water.Remove ethanol by washing the column with 130 ml degassed, deionized water (0.5 ml/min flow rate) and 130 ml of degassed PBS 1x (0.5 ml/min flow rate). The volume of 130 ml refers to 1 volume of the bed (120 ml) and 10 ml of column equilibration volume. Set the purification run according to Table 1: Table 1. ÄKTAprime Method Breakpointsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716020241_4655.jpgLoad the concentrated BMV sample from Step C1g on the ÄKTAprime plus system, connected to HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-500 High Resolution. Sample volume should not be over 4% of the bed volume–4.8 ml. Load the sample using a syringe and a 0.45 μm filter. Run purification at 4 °C. (Figure 3) Place all the fractions from SEC at 4 °C. Rinse the sample loop with 5 loop volumes of deionized water. Wash the HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-500 High Resolution column with 180 ml deionized, degassed water and 180 ml of degassed 20% ethanol.Place 50 μl from each fraction containing protein (according to the SEC chromatogram) in Eppendorf tubes, add SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, denature at 95 °C and separate by SDS-PAGE to confirm the presence of BMV virions (see Step D1).Collect BMV-containing fractions and concentrate to 1 ml using Amicon Ultra-15 Filters.For storing, freeze in liquid nitrogen, store at -80 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716020003_9825.jpgFigure 3. Size exclusion chromatogram recorded for BMV. Horizontal axis represents fractions collected (red numbers correspond to the fractions numbers) while vertical axis corresponds to UV280 absorbance (arbitrary units). The blue curve with single peak is the chromatographic plot. Fractions covered by the peak contain the virus (see Figure 4).BMV analysisSDS PAGEGel preparationPrepare separating gel Set the glass plates in the casting frame (100.0 mm x 83.0 mm x 1.0 mm spacer).",

Place 50 μl of protein solutions in Eppendorf tubes, add SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. Denature at 95 °C for 10 min. Take out the comb and place the glass plates with gel in the electrophoresis apparatus and fill the inner and outer chamber with electrophoresis buffer. Load 10 μl of the sample into each well. Load 5 μl of the Protein tricolor ladder to one of the wells.
