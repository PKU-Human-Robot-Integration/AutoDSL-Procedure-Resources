    "1. Light-controlled chemical production using the S. cerevisiae  OptoINVRT7 circuit\nStrain construction\n\t\nObtain a strain with his3 auxotrophy, as this marker is necessary for most existing OptoINVRT plasmids5. If seeking optogenetic regulation of a gene that is native to S. cerevisiae, construct a strain in which any endogenous copy of the gene is deleted.\nLinearize the plasmid containing the OptoINVRT7 circuit, such as EZ-L4395, and integrate it into the his3-locus of the auxotrophic strain using standard lithium-acetate transformation methods15. If using the EZ-L439 plasmid, which contains the components to repress PGAL1 in the light and activate it in the dark, linearize at the PmeI restriction site. \nFollowing the transformation, centrifuge the cells at 150 x g for 1 min and gently resuspend in 200 µL of fresh histidine-dropout synthetic complete medium (SC-His) medium.\nPlate the entire cell volume onto SC-His agar plates and incubate at 30 °C for 2-3 days until colonies appear.\nPrepare competent cells from this strain using standard lithium acetate transformation protocols, and transform them with a plasmid containing the gene(s) to be controlled optogenetically downstream of either the PGAL1-M or PGAL1-S promoter5.\n\t\tNOTE: Using a plasmid that integrates at δ-sites (YARCdelta5) and selects with Zeocin allows for stable multicopy integration7,16,17,18.\nAfter transformation, centrifuge the culture at 150 x g for 1 min and gently resuspend in 200 µL of fresh SC-dropout medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The PGAL1-M promoter is a synthetic version of the PGAL1 promoter with the Mig1p repression sites deleted, while PGAL1-S is an engineered version of PGAL1-M, which has extra Gal4p activator binding sites. The regular PGAL1 promoter can be used to control the expression; however, the expression strength will be lower than from these engineered promoters.",
    "Plate the entire cell volume on a yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) agar plate if integrating into δ-sites, or an SC-dropout plate if transforming with a plasmid containing a selection marker. Incubate at 30 °C for 16 h under constant blue light to keep the optogenetically controlled gene repressed.\n\t\tNOTE: For some strains, colonies might grow faster when incubated in blue light pulses (e.g., 1 s on/79 s off, 5 s on/75 s off, 10 s on/70 s off, etc.) rather than in constant illumination, which must be determined experimentally for each strain, if necessary.\nUse any 465 nm light source and place an LED panel ~40 cm above the plate such that the light intensity is ~80-110 µmol/m2/s. Measure the intensity using a quantum meter (see Table of Materials).\nIf integrating into δ-sites, create a replica of the plate onto YPD plates containing a range of Zeocin concentrations between 400 µg/mL and 1,200 µg/mL to select for a variety of integration copy numbers5,7,12,16,17,18. Incubate the replica plates at 30 °C under constant or pulsed blue light for 2-3 days until the colonies appear.\nPreliminary screening for the best colonies\n\t\nSelect eight colonies from each plate and use them to inoculate 1 mL of SC-His medium supplemented with 2% glucose in individual wells of a 24-well plate. Grow in 24-well plates under the cells overnight (16-20 h) at 30 °C with 200 rpm (19 mm orbital diameter) shaking under constant blue light illumination.",
    "The next morning, dilute each culture in 1 mL of a fresh SC-His medium with 2% glucose to OD600 values ranging from 0.01-0.3 and grow in 24-well plates under constant or pulsed light at 30 °C with 200 rpm shaking until they reach cell densities between 2 and 9 OD600 values (Figure 4A). The amount of time needed for this growth phase will depend on the strain.\nIncubate the plates in dark for 4 h at 30 °C with 200 rpm shaking by turning off the light panel and wrapping the plates in aluminum foil.\n\t\tNOTE: This step allows the cells to metabolically transition to the production phase before resuspension in the production media.\nTo start the production phase, centrifuge the cultures in the 24-well plate at 234 x g for 5 min and resuspend cells in 1 mL of fresh SC-dropout medium with 2% glucose. Seal the plates to prevent evaporation of the desired product by using sterile microplate sealing tape.\nFerment the sealed plates in the dark for 48 h at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Ensure that the plates are wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent any exposure to light.\n\t\tNOTE: Wrapping the plates in foil does not limit oxygen or gas availability in fermentations; however, the sterile sealing tape does limit gas transfer. Small holes can be poked in the tape to introduce oxygen, if necessary.\nHarvesting and analysis\n\t\nTo harvest the fermentations, centrifuge the plates for 5 min at 234 x g and transfer 800 µL of the supernatant into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nDepending on the chemical of interest, analyze using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), or another analytical method using the sample preparation technique best suited for the instrument used.",
    "2. Light-controlled protein production using the E. coli OptoLAC system\nStrain construction\n\t\nCo-transform electrocompetent BL21 DE3 ΔlacI ΔlacI-DE3 with a plasmid containing the OptoLAC1B or OptoLAC2B circuit6 and a plasmid that expresses the recombinant protein of interest from the PT7 promoter19.\nAfter transforming, recover the cells for 1 h in 1 mL of super optimal broth with catabolite repression (SOC; 2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4, 20 mM glucose) at 37 °C with rotation or shaking.\n\t\tNOTE: The plasmid containing the protein of interest must be compatible with the OptoLAC plasmid (i.e., different resistance marker and origin of replication) and must not contain a copy of lacI.\nCentrifuge the cells at 4845 x g for 3 min and concentrate the pellet in 200 µL of lysogeny broth (LB) media. Plate the entire concentrated cells onto an LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotics and grow at 37 °C overnight under constant blue light to keep protein expression repressed.\nInitial screening to verify expression\n\t\nTake three single colonies and use them to inoculate 1 mL of LB media with appropriate antibiotics in individual wells of a 24-well plate. Grow overnight (16-20 h) at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking under constant blue light illumination (Figure 4A).\nThe next day, use 1.5 µL of culture to measure OD600 in a spectrophotometer with a microvolume measurement. Dilute cultures into 1 mL of fresh LB in 24-well plates to OD600 values ranging from 0.01-0.1.\nGrow the cultures at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking under blue light for 2-3 h. Starting from the second hour, take OD600 measurements every 15 min to ensure that the cultures do not overgrow the OD600 range of 0.1-1.5.",
    "Once the cultures are at the desired OD600, turn off the light panel and wrap the plate in aluminum foil to initiate the production phase. Keep the plate in the dark for 8 h (37 °C), 20 h (30 °C), or 48 h (18 °C), with 200 rpm shaking.\nMeasure and record the final OD600 value of each culture.\nHarvesting and analysis\n\t\nTransfer 800 µL of each culture into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 17,000 x g.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of resuspension buffer (Tris 50 mM, pH 8.0, NaCl 300 mM).\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of NaCl can be adjusted based on the recombinant protein being analyzed.\nAdd 50 µL of 6x sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (Tris 375 mM, pH 6.8, SDS 9%, glycerol 50%, bromophenol blue 0.03%, DTT 9%). Incubate at 100 °C for 10 min with shaking at 700 rpm in a thermomixer.\nLoad ~3-20 µL of the culture in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Using the final OD600 measurement as a guide, load approximately the same amount of protein for each sample (equivalent to 10 µL of the sample corresponding to a final OD600 value of 1). Use a power supply to run electrophoresis at 100 V until the gel is fully resolved.\nStain the gel with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 solution by heating for 30-40 s in a microwave oven, and then incubating on a platform rotator for at least 15 min.\nRinse with deionized water twice and destain on a platform rotator for at least 30 min (or overnight), adding two cleaning wipes tied into a knot to help absorb the stain. Boil the gel in sufficient amount of water in the microwave oven for 15 min to speed up the destaining process.",
    "3. Three-phase fermentation using the S. cerevisiae OptoAMP system\nStrain construction\n\t\nObtain a strain with a his3 auxotrophic marker, as this marker is necessary in order to use the existing OptoAMP plasmids5. If seeking optogenetic regulation of a gene that is native to S. cerevisiae, construct a strain in which the endogenous copy of this gene is deleted.\nLinearize a plasmid containing the OptoAMP4 circuit, such as EZ-L58012, and integrate it in the his3 locus of the auxotrophic strain using standard lithium-acetate transformation methods15. If using EZ-L580, linearize the plasmid at the PmeI restriction site.\nFollowing the transformation, centrifuge the cells at 150 x g for 1 min and gently resuspend in 200 µL of fresh SC-His medium.\nPlate the entire cell volume on selective media (SC-His-agar) and incubate at 30 °C for 2-3 days until colonies appear.\nPrepare competent cells from this strain and transform them with a plasmid containing the gene(s) to be controlled optogenetically downstream of the PGAL1-S promoter12.\n\t\tNOTE: Using a plasmid that integrates at δ-sites and selects with Zeocin allows for stable multicopy integration and selection.\nAfter transforming, centrifuge the culture at 150 x g for 1 min and gently resuspend in 200 µL of fresh SC-dropout medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The PGAL1-S promoter is a synthetic version of the PGAL1 promoter in which the Mig1p repression sites are deleted and extra Gal4p activator binding sites are added. The regular PGAL1 promoter can be used; however, the expression strength will be lower than this engineered promoter.",
    "Plate the entire cell volume on a YPD or SC-dropout agar plate and incubate at 30 °C for 16 h in the dark (wrapped in aluminum foil). Incubating in the dark keeps the optogenetically-controlled gene repressed, which allows the cells to direct their metabolic resources toward cell growth rather than chemical production.\nIf integrating into δ-sites, replica plate onto YPD plates containing a range of Zeocin concentrations to select for a variety of integration copy numbers. Incubate the plates at 30 °C in the dark (wrapped in aluminum foil) for 2-3 days until colonies appear.\nPreliminary screening for the best colonies\n\t\nSelect eight colonies from each plate and use them to inoculate 1 mL of SC-His medium with 2% glucose in individual wells of a 24-well plate. Grow the cells overnight (16-20 h) in the dark at 30 °C with 200 rpm shaking.\nThe next morning, dilute each culture in 1 mL of fresh SC-His medium with 2% glucose to 0.1 OD600 and grow in dark at 30 °C with 200 rpm shaking until they reach an OD600 of 3. Wrap the plates in aluminum foil to prevent exposure to light. The amount of time needed for this growth phase will depend on the strain.\nTo start the induction phase, incubate the plates under pulsed light (for example, 5 s on/95 s off) for 12 h at 30 °C with 200 rpm shaking. Use any 465 nm light source and place an LED panel above the plate such that the light intensity is ~80-110 µmol/m2/s for optimum results (Figure 4A).\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal light pulse duration for this incubation will vary based on the chemical being produced. It is recommended to screen a range of light schedules from 0.1% (e.g., 1 s on 999 s off) to 100% (full light).",
    "To start the production phase, centrifuge the cultures at 234 x g for 5 min and resuspend in fresh SC-His medium with 2% glucose. Seal the plates to prevent evaporation of the desired product using sterile microplate sealing tape.\nFerment the sealed plates in light for 48 h at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Optimize the light schedule during this step as some chemicals benefit from a pulsed production phase rather than full light.\nHarvesting and analysis\n\t\nHarvest the fermentations by centrifuging the plates for 5 min at 234 x g and transferring 800 µL of the supernatant into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nDepending on the chemical of interest, analyze using HPLC, GC-MS, or another analytical method using the sample preparation technique best suited for the instrument used.\n4. Chemical (mevalonate) production from E. coli in a light-controlled bioreactor\nInitial inoculation and bioreactor setup\n\t\nInoculate a colony of an E. coli strain engineered with light-controlled chemical production into 5 mL of M9 minimal salts (3.37 mM Na2HPO4, 2.2 mM KH2PO4, 0.855 mM NaCl, 0.935 mM NH4Cl) supplemented with 0.2% w/v casamino acids, 5% w/v glucose, and trace metal mixture20 (0.0084 g/L EDTA, 0.0025 g/L CoCl2, 0.015 g/L MnCl2, 0.0015 g/L CuCl2, 0.003 g/L H3BO3, 0.0025 g/L Na2MoO4, 0.008 g/L ZnCl2, 0.06 g/L Fe (III) citrate, 0.0045 g/L thiamine, 1.3 g/L MgSO4) in a 50 mL conical tube.\nGrow the culture overnight at 30 °C with 200 rpm shaking under blue light illumination.",
    "Set up the bioreactor vessel head plate, making sure that the following ports are installed: insert for thermal probe; dissolved oxygen (DO) probe; gas sparger - connect to the air source through a 0.2 µm filter; impeller; gas condenser - connect to a 0.2 µm filter; cooling line (x2); feed lines (x2) - one for media addition, one for pH control; sampling line - ensure it reaches the bottom of the vessel; empty port; pH probe - calibrate the probe with standards of pH = 4 and pH = 7 prior to installation, either autoclave with the rest of the vessel or sterilize with 95% ethanol and aseptically insert before setup.\nFill the vessel with 1 L of filtered water, and attach the head plate and tighten, making sure that the O-ring snugly fits and seals.\nCover any openings into the reactor with aluminum foil.\nPrepare three strips of tubing: one for removing the water, one for inserting the feed, and one for pH control. Cover the ends with aluminum foil and wrap all the tubing in aluminum foil.\n\t\tNOTE: NH4OH, which is used for pH adjustment, does not flow smoothly in silicone tubing, which may lead to inaccurate flow rates and over-basification of the culture. To avoid this issue, use biocompatible pump tubing (BPT) for the NH4OH feed.\nAutoclave the bioreactor and tubing, using a 30 min liquid cycle.\nRemove the materials from the autoclave. Once cool enough to handle, connect the impeller, pH and DO probes, air source, condenser inlet and outlet, and cooling inlet and outlet to the control station.\nInsert the thermal probe and cover the vessel with a heating jacket. Secure the jacket toward the top of the vessel to avoid blocking the culture from light exposure.",
    "Connect one of the sterile tubes to the sampling line and secure through the sampling pump. Place the other end such that it flows into an empty container that can hold at least 1 L. Drain the water inside the vessel.\nConnect another sterile tube to one of the feed lines and secure through one of the feed pumps. Connect the other end of the tube to a bottle of M9 media. Feed the media into the reactor.\nConnect another sterile tube to one of the feed lines and secure through one of the feed pumps. Connect the other end of the tube to the bottle containing 28%-30% NH4OH.\n\t\tCAUTION: NH4OH is corrosive. Work in a fume hood while transferring to a feed bottle and make sure the feed bottle is placed in secondary containment.\nPlace three light panels in a triangular formation ~20 cm away from the reactor, checking that the light intensities on the surface of the vessel reach ~80-110 µmol/m2/s from each side (Figure 4B).\nThe next day, turn on the bioreactor system and chiller. Set the reactor temperature setpoint to 37 °C, the pH setpoint to 7.0, and the agitation to 200 rpm. The heating jacket should turn on.\nCalibrate the DO probe by first waiting until the temperature and DO measurements become constant (this will be the 100% setpoint). Then, disconnect the probe from the system (this will be the 0% setpoint). Repeat until the DO measurement stabilizes at 100% when the probe is connected, and then set the DO setpoint to 20%.\nLight-controlled chemical production\n\t\nInoculate the bioreactor to an initial OD600 of 0.001-0.1. Turn on the light panels to initiate growth.",
    "After 3 h, begin taking samples from the sampling line to take OD600 measurements to avoid overgrowing the optimal cell density of induction (ρs). Once the optimal ρs is reached (the optimal value for mevalonate production is 0.17), turn off the light panels, cover the reactor in aluminum foil, and wrap the setup in black cloth to initiate the dark production phase.\nAdd 50 µL of antifoam, 8 h after switching to darkness. Unscrew the empty port and pipette the antifoam directly into the reactor.\nUse the sampling port to periodically take samples for HPLC or GC analysis.\nDisassembly and analysis\n\t\nAfter the experiment is concluded, turn off the system. Carefully unscrew the DO and pH probes and wash them with soap and water. Unscrew the head plate and wash it with soap and water using a brush.\nTransfer the culture into an empty container and add bleach to a final concentration of 10% v/v. Place in a fume hood and dispose of after 30 min.\nWash the reactor vessel with soap and water using a brush.\nPrepare the samples for analysis based on the product of interest. For mevalonate production, mix 560 µL of culture with 140 µL of 0.5 M HCl and vortex at high speed for 1 min. This converts mevalonate into (±)-mevalonolactone.\n\t\tCAUTION: HCl is a health hazard. Handle with proper PPE and ensure sample tubes are properly capped prior to vortexing.\nCentrifuge at 17,000 x g for 45 min at 4 °C. Transfer 250 µL of the supernatant to an HPLC vial.\nFor mevalonate, analyze samples using an organic acids ion exchange column. Quantify production using a refractive index detector (RID), comparing peak areas to a standard of (±)-mevalonolactone.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
