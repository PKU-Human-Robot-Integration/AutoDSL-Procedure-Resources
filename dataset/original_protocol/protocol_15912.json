    "Cells can be cultured according to protocols of your choice. However, if there is no strong preference, we recommended culturing cells on a substrate separable from the culture well (e.g., on coverslips) or on a removable-chamber cover glass (e.g., Sigma, cat. no. GBL 112358) for easy gelation and sample handling in later steps.\nThe cell culture protocol described below uses adherent cell lines (e.g., HEK or COS7) and has demonstrated consistent results. If removable-chamber cover glasses are used for cell culture, start with the fibronectin glass surface modification in step 2.\n1. Treat 12-mm round coverslips with 1 M KOH in water for 30 min, rinse with water three times, and store in 30% (v/v) ethanol in water.\n2. Air-dry the cleaned 12-mm round coverslips in a sterile environment (i.e., biosafety cabinet), place in a 35-mm petri dish, and subsequently treat with 10 mg/ml sterile fibronectin in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. Remove the fibronectin solution immediately before cell plating.\n3. Cells are plated and cultured on the surface of either the 12-mm coverslips or the removable-chamber cover glass to a confluency of 50% to 80% in a humidified incubator set at 5% CO2 and 37°C.\nCell fixation\nCells can be fixed using protocols of your choice. For instance, 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS can be used. For stronger fixation that preserves more ultrastructure, you might try using a mixture of PFA and a small percentage of glutaraldehyde (e.g., 4% (w/v) PFA plus 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS), although glutaraldehyde-containing fixatives have been seldom used in expansion microscopy studies to date. The 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS is typically prepared freshly prior to the fixation.\nThe fixation protocol described below has demonstrated consistent results. Note that all the washing steps should be performed quickly to avoid sample dehydration.",
    "4. Replace the cell culture medium with 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nCAUTION: This should be done in a chemical hood, as PFA is considered a potential carcinogen.\n5. Remove the PFA solution and wash the cells for 5 min with 100 mM glycine in PBS to quench the fixation.\n6. Remove the glycine solution and wash the cells twice for 5 min each with PBS.\n7. We recommend moving to the next steps of the protocol immediately.\nIf necessary, fixed cells can be stored in the dark at 4°C in PBS for up to several weeks before the next steps of the protocol.\nImmunostaining/immunohistochemistry (optional)\nFor immunostaining after fixation, follow protocols of your choice; you can essentially perform conventional histology. The protocol described below has demonstrated consistent results with fixed cells prepared by the protocols described earlier.\n8. Permeabilize the fixed cells by applying 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. To reduce nonspecific antibody binding, apply blocking buffer at room temperature for 15 min.\n9. Incubate the cells with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer, at the appropriate concentration. The incubation can be done on a shaker at low speed for a period ranging from 1 hr to overnight, at room temperature or at 4°C, depending on the antibody specifications.\n10. Remove the antibody solution and wash four times, each time for 5 min with blocking buffer.\n11. Incubate the cells with secondary antibodies in blocking buffer on a shaker at low speed for 2 to 4 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. If using antibodies conjugated with dyes, see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0005] for a discussion of dye compatibility with pre-expansion staining proExM.",
    "12. Remove the antibody solution and wash four times, each time for 5 min with blocking buffer.\n13. We recommend moving to the next steps of the protocol immediately.\nIf necessary, the samples can be stored in the dark at 4°C in PBS for up to several weeks before the next steps of the protocol.\nGelation\n14. Prepare Acryloyl-X SE (AcX)/DMSO stock solution, monomer solution (Stock X) TEMED stock solution, and ammonium persulfate (APS) stock solution as instructed in Reagents and Solutions.\n15. Replace the sample buffer (e.g., the blocking buffer if immunostained following the protocols above) with 0.1 mg/ml Acryloyl-X SE (AcX) in PBS.\nThis AcX solution is prepared by diluting the 10 mg/ml AcX/DMSO stock solution 1:100 in PBS.\n16. Leave the cells in the 0.1 mg/ml AcX solution for 2 to 3 hr at room temperature.\nPrevious protocols suggested >6 hr or overnight, but we routinely find 2 to 3 hr to be more than enough time with no shaking.",
    "17. When cells are cultured on a petri dish, the gelation chamber can be constructed in the meantime, by placing two spacers on a slide, separated from each other by a distance large enough so that the sample cover glass can fit in between (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0002]A). Thin and flat objects, such as stacks of coverslips, can serve as the spacers. For example, a stack of two No. 1.5 coverslips has a height of about 0.30 to 0.38 mm; by changing the number or types of the coverslips, the height of the spacers can be adjusted accordingly to match the cell culture substrate (i.e., the sample cover glass) height. The spacer height should be kept close to the cell culture substrate height to avoid leaving excessive gel on top of the sample, but the total thickness of the gel [i.e., (spacer height) – (cell culture substrate height)] should be at least 0.15 mm for easier gel handling in later steps. A droplet of water (e.g., a few µl) can be applied to the spacers to adhere them to the slide (and, if multiple spacers, to each other). If a removable-chamber cover glass is used for the cell culture during steps 2 to 3, the cover glass itself and the gasket can serve as the gelation chamber and the spacer, respectively. In this case, the upper structure of the removable-chamber cover glass can be removed via a removal tool (Sigma, cat. no. GBL 103259). For the gelation chamber lid, a thick and robust coverslip (e.g., a No. 2 coverslip) wrapped in Parafilm can be used, with the Parafilm preventing the gel from sticking to the coverslip when removing the lid in later steps. Make sure the Parafilm surface is flat, clean, and free of folds.",
    "We recommend finishing preparation of the gelation chamber and the lid before moving to the next step.",

(A) Schematic showing the side view of a gelation chamber. The cultured cells are on the top surface of the cell culture substrate. The lid is moved towards the chamber, bearing a droplet of the gelling solution. (B) Schematic showing lid placement. The lid is moved towards the sample so that the droplet merges with the gelling solution in the chamber, which prevents air pocket formation. (C) Schematic showing the gelation chamber ready for polymerization at 37°C. (D) Schematic showing removal of the lid and the spacers. The lid is first pried open and then the gel is trimmed down with a razor blade to remove excess gel. (E) Schematic showing the digestion step. The cell culture substrate with the gel on top is placed in the digestion buffer, which eventually causes the gel to come off the substrate. (F) Schematic showing the gel detached from the substrate and slightly expanded after the digestion step.\n18. After incubating the cells in AcX solution, wash the cells twice, each time for 15 min, with PBS. Begin thawing the components for the gelling solution for proExM—the Stock X, APS, and TEMED stock solutions. Keep the solutions chilled in an ice bath or on a cold block (chilled to 4°C).\n19. Create the gelling solution for proExM now by mixing Stock X, water, TEMED stock solution, and APS stock solution in a 47:1:1:1 ratio (gelling solution; also see recipes in Reagents and Solutions), in this order (i.e., APS last) in a microcentrifuge tube, and vortex for a few seconds.",
    "The amount of gelling solution should be scaled up or down according to the size of the gelation chamber. For instance, 200 µl of gelling solution is enough to fill a gelation chamber with a 22 × 22 × 0.38 mm void. The mixed gelling solution should be kept in an ice bath or on a cold block (chilled to 4°C). Avoid excessive warming of the gelling solution by, for example, holding the lid of the microcentrifuge tube rather than the body of the tube. Once the gelling solution is prepared, we recommend completing the next few steps (until placing the gelation chamber in a 37°C incubator in step 24) within 5 min to prevent premature gelation.\n20. Immediately after the previous step, remove the PBS from the cells using a pipet and add a small amount of the mixed gelling solution to the cells on the cell culture substrate. If a removable-chamber cover glass is used, remove the PBS and add the gelling solution to fill in the chamber, then continue to step 22.\n21. Use a pair of forceps to pick up and place the cell culture substrate (i.e., the coverslip on which cells are cultured) with the cultured cells between the spacers in the gelation chamber. Make sure the cells are facing upward. Slightly press the cell culture substrate down, to hold it in place. If the gelling solution flows away, reapply a small amount of gelling solution to the cells.",
    "22. Add a droplet (∼20 µl) of gelling solution to one side of the Parafilm-covered lid, and flip it over so that the droplet hangs from the surface due to surface tension (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0002]A). Slowly lower the lid so that the droplet will fuse with the gelling solution on the sample coverslip (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0002]B). Once fused, continue lowering the lid so it rests on the spacers. Make sure no air pockets are introduced inside the solution during this process.\n23. Using a pipet with a fine tip, keep adding additional gelling solution to both open sides of the chamber until the space between the lid, spacers, and slide is filled with gelling solution (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0002]C).\nCapillary forces should cause the gelling solution to evenly fill the void.\n24. Place the gelation chamber in an incubator at 37°C for 1 hr for polymerization. Be careful not to tilt or shake the chamber during the transfer and the gelation.\nDigestion\n25. Take out the gelation chamber from the incubator.\n26. Slowly insert a razor blade from the side between the lid and the spacers and pry the lid off. Once the lid is separated from the gel, use the razor blade to remove the spacers (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0002]D). If a removable-chamber cover glass is used, remove the lid, then use forceps to peel off the black gasket without removing the gel from the cover glass.\n27. Using a razor blade, trim the gel to a small volume around the sample. This will keep the gel compact and aid in finding cells in later steps. Use the razor blade to remove the cell culture substrate and the gel, together, from the glass slide. If a removable-chamber cover glass is used, trim the gel but do not remove the gel from the cover glass.",
    "You may want to trim the gel to have an asymmetric shape so that its orientation can easily be gauged in later steps simply by examination of the shape [see our video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OksNCAJwxVI[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OksNCAJwxVI] (proExM for tissues: gelation demonstration)].\n28. Prepare digestion buffer as described in Reagents and Solutions (final concentration of ProK: 8 U/ml).\n29. Since the gel will expand by about 1.5× during digestion, choose a suitably large container (e.g., petri dish) for the digestion. Also, use a separate container for each sample to avoid sample mix-up. Place the cell culture substrate with the gel in the container and fill it with digestion buffer of volume at least 10-fold excess of that of the gel (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0002]E). Immerse the gel in digestion buffer for at least 2 to 3 hr until it naturally peels off from the sample coverslip (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0002]F). If a removable-chamber cover glass is used, use a diamond scribe to separate each sample and its corresponding piece of the cover glass, by carefully scribing the cover glass and breaking each piece of glass off bearing its piece of gel. Place each piece of cover glass with the gel in a container and immerse in the digestion buffer as described above. A Nunc 4-well rectangular plate, for example, is convenient to contain several pieces of cover glass for digestion. The detached cell substrate can be removed using forceps, to leave only the cell-containing gel in the digestion buffer.\n30. Leave the gel immersed in the digestion buffer overnight at room temperature in the dark.\nStorage and expansion",
    "31. If not done previously, remove the now-detached cell substrate (e.g., coverslip) from the digestion container carefully using forceps without disturbing the sample gel. Remove the digestion buffer and add PBS, and store the gel at 4°C in the dark if storage for later imaging is desired.\nBe cautious not to suck up the gel while pipetting. The gel scatters light slightly at this stage, so changing the incident angle of light might help to locate it inside the solution.\n32. If the gel needs to be transferred to another container (e.g., a larger container for trimming, or the sample holder for imaging), you can use a paintbrush of suitable size to pick up and move the gel. To avoid gel dehydration, add some PBS to the container.\n33. Before expanding the sample, we recommend trimming the gel to the minimum size necessary. You can use a dissection microscope or a low-magnification wide-field microscope to locate the region of interest. To minimize sample movement, most of the surrounding liquid can be temporarily removed during trimming. Under the microscope, use a razor blade to cut and remove gel outside of the region of interest. We advise trimming the gel into an asymmetric shape to easily deduce the orientation. Make sure to trim the gel down to a reasonable size for handling and imaging, as the expansion will introduce an additional 2 to 2.5× (to a total of about 4.5×) linear increase in size. Transfer the gel with the regions of interest to a container (e.g., a petri dish of suitable size for expansion, or the sample holder for imaging) that is large enough to contain the expanded gel.",
    "34. Fill the container and immerse the gel in water and wait for 20 min. Exchange the water and wait for another 20 min. Redo the exchange one more time (20 min in fresh water, three times in total).\nThe sample should be fully expanded and optically cleared as in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0003] and ready for imaging (these times are shorter than in previous publications, but reflect numbers that work for routine use in our lab). For long-term imaging, e.g., when imaging a large volume of specimen, sample mounting is necessary after the expansion and before the imaging (see Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0008]). Sample mounting attaches the sample to the sample holder and thus prevents it from drifting, and also can help keep the specimen within the working distance of the objective lens. For a quick check of the expanded sample under the microscope (<5 min), there is typically no need for sample mounting. On an inverted microscope, for example, you can use a pipet to temporarily (<5 min) remove the water around the gel to prevent it from sliding away.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5da60f6f-3536-448b-95d5-63f777e4b93d/cpcb56-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nOptical clearing resulting from the expansion process. A 200-µm thick fixed brain hemi-slice is shown left. Post-expansion (right), the gel containing the hemi-slice becomes significantly enlarged and optically clear. Modified from Chen et al. (2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0002]).",
    "35. If you need to transfer the expanded gel to a new container, it needs to be handled with care, as it is somewhat delicate in the expanded state. First remove most of the surrounding water and then use a brush to move the gel onto a clean glass coverslip placed in the same container. Next, gently lift the coverslip (with the gel on top) out of the container with forceps. The gel can be transferred by slowly brushing it off the coverslip to the new container. This method can be also used to flip the gel by inverting the coverslip bearing the gel, in case the gel is facing in the wrong direction.",
    "The basic protocol for intact tissues differs slightly from that for cultured cells. Due to the thickness of the samples, intact tissues require a longer time for AcX diffusion. Furthermore, the gelling solution is supplemented with a polymerization inhibitor to allow for longer diffusion of the gelling solution through the samples before the polymerization begins.\nMaterials\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Current Protocols, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0006])\n4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS or, for stronger fixation, a mixture of 4% (w/v) PFA and 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS\nSinking solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-rec-0012])\nDry ice\n2-methylbutane\nOptimal cutting temperature compound (OCT), M-1 or another embedding matrix\n0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS\nBlocking buffer: 5% (v/v) normal donkey serum in 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (store up to 1 month or longer at 4°C): the serum should be from the animal host of the secondary antibodies, so other types of sera should be used instead of normal donkey serum if the secondary antibodies are from other animals\nPrimary and secondary antibodies for immunostaining\nAcX/DMSO stock solution (see recipe)\nGelling solution for expansion of intact tissues (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-rec-0004])\nDigestion buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-rec-0003])\nVibratome or cryostat microtome\n22 × 22 mm No. 1.5 coverslips (0.15 to 0.19 mm thickness)\n22 × 22 mm No. 2 coverslips (0.19 to 0.23 mm thickness)\nMicroscope slides\nParafilm\nMicrocentrifuge tubes\nPaintbrush\nIce bath or cold block chilled to 4°C\nRazor blade\nForceps\nPetri dishes\nDissection microscope\nTissue preparation\nIn this basic proExM tissue protocol, the thickness of the tissue or the tissue slice is assumed to be <200 µm in its thinnest dimension.

    "Tissues can be fixed using protocols of your choice. For instance, immersion or perfusion fixation with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS can be used. For stronger fixation that preserves more ultrastructure, you might try a mixture of PFA and a small percentage of glutaraldehyde (e.g., 4% (w/v) PFA plus 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS), although glutaraldehyde-containing fixatives have been less used in expansion microscopy protocols to date. The 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS solution is typically prepared freshly prior to the fixation.\n1. After fixation, if tissues are thicker than 200 µm, cut them into <200 µm slices using a vibratome. Alternatively, for slicing in a cryostat, the tissue needs first to be cryoprotected by immersing it in sinking solution until the tissue sinks to the bottom. The tissue is then taken out and frozen using dry ice and 2-methylbutane. After embedding it in OCT, M-1 or another embedding matrix, the sample is ready to be sliced using a cryotome.\nAfter either slicing method, we recommend moving to the next steps of the protocol immediately.\nIf necessary, fixed tissues or tissue slices can be stored in the dark at 4°C in PBS for up to several weeks before the next steps of the protocol.\nImmunostaining/immunohistochemistry (optional)\nFor immunostaining after fixation, follow protocols of your choice. The protocol described below has demonstrated consistent results with fixed brain tissues prepared by the protocols described earlier.\n2. Permeabilize the fixed tissue by applying 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 15 min, then in blocking buffer at room temperature for 6 hr.\n3. Incubate the tissues with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer. The incubation can be done on a shaker at low speed overnight at room temperature or at 4°C.",
    "4. Remove the antibody solution and wash four times, each time for 30 min with blocking buffer, to remove unbound primary antibodies.\n5. Incubate the tissues with secondary antibodies in the blocking buffer on a shaker at low speed overnight at room temperature or at 4°C. If using antibodies conjugated with dyes, see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0005] for a description of dye performance and compatibility with pre-expansion staining proExM.\n6. Remove the antibody solution and wash four times, each time for 30 min with blocking buffer to remove unbound secondary antibodies.\n7. We recommend moving to the gelation steps immediately.\nIf necessary, the samples can be stored in the dark at 4°C in PBS for up to several weeks before gelation.\nGelation\n8. Prepare Acryloyl-X SE (AcX)/DMSO stock solution, monomer solution (Stock X), TEMED stock solution, ammonium persulfate (APS) stock, and 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (4HT) solution as instructed in Reagents and Solutions.\n9. Replace the sample buffer (e.g., the blocking buffer if immunostained following the protocols above) with 0.1 mg/ml Acryloyl-X SE (AcX) in PBS.\nThe AcX solution is prepared by diluting the 10 mg/ml AcX/DMSO stock solution 1:100 in PBS.\n10. Leave the tissues in AcX solution for >6 hr (overnight is fine) at room temperature with no shaking.",
    "11. Meanwhile, to construct the gelation chamber, place two spacers on a slide, separated from each other (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0004]A). Thin and flat objects, such as stacks of coverslips, can serve as the spacers. For example, a stack of two No. 1.5 coverslips has a height ranging from 0.30 to 0.38 mm, and by changing the number or types of the coverslips, the height of the spacers can be adjusted to accommodate the tissue thickness. The spacer height should be kept close to the tissue thickness to avoid leaving excessive gel on top of the sample, but the total thickness of the gel (i.e., the spacer height) should be at least 0.15 mm for easier gel handling in later steps. A droplet of water (e.g., a few µl) can be applied to spacers to adhere them to the slide (and, if multiple spacers, to each other). For the gelation chamber lid, a thick and robust coverslip (e.g., a No. 2 coverslip) wrapped in Parafilm can be used, with the Parafilm preventing the gel from sticking to the coverslip when removing the lid in later steps. Make sure the Parafilm surface is flat, clean, and free of folds. We recommend finishing preparing the gelation chamber and the lid before moving to the next step.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3560ed26-2f17-4b42-a642-eda04e0e60e5/cpcb56-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

Begin thawing the components for the gelling solution for proExM: Stock X, 4HT, APS and TEMED stock solutions. Keep the solutions chilled in an ice bath or on a cold block (chilled to 4°C).",
    "13. Add Stock X, 4HT, TEMED and APS in a 47:1:1:1 ratio in this order (i.e., APS last) into a microcentrifuge tube (gelling solution; also see recipe in Reagents and Solutions), and vortex for a few seconds. The amount of gelling solution should be scaled up or down accordingly to the size of the gelation chamber and the size of the tissue or tissue slice and should be at least 100-fold excess in volume. For instance, at least 400 µl of gelling solution is used to incubate a 100-μm single coronal slice of mouse brain, enough to fill a gelation chamber with a 22 × 22 × 0.38 mm void, which can fit a full coronal mouse brain slice. To prevent premature polymerization of the gelling solution, APS should be added to the solution last before vortexing. In addition, the mixed gelling solution should be kept in an ice bath or on a cold block (chilled to 4°C). Avoid excessive warming of the gelling solution by, for example, holding the lid of the microcentrifuge tube rather the body of the tube. Finally, we recommend completing the next steps (until placing the microcentrifuge tube with the gelling solution and the sample at 4°C in step 15) within 5 min to prevent premature gelation.\n14. Immediately after the previous step, use a soft paintbrush to transfer and immerse the tissues in the gelling solution in the microcentrifuge tube.\n15. Keep the microcentrifuge tube containing the sample and the gelling solution at 4°C in the dark for 30 min. After the 30 min incubation, we recommend completing the next few steps (until placing the gelation chamber in a 37°C incubator in step 19) within 5 min to prevent premature gelation.",
    "16. Use the paintbrush to transfer and place the tissue slice between the spacers in the gelation chamber. Make sure the slice is lying flat without wrinkles or distortions. We recommend first adding a droplet of 20 µl of the gelling solution in between the spacers, transferring the tissue slice into the droplet, and using the paintbrush to slowly flatten the tissue within the liquid environment, gently pressing it onto the glass surface.\n17. Add a droplet of 20 µl of the gelling solution to one side of the lid, and flip it over so that the droplet hangs from the surface due to surface tension (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0004]A). Slowly lower the lid so that the droplet will fuse with the gelling solution on the sample coverslip (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0004]B). Once fused, continue lowering the lid so it rests on the spacers. Make sure no air pockets are introduced inside the solution during this process.\n18. Using a pipettor and a fine pipet tip, keep adding additional gelling solution to both open sides of the chamber until the space between the lid, spacers, and the slide is filled (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0004]C).\nCapillary forces will cause the gelling solution to evenly fill the chamber.\n19. Place the gelation chamber in an incubator at 37°C for 2 hr for polymerization. Be careful not to tilt or shake the chamber during the transfer and the gelation.\nDigestion\n20. Take out the gelation chamber from the incubator.\n21. Slowly insert a razor blade from the side between the lid and the spacers and pry the lid open. Once the lid is separated from the gel, continue to use the razor blade to remove the spacers in a similar fashion (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0004]D).\n22. Using a razor blade, trim off any excess gel.",
    "Trimming the gel will keep it compact and aid in finding the regions of interest in later steps. You may want to trim the gel to have an asymmetric shape so that its orientation can easily be gauged in later steps simply by examination of the shape [see our video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OksNCAJwxVI[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OksNCAJwxVI] (proExM for tissues: gelation demonstration)].\n23. Prepare digestion buffer as described in Reagents and Solutions (final concentration of ProK is 8 U/ml).\nWe recommend preparing enough digestion buffer to have at least a 10-fold excess in volume compared with that of the gel.\n24. Use a paintbrush to wet the gel and its sides with the digestion buffer. Wait for 10 to 30 sec, until the digestion buffer soaks the gel border.\nThis will aid in accessing the gel bottom with the paintbrush, so that the gel can be more easily peeled from the glass substrate.\n25. Peel off the gel by gently probing the space between the gel and the glass surface with a fine paintbrush. Since the gel will expand to about 1.5× during digestion, choose a suitably large container, such as a petri dish, for the digestion step. For small tissue and tissue slice samples, 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes can be used as the container. Use separate containers filled with digestion buffer for each sample. Leave gels immersed in digestion buffer for >8 hr (overnight is fine) at room temperature in the dark (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0004]E, F).\nStorage and expansion\n26. Remove the digestion buffer and add PBS, and store the gel at 4°C in the dark if storage for later imaging is desired. Be cautious not to suck up the gel while pipetting.",
    "The embedded tissue is slightly scattering at this stage, so changing the incident angle of light might help to locate it inside the solution.\n27. If the gel needs to be transferred to another container (e.g., a larger container for trimming or the sample holder for imaging), you can use a paintbrush of suitable size to pick up and move the gel. To avoid sample dehydration, add some PBS to the new container.\n28. Before expanding the sample, we recommend trimming the gel to the minimum size necessary. You can use a dissection microscope or a low-magnification wide-field microscope to locate the region of interest. To minimize sample movement, most of the surrounding liquid can be temporarily removed during trimming. Under the microscope, use a razor blade to cut and remove gel outside of the region of interest. We advise trimming the gel into an asymmetric shape to easily deduce the orientation. Make sure to trim the gel to a reasonable size for handling and imaging, as the expansion will introduce an additional 2× to 2.5× (to a total of about 4.5×) linear increase in size. Transfer the gel with the regions of interest to a container (e.g., a petri dish of suitable size for expansion, or the sample holder for imaging) that is large enough to contain the expanded gel.",
    "29. Fill the container, immerse the gel in water, and wait for 20 min. Replace the water with fresh water and wait for another 20 min. Redo the exchange one more time (20 min in fresh water for three changes in total). The sample should be fully expanded and optically cleared (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0003] for an expanded mouse brain hemi-slice) and ready for imaging (these times are shorter than in previous publications, but reflect numbers that work for routine use in our lab). An example of pre-expansion and post-expansion images of a brain slice containing Brainbow 3.0-expressing neurons is shown in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0005]. For long-term imaging, e.g., when imaging a large volume of specimen, sample mounting is necessary after the expansion and before the imaging (see Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0008]). Sample mounting attaches the sample to the sample holder and thus prevents it from drifting, and can also help keep the specimen within the working distance of the objective lens. For a quick check of the expanded sample under the microscope (<5 min), there is typically no need for sample mounting. On an inverted microscope, for example, you can use a pipet to temporarily (<5 min) remove the water around the gel to prevent it from sliding away.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f61ec547-2fd3-4b09-b4bb-18aa235807bc/cpcb56-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nProtein retention expansion microscopy (proExM) of virally injected, membrane bound Brainbow 3.0 followed by antibody staining.

    "30. If you need to transfer the expanded gel to a new container, it needs to be handled with care, as it is somewhat delicate in the expanded state. First, remove most of the surrounding water and then use a brush to move the gel onto a clean glass coverslip placed in the same container. Next, gently lift the coverslip (with the gel on top) out of the container with forceps. The gel can be transferred by slowly brushing it off the coverslip to the new container. This method can be also used to flip the gel by inverting the coverslip bearing the gel, in case the gel is facing in the wrong direction.",
    "For tissues and tissue slices of 200 to 500 μm thickness, the basic tissue protocol (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002]) needs to be modified to allow for deeper penetration of reagents. In addition, the digestion time needs to be prolonged. We have successfully used this protocol to expand samples of up to 500 μm thickness; expanding samples thicker than 500 μm may be possible as well.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002])\n2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES)–buffered saline (MBS): 100 mM MES/150 mM NaCl in water, adjusted to pH 6\n1. Tissue sample generation is outlined in steps 1 to 7 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002], and can be used for thicker tissue samples.\n2. For the AcX step (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002], step 9), a slightly acidic buffer should be used to suppress the reactivity of the NHS ester of the AcX molecule to allow for deeper penetration into the tissue. We typically use MES-buffered saline (MBS) for this slightly acidic buffer. Dilute the 10 mg/ml AcX/DMSO stock solution 1:100 in the MBS. Leave tissue in the AcX in MBS solution for up to 24 hr at room temperature, depending on the thickness of the sample. We typically allow more time for thicker tissues. For instance, we leave a 500-μm brain slice in AcX/MBS solution for 24 hr.\n3. For the gelling solution preparation (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002], step 13), increase the amount of 4HT by 50% (i.e., 47: 1.5 ratio between the Stock X and 4HT) for longer inhibition of polymerization during the incubation. For the incubation (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002], step 15), submerge the sample in the gelling solution for 45 to 60 min (instead of 30 min) at 4°C before transferring it to the gelation chamber.",
    "4. For the digestion (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002], step 25), a longer and stronger digestion is necessary. The ProK digestion can be carried out for a longer time and/or at higher temperature (up to 50° to 60°C), depending on the biological composition of the tissue and how strongly it is crossed-linked after fixation. For a 250-μm thick mouse brain slice, for example, a 2-day digestion at room temperature has yielded adequate digestion of the sample. In this case, the gelled brain slice was digested in digestion buffer (with ProK) at room temperature for 1 day, then the old buffer was exchanged with fresh digestion buffer (with ProK) and digested for another day.",
    "Immunostaining can be performed after expansion, as illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0001]C. One can perform the mechanical homogenization step using ProK, then add antibodies afterward. However, only some epitopes, such as YFP, can survive the ProK treatment and can be stained post-expansion; most epitopes do not.\nTo preserve most epitopes, a milder method, such as protein denaturing by autoclaving in an alkaline detergent-rich buffer (or, alternatively, treatment with a mild protease that cuts at only a small number of sites within proteins, like LysC), can be used for mechanical homogenization (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0001]C, also see Supplementary Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0001] of Tillberg et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0013]). We describe the protocol for autoclave-mediated disruption below. For examples using various antibodies, see Supplementary Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0001] of Tillberg et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0013].\nThe following protocol refers to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002], and an example using Thy1-YFP mouse brain slices and post-expansion anti-GFP staining is included (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/73ac5cf5-58b1-4321-94a1-0e97ff1234d7/cpcb56-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nPost-expansion immunostaining.

    "2. Soak the sample in the alkaline buffer for 15 min, then replace the solution with fresh alkaline buffer of the same composition. Place the sample, immersed in the buffer, in an autoclavable container (e.g., polypropylene bottle), leaving the lid slightly open to allow for pressure relief. Autoclave the samples in the alkaline buffer on liquid sterilization mode, at a temperature of 121°C, for 1 hr. During this and subsequent steps, the sample will expand visibly.\n3. Let the sample cool down to room temperature and wash twice, each time for 15 min, with PBS.\n4. Incubate the sample with primary antibodies in 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 plus 5% (v/v) normal donkey serum in PBS (blocking buffer) on a shaker at low speed overnight at room temperature or 4°C.\nThe serum in the blocking buffer should be from the animal host of the secondary antibodies, so other types of sera should be used instead of the normal donkey serum if the secondary antibodies are from other animals.\n5. Remove the primary antibody solution and wash four times, each time for 30 min, with blocking buffer.\n6. Incubate the sample with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody of choice in the blocking buffer on a shaker at low speed overnight at room temperature or 4°C.\n7. Remove the secondary antibody solution and wash four times, each time for 30 min, with blocking buffer.\n8. Replace the buffer with PBS for storage (for up to several weeks), if desired. Expand to the final factor of ∼4.5× with three 20-min washes in water, and then proceed with imaging (see Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0008]).\nFor more detail on how to perform specific steps above, e.g., regarding sample handling, refer to corresponding steps in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002].",
    "For the variation of proExM illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0001]C (post-expansion staining proExM), any dye conjugated to the secondary antibody should be compatible with the protocol, as the dye is only administered at the end of the process.\nFor the variations of proExM illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0001]A,B (pre-expansion staining proExM), most fluorescent proteins are compatible with the previously described basic proExM protocols (see Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0001]b of Tillberg et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0013]). For example, β-barrel (e.g., GFP-like) fluorescent proteins are protease resistant and can survive ProK digestion quite well (e.g., >50% fluorescence retention for many fluorescent proteins), but non-β-barrel fluorescent proteins (e.g., infrared fluorescent proteins based on bacteriophytochromes) are degraded by the ProK step. For antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dyes, most dyes are compatible with the basic proExM protocols (e.g., >40% fluorescence retention) except for the cyanine-family dyes (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0001]c of Tillberg et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0013]). Cyanine-family dyes, such as Cy3, Cy5, and Alexa Fluor 647, are degraded during the polymerization reactions. For far-red dyes, accordingly, we recommend Atto 647N or CF 633.",
    "ExFISH enables expansion microscopy of RNA by using a small-molecule linker, which we call LabelX, to covalently anchor endogenous RNA molecules within specimens to the swellable gel of ExM. LabelX is analogous to AcX in proExM, but enables RNA molecules to be interrogated after expansion using RNA FISH.

Remove the preincubation MOPS buffer and add LabelX in MOPS buffer to the fixed cultured cells. For cells grown in the removable-chamber cover glass, use 80 μl of LabelX in MOPS buffer. For cells grown in Nunc Lab-Tek chambered cover glasses, use a volume of 120 μl. Incubate overnight at 37°C. Afterwards, wash twice with PBS at room temperature for 5 min each.\nAt this stage, the cells can be temporarily stored at 4°C in PBS for up to a week.\nGelation\nThe Grace removable-chamber cover glass has an upper structure that can be removed with a chamber cover glass removal tool (Sigma, cat. no.

After removal of the chamber, a 1-mm silicone spacer remains with the cover glass and can be used to cast the gel (protocol described below, as well as in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002]). If cells are grown on a coverslip, then a chamber can be made using coverslip spacers (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002]). If cells are grown in Nunc Lab-Tek chambered cover glasses, we have found that the bottom coverslip along with its 1-mm gasket can be removed from the rest of the plate, and used to cast the gel.",
    "The gelation of fixed cultured cells for ExFISH is different from that of other ExM variants because VA-044, instead of APS, is used as a polymerization initiator. We found that the use of APS/TEMED yields a dim auto-fluorescent background that is significant in the context of smFISH, where the signals themselves are extremely dim. VA-044 is preferable because its use results in minimal auto-fluorescence, which is ideal for smFISH imaging. However, VA-044 has a higher decomposition temperature, and leads to a slower polymerization process. As a result, inhibition due to ambient oxygen can affect gel formation. We have found that degassing followed by perfusion with nitrogen displaces oxygen dissolved in the gelling solution and facilitates gel formation. Therefore, gelation is carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in a humidified chamber, which provides a nitrogen-filled environment and minimizes evaporation.\nWe typically use a Tupperware container, but any container that provides an airtight seal can be used for the humidified chamber (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0007]). We create two holes in the lid of the Tupperware using a syringe needle. To make the chamber humidified, we add a small amount of water to the bottom of the Tupperware. We position an empty 24-well plastic bottom plate at the very bottom of the Tupperware to provide a raised platform onto which we place the cover glass with the cells and gelling solution; the water level should be much lower than the height of the 24-well plate so that the sample being gelled is kept well above the water.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b047e687-deba-4ff3-a414-20d5bf1ef111/cpcb56-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",

Prepare gelling solution for ExFISH as follows.\nDilute the VA-044 to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) in monomer solution (i.e., dilute the stock 1:50 in monomer solution). For example, to prepare 1 ml of gelling solution, add 20 μl of VA-044 solution and 40 μl of water to 940 μl of monomer solution.\nThe gelling solution should be prepared at 4°C, and used for the next step immediately.",

Make sure the Parafilm surface is flat, clean, and free of folds. The Parafilm prevents the gel from sticking to the lid when removing the lid in later steps. Remove the cover glass from the desiccator and immediately place the Parafilm glass slide directly on top of the cover glass. Any excess gelling solution might spill out to the sides. Proceed to the following steps without delay.\n11. Place the cover glass onto the plastic platform in the humidified chamber. Seal the chamber (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0007]A,B).\n12. Remove the tape covering the holes. Connect the inlet of the nitrogen line to a syringe tip and insert the tip through one hole (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0007]C). Slowly, turn on the nitrogen flow regulator to flush nitrogen into the chamber. Increase the flow until you can feel the airflow coming out of the other hole. Flush the chamber with nitrogen for 10 min. When done, remove the inlet and immediately seal both holes with tape again (e.g., Kapton Tape or Scotch Tape).",
    "13. Place the chamber in a 60°C incubator for 2 hr to initiate the gelation (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0007]D). Be careful not to tilt or shake the chamber during the transfer and the gelation.\nDigestion\n14. When gelation is finished, take the humidified chamber out of the 60°C incubator and remove the cover glass. Using a razor blade, gently pry open the Parafilm-covered lid from the top of the wells. For the Grace Biolabs removable-chamber cover glass, gently remove the black silicone gasket by peeling it off using your hands or a pair of forceps. For the Lab-Tek chambered cover glass, do not attempt to remove the plastic gasket. At this point, you will see that gels will have formed in the individual wells on the cover glass.",
    "15. For digestion, place the cover glass in a Nunc 4-well rectangular plate. Prepare digestion buffer with proteinase K as described in Reagents and Solutions. Add 6 ml of digestion buffer to the well containing the cover glass (if using any other container, add digestion buffer at at least 10 times the gel volume to completely cover the cover glass and gels). Make sure the gel is entirely immersed for at least 2 to 3 hr until it naturally peels off from the sample cover glass (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0002]F). If a removable-chamber cover glass is used, use a diamond scribe to separate each sample and its corresponding piece of the cover glass, by scribing the cover glass and breaking each piece of glass off bearing its piece of gel. Note that the cell culture substrate is placed so that the gel is on top of the substrate and the cultured cells are at the bottom surface of the gel. Optionally, the detached cell substrate can be carefully removed using forceps, to just leave the cell-containing gel in the digestion buffer.\n16. Leave the gel immersed in the digestion buffer overnight at room temperature in the dark.\nStorage and expansion\n17. After digestion, gels can be expanded (temporarily, see below) in a petri dish, or any container large enough to hold the gels. To fully expand, wash gels with excess volume nuclease-free water three times with at least 1 hr per wash. Also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0001].\nsmFISH staining of cultured cells after expansion",
    "18. Since the gels formed in either of the above chambered cover glasses have a thickness of ∼1 mm before expansion, the thickness of the expanded gels needs to be cut down to facilitate efficient diffusion of FISH probes through the gel. To shave down fully expanded gels to a thickness of 1 mm, we use 1-mm-thick microscope glass slides as spacers as follows. Prepare a large plastic dish to use as a cutting board. We often use the plastic covers of Nunc 4-well rectangular plates, although any similarly sized flat plastic surface will work. Use a small amount of epoxy to glue two 1-mm-thick glass microscope slides on their flat slide onto the plastic surface. Position the two glass slides such that they are aligned along their longest dimension with a 2.5- to 3-cm space in between. Allow the epoxy to harden.\n19. Position a fully expanded gel in between the two glass slides on the plastic cover. The expanded gel should fit in between the two glass slides. If not, trim the gel with a razor blade. Position the gel such that the side of the gel with cultured cells is facing the bottom.\n20. Place a razor blade across the glass slides so that it bridges the slides. Carefully slide the razor blade along the glass slides and through the gel to shave off everything except the bottom 1 mm of the gel containing the cells.\n21. Carefully collect the shaved gel at the bottom containing the fixed and expanded cells and move it to PBS. If needed, at this point, shaved gels can be stored in PBS at 4°C for up to 1 month.",
    "22. Proceed to smFISH staining, which can be performed in any container, though we often use glass bottom 24-well plates for the convenience of imaging right after staining.\n23. Prepare gels by incubating with wash buffer (WA-10) for 30 min at room temperature.\n24. Prepare probes by diluting in smFISH hybridization buffer at the concentration indicated by the vendor for smFISH. We typically carry out the hybridization at a total probe concentration of 100 nM. Vortex to mix.\n25. Remove the wash buffer from the gels. Add the hybridization buffer with probes onto the gels. Add enough volume to completely cover the gel to be stained (for 24-well plates, we recommend 300 µl). Incubate overnight (or for >6 hr) at 37°C.\n26. Wash gels twice with excess volume (e.g., 500 μl for 24-well plates) of WA-10 at 37°C with 30 min per wash.\n27. Wash once with excess volume of PBS at 37°C for 30 min.\n28. Imaging can be performed in PBS or any other buffer of choice [expansion factor is determined by salt concentration: using regular PBS results in ∼2× expansion; using 0.02× PBS (diluted in water) results in ∼3× expansion while still preserving hybridization].\nAn example with HeLa cells is shown in Figure 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0008]. Refer to Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0008] for how to image expanded gels in the most common microscope setups. While the quality of the acquired image will depend on the imaging setup, wide-field imaging is generally recommended over confocal imaging due to the photobleaching of smFISH stains observed during confocal imaging.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7e7b8d37-96a2-4cfe-afa1-e5a98a5fd462/cpcb56-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8",

    "The protocol for performing ExFISH in tissues is different from the cultured cell protocol in a few key aspects. First, the tissue ExFISH protocol requires signal amplification after performing FISH, because conventional smFISH is too dim for confocal imaging and similar 3-D imaging techniques needed for tissues. As a result, we use the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to amplify the signal from FISH probes. Second, the gelling procedure is more similar to that described in the proExM protocol for tissues (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002]) than to the procedure for cultured cells. Third, higher concentrations of LabelX are used, because better RNA retention yields are observed in tissues at higher concentrations. Finally, after Label-X treatment, it is possible to use AcX to retain fluorescent proteins.\nMaterials\nNuclease-free water\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Current Protocols, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0006])\n4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS\n70% (v/v) ethanol in nuclease-free water\nMOPS buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-rec-0011])\nLabelX (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-rec-0009])\nWash buffer for HCR-FISH (WA-20; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-rec-0016])\nHCR-FISH hybridization buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-rec-0016])\nHCR-FISH probe design: probes for HCR-FISH are designed using Stellaris Probe Designer software from LGC Biosearch Technologies. 22-bp binding sequences spaced 2 bp apart are designed using the software. We often aim for at least 20 sequences targeting each transcript of interest. To design HCR-FISH probes, HCR initiator sequences (Choi, Beck, & Pierce, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0004]) are appended to each binding sequence via a 2-base spacer (AA). The initiator sequences can be appended to either the 5′ end or 3′ end of each binding sequence depending on the orientation of the initiator sequences; I1 initiators are appended to the 5′ end while I2 initiators are appended to the 3′ end. The HCR-FISH probes generated by this procedure are 60 bp in final length.\nAmplification buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-rec-0002])",

Below is a perfusion fixation and slicing protocol for mouse brain slices that has demonstrated consistent results.\n1. Transcardially perfuse the mouse brain (Chen et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0002]) with ice-cold PBS (5 to 10 ml) followed by ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (∼30 ml).\n2. Post-fix the brain in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C.\n3. Wash the brain with PBS for 30 min once, before cutting slices.\n4. Cut brain slices on a vibratome (Chen et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0002]) in PBS.\nThe thickness of slices should be less than 200 µm to allow for efficient staining with FISH probes after expansion.\n5. Slices can be stored in PBS if they are used immediately (within 1 to 2 days), or stored in 70% (v/v) ethanol in nuclease-free water for longer times at 4°C.\nLabelX treatment, gelation, and digestion of tissues and tissue slices\n6. If tissues or tissue slices were stored in 70% (v/v) ethanol in nuclease-free water, rehydrate by washing twice with PBS for 15 min per wash at room temperature. Otherwise, proceed with the rest of the protocol.\n7. Pre-incubate tissues or tissue slices with 20 mM MOPS buffer for 30 min.\n8. Prepare LabelX by diluting in 20 mM MOPS buffer at a final Label-IT amine concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (i.e., a 1:10 dilution from the LabelX stock solution).",
    "9. Remove the pre-incubation MOPS buffer and add LabelX in MOPS buffer to the slices. For convenience, tissues or tissue slices can be processed in 24-well or 48-well plates. Use enough volume to cover the slices: for example, in a 24-well plate, four 50-µm sections can be incubated together in 250 µl of solution.\n10. Incubate tissues or tissue slices with LabelX in MOPS overnight at 37°C. Afterwards, wash twice with PBS for 15 min per round.\n11. Optional: To retain fluorescent proteins in tissue slices from transgenic specimens, it is possible to do an additional incubation with AcX. Incubate slices with 0.05 mg/ml AcX in PBS at room temperature for at least 6 hr. Wash twice with PBS for 15 min per wash.\n12. Proceed to gelation and digestion as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-prot-0002].\nUnlike the ExFISH gelation procedure for cultured cells, here, gelation with APS/TEMED can be carried out as in the proExM protocol because signal amplification with HCR renders the dim auto-fluorescence that arises from APS/TEMED negligible.\n13. After digestion, wash gels with PBS twice, each time for 30 min. Gels can be stored in the dark in PBS at 4°C after this step for up to 2 months.\nStaining gelled slices with HCR-FISH\nWhile staining can be performed in any chamber, we often use 24-well plates.\n14. Prepare gels by incubating with wash buffer (WA-20) for 30 min at room temperature.\n15. Prepare probes by diluting in HCR-FISH hybridization buffer at the desired concentration (∼1 nM per probe). Vortex to mix.\n16. Remove the wash buffer from the gels. Add the hybridization buffer with probes onto the gels. Add enough volume to completely cover the gel to be stained (for 24-well plates, 300 µl per well). Incubate overnight at 37°C.",
    "17. Wash gels twice with excess volume (e.g., 500 µl for 24-well plates) of WA-20 at 37°C for 30 min per wash. For slices thicker than 100 µm before gelation, increase wash times to 45 min per wash.\n18. Wash once with excess volume PBS at 37°C for 2 hr.\n19. Wash once with excess volume of PBS at room temperature for 2 hr. For slices thicker than 100 µm before gelation, increase wash time to 4 hr. If needed, after this step, gels stained with FISH probes can be stored overnight in PBS at 4°C before HCR amplification.\nHCR amplification (adapted from Choi et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0004])\n20. Pre-incubate slices with amplification buffer for 30 min at room temperature.\n21. Prepare fluorescently labeled hairpins by snap cooling each hairpin (heat to 95°C for 90 sec, then cool to room temperature in a drawer for 30 min). For each 500 µl of total amplification buffer to be used (in the next step, we use 150 µl amplification buffer per well of a 48-well plate or 250 µl per well of a 24 well plate), 10 µl of each hairpin is needed.\n22. Prepare hairpin solution by combining all snap-cooled hairpins in amplification buffer at room temperature, using the right volume of amplification buffer to get to the desired final volume. For example, to prepare 500 µl of total amplification buffer with two hairpins, add 10 µl of each hairpin to 480 µl of amplification buffer. Vortex to mix.\n23. Remove the pre-amplification solution, add the hairpin solution to the gels, and incubate 3 to 6 hr at room temperature.\n24. Stop amplification with four 30-min washes with 5× SSCT.\nExpansion and imaging",
    "25. At this point the samples can be imaged. To expand the samples, wash three times, each time for 10 min with 0.05× SSCT. The expansion factor can be tuned by altering the salt concentration; imaging can also be performed in regular PBS for ∼2× expansion.

    "Mounting an expanded ExM sample on a stable surface can help prevent the sample from drifting during imaging, which is important for obtaining high-quality images. The best mounting method will depend on the geometries of your microscope and the sample holder (coverslip, Petri dish, or well of a multiwell plate, for example), as well as your imaging requirements such as imaging time and the objective type and magnification.\nFor a quick inspection (<5 min) of the expanded samples using an inverted or upright microscope with a dry objective, there is typically no need for sample mounting. You can use a pipet to temporarily (<5 min) remove the liquid around the gel to prevent it from floating or sliding away.\nFor long-term (>5 min) imaging or imaging that requires minimal sample drift (e.g., obtaining a z-stack), you might want to mount the sample by physically attaching the expanded samples to the sample holder. In the following sections, we describe three common mounting methods: agarose, poly-L-lysine, and superglue. For inverted microscopes, you can use poly-L-lysine to mount the gel to a stable surface. For upright microscopes, you can use agarose, poly-L-lysine, or superglue. For light-sheet microscopes, you can use superglue or poly-L-lysine.",
    "The advantage of the poly-L-lysine method is that it provides a transparent interface between the gel and the surface of the sample holder. Therefore, it is suitable for microscope configurations that require imaging through the sample holder, such as an inverted microscope. In comparison, agarose can introduce optical scattering and aberration, and superglue is not transparent after curing. The advantage of the agarose method is that you can retrieve your sample after imaging, as the sample mounting is reversible. The sample can be shrunk (and then separated from the agarose) by placing in high-salt buffer after imaging. The advantage of the superglue method is its strong adhesion compared with the other methods. It is suitable for long-term imaging on an upright microscope or a light-sheet microscope, even for days.\nSample mounting with poly-L-lysine\n5a. Coverslips, glass-bottom dishes, and glass-bottom multi-well plates can be used as sample holders. Slides or plastic multi-well plates can also be used, but the thickness of the sample holder may limit the choice of objectives and/or cause aberrations on inverted microscopes.\n6a. Clean the surface of the sample holder by rinsing with water and then ethanol. After rinsing, let the holder dry in air.\n7a. Soak the glass surface with 0.1% (w/v) poly-L-lysine in water for 20 min.\n8a. Remove the 0.1% (w/v) poly-L-lysine solution and rinse the coated glass surface with water three times.\n9a. Air-dry the glass surface for 1 hr in a clean environment or use nitrogen gas to blow-dry the surface.\n10a. Use a coverslip and forceps to pick up and transfer the expanded gel to the poly-L-lysine-modified glass surface, as follows.\n         \nFirst, remove most of the liquid around the gel. Then place a clean coverslip next to the gel and use a paintbrush to slide the gel onto the coverslip.",
    "Next, lift the coverslip (with the gel on top) out of its container with a pair of forceps.\nBefore transferring the gel to the poly-L-lysine-modified surface, the gel surface that is to be attached needs to be dried for good adhesion. You can use a small piece of a Kimwipe to wick away excess liquid. Start absorbing excess liquid from the sides of the gel and then carefully use, for example, the tip of the paper wipe to absorb the liquid in between the bottom of the gel and the coverslip.\nUse the paintbrush to slide the gel off of the coverslip onto the poly-L-lysine-modified surface. Be aware of the orientation of the gel in the context of your later microscopy work: for example, the side facing toward the sample holder will be more easily reached by the objective (e.g., within the objective working distance) on an inverted setup. In contrast, on an upright microscopy setup, the side facing away from the sample holder will be more accessible to the objective. Therefore, if the region of interest is closer to one particular side of the gel, place that side closer to the objective when mounting the sample. This practice becomes important for expanded samples, as the sample thickness and the gel thickness are scaled up by the expansion factor.\nThis gel transfer should be carried out in a timely manner to avoid dehydration of the gel: we recommend finishing this step within 5 min.\n11a. After the mounting, immediately add a small amount of water (or diluted PBS for ExFISH samples) to keep the gel hydrated and avoid gel shrinkage.\nSample mounting with agarose",
    "5b. Coverslips, glass-bottom dishes, and glass-bottom multi-well plates can be used as sample holders. Slides or plastic multi-well plates can also be used, but the thickness of the sample holder will limit the choice of objectives and/or cause aberrations on inverted microscopes.\n6b. Prepare 0.5% (w/v) low-melting agarose solution in the correct imaging medium. For example, for proExM samples, prepare 0.5% (w/v) agarose in water. For ExFISH samples, prepare 0.5% (w/v) agarose in diluted PBS or other buffers of your choice. Keep the agarose solution warm in a 40°C water bath to avoid premature hardening. If hardened, use a short microwave cycle (10 to 20 sec) to melt the agarose solution. Alternatively, heating it to ∼60°C will re-melt it as well.\n7b. Transfer the expanded gel to the sample holder of choice (e.g., coverslips and glass-bottom dishes). During the transfer, remove and wick away liquid from the expanded gel (see step 10a, above).\n8b. Using a pipet, carefully apply the melted agarose solution onto the edges of the gel. If necessary, you can also embed the entire gel in agarose, using the melted agarose solution.\n9b. Wait for the agarose to harden at room temperature or at 4°C, and then add a small amount of water (or diluted PBS for ExFISH samples) to prevent dehydration.\n10b. After imaging is complete, you can place the mounted sample in high-salt buffer such as PBS. This will shrink the gel but not the agarose. Using paintbrushes or forceps, you can separate the gel from the agarose. The gel can be then stored in PBS for later use.\nSample mounting with superglue",
    "5c. Coverslips, glass-bottom dishes and glass-bottom multi-well plates can be used as sample holders. Slides or plastic multi-well plates can also be used. However, since the superglue turns opaque upon curing, this mounting method is not compatible with inverted microscopes that require imaging through the sample holder.\n6c. Clean the surface of the sample holder by rinsing with water and then ethanol. After rinsing, let the holder dry in air.\n7c. Apply superglue to the surface of the sample holder. Only apply the glue to the area where the gel should be attached. Also make sure excessive superglue is removed by paper wipes, leaving only a thin layer.\n8c. Transfer the expanded gel to the sample holder of choice. Before the transfer, remove and wick away liquid from the expanded gel (see step 10a).\n9c. Once the gel is placed on the glue, wait for 20 to 30 sec for the superglue to cure before adding water (or diluted PBS for ExFISH samples) to hydrate the gel.\nAfter curing, there should be an opaque interface between the gel and the superglue.\nImaging ExM samples with inverted microscopes (e.g., inverted spinning disk confocal microscopes)\nA typical inverted microscope setup is shown in Figure 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0010]. The poly-L-lysine mounting method is recommended for inverted microscopes, since the transparent interface between the gel and the poly-L-lysine modified surface will allow for imaging through the sample holder.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c9b2c67b-a97b-49a0-ae00-def976b09e43/cpcb56-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10",

(C) Typical imaging setup on an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope with a glass-bottom multi-well plate.\nFor imaging on an inverted microscope, we recommend starting with low-magnification (4× or 10×) objectives to find the region of interest first, and then switching to high-magnification objectives. Air objectives are typically low-magnification objectives (e.g., 4× or 10×) and can be used at the beginning to find the samples and the regions of interest. For high-magnification imaging (>20×), we recommend using water-immersion objectives to avoid aberrations caused by refractive index mismatch between the aqueous mounting medium and the coverslip or oil. Due to the generally short working distances, oil-immersion objectives can be considered for use mainly when the expanded gel is mounted close (within ∼10 μm) to the coverslip and when the specimen or object of interest is close to the objective (such as in cultured cells or thin tissues). The working distance of the objective is typically not an issue for thin samples such as cultured cells, if the gel is properly mounted on the sample holder (i.e., the sample side of the gel is mounted facing the objective side using the poly-L-lysine method). For some tissue samples, however, the working distance becomes an issue when imaging deep into the gel (e.g., >300 µm). In this case, long-working distance water-immersion objectives are recommended. As with every microscopy experiment, make sure the correction collar on the objective (if applicable) is adjusted to match the thickness of the coverslips.",
    "Many of the wide-field and confocal microscopes used in biology labs and imaging facilities are inverted microscopes. We have found that spinning-disk confocal microscopes offer a good combination of resolution and speed, and are highly suitable for fast nanoscale imaging of expanded tissues. Laser-scanning confocal microscopes can be used most effectively for high signal-to-background imaging of thin and small samples such as cultured cells.\nImaging with upright microscopes\nFor upright microscopes, any of the three mounting methods, poly-L-lysine, agarose, or superglue, can be used. If you plan to retrieve your sample after imaging, we recommend the agarose mounting method. In the other two methods, the gel is physically attached to the sample holder, but can potentially be cut free using a razor blade if the sample needs to be retrieved (note that this process can damage the sample, if you are not careful). For long-term imaging (e.g., over a few days), we recommend using the superglue mounting method, as it offers the strongest adhesion to the sample holder. The poly-L-lysine method gives a transparent interface between the gel and the sample holder and thus can be imaged on an inverted microscope, too. For imaging on an upright microscope, we recommend starting with low-magnification (4× or 10×) objectives to find the region of interest first, and then switching to high-magnification objectives, which is similar to the procedure on an inverted microscope. For high-magnification imaging (>20×), we recommend using water-dipping or water-immersion objectives, as the gel is immersed in aqueous mounting medium.\nImaging with microscopes with the sample hanging from above (e.g., light-sheet microscopes)",
    "Light-sheet microscopes are suitable for imaging of expanded tissue samples at high speeds, using long-working-distance objectives. To accommodate the objectives, some light-sheet microscopes hang the samples from above. For example, a typical imaging setup of a light-sheet microscope (Zeiss Z.1 light-sheet microscope) is shown in Figure 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0011]. The Z.1 light-sheet microscope uses a rod to hang samples from above the objectives, perpendicular to the microscope's light path. The sample is then enclosed in an imaging chamber filled with aqueous mounting medium. For expanded ExM samples, a thin coverslip can be used as the backing to physically support the gel, and then the coverslip backing can be attached to the rod through a small 3-D-printed adapter, which is available for download at our Web resource http://expansionmicroscopy.org[href=http://expansionmicroscopy.org]. To attach the gel to the coverslip backing, we recommend the superglue mounting method, as it most strongly attaches the gel to the coverslip. Poly-L-lysine mounting can be also used for short-term imaging, but we have observed detachment of the gel if the mounting is not properly performed (e.g., due to expired poly-L-lysine, fast stage movements, or inadequate water removal from the gel before placement). After mounting the gel to the coverslip backing, the coverslip backing can be attached to the adapter with superglue. The adapter is designed to match the dents at the end of the rod so it can be mechanically fixed to the rod.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7403081a-a55a-453b-8e88-c5597a50b42d/cpcb56-fig-0011-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 11",

(A) Schematics showing configurations of the objectives and the mounted sample on a commercial light-sheet microscope (Zeiss Z.1 light-sheet). The green and red arrows show the excitation and emission light, respectively. Note that the gel is facing the objective and is mounted on a coverslip as the backing, which is glued onto a 3-D-printed adapter that is connected to the sample holder rod hanging from the top (the rod is not shown in the schematic). The sample is immersed in water or diluted buffer, and the excitation light sheet travels through the sides of the gel perpendicular to the detection objective focal axis.

Two illumination objectives are on the side to form the excitation light sheets, and a water-immersion objective is located perpendicular to the illumination objectives for the imaging.

The two side glass windows allow the light sheet to illuminate the sample, and the front glass window is used for rough sample alignment using a small camera.

    "On the Zeiss Z.1 light-sheet microscope, we typically use a 1.0 NA, 20× long-working-distance water-immersion objective for high-resolution imaging. If the imaging volume is large and requires a long imaging time, we can use lower-magnification objectives (5×) to obtain a low-resolution, quick overview of the sample. The Z.1 light-sheet microscope is suitable for imaging large, multi-color samples with its two-camera setup, fast image acquisition, and capability of capturing two color channels simultaneously. In addition, the long working distance of the objective can be used to image large transparent samples. These specifications of the Z.1 light-sheet microscope are particularly advantageous for imaging ExM samples.\nWe first demonstrated these advantages by imaging a ∼575 × 575 × 160–µm volume (∼6 × 1010 voxels in three colors) of a HCR-ExFISH sample in about ∼3 hr, with a resolution capable of resolving single RNA puncta within the expanded tissue (Fig. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0011]D-F; Chen et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-bib-0003]). Even larger samples in the millimeter range have been successfully imaged with this system. One such example is shown in Figure 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0011]G, in which a subregion of a mouse hippocampus infected with a Brainbow 3.0 AAV virus (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.56#cpcb56-fig-0005]) was expanded with a proExM protocol described earlier. The imaging volume was ∼1.5 × 0.8 × 0.1 mm in pre-expansion units, and the dataset required stitching of 180 individual 3-D image stacks, resulting in a 5 Terabyte, 0.7 Teravoxel dataset with an effective lateral pixel size of about 60 nm."
