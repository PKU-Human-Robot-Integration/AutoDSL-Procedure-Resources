    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTypical parameters are listed in the following table for growing silica nanowires by high-temperature tubular furnace equipment.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1333_1.csv\nCritical: Hydrogen is combustible. Hence, a gas sensor is required to monitor the hydrogen concentration in the environment.\nAlternatives: A vacuum system with high-temperature heating capabilities is an alternative for furnaces. In addition, H2 and Ar gases can be replaced by other gases (e.g., N2) (Shalav et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) as long as traces of oxygen can be controlled for the active oxidation mechanism.\nNanowire growth\nTiming: 2 h\nFigure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows a schematic and photograph of the system used for growing silica nanowires in a high-temperature furnace. The tubular quartz tube is 2.5 mm in diameter and 100 cm in length. The maximum temperature is ∼1050°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1333-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental setup of the furnace system to grow silica nanowires\n(A) Schematic and (B) photograph.\nAfter precleaning and Pt deposition, stack the samples layer by layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and place them at the center of the furnace. The operating procedures are as follows:\nThe reaction gases include H2 and Ar. The flow rate ratio affects the growth rate of nanowires. Typically, set H2 and Ar gases at flow rates of 70 and 40 sccm, respectively, on the metal foil samples.\nSet the working pressure during the process at 5 Torr.\nAfter pressure stabilization, heat the chamber to a growth temperature of 830°C. The heating duration, adjusted from 0 to 60 min, determines the length of the nanowires.\nAfter growing the nanowires, cool the furnace system to 510°C under Ar and H2 flow. Then, turn off H2 for subsequent cooling. When the temperature reaches 200°C, stop Ar gas flow, and remove the samples. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] shows a schematic of the temperature-time profile with typical gas flow rates.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1333-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Schematic of the temperature-time and gas flow rate profile for silica nanowires grown on steel foil\nSurface treatment\nTiming: 2 h\nThe as-prepared nanowire samples have superhydrophilic properties, which offer substrates with antifogging properties (Tsai and Shieh, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). We use tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyltrichlorosilane (F13-TCS) to modify surfaces with a low-energy molecule, which makes the surfaces superhydrophobic (Beck et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The chlorosilanes connect covalently to the silica substrates, providing a stable surface with low surface energy.\nFigure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] shows the surface modification experiment performed by injecting 5-μL F13-TCS into the inverted Petri dish at 210°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1333-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Photograph to show the experiment of F13-TCS treatment on the sample\nDeposit a water drop on the surface of the sample to confirm the success of the F13-TCS treatment. Successful treatments cause the water droplets to stand on the surface.\nNote: F13-TCS reacts with water. Hence, before injecting F13-TCS into the Petri dish, the hot plate must be set above the boiling point of F13-TCS (192°C) to keep the substrate surface dry."
