    "Cell culture and transfectionHela cell passageHela cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (hitherto referred to as DMEM10).Remove the DMEM10 culture medium from the 100 mm Petri cell culture dish when cell density reaches approximately 80%.Wash the Petri dish three times with 1.5 mL of PBS. Remove the PBS.Slowly add 1 mL of trypsin, and place the dish back into the incubator at 37°C for 1 min.Remove the trypsin. Add 2–3 mL of DMEM10 culture medium. Pipette the medium several times to help the cells detach. Transfer the medium containing cells to a 15 mL tube.Seed ~25,000 cells into a 35 mm glass bottom Petri dish, and add DMEM10 culture medium up to 1.5 mL.Place the dish containing cells back in the incubator. Incubate the cells at 37°C for 24 h before transfection, staining, or UPLaS experiments.Cell transfectionDilute 1 μg of DNA (CEPIA-3mt, Parkin-mCherry, or LC3-GFP) in 200 μL of jetPRIME buffer.Vortex for 10 s and spin down.Add 2 μL of jetPRIME reagent (DNA/jetPRIME ratio 1:2).Vortex for 1 s, spin down, and incubate at room temperature (RT) for 10 min.Add the transfection mix to the cells cultured in 2 mL of DMEM10 culture medium in a 35 mm Petri dish.Replace DMEM10 culture medium with 2 mL of fresh DMEM10 culture medium 4 h after transfection.Check transfection efficiency 24–48 h after transfection. Normally, select several fields of view (FOV) by fluorescence microscopy, the transfection is ideal when 60–80% of cells have been transfected successfully.Note: According to the actual transfection efficiency and cell density, 1–3 μg of DNA can be added, while maintaining the DNA/jetPRIME ratio previously used. The culture and transfection procedures for SH-SY5Y cells are the same as that of Hela cells. The SH-SY5Y full serum culture medium (MEM/F12-10 culture medium) contains 43.",
    "5 mL of MEM, 43.5 mL of Ham’s F-12 Nutrient Mix, 10 mL of FBS, 1 mL of GlutaMAX, 1 mL of Sodium Pyruvate, 1 mL of MEM NEAA, and 1 mL of (1×) Penicillin/Streptomycin. The culture medium for SH-SY5Y cells in all culture and transfection steps is MEM/F12-10. Setting up the UPLaS systemThis UPLaS system consists of a commercial confocal microscope and a femtosecond laser. In Figure 2, a fiber femtosecond laser (1,030 nm, 1 MHz, 220 fs, 1 W) is incorporated into the excitation path of a confocal system.Turn on the confocal microscope.Fix the Galvo to the center of the FOV.Turn on the femtosecond laser.Note: Please set the femtosecond laser power at a low level (~50 mW, tested between Shutter and RM3 by a laser power meter) for the process of adjusting the optical path. Use the reflective mirrors (RM1 and RM2, shown in Figure 2B) to direct the femtosecond laser beam through a mechanical shutter. Open the shutter.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4369/bioprotoc-12-07-4369-g002.jpgFigure 2. The photostimulation scheme established on a femtosecond laser coupling into a confocal microscope. (A) Optical paths of (B) the UPLaS system. The femtosecond laser is aligned into the microscope scanning system through RM4 and RM5, to form a UPLaS system. A CCD camera is used to provide a bright-felid image to align the optical path. DM = dichroic mirror, RM = reflective mirror. The wavelength of confocal scanning laser is 488 nm/532 nm, and the typical collection wavelength interval of fluorescence is <560 nm/560–625 nm/> 625 nm. The fiber femtosecond laser (1,030 nm, 120 fs, 50 MHz, 1 W) can be replaced by a Ti = Sapphire laser (810 nm, 80 MHz, 65 fs, 1 W), or other commercial femtosecond laser oscillators.Steer RM4 and RM5 to make the femtosecond laser beam coincide with the scanning laser beam.",
    "Measure the transmission efficiency of the objective of the femtosecond laser.Note: It will use the power at specimen to illustrate the related experiment procedures below. Turn off the shutter, femtosecond laser, and confocal microscope until experiments start.Notes:  The shutter is synchronized with the confocal scanning process. It opens at the pre-designed time which is set through the confocal imaging controlling software. The stimulation area can be pre-assigned manually in the confocal imaging controlling software to any form like line, polygon, or circle. Thus, the sample is only stimulated by the femtosecond laser when the confocal scanning process enters a given imaging frame. Along with femtosecond laser stimulation, confocal microscopy provides continuous cell imaging to monitor molecular dynamics in real time. It can be replaced by a Ti: Sapphire laser or other commercial femtosecond oscillators in the NIR range. The laser power and some other photostimulation parameters need to be tuned because the optical parameters (pulse width, wavelength, and repetition rate) vary a lot in different femtosecond lasers, which thus induce different multiphoton excitation efficiencies. Especially if the wavelength is changed, the power needs to be adjusted carefully. Our experience is that, if the wavelength reaches 800 nm, the power needs to be reduced a lot. If the wavelength is as short as 700 nm, the cells will be extremely sensitive, and this is not recommended.

Synchronize the shutter of femtosecond laser with the confocal scanning according to the predefined photostimulation area, which is only open when the laser scanning drops in the stimulation frame, and closes immediately when it goes out.Set the power of the femtosecond laser to 8 mW (1,030 nm) at the sample.Set the scanning and stimulation time sequence.Scan the targeted cells during Pre-UPLaS CM and Post-UPLaS CM with a 473 nm laser.
