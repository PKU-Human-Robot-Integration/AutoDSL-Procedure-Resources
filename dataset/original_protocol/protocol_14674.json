    "Use and euthanize all animals in accordance with institutional and governmental guidelines and regulations, most commonly via CO2 inhalation and cervical dislocation.\n1. Preparation of Reagents\nNOTE: Prior to beginning, prepare all reagents using analytical grade chemicals. Make solutions using molecular grade distilled and deionized water unless otherwise specified.\nPhosphate buffered saline (1x PBS): Make 1 L of 1x PBS by dissolving 8g NaCl, 0.2g KCl, 1.44g Na2HPO4 and 0.24g KH2PO4 in 1 L of H2O. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl. PBS does not need to be sterile and can be stored at RT. Note that this buffer is made without CaCl2 or MgCl2.\nParaformaldehyde (4% PFA): Prepare a 4% solution of PFA in 1x PBS in a ventilated fume hood. Add 40g of paraformaldehyde powder to 1 L of 1x PBS. To dissolve, stir and heat to approximately 60 °C, and slowly add NaOH drop wise to raise the pH. Once the powder has dissolved, readjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl. Filter through a 0.45 µM filter and freeze aliquots. Defrost a fresh aliquot for each experiment.\nTriton buffer: Prepare a 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 solution by dissolving 8.77 g NaCl in 1 L of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Add 1 ml Triton X-100. Stir to dissolve. Store Triton buffer at RT.\nTriton block: Prepare 10% goat serum in Triton buffer by adding 1 ml of goat serum to 9 ml of Triton buffer. Store at 4 °C. If using primary antibodies raised in mouse, add goat anti-mouse IgG Fab fragments at a dilution of 1 in 200 to the Triton block for the blocking step.\n\tNOTE: If planning to use samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), prepare additional reagents as listed below.",
    "Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with calcium and magnesium: Make a 1x solution of HBSS by diluting from a stock solution in sterile distilled H2O. As HBSS buffer is complicated to make and there are risks involved, it is advisable to order a premade 10x stock solution. The final concentration of HBBS buffer routinely used is the following: 1.26 mM CaCl2, 0.49 mM MgCl2-6H2O, 0.41 mM MgSO4-7H2O, 5.33 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 4.17 mM NaHCO3, 137.93 mM NaCl, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4, 5.56 mM Dextrose.\nHepes buffer: Prepare a 0.1 M Hepes solution in 1x HBSS, by dissolving 23.8 g HEPES in 1 L 1x HBSS buffer.\nScanning electron microscopy fixative (SEM Fix): Prepare fixative for SEM by diluting electron microscopy grade glutaraldehyde (2.5%) and paraformaldehyde (4%) in Hepes buffer. Add CaCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mM.\n1% Osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in Hepes buffer; 1% Osmium tetroxide in water: Dilute a stock solution of osmium tetroxide in Hepes buffer, and separately in sterile distilled H2O, to a final concentration of 1%. Osmium tetroxide is highly toxic and is most commonly sold as a 4% solution.\n1% (w/v) Tannic acid: Dissolve 0.5 g tannic acid in 50 ml sterile distilled H2O. Filter sterilize by filtering through a 0.45 pore size filter.\nGraded ethanol solution series: Dilute 200 proof ethanol with sterile distilled H2O to make 30, 50, 70, 90 and 95% ethanol solutions. For the final ethanol rinses, 100% ethanol 200 proof is required. Use a freshly opened bottle of 200 proof ethanol for the final rinses.\n2. Choice of Tissue\nIdeally, examine embryos or young pups between the ages of embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) and postnatal day 3 (P3).",
    "NOTE: Ossification of the bony labyrinth and temporal bones makes dissection progressively more challenging as mice mature. Also kinocilia, the only true microtubule-based cilium found on cochlear hair cells, retracts during development and is no longer present in adult mice.\nAfter fixation, decalcify adult cochleae. Place dissected (see section 3) bony labyrinths, into 2 ml EDTA (4.13% in PBS), pH 7.3, in a microcentrifuge tube for 3 - 4 days with rotation. Replenish EDTA daily. After the tissues have softened, rinse in 1.5 ml or more PBS 3 times for 5 min on a nutator with increased agitation.\n3. Cochlea Dissection\nPost euthanization via cervical dislocation or CO2 inhalation (100% CO2 ), remove the head. Use a scalpel blade or small pair of scissors, depending on the size of the animal, to dissect the head along the sagittal mid-line beginning at the nose and extending caudally. Remove the brain from each half of the skull with a pair of forceps. Identify the temporal bones, which contain the developing bony labyrinths of the inner ear (see arrow in Figure 1A).\nUse a pair of forceps to carefully isolate the bony labyrinths from the skull (temporal bones). Do this under a dissecting microscope. Prise away the bony tissue from the skull by running the forceps gently underneath the bony labyrinths. In animals up to P4 the bony labyrinths are still cartilaginous and can be easily removed without breaking.\nFollowing dissection, use the tip of the dissecting forceps to clear the oval and round windows and make a small hole in the apex of the cochlear spiral. Fix the bony labyrinths before further dissection of the cochlear duct. To allow for easy removal of the tectorial membrane (see 3.7), fix the bony labyrinths in 1.5 ml 4% PFA for 5 min on ice.",
    "NOTE: If removal of the tectorial membrane is not required, longer fixation is advised (see 4.1 - 4.3). Brief fixation of the temporal bones prior to dissection of the cochlear duct aids the dissection process and removal of the tectorial membrane. Post dissection and exposure of the organ of Corti, further fixation is required.\nFurther dissect the bony labyrinths to expose the cochlear sensory epithelium as follows. Place the bony labyrinths in a black silicone elastomere-coated dissecting dish containing PBS to facilitate dissection. Use minutien pins to immobilize the tissue if required. To use minutien pins, place them through the vestibular portion of the bony labyrinths with the ventral aspect of the cochlear spiral facing upwards.\n\tNOTE: Black silicone elastomere dish: Mix silicone elastomere base component with powdered charcoal to obtain an opaque black color. Add the curing agent and pour into one or more petri dishes (glass or plastic). Dry under vacuum to remove trapped air bubbles. Dry dishes completely prior to use.\nUse fine forceps (#5) to remove the outer cartilage exposing the cochlear duct. Start at the oval window; insert the bottom tip of the forceps into the oval window and gently pry open the cartilage, slowly moving upwards towards the apex.\nAfter exposure of the cochlear duct, remove the ventral surface, the Reissner's membrane. Use a fine pair of forceps to pinch the Reissner's membrane at the base of the cochlear duct and peel it off in an upward motion. Visualize the dorsal aspect of the cochlear duct, including the sensory epithelium.\nRemove the tectorial membrane as described below (optional). For SEM or immunohistochemistry of the kinocilium or stereociliary bundles remove the tectorial membrane.",
    "Use a very fine pair of forceps (#55 or finer) to pinch the tectorial membrane at the base of the cochlea and peel upwards towards the apex.\n\tNOTE: The tectorial membrane is optically clear which makes it difficult to identify. More often than not the membrane comes off in one piece and although it is not easily visualized, one can feel the resistance as it is pulled off from the exposed organ of Corti.\nAfter exposing the organ of Corti, further fix the tissue as described below. Retain the vestibular region to aid further preparation of the tissues.\n4. Fixation\nFor regular immunohistochemistry fix the dissected bony labyrinths in 1.5 ml 4% PFA at 4 °C on a nutator for 2 hr.\n\tNOTE: Because of the sensitivity of differing antibodies and antigens, variations in the length and composition of fixation may be required and should be optimized for each antibody.\nAfter fixation, wash the samples by rinsing in 1.5 ml or more PBS 3 times for 5 min on a nutator with increased agitation. Samples can be stored in PBS at 4 °C for several weeks before processing.\nIf preparing samples for SEM, fix dissected temporal bones in SEM fix (see 1.7) for 2 hr at RT. Wash by rinsing in 1.5 ml or more Hepes buffer 3 times for 5 min on a nutator with increased agitation. Store in Hepes buffer at 4 °C until further processing. Storage for longer than a couple of weeks is not recommended.\n5. Immunohistochemistry\nPerform immunohistochemistry on dissected samples in one well of a flat-bottomed 96 well plate. Alternatively, use a PCR or microcentrifuge tube. It is advisable to retain the vestibular portion of the bony labyrinth to facilitate processing.",
    "Permeabilize the tissue by incubating in 1.5 ml Triton buffer for 1 hr at RT on a nutator with gentle agitation.\nBlock the tissue by incubating in 0.5 ml Triton block for a minimum of 1 hr at RT. If using primary antibodies raised in mouse, add anti-mouse IgG Fab fragments to the block at a dilution of 1 in 200 (see section 1.4). This greatly decreases non-specific binding of anti-mouse IgG to mouse tissue.\nIncubate the tissue with primary antibodies diluted in Triton block O/N at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Antibody dilution depends on antibodies being used (see section 6.1). Alternatively incubate primary antibodies for 2 hr at RT. Ideally use a minimum volume of 0.5 ml primary antibody dilution. If antibody is limited, use the smallest volume of antibody dilution that completely envelops the tissue.\nWash the tissue by rinsing in 1.5 ml or more Triton buffer, a minimum of 3 times for 15 min, on a nutator with increased agitation.\nIncubate the tissue with fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted at the manufacturers recommended concentration (typically 1:200-1:1,000) in Triton block for 1 hr at RT on a nutator. Use a minimum volume of 0.5 ml secondary antibody dilution.\n\t\nCentrifuge the diluted secondary antibody at 13,000 x g for 3 min prior to use to minimize non-specific binding of secondary antibody aggregates. Shield the tissue from light from this step onwards to avoid photobleaching the fluorescent dyes.\nAs in step 5.5, wash the tissue by rinsing in 1.5 ml or more Triton buffer, a minimum of 3 times for 15 min, on a nutator with increased agitation. Store samples in PBS at 4 °C until ready to mount.\n6. Antibody Selection",
    "NOTE: The source of recommended antibodies and their dilutions are listed in the Table of Specific Materials and Equipment. Perform antibody incubations as described in section 5.\nTo visualize the microtubule-based kinocilium, use a ciliary axoneme marker such as anti-Arl13b (1:1,000) or anti-acetylated-α-tubulin (1:800). Visualize the basal body using an antibody against γ-tubulin (1:200) or any other centrosomal marker.\nTo visualize the actin filament-rich stereociliary bundles, add phalloidin (1:300 - 1,000) conjugated to one of several different fluorophores to the secondary antibody incubation. Phalloidin also labels other filamentous actin structures including the cortical actin filaments surrounding the periphery of each epithelial hair cell. This is helpful in determining the outline of each hair cell. Use an alternative membrane marker such as anti-Zo-1 (1:500) if necessary.\nLabel cochlear hair cells using antibodies against Myosin VI (1:1,000) or Myosin VIIa (1:1,000). These can be used if assessing cochlea length.\nNOTE: Use appropriate fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies optimized to the microscope requirements.\n7. Mounting and Imaging\nPlace the sample in a black silicone elastomere dish containing PBS. Using fine forceps, remove the vestibular region from the cochlear spiral.\nVery carefully remove the underlying cartilage and mesenchyme from the cochlear spiral. The remaining cochlear spiral contains the inner sulcus, organ of Corti and outer sulcus.\nTransfer the cochlear spiral into a drop of PBS placed on a microscope slide. If desired, separate the cochlear spiral into pieces equivalent to one turn. This step is not necessary however, and can lead to loss of the tissue. The apical surface (stereocilia side) of the cochlear hair cells should be facing upward towards the coverslip.\nWick away the PBS with an adsorbent tissue or piece of filter paper and gently reposition the cochlear spiral if the epithelia has shifted and overlaps onto itself.",
    "Add a drop of mounting media directly onto the cochlea sample and gently place a coverslip on top, taking care to avoid air bubbles. No spacers are required; place the coverslip directly onto the sample. A water-soluble, non-fluorescing, semi-permanent mounting medium which does not require additional steps to hold the coverslip in place is recommended. Mounting media and coverslip thickness should be matched to microscope specifications.\nUse an epifluorescent or laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with high magnification (63 - 100X), high numerical aperture (1.2 - 1.4) objectives to capture images of the apical surface of the cochlear hair cell. Use lower objectives (5 - 20X) to take overlapping images of the cochlear spiral to quantify the length of the cochlear duct. Match excitation lasers and emission filters to fluorophores used for secondary antibodies.\n8. Scanning Electron Microscopy\nContinue from section 4.3. After washing SEM fixed samples in Hepes buffer, perform the following steps under ventilation. The following protocol works well for cochlea tissue and avoids the use of sputter coating with a conductive metal.\nPost-fix in 1% OsO4 in Hepes buffer for 1 hr, followed by 3 washes with 1 ml distilled water for 5 min each. The smallest volume of OsO4 that completely envelops the tissue should be used to minimize toxic waste. No agitation is required.\nIncubate samples at RT in each of the following solutions for 1 hr with 3 washes with 1 ml distilled water for 5 min each in between steps: 1% Tannic acid freshly made in water and filtered prior to use; 1% OsO4 in water,1% Tannic acid in water,1% OsO4 in water.\nDehydrate samples through a graded ethanol series by incubation for 10 min in each of the following dilutions: 30, 50, 70, 90, and 95%. No agitation is required.",
    "Transfer samples through three changes, 5 min each, of 100% ethanol (from a newly opened bottle of 200 proof ethanol).\nRun the samples though a critical point drier following manufacturer's instructions.\nMount the samples using conductive carbon adhesive on top of an SEM stub prior to imaging on an electron microscope. Under a stereomicroscope, use a pair of fine forceps and a paintbrush to gently position the sample with the cochlear epithelia facing up. Use the vestibular portion of the sample to 'anchor' the tissue to the stub. Store samples in a desiccator until imaging. Perform SEM imaging as described in Jones (2012)21.\n9. Quantification\nAfter immunohistochemistry preparation, acquire images using an epifluorescent or laser-scanning confocal microscope. After preparation for SEM, use a scanning electron microscope to image the specimens. Image the apical surface of the organ of Corti with the exposed cochlear hair cells and intercalated support cells.\nDefine specific positions along the cochlear duct, such as 25, 50, and 75% from the base and use these to compare cochlea regions between mutant and control samples. Analyze and compare cilia mutants with their littermate controls, as differences in genetic background can modify the cochlear phenotype.\n\tNOTE: The organ of Corti develops in a gradient that extends from the mid-base towards both the apex and the base. In the mouse, development is not complete until P14, so it is important to compare regions at similar developmental stages and positions.\nTake pictures using software accompanying the microscope that allow for quantification of the particular phenotype as required (see below). Use image analysis software such as Image J or software accompanying the microscope to measure lengths, count cells and determine protein localization as described below. Graph these data as a bar chart, scatter plot, box blot or histogram, comparing mutant vs. control.",
    "Total length of the cochlear duct (Figure 3A):\n\t\nUsing a hair cell marker or phalloidin, (which marks the stereociliary bundles), determine and measure where the sensory epithelium begins and ends. The length of the cochlear duct is often shortened in cilia mutants.\nStereociliary bundle abnormalities (Figure 3B,D,E,G):\n\t\nMeasure bundle convexity (height) as the shortest distance between the vertex of the bundle and the line that extends through both ends of the bundle 'arms' as shown in Figure 3G, left. Alternatively, quantify the area encompassed by the arms of outer hair cell stereociliary bundle as shown in Figure 3G, right. If hair cells with circular stereociliary bundles can be identified count these as a percentage of total hair cells.\n\t\tNOTE: In many ciliary mutants bundle abnormalities can be observed irrespective of bundle orientation. It is difficult to accurately quantify stereociliary bundle abnormalities.\nOrientation of the stereociliary bundles (Figure 3B,C,G):\n\t\nAssess the orientation of each individual bundle relative to a line extending perpendicular to the row of pillar cells that separates the inner and outer hair cells. Cells with a normal orientation are aligned along this perpendicular axis and so have a rotation of 0°. Determine angles of rotation using either a 360° notation or as absolute deviations from 0°.\nKinocilia positioning or stereociliary bundle positioning (Figure 3B,F,H):\n\t\nCount the percentage of cells in which kinocilia are missing. Measure the distance from the kinocilium to the 'vertex' or center of the bundle. The 'vertex' of the bundle may not be easy to define if bundles are abnormal, and so the center of the bundle can be used instead.",
    "Quantify the position of kinocilia and stereociliary bundles on the apical hair cell surface, by overlaying a positional grid onto each hair cell and marking the location of either the base of the kinocilium or the vertex/center of the stereociliary bundle. Display the data as a percentage of each category that lies within a specific region of the grid, and by overlaying the locations of each marking onto one positional grid.\n\tNOTE: In control tissues, kinocilia are always attached to the vertex of the stereociliary bundle. In cilia mutants, kinocilia are often missing, mislocalized yet still attached, or even completely detached from the stereociliary bundle.\nKinocilia length (Figure 3I):\n\t\nMeasure the length of the kinocilium by labeling with a ciliary axoneme marker. Only measure kinocilia that lie flat within a 1.5 µm confocal plane. Confirm that cilia are lying flat by observing a cross-sectional view of the scanned tissue. Compare aged matched samples from the same region of the cochlea since the kinocilium retracts during development.\nMislocalization of polarity proteins:\n\t\nFollowing immunohistochemistry using antibodies against polarity proteins such as Vangl2 and Gαi3, determine the localization via imaging.\nNOTE: In some cilia mutants, localization of polarity proteins is disrupted. These include Vangl2 and Gαi3, which have been shown to be disrupted in Ift20, Bbs8 and Bbs6 mutant cochlea.\nNOTE: Further examples for how to quantify and display hair cell polarity can be found in the following papers.
