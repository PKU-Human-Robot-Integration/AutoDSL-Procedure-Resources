    "A flowchart depicting the whole experimental procedure is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4474/bioprotoc-12-14-4474-g002.jpgFigure 2. Flowchart of the procedure to detach the retina from the eye semi-cup with the MR incubation. Prepare the eye semi-cup for incubationOperations from step A2 on must be carried out at room temperature, in a dark room in dim red light (lower than 10 lux, 620 nm red lighting), to avoid rhodopsin bleaching. This facilitates the detachment of the photoreceptor OS from the RPE.Obtain freshly enucleated bovine eyes from a slaughterhouse and use them within 2 h of animal death. The age of the cattle from which the eyes can be obtained for scientific purposes may be limited (as is the case in Italy) to 1.5 years, as a cautionary measure for the risk of possible transmission of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). Eyes must be kept warm, in a light-tight container, possibly a Dewar flask, and handled to minimize the temperature decline.Remove extraocular tissues with scissors.Gently separate the anterior segment and vitreous from the eye semi-cup containing the neural retina. Make an incision in the sclera with a scalpel on one side of the eyeball, then hemi-sect the eye using scissors, approximately at the level of the ora serrata. Remove the anterior chamber, the lens, and vitreous carefully and discard them.Detach the retina with MR incubation (Figure 3)Fill the eye semi-cup containing the retina still attached to the RPE with 5–7 mL (depending on the size of the eye) of sterile filtered MR containing 2 mM glucose, protease inhibitor cocktail, and Ampicillin (100 μg/mL). All the operations, including incubations, are conducted at room temperature. The surface for dissection is routinely an aluminum foil.Incubate each eye semi-cup for 10–15 min to allow the retina to detach completely. Eyes should be dissected and incubated with MR in rapid sequence.",

CLSM evaluation of OS distribution in the retina and the eye semi-cup after asportation with MR. A) Mitotracker signal in a whole retina spontaneously detached from the eye semi-cup. In this case, a homogeneous layer of photoreceptors is recognizable. B) Mitotracker signal in an eye semi-cup from which the retina was let float to detach spontaneously from RPE. In this case, only mitochondria are visible (white head arrows). MitoTracker Deep Red 633 was used, dissolved in DMSO, and kept at -20°C in dark vials.Gathering of Retinas (Figure 4)After 10 min of incubation, rods spontaneously detach from the RPE, and the retina freely floats inside the eye semi-cup, attached to it through the optic nerve fibers; upon shorter incubation time, if it is necessary to remove the retina, gently shake the eye semi-cup by hand for 10 s, avoiding spilling the liquid contained inside, until the retina completely detaches from the RPE.Rapidly turn the eye semi-cup inside out and discard the MR previously filling the semicup and now dripping out.Cut each retina free from the optic nerve with scissors, letting the retina drop into a centrifuge 13 mL tube.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4474/bioprotoc-12-14-4474-g004.jpgFigure 4. CLSM evaluation of OS distribution in the retina and the eye semi-cup after retina asportation with a soft brush. A) Retina detached from the eye semi-cup by a soft brush. In this case, the sample is characterized by a poor OS layer, allowing the visualization of the underlying mitochondria (white head arrow) belonging to inner segments of photoreceptors and the other retinas layers. B) Mitotracker signal in an eye semi-cup from which the retina had been detached with a soft brush. Specifically, it is possible to observe mitochondria (white head arrows) and OS immersed into the RPE (white arrows) since they have been torn from their ellipsoid."
