    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nDifferentiate hiPSCs to Astrocytes\nTiming: 90+ days\nThis step will produce a stock of fully differentiated astrocytes that are ready to be added to the tri-culture.\nThaw a vial of the previously NGN2-rTTA transduced hiPSCs and plate onto 3 wells of a 1:50 (Matrigel: DMEM:F-12) Matrigel-coated 6-well plate (7 × 104 cells/cm2) in Stem MACS iPS-Brew XF media with 10 μM Y27632.\nProceed through the iNeuron differentiation as described above up through day 1 (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). (Day 2) After 24 h, re-seed the cells (which are now at an NPC-like stage) at 1 million cells/well on a 1:20 Matrigel-coated 6-well plate (1 × 105 cells/cm2) in high FGF Astrocyte media for first stage maintenance (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/296-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. iAstrocyte Timeline and Representative Images\n(A) Timeline of iAstrocyte differentiation.\n(B) Representative image of iAstrocytes in high FGF media in mono-culture. Scale bar, 50 μm.\n(C) Representative image of iAstrocytes in low FGF media in mono-culture. Scale bar, 50 μm.\n(D) Representative mage of iAstrocytes in ScienCell astrocyte media. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nNote: The FBS, EGF, and FGF will push the NPC-like cells toward an astrocyte fate.\nLet grow with half media exchanges every 3 days and re-plate via the same method as for hiPSCs 1:2 when it reaches ∼90% confluency to 1:35 Matrigel-coated plates.\nCritical: High density is extremely important throughout differentiation. If the cells are too sparse, they will stop growing completely. This is especially true in the first two stages (high FGF media and low FGF media, up through day 70 of differentiation).\nPause Point: You can freeze down at this stage in high FGF astrocyte media + 10% DMSO.\nNote: Increased Matrigel dilution of 1:35 increases NPC adherence.",
    "Note: Cells will have a pyramidal shape with sparse, short processes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\n(Day 30) Exchange half media to low FGF Astrocyte media for second stage maintenance.\nContinue to feed, let grow, and expand as before now in low FGF Astrocyte media for second stage maintenance up to day 69.\nPause Point: You can freeze down at this stage in low FGF astrocyte media + 10% DMSO.\nNote: Cells will have similar pyramidal shape as in the high FGF stage. However, in more sparse cultures, the cells can flatten out (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n(Day 70) Exchange half media to ScienCell astrocyte media.\nContinue to perform half media exchanges in ScienCell astrocyte media, let grow, and expand to day 90.\nAt this point, when you re-plate, you do not need to coat with Matrigel.\nPause Point: You can freeze down at this stage in ScienCell astrocyte media + 10% DMSO at 1 million cells per vial.\nCells are ready after day 90 for tri-culture.\nNote: Cells will have abundant processes and take on a more star-shaped astrocyte phenotype (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nImmunostain cells for nestin, glutamine synthetase, SOX9, and thrombospondin-1.\nGreater than 80% of the cells should be positive for nestin, glutamine synthetase and SOX9 and at least 50% of the cells should express thrombospondin-1.\niAstrocytes can also be tested for calcium wave propagation and glutamate uptake.\nNote: glutamate uptake can be observed at this stage, but the iAstrocytes are still immature.\nDifferentiate hiPSCs to Common Myeloid Progenitors\nTiming: 11–14 days\nThis step will produce a stock of CD41+CD235+ common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) that are ready to be differentiated into iMicroglia. This section of the protocol was based on previously published work (Paluru et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).",
    "Thaw a vial of hiPSCs and plate onto 3 wells of a 1:50 (Matrigel: DMEM:F-12) Matrigel-coated 6-well plate (7 × 104 cells/cm2) in 2 mL/well Stem MACS iPS-Brew XF media with 10 μM Y27632.\nAllow to grow until ∼80% confluency.\nOnce ∼80% confluent, split cells 1:6 to a 1:3 (Matrigel : DMEM/F12) Matrigel-coated 6-well plate.\nNote: The high concentration of Matrigel is necessary for the health of the mesoendothelial cells that are produced by the differentiation, which produce the non-adherent common myeloid progenitors.\nRemove Stem MACS and wash 1× with 20°C PBS.\nAspirate media from stem cells and apply warm dispase (incubated in 37°C water bath for 15 min) at half the normal amount of media in the plate (i.e., 1 mL per well of a 6 well plate)\nNote: Dispase is used in this passaging stage to keep the cells in clumps. The Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Core at CHOP, who developed this method, found this to be effective for performing the differentiation.\nIncubate in 37°C 5% CO2 incubator until cells begin lifting from plate (roughly 5 min).\nApply a volume of warm DMEM:F-12 equal to that of the dispase used.\nWash cell clumps from bottom of plate by pipetting up and down slowly with a 5 mL serological pipette 2–3 times, making sure not to break the clumps.\nPlace cells in an appropriately sized conical tube and spin for 5 min at 162 × g, 20°C.\nResuspend in Stem MACS by slowly adding media to the tube and then gently pipetting up and down with a 10 mL pipette until the pellet has uniformly gone into suspension. Take a p1000 and slowly break up the colonies 3–5 times so that they are a uniform suspension of small clumps.\nRe-plate with 10 μM Y27632 at 1:15 ratio.",
    "Feed daily (2 mL/well) until the cells reach ∼60% confluency. See timeline (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/296-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Timeline of CMP Differentiation\n(Days 0–1) Once they reach ∼60% confluency, full exchange change media to RPMI with 5 ng/mL BMP4, 50 ng/mL VEGF, and 1 μM CHiR\n(Day 2) Full exchange media with RPMI + 5 ng/mL BMP4, 50 ng/mL VEGF, and 20 ng/mL bFGF\nWash once first with RPMI with no small molecules to remove dead cells\n(Day 3) Full exchange media with SP34 + 5 ng/mL BMP4, 50 ng/mL VEGF, and 20 ng/mL bFGF\nWash once first with RPMI with no small molecules to remove dead cells\n(Days 4–5) Full exchange media each day with SP34 + 15 ng/mL VEGF and 5 ng/mL bFGF\n(Day 6) Full exchange media with SFD + 50 ng/mL VEGF, 100 ng/mL bFGF, 50 ng/mL SCF, and 25 ng/mL Flt3L (day 6)\nStarting day 6, media is increased to 4 mL/well.\n(Days 7–9) Full exchange media with SFD + 50 ng/mL VEGF, 100 ng/mL bFGF, 50 ng/mL SCF, and 25 ng/mL Flt3L. Fresh media with all components (2 mL/well) were added each day.\nCritical: From days 7 to 9, single cells shed off the adherent layer into the medium and are collected. These are the common myeloid progenitors (CMPS). Collect supernatant by pulling all the media from the wells and placing into a 50 mL tube. Centrifuge at 162 × g for 5 min at 20°C. Aspirate the supernatant. The cell pellet is often not visible, so leave roughly 500 μL of the supernatant to avoid aspirating the CMPs. Resuspend in 2 mL of SFD with small molecules. Feed the wells with the fresh media while spinning, and then add back the resuspended used media equally across the wells.",
    "Note: There is line-to-line variability on the number of CMPs produced. An efficient differentiation will yield 2 × 105 to 5 × 105 per well.\nNote: Cultures are terminated after day 9 as non-CMPs begin to be produced and reduce the purity.\nCMPs are frozen at 1–3 million cells per vial in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO.\nPause Point: Frozen CMPs can be stored in LN2 until ready to start tri-culture.\nCritical: All three base media (RPMI, SP34, and SFD) are supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid, and 400 μM monothioglycerol (MTG) fresh daily.\nAssemble the Tri-culture\nTiming: 30 days\nThis is a 30-day protocol that combines three differentiations. It is expected that the iPSC line for the iNeurons has already been transduced with the NGN2 virus, have had stocks frozen down, and have been tested for differentiation yield. It is also expected that the iAstrocyte differentiation is completed to day 90 and are frozen down. Lastly, it is expected that CMPs have been generated before the 30-day protocol begins. This protocol is designed to end on day 21 of the iNeuron differentiation, with the iAstrocytes added on day 5 and iMicroglia added on day 7 of the iNeuron differentiation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). This can be amended for extended cultures if desired. The iMicroglia differentiation in this section was based on previously published work (Abud et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Time commitments per step are dependent on scale, number of lines, and number of conditions in the experiment. It is highly recommended you write out the timepoints of the protocol on a calendar before you begin.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/296-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale bar, 20 μm.\n(Day 0) Thaw and plate iAstrocytes on uncoated 6-well plate in ScienCell media (1 million cells/well).\nThe iAstrocytes need roughly 2 weeks (line-to-line variability) to expand.\nFeed and expand in ScienCell media up to day 14 of the differentiation. Initial amount that is thawed is experiment dependent based on how many tri-culture wells are needed.\n(Day 4) Thaw a vial of 2 × 106 transduced hiPSCs in preparation for the iNeuron differentiation onto 3 wells of a 1:50 Matrigel-coated 6 well plate.\nExpand the hiPSCs as previously described to 2 1:50 Matrigel-coated 10-cm dishes.\nThe goal is to have the hiPSCs at ∼60% confluency on 2 10-cm dishes at day 9 when the iNeuron differentiation will begin.\nCritical: This generally is enough time to have a single vial plated onto 3 wells of a 6 well plate, then expanded to 2 10-cm dishes reach ∼60% confluency. However, this needs to be empirically tested, as described above, as each line will have different growth rates and different transduction efficiencies. In addition, this will need to be scaled based on the needs of the experiment.\n(Day 5) Begin iMicroglia differentiation by thawing CMPs and plating them at 3.3 × 105 cells/well of a 24-well CellBIND plate (1.74 × 105/cm2) in iMg media (RPMI + 10% FBS, 100 ng/mL IL-34, 25 ng/mL M-CSF, 50 ng/mL TGF-β1, pen/strep) for differentiation and maintenance.",
    "Critical: Do not use a larger sized well than a 24-well even at the same seeding density. iMicroglia yield will exponentially drop. Smaller wells do work.\nNote: iMicroglia can also be plated onto 24 wells plates/glass or smaller with 1:35 Matrigel coating, but it will have a slightly lower yield than the CellBIND counterpart.\nThaw CMPs in the same manner as hiPSCs.\nThaw in a 37°C water bath until there is a pea-sized amount of ice left.\nSlowly add thawed CMP solution to 9 mL of warmed RPMI.\nSpin at 162 × g for 5 min at 20°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet gently with a 5 mL pipette in iMg media (3.3 × 105 cells/mL). Slowly pipette up and down until pellet has fully gone into suspension.\nPlate at 1 mL/well on CellBIND 24-well plate.\nLet cells rest for 48 h (days 0 and 1).\nHalf media exchanges will be performed on days 2 and 5, and a full exchange on day 8 of iMicroglia differentiation.\n(Day 7) Perform a half media exchange on iMicroglia.\nCritical: Cytokines in the iMg media (IL-34, M-CSF, and TGF-β1) are unstable, so they must be added fresh for each media exchange (day 2 of iMicroglia differentiation).\n(Day 9) Begin iNeuron Differentiation.\nExchange Stem MACS iPS-Brew with N2 media + small molecules (day 0 of iNeuron differentiation).\nhiPSCs should be ∼60% confluent.\n(Day 10) Feed iMicroglia and continue iNeuron differentiation.\nPerform a half media exchange on iMg (day 5 of iMicroglia differentiation).\nExchange N2 media + small molecules with fresh N2 media + small molecules supplemented with 5 μg/mL puromycin (day 1 of iNeuron differentiation).",
    "(Day 11) Re-seed the iNeurons at 7.5 × 104 cells/well of a 1:20 Matrigel-coated Nunc 8 Well chamber slide (∼1.07 × 105 cells/cm2) in iN media for maintenance (day 2 of iNeuron differentiation).\nNote: Microglia will be highly ramified by the end of the 11-day differentiation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: 8-well chamber slides will have 500 μL of media.\nNote: Tri-culture will be combined onto the iNeurons in the chamber slide. Tri-cultures can be combined onto different plate formats, but they have not been rigorously tested by this group.\n(Day 13) Feed iMicroglia and add Ara-c to iNeurons.\nPerform a full exchange on the iMicroglia (day 8 of iMicroglia differentiation).\nExchange 50% of iNrn media with iN media for maintenance supplemented with 4 μM Ara-c for a final concentration of 2 μM Ara-c (day 4 of iNeuron differentiation).\n(Day 14) Remove Ara-c and introduce iAstrocytes (day 5 of iNeuron differentiation).\nFirst perform a full media exchange with iNeurons with iN media for maintenance to remove Ara-c.\nCritical: The iNeurons are now very sensitive and can lift easily from the plate, so all media exchanges should be done very carefully.\nRe-seed iAstrocytes onto iNeurons at 5 × 104 cells/well of an 8 well chamber slide ( ∼7.1 × 104 cells/cm2)\nCritical: Resuspend iAstrocytes in ScienCell astrocyte media to 5 × 104 cells/100 μL. Survivability in the tri-culture increases if they are re-seeded in a mixed media initially.\nNote: The iAstrocytes are added as early as possible to help support and mature the iNeurons, but it must be added after Ara-c treatment is removed, otherwise they will die.\n(Day 16) Re-seed iMicroglia at 1 × 105/well of the 8 well chamber slide (∼1.43 × 105 cells/cm2) (day 11 of iMicroglia differentiation) (day 7 of iNeuron differentiation).",
    "Lift iMicroglia into a single cell suspension with Accutase.\nCritical: iMicroglia yield (total number of cells after lifting) can dramatically decrease with larger tubes. Use as small a tube (preferentially 2 mL Eppendorf tubes) as possible to increase yield.\nCritical: Resuspend iMicroglia in iMg media to 1 × 105 cells/100 μL. Survivability in the tri-culture increases if they are re-seeded in a mixed media initially.\nNote: Yield for iMicroglia from CMPs is usually around 50%–60% of total number of CMPs seeded but varies across lines.\nNote: iMicroglia can be differentiated beforehand and frozen. However, the yield will be reduced due to cell death during freeze/thaw process.\n(Day 21) Perform a half media exchange with iN media without doxycycline (day 12 of iNeuron differentiation).\n(Day 26) Perform a half media exchange with iN media without doxycycline (day 17 of iNeuron differentiation).\n(Day 30) End of differentiation (day 21 of iNeuron differentiation) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nNote: Tri-culture can be extended beyond this timepoint. This group has extended iNrn differentiations to upwards of day 80. However, these were grown on rat astrocytes and were switched over to BrainPhys media (STEMCELL Technologies #05793) starting day 21 of iNeuron differentiation."
