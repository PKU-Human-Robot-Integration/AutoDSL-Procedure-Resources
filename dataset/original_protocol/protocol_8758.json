    "This protocol follows the animal care guidelines of the Université de Bourgogne and was approved by the Université de Bourgogne ethics committee.\n1. Animals\nUse genetically engineered OR-IRES-tauGFP mice available at the Jackson Laboratory. These mice were developed in Dr. Peter Mombaerts’ laboratory in order to analyze axon targeting and development of the olfactory system19. For example, the MOR23-IRES-tauGFP line, stock number 006643, bears the official strain name B6;129P2-Olfr16tm2Mom/MomJ; similarly, the SR1-IRES-tauGFP line, stock number 6717 bears the official name B6;129P2-Olfr124tm1Mom/MomJ.\nRegarding the age of the animals: for a better outcome of the protocol, use animals between 2 and 4 weeks of age. In this age group, the dissection is easier (softer bones, firmer olfactory epithelium) and the dendritic knobs are bigger compare to older animals.\n2. Preparation of Electrodes and Solutions\nFor the stimulating pipettes: purchase prepulled stimulating pipettes. Otherwise, manually prepare them.\n\t\nUsing a flame, bend six 1 mm glass pipettes at about 1 cm from the tip. Insert these six pipettes plus a straight 7th in 1.5 cm heat-shrink tubing strengthen by an eyelet.\nHeat shrink the tubing to maintain the barrels attached together. Attach an additional heat-shrink tubing to the other extremity of the barrels. Pull this stimulating pipette with a multi-barrel puller.\nAdd some white liquid glue around the eyelet to strengthen the bended tips. Let dry O/N.\nPrepare 1 or 2 L of normal Ringer’s extracellular solution (in mM: NaCl 124, KCl 3, MgSO4 1.3, CaCl2 2, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1.25, glucose 15; pH 7.6 and 305 mOsm). Keep at 4 °C until use.\nPrepare intracellular stock solution (in mM): KCl 70, KOH 53, methanesulfonic acid 30, EGTA 5, HEPES 10, sucrose 70; pH 7.2 (KOH) and 310 mOsm. Keep at 4 °C until use. Good for several weeks.",
    "Prepare intracellular recording solution with nystatin extemporaneously (at the last minute) before experiment.\n\t\nWeigh 3 mg of nystatin, add 50 µl of DMSO; vortex 20 sec then sonicate 2-3 min until entirely diluted.\nAdd 20 µl of DMSO-nystatin solution in 5 ml of intracellular stock solution. Vortex 20 sec, then sonicate 3 min. Keep this solution at 4 °C and protect from direct light, nystatin is light-sensitive. This solution can be used for a few hours. Replace every day.\nOnce the olfactory epithelium preparation is under the microscope, take some of this solution in a 1 ml syringe with a flame-elongated yellow tip to fill the electrodes; protect from direct light. Once at RT, the nystatin solution is not stable; replace the solution in the 1 ml syringe every hour or keep it in ice.\nPull recording electrodes with a puller to obtain long neck and small tip (~2 µm) with a resistance of 15-20 MΩ with the internal nystatin solution.\nPrepare odorant solution at 0.5 M in DMSO under fume hood; aliquot and keep at -20 °C until use. Dilute odorant in Ringer’s solution until the desired concentration. Fill the stimulating pipette.\n3. Preparation of Olfactory Epithelium\nNote: OR-IRES-tauGFP mice express the tauGFP under the control of the OR promoter. In these mice, all neurons expressing the OR of interest are labeled with GFP. This protocol is adapted for ORs expressed in all zones. However, dissections and recordings are easier for ORs expressed in the dorsal zone.\nAnesthetize the animal by injecting a mix of ketamine and xylazine (150 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg body weight, respectively). Decapitation can be performed with sharp scissors for young mice or with a properly maintained rodent guillotine for older mice.",
    "Using ring dissecting scissors make a longitudinal medial incision through the dorsal skin. Remove the skin by pulling it apart. Using the scissors, cut the lower jaws at the jaw joint. Remove the upper front teeth by a coronal cut parallel to the teeth.\nMake a coronal cut of the head behind the eyes and keep only the anterior part of the head. Dip it in ice-cold Ringer solution for the dissection under the scope.\nDissect under the scope: in the ventral side, make a longitudinal cut along the upper jaw/the teeth. Cut the dorsal bones longitudinally, following the dorso-lateral side of the nasal cavity. Remove most bones and palate; transfer the septum and the epithelium attached to it in oxygenated Ringer at RT.\nFor the final dissection: Right before starting the recording session, peel away the epithelium from the underlying septum with forceps. Detach the epithelium with forceps and with two 4-5 mm scissor cuts (use microvannas scissors) at the anterior part of the septum where the adhesion is stronger.\n\t\nCarefully remove the vomeronasal organ by cutting it out along its dorsal connection to the septal epithelium. Transfer the epithelium to a recording chamber with the mucus layer facing up; keep it flat in the chamber with a harp.\nInstall chamber under an upright microscope equipped with fluorescence optics and a sensitive camera. Visualize the preparation on the computer screen at high magnification through a 40X water-immersion objective (numerical aperture 0.8) and an extra 2X or 4X magnification achieved by a magnifying lens. Perfuse continuously with oxygenated Ringer at RT (1-2 ml/min).\n4. Recording Session\nSearch for fluorescent cell: excite the preparation at 480 nm for EGFP, which emits light in the 530-550 nm range; target one dendritic knob which is reliably visible in fluorescence and under bright field.",
    "Fill electrode with intracellular solution with nystatin; remove bubbles by gently tapping on the electrode.\nInsert electrode on electrode holder, apply positive pressure in the pipette; Resistance should be 15-20 MΩ.\nBring electrode close to the cell; once resistance reaches ~40 MΩ, release positive pressure and apply slight negative pressure to reach a gigaseal.\nOnce seal is reached, set the membrane potential at about -75 mV;\nOnce the cell is opened, proceed with stimulation protocols, pharmacological treatments. To measure the response to a single odorant stimulation, record 200-500 msec of spontaneous activity, stimulate for 500 msec and measure the response of the cell for up to 10 sec 13. For pharmacological treatments, perfuse the pharmacological agents at the desired concentration20.\n5. Data Analysis\nAnalyze currents elicited by odorant stimulation as followed: the maximum amplitude, the rise-time (time necessary to reach 90% of the maximum amplitude, in msec), the total current (area under the curve in pAs), the time at 50% (time between the onset and the offset of the response at 50% of the maximum amplitude, in msec).\n\t\nUsing the peak transduction currents (maximum amplitude reached) at different concentrations, draw and fit a dose response curve using the Hill equation: I  = Imax/(1 + (K1/2/C)n), where I represents the peak current, Imax the maximum response at saturating concentrations, K1/2 the concentration at which half of the maximum response was reached, C the concentration of odorant and n the Hill coefficient.\nAnalyze recordings of membrane potential in current clamp for the maximum depolarization, the total potential elicited (area under the curve in mVsec); record spontaneous spiking activity over 30 sec to 1 min recordings; record excitability through spikes elicited by injection of currents (5-10 pA).\nSubscription Required.
