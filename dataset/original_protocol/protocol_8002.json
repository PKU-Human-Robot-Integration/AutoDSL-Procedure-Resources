    "1. Caffeine Extraction in Cell Suspensions of C. arabica L.\nUse C. arabica cell suspensions9. Maintain the suspensions by biweekly subcultures in Murashige and Skoog medium at pH 4.3 with constant 100 rpm shaking at 25 °C under continuous light (8.3 W/m2).\nHarvest the cells under vacuum filtration using 11 µm pore filter paper and a Buchner funnel.\nRegister the fresh weight of the collected cells using a scale, wrap them in aluminum foil, freeze them in liquid nitrogen and keep them at -80 °C until analysis.\nLyophilize the frozen cellular material for 72 h.\nRegister the weight of the lyophilized cells in order to estimate the dry weight yield.\nStore the powdered material in reusable polyethylene bags (9 cm x 7.5 cm). Macerate the material to a fine powder and store in a desiccator until use.\nMeasure 0.5 g of dry cellular matter on the analytical scale and add it to a glass flask (25 mL).\n\t\nAdd 10 mL of acetone to the lyophilized cells and mix in a vortex mixer for 30 s for homogenization. Then, seal the flask with aluminum foil.\nMix at 100 rpm using a rotator at room temperature (25 °C) for 5 h.\nTransfer all material to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10 min.

Conditions for the Assessment of Caffeine by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)-Densitometry\nApply 1 µL of the previously resuspended caffeine extract to the stationary phase.",
    "Note: Silica gel plates (F254) are used as the stationary phase. Before applying the samples, the plates were developed with 10 mL of chloroform-methanol [9:1 v/v] in a chromatography chamber (14 cm x 12 cm x 9.5 cm), and the plates were dried at room temperature. The characteristics of the chromatographic plate where the samples are applied are shown in Figure 1. The chamber was saturated for 30 min with solvent before developing the plate. TLC plates should handle using gloves to avoid contamination.\nDevelop the TLC in the chromatography chamber with 10 mL of the mobile phase cyclohexane-acetone [40:50 v/v].\n\tNote: This mixture allows the separation of caffeine at a retention factor (Rf) of 0.34.\n\t\nRemove the TLC plate from the chamber and let it dry completely at room temperature.\nVisualize caffeine bands in short wavelength ultraviolet light (UV, 254 nm).
