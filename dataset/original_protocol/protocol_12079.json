    "1. Drosophila melanogaster Genetics and Optional Heat Shock Procedures\nOnce flies have been crossed and F1 progeny have hatched, obtain females and/or males of the appropriate genotype. Depending on the brain region being investigated, flies should be collected daily and separated by sex so that age-dependent and/or sexually dimorphic patterns of brain connectivity can be more easily distinguished.\n\tNOTE: Optional: If flies are being used for Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker (MARCM) analysis12,47, embryos, larvae, or pupae should be heat shocked at 37 °C for 30 - 45 min to induce mitotic recombination. In order to target specific regions of the mushroom bodies for MARCM analysis, heat shock should be timed according to the schedule determined by12 and outlined in Figure 5B. If using MARCM to investigate brain regions other than the mushroom bodies, pilot experiments should be performed to determine the optimal stage to be heat-shocked. While the steps below are written in regard to eclosed flies, pharate adults can also be dissected using these steps once the pupal case has been removed.\n2. Dissection Station Preparation\nPosition the stereomicroscope and light source with attached fiber optic goosenecks on a large benchtop. To promote steady hand movements and reduce hand \"shake\" while dissecting, it is essential that adequate hand and arm rest space is available around the microscope. Ensure that there is approximately 8 - 10 inches on either side of the microscope and 4 - 6 inches between the base of microscope and edge of the bench.",
    "Fill 2 or 3 wells of a glass 9-well or 3-well dish with 1.0 mL of PTN buffer (0.1 M Sodium Phosphate Buffer pH 7.2, 0.1% nonionic surfactant, see Materials Table for complete buffer components) and place next to the dissecting station on ice. Newly dissected brains will be transferred to this dish and stored until the fixation step.\nNote: If live imaging is required, dissection buffer should be 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) or HL3 buffer48. If intracellular protein localization is required, PBS can also be used as an alternative buffer for dissection and fixation. Following fixation, permeabilization of cell membranes should then be performed using PTN washes containing 0.1% or 0.3% nonionic detergent.\nIf PBS is used for dissections and fixation, pipette tips should be rinsed at least one time with a detergent-containing buffer (such as PTN) to prevent brains from sticking to the plastic pipette tips during transfer to microcentrifuge tubes.\nUsing an empty 35 mm glass or plastic petri dish, construct a dissection dish containing a silicone elastomer. Briefly, mix the elastomer components according to the manufacturer's directions, pour into 35 mm dishes, and let it polymerize overnight on a flat surface. Elastomer containing dissection dishes should be used to protect the fine tips of dissecting forceps, which can easily be damaged if contact is made between the forceps and a harder surface, such as a glass dish. We also regularly purchase commercially available silicone coated dishes from online retailers. To increase contrast during dissections, silicone elastomer dissection dishes containing inactivated charcoal (and thus colored black) are particularly useful.\n3. Adult Brain Dissection Procedure",
    "Anesthetize 3 - 5 day old adult D. melanogaster with CO2 or by using ice. If using ice, place the vial containing flies upside down (plug end down) into an ice bucket for ~5 min. Placing the vial into ice upside down prevents flies from becoming lodged in the food. Once flies have been anesthetized, place the flies on a cold metal pad or petri dish sitting in ice or on a CO2 emitting fly pad. If dissecting brains to analyze neurodegeneration, older flies may also be used.\nPlace a small amount (150 - 200 µL) of PTN in the center of the dissection dish using a transfer pipette or a p200 pipette to create a \"bubble\" of PTN. Place the dissection dish under the stereomicroscope and adjust the lighting and focus so that the bubble of PTN fills the field of view and is uniformly illuminated.\nManipulate flies so that they are \"belly up\" (i.e., ventral side up) while lying on the metal or CO2 pad.\nUsing one pair of #5 forceps, grasp the abdomen of a fly to be dissected and, keeping hold of the fly, completely submerge it in the PTN on the dissection dish.\n\tNOTE: For the remainder of the protocol, all steps should be performed while the head is submerged in PTN.\nUsing a second pair of #5 forceps, grasp the base of the fly proboscis and pull the two pairs of forceps apart to detach the fly head from the body. Discard the abdomen and thorax. During this step, it is critical that the head is not released and allowed to float on the surface of the PTN. Once the head is floating, it can be very difficult to grasp again without crushing the brain.",
    "NOTE: Using this method, connections between the brain and ventral nerve cord are severed. If intact connections between these regions of the CNS are required, an alternative dissection protocol, such as49,50, should be followed. If the proboscis detaches from the fly head before the head is removed, there will be a hole where the proboscis was. In this case, grasp the fly head at the edge of the hole near one eye. Then remove the head using a moderate amount of force while pulling the two pairs of forceps apart from one another. Occasionally, when the head is removed from the body, the gut and/or ventral nerve cord remains attached to the head and should be removed before continuing the dissection.\nWhile one pair of forceps grasps the proboscis, the second pair should grasp the medial edge of the right fly eye. Slowly, pull the forceps apart from one another. This step should be performed with a small amount of steady lateral force. As the forceps slowly move apart from one another, the proboscis should pull away from the head and create a central hole in the head cuticle. Discard the proboscis with the first pair of forceps without releasing the medial portion of the right eye from the second pair.\n\tNote: The adult D. melanogaster brain is in the caudal (i.e., posterior/rear) region of the fly head. Thus, grasping that region of the head should be avoided. Ideally, only the rostral (i.e., front) portion of the head near the medial retina should be directly grasped by the forceps. The brain and associated trachea should now be visible through the central hole in the cuticle. At this time, any white stringy threads of trachea protruding from the hole can be removed and discarded.",
    "With the second pair of forceps, grasp the medial edge of the left retina (at the edge of the central hole in the head cuticle). To remove the retinas and associated cuticle, slowly pull the forceps away from one another at a 180° angle. As the retina dissociates from the underlying optic lobe, you should feel a slight decrease in tension. Proceed slowly to prevent tearing the optic lobe.\n\tNOTE: Separating the forceps too quickly during this step may result in the tearing of the optic lobe or disruption of mushroom body structures. Occasionally, the cuticle will be removed but pieces of the retina will remain attached to the optic lobe. If imaging the mushroom bodies, it is not completely necessary to remove the entire retina. However, analysis of other brain regions (such as retinal neuron innervation of the optic brain lobes) may require the retina to be completely removed as described by48,51.\n\tNOTE: As the retina is slowly separated from the underlying optic lobe of the brain, the optic lobe should be observable as an opaque white structure covered with white, stringy trachea. Once one retina has been removed, it can be discarded. When analyzing pathfinding of retinal neurons, particular care should be taken during this step to prevent damage to the optic lobe. An additional protocol focused on dissection and live imaging of the photoreceptor neurons is also available48.\nNow, carefully remove as much of the visible trachea as possible. The trachea may already contain or later fill with air, causing brains to float and, potentially, be lost during later immunostaining steps. To remove trachea, pick it off the brain using a very sharp pair of #5 forceps.",
    "Remove the remaining retina and surrounding cuticle by using both pairs of forceps to grasp the medial region of the left fly retina. Carefully tear the retina in half to remove pieces of the retina and cuticle. In some cases, removing the remaining cuticle without crushing the brain proves especially challenging. In these cases, we have found that the remaining strands of the ventral nerve cord can instead be grasped by one pair of forceps while the other pair of forceps is used to carefully remove the last of the cuticle.\nUsing a p200 pipette, move dissected brains to one well of the 9- or 3-well dish containing PTN. Brains of the same genotype should be pooled together into the same well and kept on ice. Brain tissue should be fixed within one hour of dissection. Brains can be fixed in small batches and pooled if a larger number of brains is required. In most circumstances, an experienced researcher can usually dissect a brain and transfer it to the glass collection dish in approximately 3 - 5 min.\n4. Fixation and Immunofluorescent Staining Procedure\nUsing a p200 pipette, transfer dissected brains from the 9-well dish to a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube filled with 0.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PTN. At least 10 - 15 brains of the same genotype can be combined into one microcentrifuge tube. All remaining steps (until mounting of brains onto slides) are completed in 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde (PFA) should be handled in a fume hood. PFA waste should be saved and disposed of properly. 20% paraformaldehyde purchased in glass ampules can be aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes and stored at -20 °C until needed.",
    "Inside a fume hood, incubate brains in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min with slow speed rocking at room temperature.\nFollowing fixation, allow brains to settle to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube by gravity.\n\tNote: Occasionally, the brains may stick to the side of the microcentrifuge tube. If this occurs, it is usually helpful to laterally rotate the tube between the index finger and thumb or to very gently tap the tube on the bench to promote sinking of the brains.\nRemove fixative using a p1000 pipette and perform two \"quick\" washes with 500 µL of PTN, allowing the brains to settle to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube between washes. During these quick washes, once all the brains have settled by gravity to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube, the PTN can be immediately exchanged for fresh buffer; no additional wash time is required.\n\tNOTE: Typically, leaving extra buffer in the tube is preferable to risking brain removal. Careful examination of the pipette tip is often required to ensure that no brains have been mistakenly removed from the tube. If brains have been accidently pipetted into the tip, dispense them back into the microcentrifuge tube, wait for the brains to settle, and then continue removing any extra PTN that remains.\nAfter the last quick wash, use a p1000 pipette to perform three \"long\" washes: add 500 µL of PTN and wash for 20 min at room temperature on a rocker/nutator. All future \"long\" washes should be for 20 mins.\n\tNOTE: Following these washes, fixed brains may be stored overnight at 4 °C in PTN.",
    "Remove the last wash using a p1000 pipette and incubate brains on a rocker or nutator at room temperature in 0.5 mL of blocking solution [PTN + 5% normal goat serum (NGS)] for at least 30 min at room temperature.\nGoat secondary antibodies will be used in subsequent protocol steps. If secondary antibodies from another species will be used, normal serum from that species (rather than NGS) should be used in the blocking and antibody solutions.\nUsing a p1000 pipette, remove blocking solution and add the primary antibody diluted in PTN (PTN + 5% NGS + diluted primary antibody). When using a primary antibody for the first time, the optimal dilution of that antibody should be determined empirically.\n\tNote: For visualizing mushroom body neurons, antibodies recognizing Fas2 are typically used. These antibodies are available from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) as antibody 1D4 and should be diluted 1:20 in PTN + 5% NGS.\n\tNOTE: For visualizing photoreceptor neurons, antibodies recognizing chaoptin are typically used. Chaoptin antibodies are available from the DSHB as antibody 24B10 and should be diluted 1:20 in PTN + 5% NGS.\n\tNOTE: The fixation process typically eliminates fluorescence from fluorescent protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Therefore, when using MARCM to analyze axonal guidance of individual MB neurons, use an antibody recognizing GFP.\nIncubate brains in primary antibody solution on a rocker/nutator for 2 - 3 nights at 4 °C.\nFollowing incubation with primary antibodies, allow brains to settle to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube and then remove the primary antibody solution.",
    "Using a p1000 pipette, perform 2 \"quick\" washes and 3 \"long\" 20 min washes with 0.5 mL of PTN as described above in Steps 4.4 and 4.5, carefully allowing brains to settle by gravity to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube between each wash.\nIncubate brains for 3 h at room temperature with appropriate fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies are usually diluted in 0.5 mL of PTN + 5% NGS at a concentration of 1:200.\n\tNOTE: Once fluorescent secondary antibodies have been added, brains should be kept in the dark for the remainder of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: In case residual GFP fluorescence remains, when performing MARCM analysis it is advisable to use a secondary antibody labeled with a fluorophore having similar excitation/emission wavelengths as GFP (e.g., Fluoroscein isothyocyanate (FITC) or Alexa488).\nFollowing secondary antibody incubation, allow brains to settle to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube and remove the secondary antibody solution.\nPerform 2 \"quick\" washes and 3 \"long\" 20 min washes with 0.5 mL of PTN as described above in Steps 4.4 and 4.5, carefully allowing brains to settle to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube between each wash.\nFollowing the third \"long\" 20 min wash, use a p200 pipette to remove as much buffer as possible.\nAdd 75 µL of fluorescent anti-fade mounting medium to the brains. Pipette brains and mounting medium into the pipette tip once to mix. Do not invert the tube since brains may become stuck on the cap or sides of the microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: Following suspension of brains in mounting medium, tubes may be wrapped in aluminum foil to slow fluorophore quenching and stored at 4 °C overnight. If necessary, brains can be stored for several days at 4 °C, but should ideally be mounted onto slides as soon as possible.",
    "5. Mounting Adult D. melanogaster  Brains onto Microscope Slides and Imaging\nBuild a \"bridge\" slide. Position two \"base\" coverslips roughly 1 cm apart on a positively charged slide. Ensure that the positively charged side of the slide is facing up. Adhere the coverslips to the slide with fingernail polish as shown in Figure 3A. It is usually helpful to seal the three outer edges of each base cover slip with fingernail polish to ensure mounting media does not wick under these base cover slips. Let fingernail polish dry completely (10 - 15 min) before proceeding.\nPlace the slide under the stereomicroscope and pipette the mounting media solution containing the dissected brains into the space between the two coverslips. To provide more contrast, it is useful to maneuver the gooseneck lights so that they are parallel with the bench top.\nRemove extra mounting media from the slide using a pipette, being careful not to pipette the brains off the slide.\nWick away extra mounting media. This will allow the brains to be positioned more precisely during the next step.\nUsing a pair of forceps and the stereomicroscope, position the brains on the slide in a grid pattern with antennal lobes facing up.\nPlace a cover slip (the \"bridge\") over the brains (Figure 3A). Use fingernail polish to seal the sides of the bridge cover slip where they contact the \"base\" cover slips.\nUsing a p200 pipette, slowly fill the center cavity under the bridge with fresh mounting media (Figure 3B). Place one drop at a time on the open edge of the center coverslip and allow the mounting media to wick under the center bridge coverslip. Continue until the entire cavity is filled with mounting media, then seal the top and bottom with clear fingernail polish.",
    "Once the fingernail polish is dry, image the slides immediately or store in a lightproof tight slide box at -20 °C.\nWithin one week, image brains using a laser-scanning confocal microscope with excitation lasers and filter cubes appropriate to the chosen fluorescent secondary antibodies. Z-stack images of mushroom body neurons are typically obtained using 20X or 40X objectives. Imaging of retinal photoreceptor neurons may require higher magnification."
