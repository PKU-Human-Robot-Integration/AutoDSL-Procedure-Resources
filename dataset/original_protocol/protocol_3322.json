Workflow schematic of single-spore imaging\nCreated in part with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com] TA refers to the bile acid germinant, taurocholate.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nNote: Spores are purified from sporulating cultures grown on 70:30 agar media after multiple water washes, DNAse treatment, and gradient centrifugation to obtain a >95% pure population of C. difficile spores.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nDilute purified spores to 0.2–0.5 OD600 in a final volume of 50–100 μL depending on how many experiments are planned for that respective prep.\nPrepare coverslip on which spores will be inoculated.\nClean coverslip (#1.5H thickness) using 70% ethanol followed by deionized water. Wipe with a folded Kimwipe.\nNote: Fold, but do not crumple, the Kimwipe to avoid excessive lint.\nNote: The coverslip size depends on the size of Gene Frame used. For 25 μL Gene Frames, we use a 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip. For 100 μL Gene Frames, we use a 24 × 40 mm coverslip.\nDraw a 3 × 2 grid (if using a 100 μL Gene Frame) on a coverslip using permanent marker if imaging multiple strains or preps in the same assay.\nSpot 2–3 μL diluted spores onto their respective grid position on the coverslip and let the spots dry at 37°C for 20–30 min or at ∼25°C for 30–60 min.\nNote: Ideally, you will have isolated single spores with as few clumps as possible. The spore dilution used should be optimized to minimize clumping (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nPrepare imaging chamber.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3089-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Spore density in movies",
    "(A) Evenly spaced spores at a good density for segmentation.\n(B) A clump of spores is outlined in yellow that can decrease the accuracy of the segmentation. Scale bar shows 8 μm.\nClean two standard microscope slides with 70% ethanol followed by deionized water.\nRemove the solid adhesive backing, keeping the one on the opposite side (with a center hole), of a Gene Frame and adhere to the center of one of the clean slides.\nCritical: Avoid introducing bubbles between the Gene Frame and the slide to create an airtight seal (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nPrepare agarose with germinant.\nMake a 3.5% solution of low melting point agarose in deionized water.\nMake a 2× concentrated solution of media/buffer for germination containing germinant signals.\nNote: For C. difficile, BHIS (rich medium)12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] containing 0.2%–0.5% sodium taurocholate is adequate to initiate germination.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] If using a buffer containing taurocholate, the buffer must include either CaCl2 or glycine as a co-germinant.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nPrepare agarose pad.\nVortex 1 mL molten agarose and 1 mL 2× media thoroughly, then quickly pipet 500 μL of the solution into the well created by the Gene Frame.\nNote: See Wilmaerts et al. for more details about setting up the agarose pad (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nQuickly cover with another clean microscope slide, as agarose will spill from the sides. Press the top slide down firmly on the Gene Frame.\nNote: Gene Frames are gas impermeable, which is a useful feature when studying the outgrowth of germinating spores from anaerobic bacteria. However, for obligate or facultative aerobes, the use of Gene Frames for longer-term imaging studies may alter the outgrowth kinetics measured. Since germination is insensitive to oxygen, the use of Gene Frames will not affect germination kinetics.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]",
    "Let solidify at 4°C for 30 min or 25°C for 2–5 h. Ensure that the agarose pad equilibrates to the temperature that the experiment will be conducted (e.g., 25°C or 37°C) before adding the coverslip (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] & 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nSet up image acquisition parameters.\nSelect a 60–100× high numerical aperture phase-contrast oil immersion objective.\nFind a suitable illumination intensity and exposure time.\nCritical: It is important to avoid saturated pixels. Phase-bright spores are so “bright” that their intensity can easily saturate the camera. For guidance optimizing illumination conditions, see the following ref. 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] and 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3])\nSet the experiment duration optimized for your experiment and the sampling interval (30 s maximum to avoid under-sampling).\nInoculate spores onto agarose pad.\nTake the top slide off the agarose pad, pull off the top adhesive backing, then let the pad dry for 3–5 min at 25°C.\nTake the coverslip with adhered spores and carefully place it on the agar pad, sealing the edges.\nPlace the slide on the stage insert (holder should accommodate a standard glass slide).\nImmediately pick two different XY positions throughout each sample and begin imaging.\nCritical: Working quickly is essential to track germination. Ideally, you should start imaging within 1–1.5 min.\nNote: Choosing multiple XY positions ensures that even if one of them goes out of focus, the other positions will still allow for useful data to be acquired. However, the use of multiple XY positions can result in changes in focus when the stage moves due to oil dragging. Adding a “wait” command of 100–500 ms should ensure that the oil is spread evenly on the top lens (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problems 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] & 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).",
    "Note: It is important to choose positions that are not too crowded and avoids clumps as the segmentation becomes less accurate. An example of an ideal density of spores and one that has clumps is provided in (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nImage processing using PySpore\nTiming: Varies depending on the size of the dataset\nPreprocess images (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCrop and export files in tagged image format (.tif).\nNote: Although PySpore is robust to images that have some deviation in illumination across the field, it is important to curate the images and crop portions of the image that are out of focus. It may also be necessary to discard movies that drift in and out of focus between frames. Having as flat an agarose pad as possible will minimize these issues (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] & 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nCritical: Images must be fed into the software as a stack of .tif files, not individual frames.\nIn FIJI/ImageJ or image acquisition software, crop out out-of-focus regions from the image and trim the number of frames as needed.\nFilenames should contain the channel and position of the image. For example: WT_A1 Position1_Crop001_RAW_ch00.tif (the naming convention here refers to the strain (WT); slide region (A1), and given XY position (Position1).\nNote: There are no specific requirements for the naming convention, but distinguishing between TIFF stacks analyzed based on strain and position would be helpful.\nLaunch PySpore.\nClick on the “Launch Image Processing” button within the launcher. At this point, the image processing GUI will pop up (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nSelect “Browse” (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], yellow oval) from the top of the GUI. Navigate to the directory containing the pre-processed images. The image names will appear in the list box found at the center of the GUI.",
    "Load an image by selecting it from the list and clicking the “Load Image” icon (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], orange rectangle).\nNote: At the bottom of the window, a slider will appear, allowing the user to view all images in the stack.\nOptimize segmentation by clicking “Test Segmentation” (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], green rectangle). An image showing the spore outlines generated will be displayed.\nNote: If spores are poorly segmented and small pieces of debris are highlighted, adjust the threshold to a higher value. Typical values range between 0.05-0.15. As part of the image processing scheme, the image undergoes a black-hat transform to accentuate the dark spore coat along with phase-gray and phase-dark spores, so the thresholds do not reflect the intensities of the input image. Testing the threshold should be done for multiple time points in the movie. Do this by using the frame slider noted in the previous step.\nNote: If significant drift is observed between frames, check the box to align the images (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). The program will do so using phase cross correlation to generate an offset between the current frame and the next and translate the images (shift in x,y) using the calculated offset.\nProcess the images.\nHighlight one or more files and select either “Process” or “Batch Process” (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nNote: The progress of the analysis is displayed in the command line, and the output contains (1) the resulting segmentation masks and (2) the .csv data containing relevant spore properties quantified.\nEnter relevant experimental data associated with each image (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nSelect the “Save Experiment Data” button to ensure the data is propagated to the output.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3089-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. PySpore image processing and data processing GUIs",
    "PySpore image processing and data processing GUIs. Highlighted features are shown including an interactive image viewer, interactive threshold selection to optimize parameters, a selection for whether the images in the TIFF stack should be aligned prior to segmentation to facilitate accurate tracking, a batch processing interface, and simple file selection. A data processing interface is also included which allows the user to plot and explore data, filter data, and join multiple datasets together.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3089-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Batch image processing interface\nPySpore allows the user to process multiple images after selecting an appropriate threshold. Upon highlighting all images to be processed, the user selects “Batch Process” which will bring up a new window prompting the user to enter relevant data for the experiment. Once the data is added, the user selects “Save Experiment Data”, and a popup will appear indicating that the operation was successful. To start the batch analysis, the user presses the “Exit” button.\nData processing using PySpore\nTiming: Varies depending on the size of the dataset and computer hardware\nExplore PySpore output data.\nPlot the data to generate simple interactive plots of spore germination traces displayed in a web browser (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3089-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Interactive single-spore plots of the data integrated into the data explorer\n(A) Plotting functionality with dropdowns for plotting parameters and for plot row grouping. Users enter the number of spores they want plotted from each position in the “Num Samples” box and click “plot random traces” to generate plots.\n(B) Plots are generated using the Plotly Express Python library and are displayed in html format in a web browser. Selecting save plots will allow the user to save the plot locally as a .svg by default, though a different extension including .png or .tif can be denoted.",
    "(C) Mousing over individual traces shows data for an individual spore at any timepoint. Portions of the plot can be highlighted and viewed in higher detail.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3089-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Data processing fields in data explorer GUI\nGUI allows users to join and process datasets with multiple filtering parameters, pixel conversion, and time conversion.\nNote: . PySpore also (1) provides functionality to join datasets together, (2) assigns unique identifiers to spores in joined datasets, and (3) allows for easy gating on specific parameters, including spore area to exclude clumps and the number of frames a spore was tracked (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). In addition, PySpore allows the user to input a time offset (time delay to the start of the acquisition) and correct for the pixel size based on the camera and objective magnification. The combined dataset is compiled in “long form” where rows contain each measurement at a given time and each column represents a different variable that was measured and thus should be amenable to plotting and statistical analysis in software, including GraphPad Prism."
