  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All animal procedures complied with guidelines for the care and use of animals set forth by the National Institutes of Health. All protocols were approved by the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University in St. Louis.\nNOTE: Specific materials and equipment for this protocol are listed Materials and Equipment table.\n1. Timed Breeding of Female Mice\nBreed adult females between two and six months of age in a 2 hr time window with males. Specific breeding hr are not needed as long as they are kept consistent for the entirety of the experiment.\nConfirm pregnancy by the presence of a copulatory plug. Designate the day and hr on which the plug is first seen as day post-coitus 0 (dpc0). Remember the specific hour when starting pressure recording.\nPerform surgeries on dpc8–13. The exact dpc will depend on the mouse strain.\nTo determine if a mouse is pregnant before surgery, perform ultrasound imaging of the abdomen with a 40 MHz linear array probe coupled to a imaging system before administering anesthesia. This will allow visualization of gestational sacs. If an ultrasound system is not available, use the weight of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: A weight gain of at least 2 g between dpc0 and dpc8 and distension of the abdomen is a good indicator of pregnancy.\n2. Telemetry Surgery Prep\nUse an autoclave to sterilize instruments, gauze, cotton swabs, surgical drapes, and pipette tips within 24 hr before surgery.\nClean surgery surface with 70% ethanol.\nTurn on heating pad (specialized for rodents) and bead sterilizer.\n3. Telemetry Surgery\nFor anesthesia, use 4-5% isoflurane with an oxygen flow rate of 1-2 L/min.\nWait until the mouse shows signs of anesthetization and then inject subcutaneously with buprenorphine (analgesic: 0.1 ml per 20 g).",
    "Shave the abdomen of the mouse from the bottom of the ribs down to the bladder.\nBring the mouse to the surgery table on pre-warmed heating pad, and cover the mouse’s eyes with ophthalmic ointment to prevent drying.\nBegin sterile technique. Put on sterile gloves and keep the wrapper as a sterile surface on which to place the iodine and ethanol scrubs.\nRemove the telemeter from the package or saline and use sterile forceps to place it on sterile gauze.\n\t\nUse the syringe (provided by the telemeter supplier) to fill the catheter tip with gel.  Gently squeeze the catheter creating enough negative pressure to draw the gel into the catheter.\nPlace a sterile tip on the pipette. Pipette 2 µl of surgical glue and set the pipette on a sterile surface.\nTo clean the surgical site, swab the area with iodine and then with 70% ethanol.\nCut a hole in the surgical drape just large enough for the area needed for the incision and place over the mouse.\nPerform a foot pinch (pedal response) to ensure the mouse is completely anesthetized before making an incision.\nMake a small vertical midline incision. Next, make a similar incision through the underlying body wall muscle.\nGently pull the uterus out of the body cavity and locate the uterine horn containing the most pups that are viable.\n\t\nOptional - For addition of miRNA, inject viral vector into muscle layer of uterus before insertion of telemeter.\nMake a small incision at the tip of the uterine horn with 3 mm cutting edge spring scissors.\nThread the catheter, without squeezing, between the uterine wall and fetal sacs. Insert the catheter past several sacs to reduce its accidental removal. Make sure the fetal sacs are not disturbed by the insertion.",
    "Pipette the surgical glue to the site of telemeter insertion to adhere the catheter to the uterine horn and prevent the catheter from sliding out of the uterine horn. Wait a few seconds for the glue to become rigid, and then carefully place the uterus back inside the body cavity.\nPlace the telemeter in the body cavity on the opposite side of the catheter insertion site.\nSuture the body cavity closed with 6.0 absorbable sutures. First, do a purse stitch and then three to four individual stitches.\nSuture the skin by using the same technique, but with 6-0 non-absorbable suture.\nSwab dibucaine (topical analgesic) ointment over the incision site.\nInject 0.3-0.4 ml of sterile saline subcutaneously to help rehydrate the animal.\nMonitor the animal after surgery until it is fully awake. Do not place the mouse back in its cage until it is able to freely hold its head above the table as certain types of bedding can suffocate a heavily anesthetized mouse. For a mouse that has been anesthetized for 30-45 min, one should expect the mouse to be fully awake by 1 hr and 15 min.\nIf performing additional surgeries, wipe instruments with 70% ethanol and bead sterilize before reuse.\n4. Post-surgery Recovery\nMonitor daily post-surgery progress in a log. Catalog weight gain and loss and watch for lethargy, bleeding, or incomplete closure of the surgical incision.\n\t\nFeed the mouse softened mouse chow (~the consistency of applesauce) or specialized recovery diet food.\nExamine the sutures and make sure they are not pulled out, but try not to handle the mouse excessively.\n5. Telemetry Recording",
    "On the day of interest (at least a two to three days after the mouse has recovered from surgery), place a magnet near the mouse to turn on the telemeter. Put the mouse cage on the receiver. The light on the receiver should turn on if the telemeter is activated.\nCalibrate brand new telemeters with manufacturer specific calibrations provided. Reused telemeter calibration specifications will be kept in software.\nWithin the software, start recording by right clicking on “animal” and click “start sampling, continuous,” which allows sampling at rates of up to 500 Hz. Make sure the software is set to save AND trace.\n\tNOTE: When the sampling mouse icon turns green, pressures are being recorded. Disturbing the mouse during delivery can interrupt or alter labor, so observe cautiously.\nAfter delivery or time period of interest, stop recording by right clicking on “animal” and selecting “stop recordings, all”. Use a magnet to turn off telemeter to save battery life, as the telemeter battery will typically only last for 1.5 months of continuous recording.\nEuthanize the mouse by CO2 overdose and recover the telemeter. Pups are euthanized by decapitation. \n6. Telemeter Sterilization\nPlace the telemeter in a solution of 1% enzyme detergent in deionized water overnight at room temperature.\nRinse the telemeter in deionized water and remove all tissue and glue, being careful not to squeeze the catheter.\nIncubate the telemeter in 2% glutaraldehyde for 24 hr at room temperature to sterilize.\nRinse the telemeter with sterile saline and store it in sterile saline until next implantation or to be sent back to manufacturer to be refurbished. Telemeters should be refurbished if tissue is located inside the catheter after sterilization. Typically telemeters can be used 4-5 times before needing to be refurbished.\nSubscription Required.
