    "Isolation and preparation of peritoneal cavity cells (refer to explicative video to follow steps 5–10) Anesthetize the mouse via subcutaneous injection of 500 µL of ketamine/xylazine (see Recipes) using a 1 mL syringe with a 26 G needle.Euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation.Place the mouse on its back on the Styrofoam block.Spray the mouse with 70% ethanol (see Recipes). Using dissecting forceps and mayo scissors, grab and cut the external skin of the peritoneum.Separate the skin until approximately 3 cm of the peritoneum is exposed.Pull up the peritoneum skin with dissecting forceps and elevate it (see Video 1).Inject 4 mL of RPMI supplemented with 0.2% FBS in the peritoneal cavity using a 5 mL syringe with a 24 G needle. Insert the needle gently in the area held with dissecting forceps.After injection, clamp the area with hemostatic forceps and gently massage the peritoneum to release cells.Using iris scissors, perform an incision in the peritoneum wall in the area above the clamp. Holding the hemostatic forceps, flip the mouse face down in a 50 mL Falcon tube. Alternatively, peritoneal lavage collection could be performed using a plastic Pasteur pipette.Once there, open the clamp, release, and collect peritoneal fluid.Centrifuge the peritoneal fluid collected at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL of RPMI supplemented with 0.2% FBS.Count viable cells using trypan blue (1:2 dilution) and a hemacytometer.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Peritoneal Lavage. Note: Intraperitoneal anesthesia is not recommended due to its inflammatory effect on peritoneal cells. It is important to anesthetize mice before cervical dislocation to facilitate precise manipulation and avoid blood infiltration in the peritoneal cavity.",
    "To prevent damage on peritoneal cavity organs and avoid collection of blood or other fluids with peritoneal fluid, it is important to be very careful when injecting, clamping, and cutting the peritoneum. The use of a 24 G needle for the peritoneal lavage is crucial. A bigger needle will damage the peritoneum and the organs in the cavity. At least 1 min of peritoneal mice massage is required to recover as many cells as possible from the peritoneal cavity. The technique used for the peritoneal lavage ensures the complete recovery of the volume injected in the peritoneal cavity and, therefore, maximum cell recovery. With this protocol, at least 5 × 106 cells per animal will be recovered. After animal sacrifice, all procedures should not exceed 5 min to maximize cell viability. After collection, it is important to maintain peritoneal cavity cells on ice. For optimal peritoneal cell counting, it is recommended to use a final 1:20 dilution. Dilute the cells 1:10 in RPMI supplemented with 0.2% FBS and then dilute 1:2 with trypan blue.  Flow cytometry staining protocol Use three wells for each sample to be analyzed: one for SIRT6 staining and the others for SIRT6 antibody control and secondary antibody control (see detailed control information in Table 1). For Single Stain (SS) and No Stain (NS), mix the remaining cells from all samples and plate them. In all cases, plate 2 × 105 cells in each well.Centrifuge the cells at 500 × g for 2 min.Aspirate and discard supernatant with a multichannel pipette and wash with 100 µL of PBS. Alternatively, the supernatant could be decanted by inversion of the plate.Centrifuge cells at 500 × g for 2 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend all sample wells in 10 µL of fixable viability dye (see Table 2).",
    "For SS and NS wells, resuspend in 10 µL of PBS.Incubate the plate 10 min at room temperature, protected from light.Add 15 µL of 15% NRS (see Recipes) to each well (including SS and NS) and resuspend the cells.Incubate 20 min on ice protected from light.Add 25 µL of surface staining mix (see Table 2) to each sample well and resuspend cells. For SS wells, add the antibody selected for each fluorophore [e.g., for PE SS, use PE Anti-F4/80 (see Table 2 for each SS)]. For NS wells, add and resuspend in 25 µL of FACS buffer (see Recipes).Incubate 30 min on ice protected from light.Centrifuge cells at 500 × g for 2 min.Discard supernatant and wash with 100 µL of FACS buffer.Repeat steps 11 and 12.Discard supernatant and resuspend all cells in 100 µL of transcription factor staining fixation/permeabilization reagent (prepared as described by manufacturer).Incubate overnight at 4 °C protected from light.Centrifuge cells at 500 × g for 2 min.Discard supernatant and wash with 100 µL of transcription factor staining permeabilization buffer (prepared as described by manufacturer).Repeat steps 16 and 17.Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 20 µL of anti-SIRT6 antibody to each SIRT6 staining and secondary antibody control wells. For SIRT6 antibody control, SS, and NS, resuspend in 20 µL of transcription factor staining permeabilization Buffer.Incubate 30 min on ice protected from light.Centrifuge cells at 500 × g for 2 min.Discard supernatant and wash with 100 µL of transcription factor staining permeabilization buffer (prepared as described by manufacturer).Centrifuge cells at 500 × g for 2 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend in 20 µL of conjugated secondary antibody to SIRT6 staining wells and SIRT6 control wells of each sample. For secondary antibody control, SS, and NS, add 20 µL of transcription factor staining permeabilization buffer.",
    "Incubate 1 h on ice protected from light.Discard supernatant and wash with 100 µL of transcription factor staining permeabilization buffer.Centrifuge cells at 500 × g for 2 min.Repeat steps 26 and 27.Discard supernatant and resuspend all wells in 100 µL of FACS buffer.Transfer the content of each well to Eppendorf tubes.Add up to 400 µL of additional FACS buffer to each tube.Acquire between 2 × 104 and 5 × 104 events per sample in the flow cytometer. Note: For SS and NS, one well per fluorophore used in staining (SS conditions) and one additional well for NS condition are necessary. The transfer of the content of each well to appropriate tubes is only necessary if using a flow cytometer without a plate handler. The additional FACS buffer volume needed in each tube depends on the flow cytometer used. For AttuneTM NxT flow cytometer ,Table 1. Antibody controls description.
