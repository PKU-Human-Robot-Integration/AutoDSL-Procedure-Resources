    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissection\nTiming: approximately 10–15 min\nThis step aims to remove the undesired organs and primordia to expose the meristems to be observed.\nFor both vegetative and inflorescence meristem, prepare a stem approximately 0.6 cm long that harbors the apex (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B):\nTo observe vegetative meristem, cut off the root and excess hypocotyl with the needle of an insulin syringe (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nTo observe inflorescence meristem, remove the flowers and larger primordia from the base of the peduncles with tweezers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: This can be done under a stereomicroscope.\nPut the apex into the dissection dish:\nUse an insulin syringe to pierce a hole vertically in the dissection dish and slightly enlarge the hole.\nInsert the apex vertically into the hole via tweezers.\nPress the petioles of cotyledons or the remaining peduncles to insert the apex deeply into the dissection dish, leaving only the remaining organs outside the agarose (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: A strong stem facilitates dissection, and caution should be taken to avoid harming the stem when removing larger organs and when inserting the apex into the dissection dish. Minimize the space between the apex stem and agarose to hold the apex firmly. This can be accomplished by collecting agarose from other parts of the dissection dish and filling it around the apex.\nRemove undesired organs and primordia from the base with the syringe needle under a stereomicroscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). If time-lapse imaging is needed, perform the dissection in a laminar-flow hood. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].",
    "Critical: Keeping the apex fresh is critical for dissection and staining. We strongly recommend recovering the apex by keeping it in 1/2-strength MS media topped with water for several minutes after dissection, although staining directly is also feasible. If dissection is performed in a laminar-flow hood, set the airflow speed to the lowest level (e.g. 20% of the maximum airflow speed).\nStaining\nTiming: 10 min\nThis step aims to stain cell contours using chemical dyes to facilitate visualization. FM4-64 and PI are the most commonly used staining dyes for cell outlines. FM4-64 is a lipophilic dye that can bind the cell membrane,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] whereas PI labels pectin of the cell wall.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] We present primordia stained by FM4-64 and PI in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], respectively, to demonstrate the staining effects. Note that some signals may be seen inside the cell because FM4-64 can be internalized by endocytosis when staining time is too long, and PI is permeant in damaged cells and may bind to DNA.\nDilute the dye stock 20 times in a 200 μL Eppendorf tube.\nPut the dissected apex top down into the dye solution and ensure that the top is submerged. Stain for 6 min (for FM4-64) or 8 min (for PI) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCritical: Remove any residual water with filter paper before putting the apex into the dye. The diluted dye can be kept at room temperature (20°C–30°C) and should be discarded when its color changed.\nLive imaging via a confocal microscopy\nTiming: 10–30 min\nThis step uses confocal microscope to image meristems. Although this protocol used an upright confocal microscope for imaging, inverted confocal microscopes can also be used in accordance with other protocols.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nPrepare imaging dish with apex:",
    "Insert the stained apex vertically into the imaging dish. Use imaging dish for single-time point imaging and live imaging dish for time-lapse imaging.\nFill the imaging dish with sterile deionized water to submerge the apex completely.\nNote: To avoid osmotic changes, deionized water can be replaced with 0.2 M mannitol.\nLower the microscope stage to the lowest position and put the prepared imaging dish onto it (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: To avoid apex displacement during the imaging process, which may cause blurring of the reconstructed 3D image, we recommend leaving the apex in the imaging dish to stand for a few minutes before image acquisition, especially when deionized water is used.\nUse a water-immersion lens with proper magnification for imaging. Raise the stage to dip the lens into the water, and take care to avoid crushing the samples or generating air bubbles between the lens and samples (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nChoose the proper parameters to acquire images, use software to construct 3D images, and proceed to further analysis. Detailed information about confocal microscope equipment and settings used for Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] as a reference. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2575_6.csv\nCritical: Small z-step size is critical for improving the Z-axis resolution for subsequent fine signal analysis. However, this usually prolongs the imaging time, which may cause fluorescence bleaching and may damage the samples, a detrimental issue for time-lapse imaging.\nCulture (only for time-lapse imaging)\nTiming: 1 day or other durations (as needed)\nThis step aims to culture the dissected and imaged apex for time-lapse imaging.\nRetrieve the dissected apex from the imaging dish, and remove the water. Gently insert it into 1/2-strength MS media and culture under the appropriate conditions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].",
    "After culturing for the required time (such as 24 h), repeat the staining and imaging step again. If necessary, dissect to remove older primordia before imaging."
