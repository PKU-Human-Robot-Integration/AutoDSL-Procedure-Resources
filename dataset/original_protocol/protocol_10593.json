    "1. The Portable Chemical Sterilizer (PCS)\nEquipment. The PCS is an innovative device for portable, energy-independent, point-of-use medical sterilization. For these purposes, a commercial PELICAN rigid plastic suitcase was embellished with special design features to accommodate sterilization (Figure 1).\nEquipment Design. a) A wide-mouthed reaction vessel receives the dry chemical reagents and water; b) two check valves installed in the case wall relieves pressure at 1 psi; c) a filtered inlet valve allows air to be pumped in for flushing the chamber; d) a circulating tube distributes air through the chamber post-sterilization; e) disposable dry scrubber (activated carbon) devices engrafted over the outlet check valves remove residuals and ensure the health and safety of the user and environment; and f) stilts in the base of the case accommodate a surgical instrument tray or other perforated tray and maximize gas-flow during flushing.\nOperation. Place the PCS on a level surface and open the lid. Place a surgical tray containing clean, non-sterile instruments and wrapped in blue autoclave paper on the stilts inside the case. Mix dry chemicals and water (e.g., 93 g sodium chlorite, 63 g sodium sulfite, 25 g sodium hydrogen ascorbate, and 300 ml water – other permutations are possible) in the wide-mouthed reaction vessel to initiate chemical reaction, then close and lock the lid. In under 2 min, the reaction produces copious chlorine dioxide sterilant, heat, and humidity. At 25 min, connect a battery-operated or hand-powered air pump to the inlet valve and flow air into the chamber for approx. 5 min (Figure 2).",
    "Cycle Completion and Re-use. Open the case and remove the surgical tray of sterile instruments. Dispose of the reaction vessel (water and benign chemical salts). The PCS is available for immediate re-use with another tray of surgical instruments and a fresh set of dry chemicals and water.\nValidating Sterilization with Bio-indicators. Place commercially available B/T Sure Biological Indicators containing spores impregnated on paper (~105 spores/unit) of either G. stearothermophilus (used for wet heat) or B. atrophaeus (used for ethylene oxide gas sterilization) inside the case for a sterilization cycle. At completion of the ClO2 sterilization cycle, remove and activate the indicators, then incubate indicators for 24-48 hr to validate sterilization.\nValidating Sterilization with Spore Suspensions. Place aqueous suspensions of G. stearothermophilus spores (~105 cfu/ml) inside the PCS for exposure to a ClO2 sterilization cycle. Recover G. stearothermophilus spores exposed to the chlorine dioxide treatments on Antibiotic Assay Medium with 1% soluble starch8 (no recovery indicates sterility). Examine refractility of treated spores with phase contrast microscopy (spores inactivated by ClO2 retain phase bright character14).\nValidating Sterilization of Hard Surfaces. Inoculate hard, non-porous surfaces made of glass or metal with aqueous suspensions (~105) of G. stearothermophilus spores. Place inoculated materials into the PCS for treatment with a ClO2 sterilization cycle. Sampling the treated surfaces with commercially available Difco HY-Check swabs and obtaining no-growth confirms sterility.\n2. “D-FENS”\nEquipment. “D-FENS” is a collapsible handheld bottle fitted with a hand-operated spray-trigger device. The flexible plastic bottle has a gusseted bottom to stand-up when full, and the chemically-resistant plastic affords multiple re-uses per sprayer (Figure 3).",
    "Generate Aqueous ClO2 Solution. D-FENS uses 1-10 g total quantity of dry reagents to generate up to 800 ml of 50 − 500 ppm chlorine dioxide solution (e.g., 4.7 g sodium chlorite, 1.6 g sodium sulfite, and 1.3 g sodium ascorbate, with permutations possible). Use “kinetics control,” a novel 2-step mixing process comprising: i. Pre-concentration − dissolving all reagents in a small volume, and ii. Post-reaction dilution – diluting the solution to its final working volume, to generate aqueous chlorine dioxide solutions in the spray-bottle in 2-9 min. The disinfectant solution is sprayed as a fine mist or aerosol to disinfect or decontaminate intended surfaces. The chlorine dioxide solution in D-FENS remains stable for a minimum 8 hr shift and any remaining solution can be emptied down sink or floor drains at the end of a shift to purge biofilms.\nMicrobiological Validation – inoculating porous surfaces. Prepare Petri dishes of Baird-Parker Agar (BPA) containing egg yolk tellurite (EYT) and Yeast Extract (YE) and inoculate agar surface with 0.1 ml of a ~106 cfu/ml suspension of a 3-strain cocktail of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus A-100 that produces enterotoxin A, S. aureus ATCC 14458 that produces enterotoxin B, and S. aureus 993 that produces enterotoxin D)7. S. aureus was selected as the target organism because it produces distinctively obvious black colonies, if not inactivated.",
    "Microbiological Validation – Testing Porous Surfaces. Using the D-FENS spray bottle containing chlorine dioxide solution, spray the disinfectant solution onto the porous agar surface. Use consistent, steady force to dispense approximately equal volumes of solution per spray-trigger pulse. Rotate the plates 90º between successive pulses to apply uniform coverage of the agar surface. Also use this technique with a glass hockey stick and applying light pressure to spread chlorine dioxide solution over the agar surface for mechanical abrasion (equivalent to wiping or scrubbing – see Figure 4).\nMicrobiological Validation – Hard Surfaces. Inoculate sterilized custom stainless steel (type 304) coupons (4” x 4”, with total surface area 10.16 cm2) with 0.2 ml volume of aqueous suspensions of bacterial cells (e.g., S. aureus, Escherichia coli, or Listeria monocytogenes) and spread inocula uniformly across coupon surface. Air-dry coupons for 30 min at room temperature in laminar flow hood. Pick up inoculated coupons with sterile forceps and immerse in 20 ml test solution containing chlorine dioxide in a 100 ml stomacher bag. After contact times of 0.5 to 5 min, quench the sanitizer solution by adding a small amount of sodium sulfite solid, then masticate solution for 2 min in a stomacher. Remove bag and in a laminar flow hood withdraw supernatant and serially dilute solution onto pre-made agar plates, then incubate for 24 hr to enumerate survivors.\n3. The PCS for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables\nThe ability of reduced PCS treatments to kill harmful foodborne pathogens (E. coli and L. monocytogenes) on fresh produce was tested using a spot-inoculation method in which high levels of pathogens were spotted onto the exterior surfaces of tomato wedges.",
    "Inoculation. Inoculate the exterior surfaces of 25 gram samples of tomato wedges with either 105 CFU/g L. monocytogenes OSY-8578 or with 106 CFU/g E. coli ATCC 11229, then air-dry in a sterile bio-hood for 15 min.\nPCS treatment. After the inoculum dries, place the tomato wedges (wear sterile gloves) in the PCS and test under various conditions of chlorine dioxide concentration and exposure time. In some instances, place spore bio-indicators of G. stearothermophilus and B. atrophaeus inside the PCS to accompany the tomato wedges and validate the sterilization treatment (Figure 5).\nMicrobial Recovery. After the PCS treatment, place tomato wedges in a stomacher bag with 50 ml of aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 7), then masticate for 2 min with a stomacher blender.\nEnumeration. Dispense the masticated solution as serially 10-fold dilutions onto agar plates Tryptic Soy Agar-Yeast Extract (TSAYE) and nutrient agar (NA) for L. monocyotgenes and E. coli, respectively, and spread with a glass hockey stick, cover and incubate plates at T = 35 °C for 24-48 hr. Enumerate survivors using a colony counter to confirm microbial inactivation.\nInactivating Polyphenoloxidase (“browning”) Enzymes. Place uninoculated apple slices in separate Petri dishes inside the PCS and expose to chlorine dioxide (Figure 5). After treatment, remove the Petri dishes and expose the apple slices in the ambient environment. Visual observation showed no browning for up to 1 week post-treatment.\n4. “D-FEND ALL”\nGenerate Aqueous ClO2 Solution. D-FEND ALL uses small quantities of dry chemicals (chlorite and SAMIA) in water to generate chlorine dioxide solution in 0.5-3.0 min. For example, mix 0.8-3.3 g of reagents in 15-1,200 ml of aqueous solution to produce a chlorine dioxide solution.",
    "Microbiological Validation – Textiles. Inoculate sterile strips of textile samples with aqueous suspensions of Bacillus anthracis Sterne or Bacillus amyloliquefaciens spores, and let textile strips air-dry in a laminar flow hood. Pick up strips with sterile forceps and immerse in 20 ml of chlorine dioxide solution in a 100 ml stomacher bag. At 10 min, quench process without affecting spores by adding a small amount of sodium sulfite solid, then masticate textile strip and solution for 2 min in a stomacher. Remove bag and in a laminar flow hood serially dilute solution onto pre-made agar plates, then incubate for 24 hr and enumerate to validate decontamination.\nSubscription Required.
