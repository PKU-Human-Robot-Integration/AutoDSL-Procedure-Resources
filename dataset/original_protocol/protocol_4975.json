    "Preparation: design and order CRISPR gRNA oligosDesign target gRNA oligonucleotides using any of the online designing tools such as the optimized CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/[href=http://crispr.mit.edu/]).Notes: Because the gRNA expression cassette utilizes a human U6 promoter, the first nucleotide of the CRISPR target site should preferably be a ‘G’ to ensure efficient transcription.It is also very important to exclude gRNA oligonucleotides that contain any of the following type IIS restriction sites: BbsI, BsaI, and BsmBI.For target sites starting with a ‘G’, add the following four nucleotide overhangs to the sense (SS) and antisense (AS) gRNA oligonucleotides:SS: 5’CACC(N20)AS: 5’AAAC(N20) For target sites not stating with a ‘G’, add the following overhangs:SS: 5’CACCG(N20)AS: 5’AAAC(N20)COrder oligonucleotides from any qualified company, dilute the oligonucleotides to a stock concentration of 100 pmol/µl (µM) and store at -20 °C. (Standard desalted purification of the oligos is sufficient).Annealing of gRNA oligosAnneal the sense and antisense gRNA oligonucleotides for each gRNA in separate 1.5 ml EP tubes:Sense gRNA oligo: 1 µl (100 pmol/µl)Antisense gRNA oligo: 1 µl (100 pmol/µl)10x NEB buffer 2: 2 µlAdd ddH2O to a final volume of 20 µl. Denature the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min in a heating block.Place the heating block on the lab bench and slowly anneal oligonucleotides until mixture is at room temperature (which takes approximately 1-2 h).Quick-spin the annealed gRNA oligonucleotides to the bottom of the tubes and store at -20 °C for later use or proceed with the following experimental procedure.Vector cloningUsing this protocol, the generation of the gRNA expression array vector is accomplished in 5 days (for 1 to 10 gRNA expression cassettes) to 7 days (for 11 to 30 cassettes). See schematic in Figure 2 for an overview.",
    "In the protocol, the location of a target site in the CRISPR expression array is referred to as T# (#, an integer between 1 and 30 denoting the order of the gRNAs). The protocol utilizes 10 individual gRNA expression cassettes that are tandemly assembled into a set of ‘array’ vectors depending on the number of cassettes, where each array vector contains up to 10 cassettes. When assembling 11-30 cassettes, multiple array vectors are finally assembled into a single vector. The selection of plasmids for assembly is described in step C3c, Table 3. A schematic illustration is given in Figure 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130175812_1498.jpgFigure 2. Protocol overview. Day to day overview of the protocol. For assembly 1 to 10 gRNA expression cassettes, the protocol is completed after miniprep of positive colonies at day 5. For assembling 11 to 30 gRNA expression cassettes, an additional round of assembly is performed at day 5 and completed after day 7.Day 1. Ligation of gRNA oligonucleotides into individual modular single gRNA expression vectorsSelect pMA plasmids for annealed gRNA oligonucleotides T1-TN (N ≤ 30) generated in step B4 according to the table below (pMA-SpCas9-g1 for T1, pMA-SpCas9-g2 for T2, …, pMA-SpCas9-g1 for T11, pMA-SpCas9-g2 for T12, …, pMA-SpCas9-g1 for 21, pMA-SpCas9-g2 for T22, etc.) (Table 2).Table 2. Assembly scheme of modular single gRNA expression vectors and annealed gRNA oligonucleotides. This table illustrates how to choose the right single modular plasmids (pMA-SpCas9-g1 to pMA-SpCas9-10) for cloning of the gRNA oligonucleotides into individual gRNA expression plasmids (named pMA-T# after successful cloning). The number of each gRNA represents the position of the gRNA in the tandem gRNA expression array.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130180010_3668.jpgPrepare assembly reaction in individual PCR tubes containing:100 ng modular single gRNA expression plasmid (pMA-SpCas9-g#).1 µl of annealed gRNA oligonucleotide from step B4 (T#).1 µl BbsI restriction enzyme.1 µl T4 DNA ligase.",
    "2 µl 10x T4 ligase buffer (to a final concentration of 1x).Nuclease-free water up to 20 µl total reaction volume.Incubate the reactions in a thermal cycler with the following conditions:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130180238_0991.jpg Transform competent E. coli using 2 µl of the ligation product. Note: Protocols for generation of competent E. coli and transformation are available from the authors upon request. Plate (1/10) transformed cells on a 10 cm LB agar plate containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin.Note: Do not over-plate the cells.Incubate agar plates at 37 °C overnight.Day 2. 1st colony screening and culturePick two to three colonies from each transformation using a 10 or 100 µl pipette tip.Dip the pipette tip in 100 µl LB medium (50 µg/ml ampicillin) to start initial culture. Transfer the pipette tip to a PCR tube containing 30 µl nuclease-free water and pipette up and down to release cells. Note: The initial culture and PCR tube should be labeled with the same ID. If working with over 10 gRNAs, we normally use two sets of 200 µl PCR tubes, one set for the initial culture and the other set for the cell lysate. Place the initial culture tubes in a 37 °C incubator.Place the PCR tubes in a thermal cycler at 98 °C for 10 min to lyse cells.Perform gRNA PCR screenings of cell lysates. Add to each reaction:1 µl transformed E. coli lysate.5 pmol universal U6 Forward primer (Table 1).5 pmol antisense oligonucleotide of the gRNA in question.0.4 µl dNTP (10 mM).0.1 µl DreamTaq polymerase (or similar).2 µl 10x DreamTaq buffer (to final concentration of 1x).Nuclease-free water to 20 µl total reaction volume.Example: For colony screening of pMA-SpCas9-T1, PCR is performed for 2-3 picked colonies using the universal U6 promoter as the forward primer and T1-antisense oligonucleotide as the reverse primer.",
    "Incubate the PCR reactions in a thermal cycler with the following conditions:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130180614_4715.jpgVisualize PCR product on a 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis. The expected amplicon size is approximately 270 bp.Select one positive colony from each transformation and transfer 50 µl of initial culture to individual tubes containing 5 ml LB medium with 50 µg/ml ampicillin. Incubate overnight at 37 °C in an orbital shaker.Day 3. Plasmid prep and assembly of individual gRNA expression cassettes into the ‘array’ plasmidsIsolate the plasmid DNA (named pMA-T#) from the overnight cultures using a commercial miniprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Validate the single gRNA expression plasmids by Sanger sequencing using the universal U6 primer (recommended).Select array plasmids for 1st assembly of single gRNA expression plasmids according to Table 3:Table 3. Selection of array plasmids for assembly of pMA-T# vectors. Selection of array plasmids depends on the number of gRNA expression cassettes to be assembled. For assembly of 1-10 gRNA cassettes (Left), one of the pFUS-B# array plasmids is selected depending on the number of gRNA cassettes. When assembling 11-20 gRNA cassettes (Middle), pFUS-A is selected for the assembly of gRNA cassettes 1 to 10. For the remaining cassettes (≤ 10), one of the pFUS-B# array plasmids is selected depending on the number of gRNA cassettes. For assembly of 21-30 gRNA cassettes (Right), pFUS-A30A is used for assembly of the first 10 gRNA expression cassettes. pFUS-A30B is used for assembling gRNA cassettes 11 to 20. The remaining cassettes (≤ 10) are cloned into a pFUS-B# array plasmid depending on the number of gRNA cassettes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161204/20161204224556_7489.jpgSet up Golden Gate assembly reactions in individual PCR tubes containing:30 ng array plasmid.Note: The plasmid amount has been optimized.50 ng of each individual modular single gRNA plasmid (maximum of 10 plasmids).1 µl BsaI restriction enzyme.1 µl T4 DNA ligase.",
    "2 µl 10x T4 ligase buffer (to a final concentration of 1x).Nuclease-free water to 20 µl total reaction volume.Incubate the reactions in a thermal cycler with the following conditions:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130182056_0134.jpgAdd 1 µl 25 mM ATP and 1 µl plasmid safe DNase to the reaction.Note: Plasmid safe DNase treatment digests all unligated linear dsDNA fragments, incomplete assembly products and linearized vectors. This step minimizes the risk of in vivo recombination of linearized dsDNA fragments in the competent cell. This step is very important when assembling more than five gRNA expression cassettes.Incubate the reactions in a thermal cycler for 1 h at 37 °C.Transform competent E. coli cells using 2 µl of the assembled product.Plate (1/20) of the transformed cells on 10 cm LB agar plates containing 50 µg/ml spectinomycin as well as 8 µl 100 mg/µl X-gal and 8 µl 0.5 M IPTG for blue/white colony screening.Incubate agar plates at 37 °C overnight.Day 4. 2nd colony screening and cultureInspect plates for positive white colonies. The expected ratio of white to blue colonies is at least 25% for successful assembly of 10 gRNA expression cassettes and will increase gradually with a decreased number of gRNA expression cassettes (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161130/20161130182429_5778.jpgFigure 3.

Right: Universal PCR for M10 screening of 8 white colonies. Lanes 1-4 and 7-8 show multiple bands resembling a ladder indicative of a positive colony. Lanes 5 and 6 only show the two dominant bands without a ladder indicative of an incorrect insertion.Pick two to three white colonies from each transformation as described for Day 2.Set up PCR screening reactions for all picked colonies in individual PCR tubes containing:1 µl transformed E. coli lysate.",

The correct amplification pattern should be a ‘ladder’ with a dominant band at approximately 400 bp and an increase of 392 bp for each ‘step’ corresponding to each additional gRNA expression cassette included in the amplification (Figure 3B).Select one positive colony from each transformation and transfer 50 µl of initial culture to individual tubes containing 5 ml LB medium with 50 µg/ml spectinomycin.Incubate overnight at 37 °C in an orbital shaker.Day 5. Plasmid DNA prep and 2nd assembly for plasmids containing 11 to 30 expression cassettesIsolate the plasmid DNA from the overnight cultures using a commercial miniprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Validate the assembled array plasmids by restriction enzyme digestion. In a 1.5 ml EP tube, add:0.5 µg assembled array plasmid DNA.1 µl AflII restriction enzyme.1 µl XbaI restriction enzyme.2 µl 10x reaction buffer (to a final concentration of 1x).Nuclease-free water to 20 µl total reaction volume.Visualize digestion product on a 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis.Note: The expected size of the released expression cassette is approximately 4 kb for 10 cassettes (~400 bp per gRNA expression cassette). We strongly recommend generating a theoretical sequence map for each multiplex vector. The RFLP results will be different if there are AflII or Xbal recognition sites in any of the gRNA guide sequences.For further validation of the assembled array plasmid, set up guide specific PCRs for all gRNA expression cassettes present in the array vector in individual PCR tubes.",
    "Add to each PCR reaction:1 ng array plasmid DNA.5 pmol sense oligonucleotide of the specific gRNA in pMA-TN as the forward primer.5 pmol antisense oligonucleotide of the next specific gRNA in pMA-TN+1 as the reverse primer.0.4 µl dNTP.0.1 µl DreamTaq polymerase (or similar).2 µl 10x DreamTaq buffer (to a final concentration of 1x).Nuclease-free water to 20 µl total reaction volume.Example: For validation of assembled pFUS-B4-M4, three individual PCR reactions should be performed. The first one is with the SS oligonucleotide of T1 as the forward primer and the AS oligonucleotide of T2 as the reverse primer. The second one is with the SS oligonucleotide of T2 as the forward primer and the AS oligonucleotide of T3 as the reverse primer. The third one is with the SS oligonucleotide of T3 as the forward primer and the AS oligonucleotide of T4 as the reverse primer.

To individual PCR tubes, add:1 µl transformed E. coli lysate.5 pmol sense oligonucleotide of the last gRNA (T10 or T20) in the first or second expression cassette array as the forward primer.5 pmol antisense oligonucleotide of the first gRNA (T11 or T21) in the second or third expression cassette array as the reverse primer.0.4 µl dNTP.0.1 µl DreamTaq polymerase (or similar).2 µl 10x DreamTaq buffer (to a final concentration of 1x).Nuclease-free water to 20 µl total reaction volume.Example: For validation of assembled pMsgRNA-EGFP-M30 (array plasmid containing 30 gRNA expression cassettes generated from the assembly of pFUS-A30A – pFUS-A30B – pFUS-B10), two individual overlap PCR reactions are performed. The first reaction uses the sense (SS) oligonucleotide of T10 as the forward primer and the antisense (AS) oligonucleotide of T11 as the reverse primer. The second uses the SS oligonucleotide of T20 as the forward primer and the AS oligonucleotide of T21 (Figure 5).
