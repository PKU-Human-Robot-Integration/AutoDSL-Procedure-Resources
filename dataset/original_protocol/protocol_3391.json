During this incubation time, the plates can be kept inside the hood by keeping the lids open.\nSeed U2OS cells at about 60%–70% (0.3–0.4∗106 cells/ well) confluency on the coverslips.\nIncubate the plate in 5% humidified CO2 incubator for 16–24 h.\nDay: 2\nTiming: 3 h\nDilute CCCP working stock (conc. 20 mM) to a final concentration of 20 μM with McCoy’s 5A media.\nUse DMSO as a vehicle control.\nAspirate the old media from the wells.\nAdd 2 mL of DMSO/ CCCP containing media in each well.\nIncubate for 2 h in the incubator.\nAfter incubation, remove the media.\nWash the wells with 2 mL 1X PBS.\nAdd 4% Formaldehyde solution (2 mL/well) and incubate for 15 min.\nWash three times with 1X PBS for 5 min each.\nAdd 2 mL PBS to each well.\nNote: After this step, the cells can be immediately used for staining or can be stored at 4°C until the next day.\nStaining and imaging of the cells\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step explains the steps from the staining of the cells to the imaging.\nDay: 1\nTiming: 4 h\nRemove the PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of permeabilization buffer to each well and incubate for 15 min.\nAspirate the permeabilization buffer.\nWash three times in 1X PBS for 5 min each.",
    "Add 1 mL of Goat Serum to each well and incubate for 1–2 h.\nAfter incubation, wash the coverslips once with 1X PBS.\nPrepare the staining chamber by keeping parafilm on top of a wet blotting paper in closed environment.\nDilute the primary antibodies in antibody dilution buffer and incubate for 2 hrs.\nTransfer the coverslips from the 6-well dish to the staining chamber by using a fine-tip tweezer and incubate it with 30‒40 μL primary antibody solution.\nAfter incubation with the primary antibody, transfer the coverslips back to the 6 well dish and wash them for 3 times with 1X PBS.\nDilute the secondary antibodies in antibody dilution buffer and incubate for 1 hr.\nWash coverslips for 3 times with 1X PBS.\nClean the glass slides with 70% alcohol.\nInvert and mount the coverslips with Fluoromount G and leave it to dry overnight.\nNote: We recommend the use of ATP5A (inner mitochondrial membrane marker) or Tom20 or Tom70 (outer mitochondrial membrane marker) antibodies (1:300 dilution) to check mitochondrial morphology.\nDay: 2\nTiming: 2 h\nProceed for imaging. Images can be acquired either as individual images or Z-stacks.\nIf the images are acquired as Z stacks, maximal projection images can be created and used for quantification. This quantification protocol can identify mitochondrial subclasses from both types of images.\nIn DMSO-treated cells mitochondria appear as long, branched structures which create a network (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], left image). Comparatively CCCP treated cells mitochondria appear as punctate or dotted structures (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], right image).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3157-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. U2OS cells treated with DMSO (used as vehicle control, left) or CCCP (20 μM for 2 h, right)\nMitochondria is stained with ATP5a antibody and nuclear staining is done with Hoechst. Scale bar 10 μM.\nAfter imaging save/convert image files into the TIFF format for further analysis.",
    "Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]: U2OS cells treated with DMSO (used as vehicle control, left) or CCCP (20 μM for 2 h, right). Mitochondria are stained with ATP5a antibody and nuclear staining is done with Hoechst. Scale bar 10 μM. Images were captured using 60x objective in Leica SP8 microscope.\nQuantification analysis\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step explains the image processing steps required to quantify the ratio of network and punctate mitochondria using Fiji software. Exact values may need to be modified based on quality images.\nOpen the image stack in Fiji.\nSubtract background noise In the Fiji menu window, select Process > Subtract Background, and set the rolling ball radius to 50.0 pixels.\nApply a low median filter to smooth intensity variation within structures: Process >Filters > Median and set the radius to 1 pixel.\nBinarize: Process > Binary > Make Binary > Default, select “Calculate threshold for each image”\nDespeckle to remove excess noise: Process > Noise > Despeckle.\nPause and manually check each image to ensure effective binarization. If features are lost, try a different filter and pixel size, or thresholding method for binarization.\nOpen classifier trainer: Plugins > Segmentation > Trainable Weka Segmentation.\nMake 3 classes by selecting “Create new class”, and label them network, puncta, and background.\nUsing the wand tool from the Fiji menu, select 5 networks and puncta, one at a time, and add to their respective label. Avoid using shapes with holes. Select 5 areas of background by drawing shapes in the background and add them to label.\nSelect “Train classifier”, with default settings.\nRefine the classifier if needed by adding more traces to labels. Repeat until satisfied with the classifier.\nSave the classifier, load the binarized image stack, and select “Apply classifier”. Reuse the same classifier for all subsequent image stacks.",
    "Convert the classified image stack to RGB: Image > Type > RGB Color.\nDuplicate the image stack.\nColor threshold for each stack to keep only networks in one and puncta in the other: Image > Adjust > Color threshold > move the bars under “Hue” to the threshold and select “Stack” to apply to all images.\nBinarize each stack: Process > Binary > Make Binary > Default.\nQuantify the total area of networks and puncta: Analyze > Analyze particles, select “Display results”.\nSave, open in Excel, and calculate the sum of all particles from each label. Add labels together to get the total area of mitochondria. Divide each labeled area by the total area to get the percentage of the total.\nNote: If planning on repeating protocol multiple times, record the pipeline as a macro on Fiji for automation.\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]: Quantification pipeline.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3157-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
