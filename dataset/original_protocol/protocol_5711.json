  "procedures": [
    "Prepare Schiff’s reagent solution (Recipe 1).Grow plants hydroponically.Indica rice: Germinate surface sterilized (with 0.01% mercuric chloride) rice seeds (undehusked) in Petri plates with cotton bed (absorbent cotton covered with Whatman 1 filter paper) soaked in Hoagland nutrient solution (Recipe 2) at 28 ± 2 °C in dark condition. Grow the germinated seedlings hydroponically on Hoagland nutrient solution (Recipe 2) at 26 ± 2 °C over a photoperiod of 14 h with a photon flux density of 220 μmol m-2 sec-1 (PAR) for 5 days and then pretreat with 500 µM CaCl2 solution for 24 h. Expose the pretreated seedlings to 100 µM AlCl3 solution (dilute from the stock solution, Recipe 4) containing 500 µM CaCl2 at pH 4.5 for 48 h and harvest root tips for histochemical assay.Note: Because of toxic nature of mercuric chloride (HgCl2), use of precautionary clothing is highly recommended.Assam tea: Plant the cuttings procured from local tea gardens, after pulling out the polythene sleeves and then acclimatize for 30-35 days in soil at 26 ± 2 °C over a photoperiod of 14 h with photon flux density of 220 μmol m-2 sec-1 (PAR). After acclimatization, grow tea plantlets hydroponically in pots with the nutrient solution (Recipe 3). Pre-culture the plants for a week in the nutrient solution (unsterile) before the application of Al3+ in the form of AlCl3, at a concentration of 250 µM. The pH is maintained at 4.2. After 3 days, harvest the root segments for histochemical assay.Indian mustard: Surface sterilize healthy seeds of Brassica juncea (L.) Czern & Coss with 0.01% HgCl2 and set for germination. Impart 1 mM CdCl2 and 2.5 mM ZnCl2 treatments (dilute from the stock solutions, Recipe 4) to seeds by placing in Petri plates with cotton bed soaked in the stress solutions when kept for germination.",
    "After 7th day, harvest the seedlings for histochemical study.Note: Since no carbohydrate source is added to the nutrient solution, so no bacterial contamination occurs.In another set of experiments, keep control samples apart from stress and allow to grow under normal unstressed condition (plants not treated with any of the stress factors).Excise (using a razor blade) root tissues for Indica rice and Assam tea. Transfer root tissues and whole seedlings of Indian mustard to 15 ml centrifuge tubes and add 5 ml of Schiff’s reagent solution to each tube. Note: Tissues should be completely immersed in the solution. Vacuum infiltrate the tissue samples dipped in Schiff’s reagent for 1-2 h and then rinsed with a sulfite solution for 10 min (Recipe 5).Note: The time for vacuum infiltration varies with tissue and plant age, should be kept until and unless a contrasting visual difference in Magenta coloration is obtained. A representative image that shows the extent of color change indicative of sufficient infiltration has been provided (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416012019_7419.jpgFigure 1. Representative image that shows the color change indicative of sufficient infiltration/treatment. Schiff’s reagent in Indica rice root (A) control, (B) stressed, scale bar = 1 cm; Assam tea roots (C) control, scale bar = 1 cm, (D) stressed, scale bar = 1 cm; and in Indian mustard seedling (E) control, scale bar = 1 cm, (F) 1 mM Cd treated seedling, scale bar = 1 cm, (G) 2.5 mM Zn treated seedling, scale bar = 1 cm.Wash thoroughly with distilled water to remove the extra stain and then bleach the tissue samples with bleaching solution (Recipe 6) for 5-10 min at 100 °C in a water bath. Note: Chlorophyll should be completely removed from tissue samples.",
    "After complete bleaching is achieved, carefully mount samples on slide (for rice and tea roots using needle and brush) and take photographs under a microscope at 10x magnification (Figure 2). Whereas for mustard, take direct photographs with a digital camera for seedlings (Figure 2). If required, store the tissue samples by completely dipping in storage solution at 4 °C (Recipe 7) for future photography sessions. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416012326_6239.jpgFigure 2. Histochemical determination of lipid peroxidation in different plant species by Schiff’s reagent. Detection of lipid peroxidation using Schiff’s reagents in Indica rice root (A) control, scale bar = 100 μm; (B) stressed, scale bar = 100 μm; Assam tea roots (C) control, scale bar = 100 μm, (D) stressed, scale bar = 100 μm; and in Indian mustard seedling (E) control, scale bar = 5 mm, (F) 1 mM Cd treated seedling, scale bar = 5 mm, (G) 2.5 mM Zn treated seedling, scale bar = 5 mm.Note: Root in Figure 2C looks brownish because of various phenolic compounds secreted by tea plant."
