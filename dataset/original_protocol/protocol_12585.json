    "1. The installation of the virtual machine\nDownload the virtual machine file from (https://github.com/zhenchengfang/DL-VM).\nDownload the VirtualBox software from https://www.virtualbox.org.\nDecompress the \".7z\" file using related software, such as \"7-Zip\", \"WinRAR\" or \"WinZip\".\nInstall the VirtualBox software by clicking the Next button in each step.\nOpen the VirtualBox software and click the New button to create a virtual machine.\nStep 6: Enter the specified virtual machine name in the \"Name\" frame, select Linux as the operating system in the \"Type\" frame, select Ubuntu in the \"Version\" frame and click the Next button.\nAllocate the memory size of the virtual machine. We recommend that users pull the button to the right-most part of the green bar to assign as much memory as possible to the virtual machine, and then click the Next button.\nChoose the Use an existing virtual hard disk file selection, select the file \"VM_Bioinfo.vdi\" downloaded from Step 1.1 and then click the Create button.\nClick the Star button to open the virtual machine.\n\t​NOTE: Figure 3 shows the screenshot of the desktop of the virtual machine.\n2. Create shared folders for files exchanging between the physical host and the virtual machine\nIn the physical host, create a shared folder named \"shared_host\", and on the desktop of the virtual machine, create a shared folder named \"shared_VM\".\nIn the Menu Bar of the virtual machine, click Devices, Shared Folder, Shared Folders Settings successively.\nClick the button in the upper right corner.\nSelect the shared folder in the physical host created in Step 2.1 and select the Auto-mount option. Click the OK button.\nRestart the virtual machine.\nClick the right click on the desktop of the virtual machine and open the terminal.\nCopy the follow command to the terminal:\n\t​sudo mount -t vboxsf shared_host ./Desktop/shared_VM",
    "When prompted for a password, enter \"1\" and hit the \"Enter\" key, as shown in Figure 4.\n3. Prepare the files for the training set and test set\nCopy all four sequence files in \"fasta\" format for the training and testing process to the \"shared_host\" folder of the physical host. In this way, all the files will also occur in the \"shared_VM\" folder of the virtual machine. Then, copy the files in the \"shared_VM\" folder to the \"DeepLearning\" folder of the virtual machine.\n4. Digitize the biological sequences using \"one-hot\" encoding form\nGo to the \"DeepLearning\" folder, click the right click and open the terminal. Type the following command:\n\t./onehot_encoding p_train.fasta n_train.fasta p_test.fasta n_test.fasta aa\n\t(for amino acid sequences)\nor\n\t./onehot_encoding p_train.fasta n_train.fasta p_test.fasta n_test.fasta nt\n\t(for nucleic acid sequences)\n\t​NOTE: A screenshot of this process is provided in Figure 5.\n5. Train and test the artificial neural network\nIn the terminal, type the following command as shown in Figure 6:\n\tpython train.py\n\tNOTE: The training process will begin.\nSubscription Required.
