    "Cell surface immunoprecipitationGrow N. meningitidis from frozen stock: Obtain a small amount of frozen culture with a sterile 200 µl tip, inoculate Columbia agar base (CAB) plate and spread to give single colonies. Incubate overnight (~18 h) at 35 °C with 5% CO2. Collect 20-30 colonies and spread over the entire surface of a CAB plate, using a sterile loop, and incubate for 4 h at 35 °C with 5% CO2. Individual colonies will not be seen at this stage.Recover bacteria by adding PBS to the plate and mixing the colonies into the PBS using a sterile loop. Remove the PBS/bacteria suspension using a P1000 micropipette (1 ml per plate, use half plate for each immunoprecipitation), centrifuge for 2 min at 13,000 x g at room temperature, Wash pellet three times with 1 volume PBS plus 1% BSA. For these and subsequent wash steps, pellet cells by centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 x g at room temperature, remove supernatant, add fresh buffer and resuspend the pellet.Notes: If using liquid culture instead of plates, we suggest harvesting cells at mid-log growth phase and conditions that favor the expression of virulence factors. We suggest researchers do a growth curve with their organism of interest or have good knowledge of how the organism grows in liquid media to be able to properly identify growth phases.Centrifugation conditions may vary according to the bacterium in question. The presence of lysed cells will increase the selection on non-surface proteins.Make every effort to ensure that early centrifugation steps will not disrupt cells while removing secreted proteins or components of lysed, dead cells (see Note 2).",
    "Suspend pellet from previous step in 1 ml of serum sample (control or test [items 17 and 18 of Materials and Reagents list, respectively]) and rotate for 90 min at 4 °C.Note: Proteins identified in the control serum samples should be disregarded in future analysis as they are likely to play no role in the immune response against the pathogen. Researchers should make sure the control sera they have is indeed negative against for the pathogen they are investigating.Pellet the cells (13,000 x g, 5 min, RT) and wash twice with PBS plus 1% BSA.Resuspend cells in 1 ml solubilization buffer and incubate for 60 min at 37 °C.Centrifuge sample (13,000 x g, 60 min, RT), collect supernatant and incubate with protein A/GUltraLink beads (50 μl) for 18 h at 4 °C with agitation or rolling.Centrifuge sample (2,500 x g, 2 min, RT), collect beads.Wash beads five times (2,500 x g, 2 min) with 1 volume solubilization buffer.Elute antibody:antigen complex with 1 volume SDS (1%) and boiling (10 min).Add 4 volumes of water and vortex to elute proteins. Centrifuge (2,500 x g, 3 min, RT), and collect supernatant; the increase in volume allows for a more efficient removal of proteins duringvortexing.Concentrate sample back to 50 μl so SDS concentration is back to 1% (approximately 45 min at 45 °C using Speed-Vac). At this point, the samples can be mixed with loading buffer and run on an SDS PAGE gel. Proceed to step B1. If the samples are being prepared for massspectrometry analysis, the proteins can be reduced and alkylated prior to separation. Reduce the eluted proteins by adding DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM and boil for 2 min (for 50 μl, add 0.5 μl of 1 M DTT stock solution).",
    "Add iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 50 mM (for 50 μl, add 2.5 μl of 1 M IAA stocksolution) and incubate for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.1D SDS-PAGE and sample digestionMix reduced, alkylated samples with loading buffer (item 23 of Materials and Reagents list) andboil for 5 min.Separate proteins by SDS-PAGE (12%, 1 mm thick, 10 cm long).Stain with SimplyBlueTM for 1 h and de-stain with ultra-pure water (according to manufacturer’s instructions–see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170501/20170501203655_2126.jpgFigure 1. Representative image of immunoprecipitated (IP) surface proteins of the  meningococcus. Reproduced from Newcombe et al. (2014).Cut gel lanes in as many slices as necessary based on sample protein concentration and place slices in low protein bind tubes.Note: A full gel lane can be cut into 20 slices, however, it may only be necessary to run a shortened gel and cutting it into 5 slices.Wash gel slices with 50% acetonitrile in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate twice with vortexing for 15 min at room temperature to remove stain–use enough volume to cover the gel slices.Dehydrate gel slice by incubation with 100% acetonitrile (20 min, room temperature).Dry gel pieces using a Speed-Vac to dryness (about 20 min).Rehydrate in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing modified trypsin (12.5 ng/μl–the final volume will depend on the size of the gel slice, 4 °C for 10 min). If required add more 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate to cover gel pieces, incubate overnight at 37 °C.Remove digest solution, extract digested proteins by incubation with 30 μl 0.1% formic acid/50% acetonitrile for 20-30 min with vortexing followed by 5 min in a sonicating bath (40 kHz)–repeat once and collect supernatant each time.Completely dry extracted digested proteins using Speed-Vac and resuspend in 20 μl water. Store at -20 °C.",
