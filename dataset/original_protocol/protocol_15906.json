    "This protocol describes the generation and validation of cells expressing BirA*-tagged adhesome constructs, followed by the proximity labeling and isolation of biotinylated proteins to be analyzed by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. The affinity purification of biotinylated proteins outlined here closely follows the protocol described in Current Protocols in Protein Science by Roux, Kim, & Burke (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-bib-0021]), with some minor modifications.\nMaterials\nTarget cell lines stably expressing BirA*-tagged IAC components and BirA* (or other control), with appropriate culture medium\n               \nAn additional tag for detection by immunofluorescence and western blotting is recommended (e.g., myc).\n20× (1 mM) biotin stock solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-rec-0001])\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium and magnesium (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

    "1. Seed cells stably expressing BirA* adhesome constructs and appropriate BioID controls on to three 10-cm-diameter tissue culture plates, and incubate for 8-24 hr. Aim for cells to be sub-confluent on day 2.\nUsing three 10-cm-diameter plates allows sufficient material for validation of biotinylation by western blotting and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry. Starting quantities may need to be adjusted depending on BirA* expression levels and cell type. Plating cells for 8-24 hr prior to addition of biotin enables robust formation of steady-state IACs, though this should be confirmed for cell type and conditions used. Sub-confluency aims to maximize cell-ECM adhesion complexes over cell-cell contacts.\n2. Add biotin (from 20× solution) to a final concentration of 50 μM, and incubate for 24 hr to initiate biotinylation of proximal proteins.\nLabeling can be induced for shorter time periods, but 18-24 hr typically gives maximal biotinylation over background levels. For shorter, time-sensitive experiments, other proximity-dependent labeling approaches should be considered (see Background Information).\n3. Wash cells three times with PBS at room temperature, draining the last wash fully to ensure minimal residual PBS.\nIt is important to remove excess biotin, as free biotin can lead to sub-optimal capture of biotinylated proteins in subsequent steps.\n4. Add 400 μl lysis buffer to each plate.\nThe stringent lysis buffer ensures that cells are fully lysed, that protease activity is inhibited, and that protein interactions are disrupted.\n5. Detach cells with a cell scraper, and transfer lysate from the three plates to a 15-ml conical tube containing 120 μl 20% (v/v) Triton X-100 (40 μl/plate). Mix by pipetting. For subsequent steps, keep lysate on ice.\nLysis is performed at room temperature to prevent precipitation of SDS. The addition of Triton X-100 prevents SDS precipitation at lower temperatures and aids solubilization of proteins.",
    "6. Pass cell lysates four times through a 25-G needle using a 1-ml syringe, followed by four times through a 21-G needle.\nThis step ensures efficient lysis of cells and shears DNA. The lysate should become less viscous. Alternatively, sonication can be used (see Current Protocols article: Roux et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-bib-0021]).\n7. Add 1.08 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris·Cl, pH 7.4 (360 μl/plate), and pass four times through a 19-G needle.\n8. Transfer cell lysate to two 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and microcentrifuge 10 min at top speed (∼16,000 × g), 4°C.\n9. Aliquot 45 μl of resuspended magnetic streptavidin beads per condition into duplicate 1.5-ml tubes (15 μl per plate), and place on a magnetic rack.\n10. Wait for the beads to accumulate on the tube wall, and remove the bead buffer.\n11. Wash twice in 100 μl equilibration buffer (lysis buffer with with 0.1 volumes 20% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.9 volumes 50 mM Tris·Cl, pH 7.4), ensuring that beads are fully resuspended between wash steps.\nThis equilibrates the beads in the buffer that is to be used for affinity capture.\n12. Remove the equilibration buffer and add the supernatant from step 8, taking care not to disturb the pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nPrior to addition of the cell-lysate supernatant to the beads, 40 μl can be retained and added to 10 μl 5× RSB as “total cell lysate” to check for efficient biotinylation by western blotting.\n13. Resuspend the beads by inverting the tube, and rotate at 4°C overnight on an end-over-end rotator.\nShorter incubation periods may also be sufficient for affinity capture.\n14. Briefly centrifuge tubes to remove residual sample from the tube caps, and place the tubes on a magnetic rack to collect the beads on the walls of the tubes.",
    "15. Without disturbing the beads, remove the supernatant.\n40 μl of the supernatant can be retained and added to 10 μl 5× RSB as “flow-through.” This can be used to check for efficient affinity purification of biotinylated proteins by western blotting.\n16. To pool beads from each sample, add 1 ml wash buffer A to the first of the two tubes, resuspend, and add to the second tube.\n17. Rotate the tubes for 5 min at room temperature.\n18. Repeat steps 14 and 15 to remove supernatant, and add 1 ml wash buffer A.\n19. Rotate the tubes for 5 min at room temperature.\n20. Repeat steps 14 and 15 to remove supernatant, and add 1 ml wash buffer B.\n21. Rotate the tubes for 5 min at room temperature.\n22. Repeat steps 14 and 15 to remove supernatant, and add 1 ml wash buffer C.\n23. Rotate the tubes for 5 min at room temperature.\n24. Repeat steps 14 and 15 to remove supernatant, ensuring that no residual buffer is remaining. Add 100 μl of 2× RSB with 100 μM biotin to each tube, and gently resuspend beads.\n25. Incubate samples at 70°C for 10 min, with shaking (∼1000 rpm).\nElution at 70°C allows dissociation of biotinylated proteins from the beads while minimizing leaching of streptavidin from the beads, which may interfere with protein detection by mass spectrometry.\n26. Repeat step 14, and transfer the supernatant containing the eluted biotinylated proteins to a new tube.\nSamples can be frozen and stored short-term at −20°C until use, alongside the total cell lysate and flow-through, if retained.\nConfirm results and perform analyses\n27. Confirm the presence of biotinylated proteins in eluted samples through western blotting (see Current Protocols article: Ni et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-bib-0020]).",
    "Successful experiments should result in significant levels of biotinylated proteins in samples from cells expressing BirA* constructs over negative control (e.g., untransfected, or biotin-negative cells), detected by streptavidin-conjugated fluorophores, for example. Endogenously biotinylated proteins may be observed in all samples (see Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-fig-0001]). Total cell lysates and flow-through samples can also be processed by western blotting to check for initial biotinylation and efficient capture and elution of biotinylated proteins.\n28. Successful experiments can then be prepared for and analyzed by high-resolution label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (see Current Protocols article: Zhang et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-bib-0030]).\nAs a starting point, 10 μl of sample should be used for validation by western blotting, leaving 90% for analysis by mass spectrometry. This may need to be adjusted for cell type and expression levels. It is recommended to process all replicates (minimum of three) of all baits alongside the BirA* control, to minimize batch-to-batch variation in processing.",
    "The raw files generated from the mass spectrometry analysis need to be processed to identify proteins and produce relative abundance measurements between control and bait experiments in order to estimate proximal interactions. Here we describe how to produce MS1 intensity values using MaxQuant software (Cox & Mann, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-bib-0005]), but it is feasible to use other protein quantitation software applications such as Proteome Discover or Progenesis QI. Protein intensities can then be used to estimate proximal interactions. Here, the Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT) software is used (Teo et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-bib-0025]).\nMaterials\nMaxQuant version 1.6.3.4 (requires registration) available from https://maxquant.org/[href=https://maxquant.org/]\nMaxQuant minimum hardware requirements are:\n               \nIntel Pentium III/800 MHz or higher (or compatible), although one should probably not go below a dual-core processor\n2 GB RAM minimum\n2 GB RAM per thread that is executed in parallel is required\nThere is no upper limit on the number of cores. Whatever you can fit into a shared memory machine will work as long as the disk performance scales up with it.\nSAINTexpress available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/saint-apms/files/[href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/saint-apms/files/]\nSAINTexpress requires g++ version 4.4 or above for compilation of a complete install. Pre-compiled versions are also bundled with the download.\n1. Using MaxQuant version 1.6.3.4, process the raw files to obtain protein intensities for each sample.",
    "Raw files are searched against a user-defined protein database, typically obtained from UNIPROT, for the organism(s) of study, and should include all non-endogenous bait proteins used in the experiment. Default instrument settings (in this case, for Orbitrap) are used for spectral matching, with the addition of ‘matched between runs’ selected, ‘label-free quantification (LFQ)’ selected, lysine biotinylation as a variable modification also selected for use in protein quantification, and ‘unique peptides only’ used for protein quantification. It is recommended to process replicates of all baits alongside all control replicates acquired within the same batch, to avoid batch-to-batch variation.\n2. Prepare three input files required for SAINTexpress using the LFQ intensities from the MaxQuant proteinGroups.txt output file (as illustrated in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-fig-0002]).\nThe proteinGroups.txt file should be filtered to remove all reverse proteins, potential contaminants, and proteins identified only by site. SAINTexpress requires three tab-delimited text files (bait, prey, and interaction) as input. The bait file details which samples refer to control samples, bait samples, and bait proteins. The prey file lists all prey proteins quantified in the filtered proteinGroups.txt file, with the protein length and (optionally) the gene name. The interaction file lists the protein (LFQ) intensity of each protein quantified alongside the sample and bait in which it has been quantified; all prey proteins with zero LFQ intensities should be omitted from this list.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3b14b114-17bc-4ff5-8953-edc12c23d60e/cpcb113-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nIllustrative example of the three input files required by SAINTexpress.\n3.

Filter SAINTexpress results for significant proximal interactions (as illustrated in Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-fig-0003]).",
    "The SAINTexpress output file produced is called list.txt and lists all prey proteins where a probability of interaction has been estimated, alongside replicate protein intensity values, fold change, and a Bayesian false discovery rate (BFDR). The BFDR is what is used here to threshold the confidence of a true proximal interaction. In this case, a 5% BFDR is used, but the user can be more relaxed or more stringent with this threshold.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/135f232a-dcc8-4542-b816-091e41de27da/cpcb113-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nExample of SAINTexpress output.",
    "This protocol outlines bioinformatic approaches that can be used to interrogate the topology of proximity interaction networks generated from multiplexed BioID experiments. Unbiased hierarchical cluster analysis can be used to determine relationships between baits and prey, which can then be analyzed for over-represented functional terms using gene ontology. Finally, this protocol describes the visualization of proximity interaction networks using Cytoscape. Although Cytoscape has many useful features that can interrogate various features of networks, this protocol describes the basic steps required to visualize the network.\nMaterials\nComputer with access to the internet\nR (version 3.5+, available from https://www.r-project.org[href=https://www.r-project.org]) with the following R packages:\n               \nPheatmap (version 1.0.12+, available via CRAN)\nReshape2 (version 1.4.4+, available via CRAN)\nBioconductor (version 3.8+, available from http://bioconductor.org/[href=http://bioconductor.org/])\nclusterProfiler (3.10.1+, available via Bioconductor) (Yu, Wang, Han, & He, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.113#cpcb113-bib-0029])\nGenome-wide annotation for specific species used.

Ensure that there are no formulas, blank spaces, or duplicated headings.",
    "It may be beneficial to include all proximity interactions in the spreadsheet, even those below the selection criteria threshold. This is because it is difficult to add information to a Cytoscape network once loaded. With multiplexed data, sometimes it is useful to be aware of proximity interactions that narrowly miss selection criteria.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ce1a2442-da1d-426a-97de-5cdf4d3e1e77/cpcb113-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nExample Cytoscape input headings.\n2c. Open Cytoscape. To import your network, go to menu File → Import → Network from File… and select the file assembled in step 1.\n3c. In the “Import Network from Table” box that appears, assign a column “meaning” to each column and assign data type from the drop-down box that appears by clicking on each column heading.\nThe BioID bait should be assigned as the “Source Node” and the prey as the “Target Node.” Information relating to bait-prey interactions such as BFDR, fold change, and intensity are generally considered “Interaction Attributes.” Additional information that is specific to individual baits or prey (e.g., presence in published adhesomes or bait/prey cluster) are considered “Source Node Attributes” and “Target Node Attributes”, respectively.\n4c. Click “OK.” A network will appear, consisting of all the bait and prey (nodes) and interactions (edges) from the input file.\nAs multiplexed proximity biotinylation is likely to result in the detection of a large number of proteins, this network may contain thousands of nodes and edges. The majority of these proteins are unlikely to be biologically relevant, and filtering (based on statistical analysis) is required.",
    "5c. Use column filters to select for high-confidence proximity interactions (e.g., BFDR ≤ 0.05) to create a sub-network of relevant interactions. Choose “Select” in the Control Panel, and click on the “+” icon to add “Column Filter.” Choose selection criteria (e.g., BFDR) from the drop-down menu, select filter value (enter manually or use sliding bar), and then click “Apply.”\nThis will select all nodes/edges that reach the specified criteria. Other selection criteria can be used to further explore the data or focus on specific parts of the network, e.g., fold change and bait/prey- or cluster-specific interactions.\n6c. Create a new network from the selected nodes and edges by clicking the “New Network from Selection” icon, or by going to menu File → New Network → From Selected Nodes, Selected Edges.\nThis network now contains only high-confidence proximity interactions.\n7c. Alter the network layout by manually dragging nodes, or by selecting options from the drop-down Layout menu (e.g., Layout → Perfuse Force Directed layout).\nVarious layout options are available, and can be performed on the whole network, or selected subsets of nodes.\n8c. Change the appearance of the network, and map values (e.g., BFDR, fold change) onto nodes and edges in the “Style” menu on the Control Panel.\nFor example, map fold change values onto edge width, and color baits according to their cluster, and outline prey identified in published adhesomes.
