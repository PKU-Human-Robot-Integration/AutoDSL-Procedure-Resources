    "Plant growth and microscope slide preparationSurface sterilize seeds in 5% v/v sodium hypochlorite for 5 min and rinse three times in sterile distilled water. Plate the seeds on to Murashige and Skoog medium (pH 5.8) supplemented with 1% w/v sucrose and 0.5% w/v Phytagel. Stratify the seeds by incubating for 2 days at 4 °C in darkness and then grown at 25 °C in continuous light in vertically oriented Petri dishes for approximately 3-5 days.Slide preparation: Cut small square frames of Secure Seal Adhesive with similar dimensions to the cover slip and stick it to the slide (this will avoid squashing the roots between the slide and cover slip and prevents the evaporation of mounting media during imaging) (Figure 1).Cut root tips from Arabidopsis seedlings whilst still on plates and place onto the microscope slide containing a drop of water. Alternatively, if seedlings are not too big, the whole seedling can be mounted on the slide. We mounted typically 1-2 roots per slide, but used only one of them for the 1 h time course, as we tried to avoid having the material too long on the slide prior to the experiment.Add a coverslip and stick it to the slide with the adhesive tape. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019042847_2870.jpgFigure 1. A. Schematic of microscope slide preparation. Arabidopsis root tips (asterisk) were cut and placed onto slides. B. Images showing selection of regions for photoactivation (labeled from 1 to 9) in roots expressing H2B-PAGFP. Before photoactivation nuclei show a very weak signal due to the faint pre-activation (see step B4). Scale bar = 5 μm.ImagingTwo-photon photoactivation experiments were performed on an Ultima two-photon laserscanning microscope. Images were acquired using an Olympus 60x 0.9 NA water immersion objective.Use 2.5x optical zoom and 512 x 512 resolution.Set up Z-steps of 1 μm.",
    "The absence of fluorescence prior to photoactivation makes it is impossible to identify the regions of interest, therefore an initial pre-activation is necessary. This faint pre-activation is achieved by scanning the root tip at 850nm wavelength, 50% power and with a pixel time of 5.6 μs. One or two scans were necessary depending on the root (Figure 1B).For photoactivation define simultaneously several regions-of-interest (ROI) covering half of each nucleus in the different Z- positions. Pulse the ROIs with a 710 nm laser light at 30% power with a pixel time of 8.8 μs. Repeat this cycle two times, and then set up normal time series. For PA-GFP time series imaging use a 925 nm laser line at 50% power, 8.8 μs/pixel, with one acquisition (one z-stack, same z-step) every 60 sec for 1 h.Image processingImage analysis was performed using Image J software.Open the hyperstack (containing z and t dimensions) and apply a Z-stack maximum projection. It is expected that cell movements and/or drift will occur during image acquisition. These movements can be corrected and/or eliminated by aligning consecutive frames using StackReg plug-in of Image J. This plugin aligns successive image frames by a cross-correlation procedure, which works easily and without operator intervention, as long as movements are not too large. More details, including screen shots are available on the developers’ website. (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/[href=http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/])Once images are aligned using the “ROI manager” tool from Image J to define three regions of interest: Photoactivation Region; Total Nucleus and Background (Figure 2A). Both the Photoactivation and Total Nucleus Regions are drawn by hand based on contrast of fluorescence. Because mean intensities are measured the exact outline of each area is not critical for the result.",
    "Once the three regions are loaded onto the “ROI manager” window click “Multi Measure” and a results table will be provided with the mean intensity values for each region at the different time points. These measurements will be used later for normalizing the data.Data analysisExport the raw intensity measurements to Microsoft Excel to perform a double normalization (Phair et al., 2004). This method normalizes the initial fluorescence to “1” and corrects for bleaching during imaging (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019042918_6431.jpgFigure 2. Determination of relative fluorescence signal in the ROI region, and correction for background and bleaching during imagingIt is also important to normalize for the proportion of the nucleus that is activated (Figure 3). In our case because half of the nucleus was activated the fluorescence decay could only reach at most half of the initial fluorescence. We therefore took this into account by additionally normalizing as follows: I (norm) = (Ft-F0/2)/(F0/2), where Ft is the fluorescence intensity at each time point (t) and F0 is the initial fluorescence intensity after photoactivation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019043004_0860.jpgFigure 3. Correction for the proportion of the nucleus activatedCopy the normalized data to a program such as GraphPad Prism and perform a curve fitting analysis. Use a non-linear regression and to a single exponential decay function (Figure 2C). The mobile fraction (Mf) and half-life values (the time it takes for fluorescence intensity to reach half the maximum of the plateau level) are obtained by the software. Present data as the average ± SEM and assess the statistical significance by t-test.Note: The examples regarding decays at different developmental stages can be found in our publication (Rosa et al., 2014).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019043041_4168.jpgFigure 4.
