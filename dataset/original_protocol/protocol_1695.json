    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection and aging of flies\nTiming: Approximately 1–2 days (excluding the variable period during which the flies are aged)\nFollowing eclosure of the flies (after approximately 10 days at 25°C), collect male and female offspring.\nMaintain collected flies in vials at a density of less than 25 flies per vial, and age them at 25°C until they reach a suitable time point.\nWhile aging the flies, transfer them into new food 2–3 times per week. Discard the old vials.\nDissection of Drosophila thoraces\nTiming: Approximately 1 h\nOnce the flies reach the desired age, anesthetize the flies on a CO2 pad, and dissect 10 fly thoraces under a microscope using suitable dissection forceps.\nNote: Anesthetized flies are dissected by severing both head and abdomen from the thorax. Save the thorax. Flies do not need to be in a buffer during dissection, and wings or legs do not have to be removed.\nPlace the dissected fly thoraces in an Eppendorf tube (without any buffer). Store immediately at −80°C until you are ready to perform the experiment.\nPause point: The frozen thoraces can be stored for at least a year at −80°C.\nIsolation of mitochondrial membranes from thoraces\nTiming: Approximately 1 h\nThaw an aliquot of the MIM (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) by incubating it in a 37°C water bath until it is almost completely defrosted. Remove and keep on ice until it is completely thawed .\nCritical: Check the MIM periodically to ensure it does not fully defrost while in the 37°C water bath. When there is little ice left take it out and place it in the ice bucket. Vortex briefly to mix thoroughly.\nObtain dissected thoraces from −80°C and keep on ice to defrost (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1280-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Mitochondria isolation from Drosophila flight muscles\nImages showing fly thoraces before homogenization (A), fly thoraces with one scoop of beads, protease inhibitor and MIM (B), homogenized fly thoraces (C), and isolated mitochondrial pellet (D).\nPlace the sample buffer, protease inhibitor, and blue dye in the ice bucket.\nAdd one scoop of Zirconium Oxide beads (equivalent to a bead volume of about 0.2 mL) and 0.5 mL of MIM containing 1× of Halt Protease inhibitors to each sample (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nHomogenize the samples in the bullet blender (BB) for 2 min, at a speed of 7 on the BB in the cold room (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: Analyze the samples to see if chunks of the thorax remain in suspension. For optimal yield, the thorax must be homogenized to the point where the remains of the thorax are barely/slightly visible in the liquid.\nCentrifuge the homogenized samples at 500 g (500 rcf) for 5 min at 4°C.\nIn the meantime, start defrosting the 5% digitonin suspension.\nFollowing centrifugation for 5 min, transfer the supernatant into new Eppendorf tubes.\nCentrifuge the supernatant again at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant into new Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 5000 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and save the mitochondria-enriched pellet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nBN PAGE gel tank preparation\nTiming: Approximately 10–20 min\nPrepare the gel tank as follows:\nObtain gel plates (3%–12% gradient native gels) and the gel tank (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Unwrap the plates, remove the comb and wash with Milli-Q water, and then with cathode buffer. Peel off the white strip and place it in the gel chamber and lock it.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1280-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Be sure to leave enough room for the wells to be visible. Using a 1000 μL pipette, add the cathode buffer to the wells.\nAfter setting up the gel tank, place the gel tank in the cold room or any 4°C incubator.\nSample preparation for BN PAGE silver staining\nTiming: Approximately 4 h\nSolubilize the mitochondrial pellet (from step 16) by adding 25 μL of 1% digitonin buffer. Solubilize by pipetting up-and-down (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nIncubate the solubilized mitochondrial pellet on ice for 15 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nSave the supernatant, and transfer it into new Eppendorf tubes. Keep on ice.\nNote: The supernatant will have the extracted OXPHOS complexes, while what remains of the membranes will be in the pellet.\nMeasure the protein concentration by Bradford method and normalize the samples to ascertain how much (volume) of each sample needs to be loaded in the gel for equal loading.\nIn a new Eppendorf tube, add 15 μL G-250 blue dye (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]), 10 μL 1× sample buffer and 5 μL sample; mix gently.\nLoad the samples in wells based on the amounts given by the Bradford method calculations.\nRun the gel using the FB300 Fisher Scientific power supply at 4°C.\nFor two gels, run at 300 V and 4 mA (keep milliamps constant) for approximately 3 h.\nSilver staining of native gel",
    "This method allows the OXPHOS complexes to be visualized. It is more sensitive than Coomassie staining.\nTiming: Approximately 1–2 h\nNote: All steps are at room temperature.\nAfter gel electrophoresis is complete, remove the gel from the cassette, place in a container with the silver staining fixative solution (50% methanol and 10% acetic acid) and rotate on a shaker for 10 min.\nRemove the fixative solution and add 100 mL of the sensitizer solution (105 mL of ultrapure water, 100 mL of methanol and 5 mL of Sensitizer) and keep on the shaker for 10 min.\nFollowing sensitization, wash the gel twice with 200 mL of ultrapure water for 5 min each.\nThen incubate the gel in the silver staining solution (90 mL of ultrapure water, 5 mL of Stainer A and 5 mL of Stainer B) for 15 min on the shaker.\nWash the gel twice with 200 mL of ultrapure water for 5 min each.\nDevelop the gel by adding the developer (95 mL of ultrapure water and 5 mL of Developer). Stop the reaction by adding the stopper solution once bands are visible.\nAfter about 10 min, capture the image with the ChemiDoc Imaging System (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1280-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Because Coomassie does not denature proteins it is suitable for characterizing enzyme activities. In-gel enzyme assays make it feasible to identify enzymes in gels based solely on enzymatic activity. Typically, after a gel is run it is soaked in a buffer containing substrates for the enzyme to be detected. Following incubation for a suitable period and a series of washes, the enzyme being assayed can be detected as a distinct colored band in the gel. Here, we describe protocols for visualizing CI, CII, CIV and CV activities of Drosophila OXPHOS complexes within blue native gels.\nSample preparation for in-gel activities of native gels (complex I, complex II, complex IV and complex V)\nTiming: 2 days\nHere, we describe the sample preparation and the specific steps for analyses of Complex I, II, IV, and V activities in native gels.\nAfter steps 1–22, in a new Eppendorf tube add 20 μL of blue dye and 40 μL of sample and mix gently.\nLoad the samples in wells in four sets for CI, CII, CIV and CV in-gel activities based on the amounts given by the Bradford method calculations.\nRun the gel using the FB300 Fisher Scientific power supply at 4°C. For two gels, run at 300 V and 4 mA (keep milliamps constant).\nAfter the gel electrophoresis is complete, remove the gel from the cassette.\nComplex I: Place the first gel in a container with Complex I in-gel activity solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]), and place it on the shaker overnight (approximately 16 h) at 4°C.
