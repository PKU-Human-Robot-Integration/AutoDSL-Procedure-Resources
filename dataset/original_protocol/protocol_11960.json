    "1. Leg Dissection and Fixation\nTake a glass multi-well plate and fill appropriate number of wells with 70% ethanol. Add 15–20 CO2-anesthetized flies (of either sex and any age) to each well and by using a brush, gently dab the flies into the ethanol solution until flies are fully submerged.\n\tNOTE: This step is to remove the hydrophobicity of the cuticle. Do not wash for more than 1 min, because this increases auto-fluorescence of the cuticle.\nRinse the flies 3 times with 0.3% nonionic surfactant detergent solution in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Keep the flies in this solution for at least 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Legs are better fixed when including detergent, which is likely to increase penetration of the fixative inside the leg.\nPlace a multi-well plate on the ice along with a tube of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n\tNOTE: The preparation of fresh 4% PFA from a 16% PFA ethanol free stock solution is critical.\nUse forceps to remove the head and abdomen of the flies without damaging the thoracic segment or the legs.\n\tNOTE: Removing the abdomen makes it easier to hold the fly and dissect the legs.\nDissect the legs from the thoracic segment with forceps and place the legs in the wells containing 4% PFA. For this, push gently but firmly at the coxa-thorax junction using the tip of fine forceps until the leg detaches.\nFix the legs in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C (approximately 20 h total).\nWash the legs with 0.3% nonionic surfactant detergent solution in 1x PBS, 5x for 20 min each.\nReplace the washing buffer with mounting medium. Keep the leg in mounting medium for at least a day prior to mounting to allow for its complete penetration into the leg.",
    "NOTE: If the mounting medium is highly viscous, dilute the mounting medium to 80% with 1x PBS because the sudden change in viscosity can cause the cuticle to collapse and damage the overall structure of the leg. Depending on the Gal4 driver, flies can be preserved for 1 to 3 weeks at 4 °C in mounting media until mounting.\n2. Leg Mounting\nPlace approximately 20 µL of 70% glycerol on the left-hand side of a microscope slide and cover with a square 22 x 22 mm2 coverslip (Figure 2A, B). Pipette about 10 µL of mounting medium along a line parallel to and at a small distance from the right edge of this coverslip. Add another 30 µL of mounting medium further on the right side of the slide (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: When applying a coverslip over the legs (see below) the mounting medium will gently spread under the coverslip and around the legs without displacing them.\nUsing fine forceps lift the leg from the solution and gently put it on the mounting medium near the left coverslip. Do the same for each leg and align them from top to bottom (Figure 2D).\n\t\nLift and transfer the legs in a drop of medium held between both tips of the forceps. Orient the legs in two ways: external side up or down.\nOnce all the legs (up to 6–8 legs can be mounted) are properly aligned, put a second coverslip over the legs such that this coverslip rests slightly on the previously placed coverslip (Figure 2E) to allow for space between the coverslip and the tissue and to prevent the legs from getting damaged (Figure 2G).\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, use sticker wells or orthodontic wax to create space between the coverslip and the slide.",
    "Use a nail polish to secure the position of the coverslips at each corner (Figure 2F).\n\tNOTE: The tissue is now ready to image.\n3. Imaging\nSet up a single track using the 488 nm laser and two detectors simultaneously to obtain both the GFP fluorescence and cuticle auto-fluorescence. Using the range control or the slider display in the spectral window of the light path window of the software, set the detection range of one detector (detector 1) between 498–535 nm and that of the other one (detector 2) between 566-652 nm.\n\tNOTE: Typically, the detector 1 should be a GaAsP detector and the detector 2 a photomultiplier tube. The 498-535 channel optimally detects GFP signal but also detects auto fluorescence from the cuticle. However, the 566–652 channel detects only the auto fluorescence from the cuticle (Figure 3A).\nUse a 20X or 25X oil immersion objective, 1024 x 1024 pixels resolution, 12-bit depth, and set Z spacing as 1 µm. Set pixel dwell time as approximately 1.58 µs, and average 2 frames/image. Use objectives with high numerical aperture.\nSet all other settings, depending on the confocal microscope and imaging software being used.\n\t\nMake sure to obtain a brighter cuticle signal from the 566–652 detector rather than from the 498–535 detector. To do this, use the same laser power of the 488-laser for both detectors. Using the saturation markers, first adjust the gain of detector 1 to obtain a bright enough GFP signal (Figure 3B, D). Then adjust the gain of detector 2 to ensure that some areas with high cuticle signal (edges of legs, joints) produce a saturated signal in this detector (Figure 3C, E).",
    "If the leg is extended and too large to be imaged in a single frame, use the Tile or Position option from the microscope imaging software.\nReconstruct the final images either using the proprietary microscope imaging software or using ImageJ/FIJI freeware (see below).\n4. Post Imaging Processing\nOpen the confocal stack in ImageJ/FIJI.\n\t\nUse the Bioformats plugin (Plugins| Bio-Formats| Bio-formats Importer) in FIJI to open images that are not in .TIF format from proprietary imaging software packages9.\nSplit the channels by selecting Image| Color| Split Channels.\n\tNOTE: If images from several positions were made and must be recombined, use the pairwise stitching plugin in FIJI from (Plugins > Stitching > Pairwise Stitching)10,11.\nTo subtract the cuticle signal from the GFP signal, open the Image Calculator (Process| Image Calculator): select the stack from detector 1 as Image 1 (GFP + cuticle) (Figure 4A), on the operation window select subtract, and select the stack from detector 2 as Image 2 (cuticle) (Figure 4B). As a result, only the endogenous GFP signal (GFP) is obtained (Figure 4C).\n\t\nMerge back this stack (GFP) with the ‘cuticle-only’ stack obtained from detector 2 (Figure 4B Image| Color| Merge Channels) to obtain an RGB image comprising of the tissue-specific GFP signal as well as the cuticle signal, which helps identifying the axon arbors within the leg segments (Figure 4D).\nAdjust contrast and brightness of each image (Image| Adjust| Brightness/Contrast) and then generate a single RGB image (Image| Type| RGB Color).\n\t\tNOTE: To generate a maximum projection of the Z-stack (Image| Stacks| Z Project…), use maximum intensity projection for the GFP signal and average intensity for the cuticle, which can then be adjusted for brightness prior to merging the two channels.",
    "Alternatively, use a macro for automatic subtraction and processing of images in ImageJ/FIJI. Copy the text in Supplemental File 1 in the macro editor (Plugins| New| Macro), save the macro in the Plugins folder, and restart ImageJ/FIJI once to be able to use the macro.\n\t\nTo use the macro, open the confocal stack, and open the Brightness/Contrast window (Image| Adjust| Brightness/Contrast). Then run the macro (Plugin| Macro| Run) and follow instructions.\nWhen asked to specify the operation (Image calculator window), choose Image 1 as stack 1 (GFP), Image 2 as stack 2 (cuticle), and Subtract.\n\t\tNote: The macro generates a maximal projection image of the processed GFP signal (MAX_Result of stack1), an average projection of the cuticle (AVG_stack2), the result of the substraction of the cuticle stack from the GFP stack (Result of stack1), and the unprocessed cuticle stack (stack2).\nWhen asked to adjust contrast, use the controls in the brightness/control window to adjust the brightness/contrast of the maximal projection image of GFP, and of the average projection of the cuticle, to generate an RGB merged image of both signals showing the GFP in green and the cuticle in gray. Merge Result of stack1, and stack2, to similarly generate a combined GFP and cuticle stack that can be used in the next stage.\nTo visualize the legs in three dimensions, use specialized 3D software with the newly generated stacks (Figure 4E).\n\t\nOpen the RGB stack with 3D software (see Table of Materials). In the pop-up dialog window, select all channels in the mode conversion section and enter the size of a voxel (volume of a pixel).\n\t\tNote: All necessary information is contained in the image files from whatever proprietary microscope software being used.",
