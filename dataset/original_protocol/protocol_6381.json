    "Cell culture and sample preparationPre-warm 2 ml 1x DEPC-PBS, 23 ml culture media and 0.8 ml 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA to 37 °C.Remove the used culture media in the cell culture flask (take 25 cm2 flask for example).Wash briefly with 2 ml 1x DEPC-PBS. Aspirate PBS.Add 0.8 ml 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA into flask and cover the cells.Check the cells with inverted microscope to be sure that most of the cells are rounded up, but still attached to the flask. Carefully remove trypsin.Add 3 ml culture media to the flask, suspend the cells from attached cell layer and mix them well by pipetting.Put 5 slides into a Petri dish and add 20 ml culture media into it to cover the slides.Seed the resuspended cells on slides.Rest for at least 10 min until resuspended cells subside on the slides.Transfer the Petri dish into the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).Culture the cells until they reach 80% confluence (12-48 h).After 12-48 h incubation, remove and discard the culture media.Wash 3 times with 25 ml 1x DEPC-PBS for 3 min each.Add 25 ml 4% (w/v) PFA into the Petri dish to cover the slides for 30 min at RT.Wash twice with 25 ml 1x DEPC-PBS for 3 min each.Perform dehydration using an ethanol series of 70%, 85%, and ethanol absolute for 5 min each. Air dry.Note: The sample slides can be stored at -80 °C until used.PretreatmentsPhosphorylate padlock probes before use. Prepare 50 μl mix containing 38 μl DEPC-H2O, 1 μl padlock probes (100 μM), 5 μl PNK buffer A (10x), 5 μl ATP (10 mM), 1 μl T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 U/μl) in the 0.2 ml PCR Tubes.Incubate the above mixture at 37 °C for 30 min and 65 °C for 10 min in the PCR machine.",
    "Note: For formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pathological tissue sections, perform pretreatments procedures 3 to 20, expect 17 and 18. For cell samples, perform pretreatments procedures 14 to 20. Bake the slide at 60 °C for 30 min.Put the slide into the xylene for 15 min and another fresh xylene for 10 min, respectively.Put the slide into ethanol absolute twice, 95% ethanol twice, and 70% ethanol twice for 2 min each time.Treat the slide with DEPC-H2O for 5 min to complete rehydration.Wash with DEPC-PBS for 2 min.Perform the fixation procedure with 4% (w/v) PFA in DEPC-PBS for 10 min.Wash with DEPC-PBS for 2 min.Put the slide into the solution of 0.1 mg/ml pepsin in 0.1 M HCl for 30 min at 37 °C.Wash with DEPC-H2O for 5 min.Wash with DEPC-PBS for 2 min.Dehydrate the slide by an an ethanol series of 70%, 85%, and ethanol absolute for 1 min each.Air dry.Assemble the 9 mm diameter and 0.8 mm depth Secure-Seal hybridization chamber to the surface of the slide on the side where the samples are (Figure 1). All the following incubation step take place in the chamber with a volume of 50 μl.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200115/20200115182305_5173.jpgFigure 1. Assemble hybridization chamber to the surface of slide where the samples are. Place a seal-tab over each filling port to prevent evaporation of the solutions and the drying out of the specimen.Rinse the cell sample with DEPC-PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (DEPC-PBST).Add 50 μl 0.5%(v/v) Triton X-100 (in DEPC-PBS) into the chamber to permeabilize the cells for 10 min at RT.Wash 3 times with 1x DEPC-PBST.Apply 50 μl 3% (w/v) H2O2 solution to the sample for 15 min at RT to block endogenous peroxidases.Wash 3 times with DEPC-PBST.Padlock probe hybridizationPrepare 50 μl padlock probe hybridization mix containing 22.5 μl DEPC-H2O, 25 μl 2x hybridization buffer and 2.",
    "5 μl phosphorylated padlock probe (2 μM, from B2).Add the mix into the chamber and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.Wash 3 times with washing buffer for 5 min each.Wash 3 times with DEPC-PBST.Padlock probe ligationPrepare 50 μl padlock probe ligation mix containing 6.5 μl DEPC-H2O, 31.25 μl 80% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μl BSA (2 mg/ml), 1.25 μl RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (40 U/μl), 5 μl SplintR ligase reaction buffer (10x) and 1 μl SplintR ligase (25 U/μl).Add the mix into the chamber and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.Wash 3 times with washing buffer for 5 min each.RCA primer hybridizationPrepare 50 μl RCA primer hybridization mix containing 20 μl DEPC-H2O, 25 μl 2x hybridization buffer and 5 μl RCA primer (10 μM).Add the mix into the chamber and incubate for 30 min at 37 °CWash 3 times with washing buffer for 5 min each.Wash 3 times with DEPC-PBST.RCAPrepare 50 μl RCA mix containing 26.75 μl DEPC-H2O, 5 μl 50% (v/v) glycerol, 2 μl dNTP (25 mM), 5 μl BSA (2 mg/ml), 1.25 μl RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (40 U/μl), 5 μl phi29 DNA polymerase buffer (10x) and 5 μl phi29 polymerase (10 U/μl).Add the mix into the chamber and incubate for 16-18 h at RT.Wash 3 times with washing buffer for 5 min each.Wash 3 times with DEPC-PBST.RCA products detectionPrepare 50 μl RCA products detection mix containing 10 μl DEPC-H2O, 25 μl 2x detection buffer, 12.5 μl 80% (v/v) glycerol and 2.5 μl HRP-labeled detection probe (2 μM).Add the mix into the chamber and incubate for 30 min at RT.Wash 3 times with DEPC-PBST.Staining and mountingIncubate the sample with staining solution for 3 to 8 min depending on the color development.Wash 3 times with DEPC-H2O.Stain the nuclei in Hematoxylin staining solution for 1 min.Wash 3 times with DEPC-H2O.",
