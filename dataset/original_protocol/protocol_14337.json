    "The study protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study.\n1. Non-activated A-PRP Preparation\nHarvest 55 mL of autologous blood from a peripheral vein of the arm using a tube with butterfly needle according to the local blood collection protocol.\nAdd 7 mL of acid citrate dextrose (ACD) solution (112 mM of citrate) to the blood tube as an anticoagulant.\nCentrifuge the blood collected in the tube at 260 x g for 10 min.\n\tNote: 23 mL of A-PRP + Autologous Platelet-Poor Plasma (A-PPP) and 20 mL of Red Blood Cells suspension (RBCs) were produced.\nTake out the tube containing A-PRP + A-PPP and RBCs from the centrifuge and insert it in a laser light selector device.\nSeparate A-PRP + A-PPP in a sterile bag by mechanical suction performed by the laser selector in which the kit is placed. RBCs are automatically removed by mechanical suction.\n\tNote: 14 mL of A-PPP was manually harvested and removed by the sterile bag from the kit. 9 mL of A-PRP was obtained.\n2. Non-activated A-PRP Injections\nDivide the scalp of the patients affected by AGA into frontal, parietal, vertex, and occipital areas.\n\tCaution: Do not perform anesthesia (local or systemic).\nPerform interfollicular A-PRP injections (0.20 mL x cm2) by the medical injector gun (see Table of Materials) to selected areas of the scalp.\n\t\nIn patients with hair loss localized to the frontal and parietal areas, perform A-PRP injections exclusively to the frontal area and use saline as placebo in the parietal area.\nIn patients with hair loss localized to the parietal and vertex areas, inject A-PRP in the parietal area, and use saline as placebo in the vertex area.\nPerform an equal number of A-PRP and placebo injections for each patient.",
    "Perform interfollicular A-PRP injections at a depth of 5 mm using the medical injector gun equipped with a 30G needle and 10 mL syringe.\nPerform three sessions spaced 30 days apart.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
