    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nProtein Digestion\nTiming: 18–24 h\nAs this protocol is interested in identifying and quantifying individual phosphosites, a bottom-up approach is being undertaken. The initial step of the vast majority of bottom-up proteomic approaches requires the digestion of proteins into peptides, in this case, we are using the widely used enzyme trypsin which cleaves C-terminal to lysine and arginine residues.\nThaw the samples and treat each lysate with 1 μl of 1 M dithiothreitol for 25 min at 56 °C to reduce disulfide bonds between cysteine residues. Cool samples to ∼22 °C before proceeding to the next step.\nAlkylate the cysteine sulfhydryls using 4 μl of 500 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at ∼22 °C, protected from light. Iodoacetamide has to be in excess compared to the dithiothreitol. This step prevents the reformation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues.\nQuench the reaction with 1.5 μl 1 M dithiothreitol to stop the alkylation reaction.\nBefore preforming the proteolytic digestion, the concentration of urea must be reduced to <2 M. Add four sample volumes of 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5. (e.g. 200 μl sample:800 μl 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5).\nAdd sequencing grade trypsin at 2 % of total protein (4 μg/sample) and incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 6-18 h. Trypsin cleaves peptides on the C-terminal side of lysine and arginine amino acid residues (except when proline is the next residue).\nNote: Trypsin digestion results in peptides with an average of 14 amino acids in length, which is favorable for LC-MS/MS analysis. Other enzymes, e.g. lysyl endopeptidase (LysC), may be used in place of, or in parallel to, trypsin. LysC cleaves C-terminal to lysine residues which ensures all peptides contain two primary amine groups which are the acceptors for TMT labelling.",
    "C18 Spin Column Cleanup of Proteolytic Digests\nTiming: 3–4 h\nBefore performing TMT labeling, components of the lysis and digestion buffer need to be removed using solid phase extraction. To concentrate and clean up the samples a C18 SepPak 130 mg bed volume is used for each sample in conjunction with a vacuum manifold set at -2 psi, to slowly pass each solution below through the solid phase extraction device.\nAlternatives: C18 MacroSpin column (Nest Group) in conjunction with a centrifuge can be used to replace the C18 SepPak column and vacuum.\nCentrifuge the samples briefly to collect any condensate liquids on the lid.\nTo prepare the samples for desalting, acidify each digested sample with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a concentration of 0.4 % (v/v) and ensure that the pH is ≤2.\nWash the columns with 1.25 ml of acetonitrile and condition them with 450 μl of 50 % acetonitrile / 0.5 % acetic acid. For all the steps, make sure that the entire solution passes through the device, but without drying the column.\nEquilibrate the columns with 1.25 ml of 0.1 % TFA. Discard the flow through.\nLoad the samples onto the columns. Save flow-through.\nWash the columns with 125 μl of 0.5% acetic acid. Combine the flow through with the flow through from Step 5, retain the SepPak and store at -20 °C, in case of loss of sample due to unforeseen technical or user error.\nElute the peptides from the columns by adding 750 μl of 50 % acetonitrile with 0.5 % acetic acid.\nDry the eluted peptides by vacuum centrifugation (∼2 h, ambient). Store the dried samples at -80 °C.\nPause Point: Dried peptides can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely.",
    "Note: It is recommended to store the flow through fractions until peptide recovery has been confirmed in subsequent steps.\nTMT10plex Mass Tag Labelling\nTiming: 2 h\nThe TMT10plex reagent set contains ten different isobaric compounds with the same nominal mass and chemical structure. A mass reporter is linked via a spacer arm to an amine-reactive NHS-ester group. By using tandem mass spectrometry, TMT10plex allows the identification and relative quantification of ten different samples simultaneously. Two sets of TMT10plex (0.8 mg per tag) are required to label the 20 samples (i.e. 10 controls and 10 phosphatase mutants) as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. The protocol follows the steps of the manufacturer but is adapted to label 200 μg of peptide material per channel.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/66-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Labeling with TMT10plex Isobaric Mass Tag Reagents Sets\nAlternatives: The TMT kit is also available in 6-, 11- or 16- plexing capacity. Alternative isobaric labeling reagents include iTRAQ.\nSolubilize each dried sample in 200 μl of 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5 by sonication in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. Check that the pH is ∼8.5 by spotting 0.2 μl on a pH indicator strip. If necessary adjust the pH by adding 1 M HEPES pH 8.5, and add equivalent volumes of 50 mM HEPES to the other samples to ensure that the peptide concentration is equal.\nEquilibrate the TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent at ∼22°C for 15 min and briefly centrifuge the reagent tubes.\nSolubilize each vial of isobaric labels in 40 μl anhydrous acetonitrile carefully and keep the tubes closed as much as possible. Briefly centrifuge and use the TMT reagents immediately.",
    "Add the sample solution to the reagent tubes according to the scheme in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. Vortex and briefly centrifuge before incubating for 1 h at ∼22 °C on a Thermomixer set at 750 rpm. If Thermomixer is not available, vortex the samples occasionally during the 1 h incorporation\nCentrifuge the tubes briefly and retrieve 2 μl of each of the 20 samples and dilute in 18 μl of 0.1% TFA (i.e. 20 individual diluted samples). Use these samples to determine the labeling efficiency as described in section 4.\nMake two groups of 10 samples following the scheme in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. Then, combine 5 μl each of the 10 samples in both sets, resulting in two mixed samples. Vortex and centrifuge briefly. Dilute 2 μl of each the two mixes in 18 μl of 0.1% TFA and use these samples in the mixing check as described in section 4. Store the remainder of each labelled sample immediately at -80 °C.\nNote: To allow a relative comparison of the phosphoproteome in the wild type and mutant context, it is essential that one half of the TMT10plex set labels the control samples and the other half labels the phosphatase mutant samples.\nNote: Every TMT lot has a different correction error, which can be found in the \"reporter ion isotopic distribution\" section of the product data sheet. It is important to keep a note of the correction error for the later data analysis.\nCritical: Do not quench the reaction until labeling has been confirmed by LC-MS/MS.\nEvaluation of TMT10plex Isobaric Mass Tag Labeling Efficiency and Sample Mixing by LC-MS/MS\nTiming: 12 h",
    "The following steps are illustrative of our specific LC-MS/MS protocol and instrument; however, any mass spectrometer with beam-type CID and MS2 resolution ≥35,000 coupled to liquid chromatography and any database search algorithm capable of processing TMT labeled data should be suitable.\nTransfer the 20 individual diluted samples and the two mixed samples to total recovery glass autosampler vials to check the enrichment efficiency. The liquid needs to be in the bottom of the vial and must not contain any air bubbles.\nInject 10 μl of each diluted TMT labelled sample or mixture on an UltiMate 3000 HPLC system coupled to an Orbitrap FusionTM LumosTM TribridTM Mass Spectrometer. Set the nanoLC flow rate to 250 nl/min. Separate the peptides using the following gradient: 0-5 min (2 % mobile phase B), 33 min (40 % mobile phase B), 34-44 min (95 % mobile phase B), 45-60 min (2 % mobile phase B). (Phase A: 95 % H2O, 5 % DMSO, 0.1 % Formic Acid, Phase B: 75 % Acetonitrile, 5 % DMSO, 20 % H2O, 0.1 % Formic Acid).\nUse the following instrument method for the mixtures. MS settings: Orbitrap mass analyser (120000 resolution), scan range 400-1400 m/z, AGC target 4.0×105, maximum injection time 100 ms. Data dependent mode cycle time of 3 s between MS scans. MS2 settings: Orbitrap mass analyser 60000), activation type HCD, HCD collision energy 38 %, isolation window 0.7 m/z, first mass 100m/z, AGC target 1.0×105, maximum injection time 105 ms, include charge states 2-6, dynamic exclusion 30 s after 1 time.\nA more detailed discussion regarding data acquisition strategies for phospho-TMT experiments is provided by  Jiang et al, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].",
    "Perform a MaxQuant database search using an up to date S. cerevisiae proteome FASTA database (freely available from the UniProt website; http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/[href=http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/]) for the 20 label check samples (http://www.maxquant.org[href=http://www.maxquant.org] and guidelines to search process). Ensure that TMT10plex labels (+229.1629 Da on peptide N-termini and Lysine side chains) are selected as variable modifications.\nTo ensure that peptides have been optimally labelled, fewer than 5 % of the identified peptides within the modificationSpecificPeptides.txt output should not have a TMT10plex-Nter and/or TMT10plex-Lys variable modification. If this criterion is not reached for a specific sample, then a second round of labelling is recommended.\nPerform a MaxQuant database search using an up to date S. cerevisiae proteome database for the two mixing checks. Ensure that Reporter ion MS2 with TMT10plex for quantification is selected. During the MaxQuant analysis, the correction numbers of the TMT lot need to be taken into consideration. At this stage, difference in the quantity of proteins between each sample can be observed and will be adjusted during the mixing of the original samples (see point 6).\nTo ensure that samples are correctly mixed, the ratios of the summed reporter ion intensities (peptides.txt) of each individual sample within a mixture should ideally be within a range of 0.75-1.33\nWhen the criteria for mixing and labelling efficiency are satisfied, thaw the samples and quench the reaction with 16 μl of 5 % hydroxylamine (solution in 50 mM HEPES) for 15 min at ∼22 °C.\nAcidify with 10 % formic acid to ∼pH 2 (∼40 μl).\nCombine individually the two groups of the 10 TMT labelled samples according to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. If the samples do not have the same concentration of proteins (see point 4.6), adjust proportionally the volume of each sample before mixing.",
    "Dry, or partially dry to remove the organic solvent (∼30 %), by vacuum centrifugation before Sep Pak clean up. After drying for 2 h the organic solvent should have been removed. Store the dried samples at -80 °C.\nPause Point: Dried peptides can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely.\nC18 SepPak Lite Cleanup of the Pooled Samples\nTiming: 2 h + drying\nAs in Major Step ‘C18 Spin Column Cleanup of Proteolytic Digests’, a C18 SepPak is used for each sample in conjunction with a vacuum manifold set at -2 psi, to slowly pass each solution below through the solid phase extraction device.\nThaw the dried, pooled TMT samples, resuspend in 0.1 % TFA and centrifuge briefly.\nCheck that the pH is ≤2, acidify with TFA, if necessary.\nWash the columns with 3.2 ml of acetonitrile and condition them with 1.1 ml of 50 % acetonitrile with 0.5 % acetic acid. For the following steps, make sure that the entire solution passes through the device without drying the column.\nEquilibrate the columns with 3.2 ml 0.1 % TFA. Discard the flow through.\nLoad the samples onto the columns. Retain the flow-through.\nDesalt with 3.2 ml of 0.1 % TFA and wash the columns with 325 μl of 0.5% acetic acid. Combine the flow through with the flow through from Step 5 and store at -80 °C in case of technical or user error during procedure and loss of sample.\nElute the peptides from the column by adding 1.8 ml of 50 % acetonitrile with 0.5 % acetic acid.",
    "Perform a final check of the mixed sample by LC-MS/MS. In theory, 2 mg of proteins are present in each combined sample (200 μg from the 10 original samples). Dilute 10 μl of the elution in 90 μl 0.1% TFA and perform the final check by injecting 10 μl for 60 min gradient elution on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer with an HCD MS2 fragmentation method, as described in Section 4.\nDry the eluted peptides by vacuum centrifugation (∼4 h, ambient). Store the dried samples at -80 °C.\nPause Point: Dried peptides can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely.\nAlternatives: As in step 2, C18 MacroSpin column in conjunction with a centrifuge can be used to replace the C18 SepPak column and vacuum.\nNote: As in step 2, flow-through fractions of 5. and 6. are unlikely to contain peptides, they are retained in case of fault during the procedure.\nNote: Ideally the dried samples will remain frozen under vacuum centrifugation and have a yellow/white powder appearance. Sometimes, sample might have an oily appearance.\nPhosphopeptide Enrichment Using Sequential Enrichment of Metal Oxide Affinity Chromatography (SMOAC)\nTiming: 1 day\nSequential enrichment by Metal Oxide Affinity Chromatography (SMOAC) is used to increase the phosphopeptide enrichment. It combines titanium dioxide (Thermo Scientific High-SelectTM TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment kit) and ferric nitrilotriacetate (Thermo Scientific High-SelectTM Fe-NTA phosphopeptide enrichment kit) phosphopeptide enrichment procedures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/66-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. SMOAC Strategy—Combination of TiO2 and Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kits\nInitially, enrichment is performed using the hermo Scientific High-SelectTM TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment kit. Suspend the lyophilized peptide samples in 150 μl of Binding/Equilibration Buffer. Sonicate the sample tubes for 10-15 min in an ultrasonic bath until complete dissolution and centrifuge at 18000 × g for 5 min. Only soluble material should be used.",

Dry by vacuum centrifugation (∼3 h). It is normal to observe a rose-tinted jelly-like material at the end of the drying.\nSecondary enrichment of the dried TiO2 flow-through fractions is completed using Thermo Scientific High-SelectTM Fe-NTA phosphopeptide enrichment kit. Solubilize the dried TiO2 flow-through fractions in 200 μl of binding buffer using an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes. The manufacturer supplied protocol is then followed.\nRetain and combine the flow-through and wash fractions (which can be analyzed for protein level quantification, if required. Dry the combined flow through and eluate using vacuum centrifugation (2 h).\nCritical: Peptides should be stored as lyophilized pellets at -80 °C.
