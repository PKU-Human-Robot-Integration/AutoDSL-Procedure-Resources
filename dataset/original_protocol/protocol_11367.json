    "The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.\n1. Material Selection\nChoice of starting material\n\tNOTE: In most cases of CLL the tumor cell count is high at diagnosis (>80-90%). Thus, cell sorting or enrichment of the leukemic cells is usually not necessary.\n\t\nIf using Peripheral blood (PB), the most common material of choice for IG gene sequence analysis, use a blood volume between 10-20 mL.\nAlternatively, in cases with a low CLL cell burden, use cell sorting of PB samples or material from other tissues, like bone marrow (BM) or lymph nodes (LN).\nSampling time\nSampling time is not crucial given that the IG SHM status is stable overtime; that said, avoid sampling at certain periods, such as immediately after or during therapy, since the low number of CLL cells may complicate the analysis and lead to unreliable results.\nMaterial collection and storage\n\tNOTE: Collection and storage of starting material depends strongly on the material choice.\n\t\nFor PB or BM samples, use EDTA or CPT (citrate-tris-pyridossalphosphate) collection tubes to prevent inhibition of the PCR amplification process; alternatively, use heparin tubes.\nFor LN samples, collection options are either cell suspensions, biopsies from fresh frozen tissue or, in rare instances formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.\n2. Density Gradient Separation\nNOTE: If PB or BM is the starting material of choice, which is the most frequent scenario, mononuclear cell isolation using density gradient separation is recommended.\nAdd 200 µL of EDTA (0.5 M EDTA/ pH 8.0) to a 50 mL sterile collection tube. Add 20 mL of PB and 15 mL of RPMI. Mix by pipetting (2-3 times is sufficient).\nAdd 15 mL of density gradient medium to a new 50 mL collection tube.",
    "NOTE: In case the PB volume is less than 20 mL, the volumes of RPMI (previous step) and density gradient should be modified accordingly.\nSlowly layer in the solution from step 2.1 so that it does not disrupt the gradient. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 20 minutes with the centrifuge brake off.\nCollect the mononuclear cell ring that has formed between the upper plasma/platelet layer and the density gradient medium layer using a sterile Pasteur pipette, then transfer to a sterile 15 mL collection tube.\nAdd RPMI to a final volume of 12 mL and mix. Centrifuge at 750 x g for 8 minutes. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet using 10 mL of RPMI and repeat step 2.5.\nDissolve the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS (DPBS, no calcium, no magnesium). Perform a cell count using a Neubauer plate by mixing 20 µL of sample and 80 µL of 1:10 Türk's solution.\nIf downstream processing of the sample is not scheduled for the same day, centrifuge the sample at 750 x g for 8 minutes. Discard the supernatant and store the cell pellet at -80o C.\n3. Nucleic Acid Extraction\nDecide on a substrate for analysis of the SHM status of IG genes. Genomic DNA (gDNA) is the most popular choice as there is no need for a reverse transcription step; alternatively, the use of RNA/complementary DNA (cDNA) ensures that, at least at the transcriptional level, the productive, functional clonotypic IG rearrangement is the \"favored\" target.\nUse one of numerous commercially available kits suitable for gDNA or total RNA extraction and the synthesis of cDNA (see Table of Materials).",
    "Assess the integrity of the DNA or RNA using sensitive nucleic acid quantification systems. If using FFPE material for the analysis, assess the quality and quantity of the extracted gDNA/cDNA by PCR amplification of a known housekeeping gene, e.g. retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa), beta-actin, etc..\n4. Amplification and Sequencing of IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ Gene Rearrangements\nIGH PCR primer selection\nPreferably, perform multiplex PCR with IGHV subgroup specific 5' primers and IGHJ gene specific 3' primers25,26. If results are sub-optimal, prepare separate PCR mixes using single IGHV subgroup-specific primers.\nUse 5' primers that anneal to either the leader region located immediately upstream of the IG rearrangement or within the coding region (e.g. framework 1, FR1) of the IGHV gene.\n\t\t\nUse leader primers that allow for the amplification of the entire rearranged IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene sequence, which in turn will enable the accurate estimation of SHM levels. Thus, IGHV leader primers are recommended by ERIC in their updated guidelines for IG gene sequence analysis27.\nIn instances where leader primers fail to amplify the clonotypic IG rearrangement, use IGHV FR1 primers. However, framework primers do not amplify the entire clonotypic IG gene rearrangement, which may lead to inaccurate determination of the level of SHM. For this scenario, clearly state in the clinical report that the use of IGHV FR1 primers may overestimate the true percent identity to the closest germline gene.\nFor the 3' end, use consensus primers targeting the IGHJ genes, multiplex sets of IGHJ gene-specific primers or isotype-specific primers, depending on the substrate. Primer sequences are provided in Table 1, whereas Figure 1 depicts the various locations for primer annealing.\nPCR amplification of IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements\nPrepare the primer mix using equimolar quantities of each subgroup primer(s) to ensure unbiased amplification.",
    "For example, when using leader primers, two different primers are used to amplify rearrangements belonging to the IGHV1 subgroup. Thus, use a quantity of these 2 primers (IGHV1L and IGHV1bL) that is half compared to IGHV4L, which is the only primer for IGHV4 subgroup rearrangements.\nApply the opposite approach in the case of the IGHJ1-2 and IGHJ4-5 primers. As these primers target two different IGHJ gene subgroups, double the quantity compared to the IGHJ3 and IGHJ6 primers.\nUse Table 1 to determine the exact primer quantities when preparing relevant primer mixes.\nMix PCR reagents as listed in Table 2. After combining all the PCR reagents in a PCR tube, add 0.5 µL of Taq polymerase and 100 ng of gDNA or 2 µL of cDNA (cDNA should be prepared using 1 µg of RNA).\n\t\tNOTE: A Taq enzyme with proofreading activity is not essential as the amplification error rate is extremely low and will therefore not affect the level of SHM.\nRun the thermal PCR protocol detailed in Table 3.\nClonality assessment\n\tNOTE: A critical next step involves evaluating the clonality pattern of the PCR product. When assessing clonality in CLL patients, the most common finding is a single, monoclonal peak/band.\n\t\nUse methods with high-sensitivity, such as fragment or heteroduplex analysis, for clonality assessment28,29.\nFragment analysis\n\t\t\nPerform multiplex PCRs using 5'-labeled IGHV leader or FR1 subgroup specific PCR primers; this will yield PCR products that can be separated by capillary electrophoresis, thereby permitting clonality assessment of the IGH PCR products based on their IGHV complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) lengths.",
    "Use primers, reagents and thermal conditions identical to those previously mentioned (see Tables 1-3). Custom 5´- labeled primers are fluorescently labeled oligos with a choice of dyes on the 5' end. Examples of reporter dyes include 6-FAM, HEX, NED or TET. Thus, 2 separate reactions are required based on the use of 3 different dyes per reaction.\nAssess the size of the PCR products on a six percent (6%) polyacrylamide gel (this percentage results in optimal resolution), using 1x TBE as a running buffer. Run at 80 V for 45 min.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended that PCR products are allowed to migrate on the gel for sufficient time so that monoclonal samples can be separated from the polyclonal background and the DNA size marker can separate adequately. Factors such as the size and thickness of the gel can affect migration so no single setting (voltage and time) can guarantee an optimal result That said, setting the voltage at 80 V for 45 minutes is a good starting point as it minimizes the risk of the sample migrating too quickly and 'running' off the gel.\nCheck for PCR products of approximately 500 base pairs when using IGHV leader primers and 350 base pairs when using the IGHV FR1 primer mixes.\n\t\tNOTE: In rare instances, CLL cases have been found to carry double, monoclonal products and in even rarer instances, cases may exhibit an oligoclonal pattern. An intercalating agent such as Ethidium bromide (EtBr) or less hazardous and more sensitive commercially available DNA stains can be used for the visualization of DNA on acrylamide gels using UV excitation or blue-light.\nPCR product purification",
    "NOTE: PCR products are purified to remove any polyclonal background originating from normal B cells within the CLL sample as well as primer dimers that may lead to suboptimal sequencing. Use any method that removes unincorporated dNTPs and primers for PCR clean-up, such as an enzymatic treatment, e.g., Sap (shrimp alkaline phosphatase)/Exo (Exonuclease I), or column-based purification.\n\t\nLoad the total volume of the PCR product onto a 3% low-melting agarose gel.\nAllow the PCR products to run on the gel until they separate from the background.\nExcise the sharp, prominent PCR bands, purify and elute. If two rearrangements are detected, both bands should be excised and sequenced seperately.\nTo perform Sap/Exo clean-up, follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding the specific volumes to use; however a typical reaction may contain 1 µL Sap, 0. 5 µL Exo and 2 µL 5x incubation buffer per 5-10 µL PCR reaction. Mix by gently vortexing each sample and incubate on a PCR block at 37 °C for 30 minutes. Inactivate the enzymes by heating to 85 °C for 15 minutes.\nLoad a small quantity of the PCR products on a 3% agarose gel to assess the purity of the product.\n5. Sanger Sequencing\nNOTE: Several sequencing strategies exist, however, regardless of the exact approach, direct sequencing of both strands is mandatory to ensure a reliable result.\nGeneral sequencing protocols\nIf amplification has been performed using single primers, proceed with sequencing using the appropriate IGHV- and IGHJ- or constant region-specific primers. This approach can also be adopted if multiplexed fluorescently labeled primers have been used and the PCR product was assessed using fragment analysis (sequencing primers should not be labeled).",
    "If multiplexed primers have been used and clonality was assessed on a gel, then use a downstream primer at the first step of sequencing e.g. a consensus IGHJ primer with the sequence being 5'-GTGACCAGGGTNCCTTGGCCCCAG-3'. Alternatively, a CH primer can be used if cDNA was used as substrate. Next, use subgroup-specific IGHV leader or FR1 primers for the second sequencing step.\nExample sequencing protocol\n\tNOTE: Several sequencing protocols exist and an example protocol is detailed below.\n\t\nDilute 33 ng of the PCR product in a total volume of 11.5 µL using, e.g., sterile water. Denature the PCR product by heating to 95 °C for 5 minutes. Immediately place on ice for 10 minutes to prevent formation of secondary structures.\nAdd 8 µL of master mix to each tube along with 0.5 µL (corresponding to 5 pmol) of the primer.\nAs a control, prepare a tube containing 8 µL of master mix, 0.5 µL pUC18 control template, 2 µL (-)47 sequencing primer and 9.5 µL sterile water. The final total volume in each tube should be 20 µL.\nUse thermal cycling conditions for the sequencing reaction as detailed in Table 4.\nPrepare the Stop Solution by mixing 2 µL of sodium acetate 3M (pH 5.2), 2 µL EDTA 100 Mm (pH 8.0) and 1 µL of glycogen (concentration 20 mg/mL), then add 5 µL to each sample. Transfer the product to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 60 µL of 100% ethanol (-20 °C) and gently mix. Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes (4 °C). Discard the supernatant.\nAdd 100 µL of 70% ethanol (-20 °C) and gently mix. Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes (4 °C). Discard the supernatant. Repeat once.",
    "Dry the pellet for 90 minutes at room temperature. Add 40 µL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution to each sample.\nTransfer the sample to a sequencing plate, cover with strip caps or tape seals, load to the machine and perform Sanger sequencing. The sequencing plate is usually a 96-well, v-bottom, full-skirt PCR plate compatible with the sequencer. The plates may be barcoded depending on whether the sequencing is to be performed in-house, at a commercial company or at an academic sequencing center/platform.\nAfter sequencing, 'stitch together' the 2 reads generated from the individual sequencing steps to form a complete IGHV gene rearrangement i.e., the consensus sequence.\n6. Sequence Analysis\nNOTE: The following sections focus on the output obtained from the IMGT/V-QUEST tool30 when analyzing rearranged IG sequences, and IMGT/JunctionAnalysis31, both of which are particularly relevant for clinical reporting and research studies. IMGT/V-QUEST is an alignment tool that compares user submitted IG sequences with the IMGT reference directory sets30. The tool output includes several sections within which the user can define certain parameters.\nSpecify the species, e.g., Homo sapiens (human), and receptor type or locus (e.g. IGH, IGK or IGL).\nPaste sequences to be analysed, in FASTA format and including headers, into the text area (in batches of up to 50 sequences per run). Alternatively, an option to enter the path to a local file containing the FASTA sequences is provided.\nChoose one of the following 3 display options for the results:\n\t\nDetailed view: choose this option in order to get the results for each sequence individually.",
    "Synthesis view: choose this option to compile a summary table ordered by IGHV gene and allele name or by sequence input order. This option also provides an alignment of sequences that, in any submitted batch, are assigned to the same IGHV gene and allele.\nExcel file: choose this option to provide all output files as spreadsheets incorporated into a single file. All viewing options have a large selection of basic and advanced parameters to choose from, however only the factors most pertinent to CLL IG sequence analysis are discussed below in the 'Representative Results' section.\n7. ARResT/AssignSubsets Tool\nTo investigate BcR IG stereotypy within CLL (additional details provided below in the 'Representative results' section), submit IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ FASTA sequences to the ARResT/AssignSubsets tool32. The tool reports the assignment to major CLL stereotyped subsets. The subset-assignment tool together with detailed instructions are available on the ARResT/AssignSubset website32 and also on the ERIC website under the services tab."
