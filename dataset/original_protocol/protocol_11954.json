    "1. Preparation of Solutions and Reagents\nPrepare complete Human Endothelial-SFM medium (EC-SFM FULL) by adding platelet-poor plasma-derived serum (1%), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 20 ng/mL) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 50 ng/mL) to Human Endothelial-SFM (see Table of Materials). Filter the medium through a 0.22 µm pore filter and store it at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nPrepare complete RPMI medium by adding fetal bovine serum (10%), 2-mercaptoethanol (0.05 nM), L-glutamine (1%), Penicillin-Streptomycin (25 U/mL) to RPMI medium (see Table of Materials). Store at 4 °C for up to 3 weeks.\n2. Coating of Microfluidic Chips\nPlace a sterile biochip into a 10 cm sterile Petri dish.\nPrepare fibronectin working solution by reconstituting the stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+/Mg2+ to a final concentration of 50 µg/mL. Estimate 80 µL of working solution per biochip.\nInject 10 µL of fibronectin working solution into each channel of the biochip. Use a pipette with small 10 µL tips and make sure to form a tight contact between the channel inlet and the pipette tip (Figure 1C, left).\nClose the lid of the Petri dish containing the biochip and place it in a humidified chamber (Figure 2B). Store the chamber at 4 °C overnight. To humidify the chamber, place a clean tissue paper at the bottom of the humidified chamber and add 5 mL of sterile H2O.\nNext day, before the assay, pre-warm the biochip at 37 °C in the incubator.\n3. Preparation of hiPSC-ECs\nNOTE: In the protocol described here, hiPSC-ECs were differentiated, purified, cryopreserved and thawed as previously described8.\nThaw and plate hiPSC-ECs in complete EC-SFM FULL into one 0.1 % gelatin-coated T75 flask, three to four days prior the assay.",
    "The night prior to the assay, stimulate hiPSC-ECs with TNFα by adding EC-SFM FULL supplemented with 10 ng/mL TNFα and incubate overnight (~12 h) at 37 °C, as previously described 7.\n4. hiPSC-ECs Dissociation and Seeding into Microfluidic Chip\nOn the day of the assay, take the flask of hiPSC-ECs from the incubator and examine the cells under the microscope. Ensure that hiPSC-ECs are 80–100% confluent and have a typical EC-like morphology.\nTransfer the flask into the cell culture hood.\nAspirate the medium from the flask of hiPSC-ECs.\nBriefly wash the cell culture by adding 10 mL of PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+. Aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 4 mL per flask of 1x dissociation enzyme. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT) (Figure 1B).\nStop the dissociation reaction by adding 8 mL of Human Endothelial-SFM medium per flask. Gently detach and collect the hiPSC-ECs suspension in a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL pipette.\nCount the total number of the cells in the suspension.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 3 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in EC-SFM FULL to a final concentration of 1.5 x 107 cells/mL.\nTake out the Petri dish with the biochip from the incubator and transfer it to the cell culture hood.\nAspirate the fibronectin solution from all the channels of the microfluidic chip.\nInject 6 µL of the cell suspension into each channel using a pipette with a small 10 µL tip (Figure 1C, middle). Make sure that the cell suspension is mixed well before the injection and avoid cell precipitation.\nExamine the biochip under the microscope and ensure that the cells are uniformly distributed, and the cell density is high (Figure 2C).\nIncubate the biochip for 15 min at 37 °C.",
    "Add 40 µL of EC-SFM FULL into the medium reservoirs from both sides of each channel.\nIncubate the biochip for 1 h at 37 °C (Figure 1C, right).\nAdd another 50 µL of EC-SFM FULL into the reservoirs from both sides of each channel.\n5. Preparation of Human Leukocytes\nNOTE: In the protocol described here, a commercially available monocytic cell line (THP-1) was used. Alternatively, peripheral blood mononuclear cells or neutrophils can be used. Isolation of peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils can be performed using standard procedure11. Perform all steps described in this paragraph in a cell culture hood.\nCollect the leukocytes in a 50 mL conical tube.\nWash the leukocytes with 10 mL of PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 3 min at RT (Figure 1D).\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS with DiOC6 dye (λex = 485 nm, λem = 501 nm) (1:5,000). Incubate the cells in the dark for 10 min at RT.\nWash the leukocytes with 10 mL of PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 3 min at RT. Repeat the washing step one more time.\nCount the total number of the cells in the suspension.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in complete RPMI medium to a final concentration of 2.5 x 106 cells/mL.\n6. Preparation of the Microfluidic Pump\nAssemble the microfluidic pump with the 8-channel manifold.\nConnect the pump to a PC with the installed operating software.\nStart the microfluidic software and load the protocol by clicking Open Protocol and navigate on the PC to select the microfluidic protocol.\nConnect the software and the pump by selecting the Setup folder and clicking Run Assay Step.",
    "Define the geometry of the channels for the correct flow rate control: select Update Geometry in the Geometry Setup folder and click Run Assay Step.\nNOTE: Make sure that the geometry details match the syringe and channels to be used (Geometry ID = 1, Number of channels = 8, Channel width = 800.0 µm, Channel depth = 120.0 µm, Syringe volume = 250 µL) and the viscosity of the sample (Liquid viscosity = 1.0).\nWash the pump by placing the inlet cable (orange) into the 50 mL conical tube containing 80% ethanol. Place the outlet cable (green) in the 50 mL conical empty tube (waste container).\nSelect the Washout/Pump Washout folder and click Run Assay Step (Wash volume = 2000 µL, Wash volume step = 250 µL, Washout direction = Output). Repeat the washing step once more.\nRepeat the pump washing steps (Steps 6.6–6.7) with cell culture grade water, and Human Endothelial-SFM culture medium.\nContinue with the washing step of the manifold.\nManually open the valve between the syringe and the manifold by placing the 3-way adapter into the correct position (indicator OFF is turned to the left).\nSelect Set Current Channel/Open step in the Washout/Manifold Wash folder and click Run Assay Step to open all valves of the manifold.\nWash the manifold manually by pushing 5 mL of 80% ethanol from the syringe, followed by 5 mL of cell culture grade water.\nWash the manifold by pushing 5 mL of Human Endothelial-SFM culture medium from the syringe.\nRemove all large air bubbles that are trapped in the manifold. To do this, place the 8-well pin adapter into the 10 cm Petri dish with the medium and perform pushing/pulling with the syringe until all large air bubbles are gone (small bubbles are not a problem).",
    "Select Set Current Channel/Close step in the Washout/Manifold Wash folder and click Run Assay Step to close all valves of the manifold.\nConnect the green outlet cable from the pump to the manifold adapter.\nSwitch the 3-way valve back to the OFF position to close the syringe.\nSelect Washout/Cable Washout folder and click Run Assay Step to wash each port with RPMI medium individually, ensuring that all bubbles are removed from each cable (Dispense volume = 100 µL).\nNOTE: Each valve of the manifold is opened one-by-one, 1 to 8, and 100 μL of the medium is dispensed through each individual channel while keeping the other channels closed. Make sure that the liquid runs from each pin. If there is no liquid coming out, it is an indication of an air bubble or a clog.\n7. Preparation of the Microfluidic Chip for Live Imaging\nEnsure that the microfluidic setups are ready, and the live imaging chamber is pre-equilibrated to 37 °C and the level of CO2 reaches 5% (Figure 3A, B).\nTake the biochip from the incubator and position it in the microscope chip holder. Mount the chip holder on the microscope imaging stage (Figure 3C).\nIn order to connect the biochip to the pump via the manifold, place the 8-pin adapter close to the outlet reservoirs of the chip and deepen all pins in the medium (but do not connect completely).\nSelect the Washout | Connect to Chip folder and click Run Assay Step to dispense RPMI medium prior to connecting the chip (Dispense volume = 30 mL). Once the medium is dispensed, insert the 8-pin adapter into the outlet of the biochip.",
    "NOTE: During this step, all channels are set to On (open) and 30 µL of the medium is dispensed through each channel and following this the channels are set to Off (closed). This ensures that no air bubbles will be introduced into the channels of the microfluidic chip.\nManually aspirate the medium from all inlet reservoirs of the biochip with a pipette.\nSelect the Washout | Chip Washout folder and click Run Assay Step to perfuse 40 μL of EC-SFM FULL medium through each of the channels one-by-one to get rid of the dead cells/debris from the channel (Washout volume = 40 µL, Maximum washout shear = 40 dynes/cm2).\n8. Flow Adhesion Assay and Image Acquisition\nManually aspirate the medium from the inlet reservoir of the channel of interest with a pipette.\nAdd 100 µL of leukocytes from Step 5.6 to the inlet reservoir of the channel of interest.\nNOTE: Gently mix the cells to make a single-cell suspension.\nIn the Cell Assay | Step Description folder, select Set Current Channel/Step Description and, in the list of channels, select only the current channel of interest and set to On (open) and set all other seven channels to Off (closed).\nSelect the Cell Assay | Step Description folder and click Run Assay Step.\nNOTE: Make sure that Variable Flow Rate Dispensing applies constant negative pressure to pull the leukocyte suspension from the inlet reservoir through the channel for 5 min (Shear set = Constant, Shear stress = -0.5 dyne/cm2, Duration = 00:05:00, Scan delay = 00:00:00). The negative value of shear stress ensures the correct direction of the flow.\nAspirate the remaining leukocytes from the inlet reservoir.",
    "Add 100 µL of complete RPMI medium to the inlet reservoir. Select Cell Assay/Step description folder and click Run Assay Step to perfuse the channel for 5 min with RPMI medium in order to wash out all non-adherent leukocytes (Shear set = Constant, Shear stress = -0.5 dyne/cm2, Duration = 00:05:00, Scan delay = 00:00:00).\nAcquire images from at least three to four different positions of the channel to image the adhered leukocytes (to ensure that representative areas are captured).\nRepeat Steps 8.1–8.7 for functional assessment of all the rest of the channels.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to run multiple channels at once. To do so, open all the channels of interest during the Step 8.3. and perform all aforementioned Steps 8.4 –8.7 for multiple channels of interest.\n9. Completing the Assay and Cleaning the Microfluidic Pump\nAfter completing the experiment, export and save all images in a RAW format.\nWhile saving the results, run the microfluidic pump and the manifold cleaning protocol.\nFor the microfluidic pump, run the Washout/Pump Washout folder first by perfusing 4 mL of cell culture grade water, followed by 4 mL of 80% ethanol as described in Steps 6.6–6.7 Dry the pump by running air for several minutes.\nIn order to clean the manifold, run Washout/Manifold Wash step with the syringe. Follow the steps to open the syringe and the manifold valves as described in Steps 6.10–6.11 Wash first with 80% ethanol and next with cell culture grade water. Dry the manifold by pushing air via the syringe. Close the syringe valve and the manifold valves as described in Steps 6.10 and 6.15.\n10.
