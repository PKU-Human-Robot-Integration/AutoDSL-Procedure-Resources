    "A schematic summary of the reprogramming procedure described in this protocol can be found in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301094151_2346.jpgFigure 1. The schematic view of general procedures for the reversion of EpiSCs by MM-401 treatment Preparation of MEF feeder cells: Irradiated MEF feeder cells are seeded at 1 x 105 cell/well in MEF medium in a 24-well plate (pre-coated with 0.2% gelatin solution). EpiSC culture: EpiSCs are routinely cultured following previously described protocol (Chenoweth and Tesar, 2010). For chemical treatment experiments, EpiSCs are cultured in the 24-well plate and enzymatically passaged every third day (see Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301094333_1572.jpgFigure 2. Representative phase image of EpiSCs at the third day of culture before splitting. Scale bar = 50 μm.To passage,Remove EpiSC culture medium from each well and wash briefly with PBS. Discard PBS and add 150 μl of collagenase type IV or 0.05% trypsin to each well, and incubate at room temperature for up to 4 min. Add 1 ml of EpiSC culture medium (without FGF2) to each well and gently pipet with a 1-ml pipette. Combine suspensions from 1 to 2 wells into a 15-ml conical tube. Add EpiSC culture medium (without FGF2) to a final volume of 5 ml to each tube for centrifugation. Separate EpiSCs from MEFs (Optional):For EpiSCs passaging in small cluster, separate clusters by centrifugation at 8 x g for 15 sec (25 °C). The EpiSC clusters will loosely pellet while the individual MEFs remain in the supernatant.For EpiSCs passaging in single cell, separate EpiSCs by centrifugation at 8 x g for 3 min (25 °C). A mixture of the MEFs and EpiSCs will loosely pallet while the individual single EpiSC will remain in the supernatant.Examine the separated EpiSCs after centrifugation under the microscope. Single EpiSCs and remaining MEF feeder cells can be distinguished by size (see Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.",

Representative image shows the EpiSCs and MEF feeders (collected from 2 well of 24-well plate) before and after centrifugation under the microscope. A and A’. EpiSCs and MEF feeder before separation; B and B’. MEF feeder cells. Black arrow, MEF feeder; Open arrow, EpiSC cells; Open circle, MEF feeder cells, which are still 2-3-fold larger than single EpiSC cell. Scale bar = 100 μm.  Plating of EpiSCs for reversion: EpiSCs were passaged in single cell or small clumps on MEF feeder cells (as described in step 1) in MM-401 reversion medium.Centrifuge the EpiSCs (from step 2b or 2c), aspirate and discard the supernatant. Resuspend EpiSC pellet in MM-401 reversion medium. For the 24-well plate, add 400 μl MM-401 reversion medium to each well. For EpiSCs passaging in small cluster, replate cells to a new well with 1:4-1:5 dilutions. For EpiSCs passaging in single cells, plate the cells at 20,000/cm2 (approximately 4 x 104 cell/well for the 24-well plate, see Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301094701_8591.jpgFigure 4. Representative image of single EpiSCs plated at the density of 20,000 cell/cm2. Scale bar = 200 μm.Establish MM-401-reverted ESC lineMorphologically distinct reverted naïve colonies become evident over the next 3-6 days. AKP is used to stain the colonies to evaluate reversion efficiency. Strong AKP staining distinguishes the reverted naïve colonies from EpiSCs that have weak AKP staining (see Figure 5). AKP activity is detected using VectorTM alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301094809_9957.jpgFigure 5. AKP staining of EpiSCs and reverted naïve colonies after MM-401 treatment as indicated on top.

The reverted cells (indicated by arrows) are morphologically distinct from EpiSCs.",
    "The colonies are dome-shaped with intense AKP staining. Scale bar = 100 μmThe reversion culture is passaged by a brief exposure (4-5 min) to 0.05% trypsin/EDTA with gentle pipetting into single cells. Cells can be re-seeded at 20,000-50,000/cm2. MM-401 is replenished to reach 50-100 μM final concentrations in each passage. Reverted ESC (rESC) lines can be established by clone picking or en masse passaging. The established rESC line can be maintained, passaged, cryopreserved and thawed by the standard protocol for conventional mESCs.rESC line can be expanded in MM-401 maintenance medium or ESC culture medium without MM-401 after passage 6."
