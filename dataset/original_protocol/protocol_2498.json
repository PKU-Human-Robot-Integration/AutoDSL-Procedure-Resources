    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nZebrafish larval model of lipid accumulation\nTiming: 13–20 days\nTiming: Breeding: 1–2 h (for step 1)\nTiming: Embryo collection: 15–20 min (for step 2)\nTiming: Transfer of larvae from plate to tank: 5–10 min (for step 3)\nTiming: Feeding: 5–10 min; Tank cleaning: 10–15 min (for step 6)\nToward understanding the lipid deposition in intersegmental vessels of larvae upon administering cholesterol rich diet, a primer of pre-atherosclerotic event that occurs in humans due to high lipid intake, zebrafish model of lipid accumulation can be generated as stated below:\nObtain embryos via in-house breeding of wild-caught zebrafish.\nThe wildtype zebrafish should be fed with artemia (INVE aquaculture; Feed type: FRiPPAK PL+150) diet twice a day and should be maintained in tanks that recirculates reverse osmosed, 0.2% sea-salt added water at 28 ± 1°C, and also maintains a 12 h dark/light cycle.\nNote: In our case, we used Tecniplast active blue stand-alone rack to maintain live fish.\nLive shrimp in brine should be given every alternate day along with control artemia feed.\nA week prior to mating, the fish should be gender segregated and maintained in separate tanks.\nCarry out in-house breeding of male and female fish of minimum 2 months old, in the ratio of 3:2 in a breeding chamber that imitates shallow waters.\nNote: For our experiments, we used a chamber that contains a pitted partition where the embryos can be collected without being damaged.\nPreceding day of mating, the fish should be well fed with artemia and shrimp and are kept gender parted (via removable divider) in the breeding chamber.\nThe following day, artificial light (in addition to day-light) should be switched on and the divider should be taken off.",
    "Maintain embryos in bacterial petri plates with E3 media at 28°C for 5 days.\nCritical: Examine for any embryonic deaths (opaque white yolk) the following day and remove the infertile embryos as they clump with healthy ones and damages them otherwise.\nNote: Change media using 3 mL plastic pipette dropper with caution not to damage the healthy embryos. Add around 15 mL of E3 media to each petri plate and do not maintain more than 50 embryos in one plate. Add an additional 1 mL of fresh E3 media to the plate every consecutive day till fifth day (post fertilization).\nOnce larvae emerge from the chorion, transfer 5 dpf (5 days post fertilization) larvae to fresh water tank and feed with finely powdered artemia twice a day.\nSprinkle powdered artemia (INVE aquaculture; Feed type: FRiPPAK PL+150) of 0.2 g using paint brush twice a day.\nCritical: Clean the water surface by sliding a tissue every day to clear the sedimented left-over powder before feeding fresh powder.\nAdd fresh water to the tank every alternate day till termination of experiments (till 13–20 dpf). Do not harvest more than 100 larvae in a single tank of dimension 10∗19.5∗9 inches.\nFill the water up to not more than half of the tank’s height (approximately 250 mL).\nIn case of observations of abundant larval deaths with powdered artemia feed, shift to lab-cultured live microalgae and rotifer co-culture as control feed to larvae from 5 dpf till completion of experiments (13/20 dpf).\nNote: The cause of deaths could be due to inability of larvae to ingest the powder because of its size (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1).\nUpon usage of microalgae and rotifer co-culture, prepare fresh culture every month and add 1 mL of the culture to the larvae twice a day.",
    "To generate zebrafish model of lipid accumulation, use a feed load of 0.8 mg/mL (0.08%; 0.2 g of boiled egg yolk in 250 mL of water).\nThe store-bought eggs used to prepare HFD feed should be boiled at medium flame for 6–7 min.\nProvide both control and high fat diet at the same time every day for control and test batches.\nBoil antibiotic free egg, separate the yolk and crush into powder using mortar and pestle and store in −20°C for not more than 3 days.\nNote: Prepare another batch of fresh yolk post usage for three days as feed.\nEvery day, weigh 0.2 g of boiled egg yolk, re-suspend in fresh water and add to the larvae as drops so that the yolk is mixed throughout.\nBlend the powdered yolk with water via pipetting using a 5 mL dropper gently for not more than 7 times.\nCritical: Rigorous or fine mixing of egg yolk and water must be avoided as it will generate fungi like mass in water making it hard for the larvae to breath. Also, some larvae may get stuck in the mass and die.\nHence, remove the yolk remnants that are settled at the bottom of the tank everyday (using disposable 5 mL droppers) and add little bit fresh water to make up the volume to ∼250 mL. Marking the tank would aid in filling of water to the required level. In addition to the removal of the debris (settled yolk and excreta) every day, change the water every alternate day as mentioned for control feed to reduce the microbial load (steps-3b,3c). To monitor the microbial load, the water may be analyzed for microbial growth via performing colony counts on agar plates post washing off the feed.",
    "Note: a) Dried chicken egg yolk powder has been used as a HFD diet by various researchers to establish hyperlipidemia in adult zebrafish as well as in zebrafish larvae (Marza et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]) (Otis and Farber, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). Interestingly, Carten et al. utilized thawed frozen chicken egg yolk and zebrafish embryonic membrane emulsion feed to deliver different chain length FA analogs (BODIPY-FL) (Carten et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). It is also to be noted that feed quality, intake and other characteristics show variation from lab to lab and even within experiments (Watts et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]). b) Earlier reports suggest different frequencies of water change during zebrafish larval maintenance, especially during usage of egg yolk or egg yolk liposomes as feed (Zhou et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]) (Ye et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]) (Den Broeder et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) (Chen et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) (Maddison and Chen, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). However, the rationale behind the same depends on the larval density and the amount of egg yolk used in a high-fat diet (HFD). In our case, for a feed density of 0.8 mg /mL of boiled egg yolk in water, and a larval density of 100 larvae per 250 mL of water, we change water every alternate day in addition to manual surface cleaning every day before feeding (steps-3a, 3b and 6a–c).\nFor staining experiments, harvest the larvae by 13 days (as 8 days of HFD feeding to visually observe the lipid deposition in head, trunk, tail as well as in intersegmental vessels). However, for lipid estimation studies, continue the feed till 20 days (15 days of feeding) as very less amounts of lipids will be obtained from 13 dpf larvae.",
    "Note: it is to be noted that in studies involving drug administration or genetic modifications where the larval feed uptake may vary as a response, control feeding assays should be performed in the animals for rational validation. Various researches have utilized fluorescently labeled viable paramecia such as 4-10-Di-ASP-labeled paramecia, fish food coated fluorescent microspheres or fluorescent Tetrahymena to evaluate the feed intake, especially in larvae, in view of their transparent body (Shimada et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]) (Boyer et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (Hsieh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) (Hsieh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). For appropriate HFD controls in hyperlipidemic studies, high fat feed serves are fluorescently (NBD- and BODIPY-Cholesterol) or radioactively labeled (14C-labeled lipids) to monitor lipid trafficking in live larvae, which can be used to indirectly measure lipid (feed) uptake (Sæle et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]) (Anderson et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Additional experimental designs may be applied with the individual researcher’s decision to account for any potential metabolic effects associated with perturbation of specific genes under study.\nTo measure cholesterol and free fatty acid levels using kits from Erba and Sigma respectively, extract lipids using Bligh and Dyer method and concentrate the lipids via solvent evaporation through nitrogen streaming, which are described in the following sections.\nOn the day of larval harvesting for lipid estimation assays, starve the larvae from the previous day and collect them in the evening for further experimentations. This allows elimination of intestinal lipids and excessively stored fat depots.\nFluorescent and calorimetric larval staining studies\nTiming: 5–6 h post 12–16 h fixation (for step 9)\nTiming: Harvesting: 20 min; Euthanization: 30–40 min (for step 9 a)\nTiming: 20–30 min (for step 9 e)\nTiming: 12–16 h (for step 9 f)\nTiming: 20–30 min (for step 9 g)\nTiming: 30–40 min (for step 9 h)\nTiming: 3(1/2)–4 h (for step 9 j)",
    "Timing: 20–30 min (for step 9 l)\nTiming: 20–30 min (for step 9 m)\nTiming: 5–6 h post overnight (12–16 h) fixation (for step 10)\nTiming: 35–40 min (for step 10 b)\nTiming: 20–30 min (for step 10 c)\nIn order to evaluate lipid distribution in zebrafish larvae or histology sections of adult fish, researchers, for many years have been using fixative stains such as Oil Red O and Nile red, and kit-based lipid estimation assays owing to their low costs and simple procedure. With standardization of protocols in accordance with our experiments, these techniques can yield high throughput results.\nCritical: Conduct all larval staining experiments and lipid estimation assays in 13–20 dpf larvae and in addition, the experiments will be gender blinded as sex determination is not possible at this developmental stage.\nOil Red O staining of zebrafish larvae. Intended for staining of neutral lipids such as cholesterol and triglycerides, Oil Red O stain has been used to demonstrate lipid accumulates in various systems ranging from cells to histological sections of animals. The dye is a lipid soluble lysochrome with the molecular formula C26H24N4O and has a calorimetric absorption at 518 nm, which therefore gives the lipids an orangish-red color upon observation under light microscope. Their inability to bind to biological membranes contribute to their specificity. Several studies have reported on Oil Red O staining of zebrafish larvae in the previous years (Chen et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Li et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Sadler et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]; Schlegel and Stainier, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]; Schlombs et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]). Based on that we have formulated and followed the below protocol for our experiments.\nPost 4 days of control/HFD diet administration, harvest the larvae in the evening in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube and euthanize via incubation in ice (4°C) for 30–40 min.",
    "Centrifuge the euthanized larvae in the tubes at 500 × g for 90 s and remove the water.\nAdd fresh 1× PBS to the tube and wash the larvae by gentle shaking for 3–5 min to remove any unwanted debris attached to the larvae.\nCentrifuge the larvae again centrifuged at the same speed and time followed by PBS removal.\nRepeat the 1× PBS washing thrice to ensure the elimination of contamination.\nPlace the tubes with the larvae in ice to a feasible extent and perform the centrifugation processes at 4°C.\nSubsequently, fix the larvae in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.\nPost fixation, wash the larvae three times with 1× PBS as described in steps-c to e, to remove any traces of paraformaldehyde.\nPost fixation, the specimens need not be maintained at 4°C.\nPre-incubate the larvae in 60% isopropyl alcohol for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with moderate shaking.\nFollowing incubation in 60% isopropanol, pellet the larvae via centrifugation at 500 × g for 90 s and remove the isopropanol solution.\nImmediately add the filtered Oil Red O stain to the fish followed by gentle shaking for 3 h at 37°C.\nAfter staining, centrifuge the larvae at 500 × g for 90 s at room temperature (20°C–25°C) and instantly remove the Oil Red O solution. Else the stain will form clumps which will be hard to remove during PBS wash in upcoming steps (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 2).\nCentrifuge the larvae at 500 × g for 90 s to remove the stain and wash with 60% isopropyl alcohol three times to rinse off non-specific staining.\nPerform the isopropanol wash similar to that of 1× PBS wash as described in steps-c to -e (Use 60% isopropanol in place of 1× PBS).",
    "Subsequently, wash the larvae with 1× PBS thrice as specified in steps-c to -e and proceed to visualize microscopically at 4× (for head, trunk, and tail region) or 10× (for intersegmental vessel section) in light microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2132-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Oil Red O and Nile red staining protocol of HFD-fed zebrafish larvae\nCritical: Oil Red O staining of zebrafish larvae must be carried out within 8 days post fertilization. In our case, even upon overnight (12–16 h) Oil Red O staining of 13 dpf larvae, bioimaging did not reveal any staining in larvae. Consistently, literature survey suggest that intensity of Oil Red O staining decreases in larvae post 6 dpf of age, especially in the intersegmental vessels despite similar lipid deposition, as revealed by fluorescence of CholEsteryl BODIPY 542/563 C11 (Chen et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNile red staining of zebrafish larvae. For fluorescent staining, 9-diethylamino-5H-benzo[alpha]phenoxazine-5-one, commonly known as Nile red can be used to stain the lipid accumulations in larvae. The dye is a near-ideal lysochrome and exhibits strong fluorescence properties in hydrophobic conditions. Its wide excitation/emission range of 450–500 nm/>580 nm (yellow) and 510–560/>590 nm (red) offers better selectivity in fluorescent microscopy experiments. Other than imaging techniques, the dye is also widely utilized in FACS studies. For better visualization and deep staining of internal organs of zebrafish larvae, Nile red staining has been performed in several studies which we standardized a little to suit our experimental requirements (Minchin and Rawls, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]) (Carten and Farber, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) (Chen et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) (Guru et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nFor Nile red staining of zebrafish larvae, develop lipid accumulation model as described in section: zebrafish larval model of lipid accumulation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] and perform zebrafish euthanization and fixation as detailed in steps-a to -g of section: 9. Oil Red O staining of zebrafish larvae.",
    "Post 1× PBS washing, incubate the larvae in Nile red solution precisely for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with gentle shaking in the dark.\nThe solution must be thawed to room temperature (20°C–25°C) prior to addition.\nCritical: Incubation of larvae for more than 30 min is not advised as non-specific staining may occur (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 3).\nRe-wash the stained larvae with 1× PBS, 3 times for 3–5 min as indicated in steps -c to -e of section: 9. Oil Red O staining of zebrafish larvae and proceed with microscopic observations in EVOS fluorescence microscope (EVOS FL).\nAcquire the images under RFP filter with an absorbance peak and emission peak of 531/40EX and 593/40EM, respectively and process the images in ImageJ software.\nThe intensity of image to be adjusted based on the microscope used. In EVOS FL, we generally fix the intensity of the image at 1%, as at higher intensities, the Nile red staining appears saturated in the images which in-turn can interfere with specific quantification (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2132-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Enriched deposition of neutral lipids such as cholesteryl esters and free fatty acids in the blood vessels, prominently due to intake of high cholesterol diet, is an essential hallmark of hyperlipidemia in humans as well as in other mammalian in vivo models such as mice, rabbit, zebrafish etc (Chan et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Getz and Reardon, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Madariaga et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). Consistently, we aimed towards estimating the accumulation of total cholesterol and free fatty acids (FFA) in our zebrafish model of lipid accumulation. Additionally, we attempted to evaluate minute perturbations in lipid build-up via HPLC method by co-relating area and concentration of standard cholesterol solution. Other studies have used similar HPLC based methods to detect lipid accumulation in zebrafish embryos and larvae (Fang et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Martano et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]; Quinlivan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).\nCholesterol measurement. Enriched cholesterol levels in zebrafish larval model of lipid accumulation may be measured using any commercially available kit. We used Erba kit for our experiments however we have not made any comparison of different commercially available kits.\nCollect equal numbers of 20 dpf control and HFD-fed larvae (minimum 50 nos.) in 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nNote: It is recommended to harvest considerable number of larvae for lipid estimation as lipid yield is very low even with 50 nos. larvae (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 4).\nWash the larvae with 500 μL of 1× PBS to remove contaminants via centrifugation at 900 × g for 5 min at 4°C, twice.\nHomogenize the larvae with microtube homogenizer by applying gentle rotations in ice in equal volumes of 1× PBS.\nIncubate in ice for 10 min.

It is very important to not alter the focus any time after the focus is set for an experiment.\nZebrafish larval mRNA isolation and qPCR analysis\nTiming: for mRNA isolation: 60–90 min; for qPCR set up and run: 3–4 h; qPCR analysis: 20–40 min\nGene quantification in zebrafish larvae using the following method would assist us to understand the metabolic changes that occur in distinct feeding groups.\nPost euthanization and washing of larvae in 1× PBS, homogenize the larvae (around 50 nos.) in 500 μL of TRIzol reagent using microtube homogenizer or via rigorous pipetting.\nNote: The solution gets sticky as the larvae gets dissolved in TRIzol.\nIn a chemical fume hood, add 100 μL of chloroform (0.2 volumes of TRIzol reagent).\nSecurely cap the sample tubes and shake vigorously by hand for 10 s.\nIncubate the samples at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 3 min followed by centrifugation at 11,600 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nUpon centrifugation, the solution separates into a colorless, upper aqueous phase, an interphase and a lower red phenol-chloroform phase.\nCollect the aqueous phase where the RNA remains exclusively and add 250 μL of isopropanol (0.5 volumes of TRIzol reagent used for initial homogenization).\nCritical: This is the most critical step in the whole process. Place the pipette tip (20–200 μL on the brim of aqueous phase and very gently apply suction through the pipette to ensure the you do not disturb the mid-protein layer or organic layer. Any cross contamination will severely affect the purity.\nMix by gentle inversion with hands for 10 s.\nNote: Do not vortex.",
    "Incubate the samples for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) or at −20°C for 1 h and then centrifuge at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTranslucent gel-like pellet (RNA) appears on the bottom of the tube.\nDecant the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet with 500 μL of 75% ethanol (ice-cold) once, via centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nGive a quick spin for 10 s and try removing the remaining ethanol as much as possible using a micropipette.\nKeep the sample lid open and air dry the remaining traces of ethanol.\nRemove ethanol and re-suspend RNA in 30 μL of RNase free water by gentle pipetting followed by incubation at 60°C for 10 min.\nGently flick the tube followed by a quick spin and store the RNA suspension in −20°C for not more than a month.\nNote: Do not vortex.\nDetermine the RNA concentration and quality by measuring absorption at 260 nm.\nWith 1–2 μg total RNA as template, prepare cDNA using random hexamers and oligo dTs in a 20 μL reaction volume using the Superscript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nPerform qPCR reactions using TB Green mix on QuantStudio5 (Applied Biosystems).\nUse gene-specific primers at a 200 nM concentration in a 20 μL reaction.\nNormalize raw Ct values of samples with Ct value of β-actin using the ΔΔCt method.\nNote: Dilute the cDNAs depending on their approximate levels in cells under normal physiological conditions. For example, to assess mRNA levels of genes such as PHLPP, CD36, Fasn, ChREBP, LDLR, etc., dilute the cDNAs to 1:5 and in case of housekeeping genes such as β-Actin, GAPDH, dilute the cDNAs to 1:50 to 1:100.",
