    "Target cell preparation under sterile tissue culture conditions This step is for preparing peptide-pulsed target cells and stain cells with CFSE to distinguish peptide-pulsed target cells from control target cells.    OVA257-264 peptide-loading for the target cells.   Splenocytes are RBC lysed followed by washing with PBS twice.    Resuspend cells in RPMI-1640 complete medium.   Count the mononuclear cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer.   Resuspend cells at 5 x 106/ml of RPMI-1640 complete medium.    Divide the cells equally into two separate 50 ml Falcon tubes- one for peptide-pulsed target cells, and the other for unpulsed target cells.    Add OVA257-264 peptide at 1 µl/ml from a 200 µM stock to peptide-pulsed target cells.   Add an equivalent amount of PBS to the unpulsed target cells.   Incubate the cells in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h.    Wash cells twice with RPMI-1640 complete medium.   Centrifuge the cells at 1,500 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C.   Resuspend the cell pellet in HBSS.     CFSE cell labeling under sterile tissue culture conditions.   Count all live cells by trypan blue exclusion using hemocytometer.   Resuspend the cells in HBSS at 5 x 107/ml.   Thaw an aliquot of 5 mM stock CFSE solution.   Make a fresh CFSElow stock solution by diluting 5 mM stock 1:10 in DMSO (a final concentration of 0.5 mM).   Incubate the unpulsed target splenocytes with the higher concentration of CFSE (CFSEhigh): Add 1 µl of the 5 mM stock CFSE for each milliliter of unpulsed target cells (final concentration of 5 µM).   Incubate the pulsed target splenocytes with the lower concentration of CFSE (CFSElow): Add 1 µl of the 0.5 mM stock CFSE for each milliliter of peptide-pulsed cells (final concentration of 0.5 µM).   Pipette cells up and down to mix well and incubate in water bath for 10 min at 37 °C.",
    "Gently agitate the cells periodically.   Add 10x the volume of pre-warmed RPMI-1640 complete medium to the CFSE-labeled cells to stop the reaction.    Pellet cells at 1,500 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C.   Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in cold RPMI-1640 complete medium.   Wash the cells two more times with cold RPMI-1640 complete medium.   Count the mononuclear cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemacytometer.   Wash the cells with cold PBS.   Resuspend each cell populations in PBS at 6.7 x 106/ml.   Combine an equal volume (~equal numbers) of peptide-pulsed CFSElow cells with unpulsed CFSEhi cells and proceed with flow cytometry analysis (Figure 1a).        Intravenous injection of target splenocytes To investigate OVA257-264-specific CD8+ T cell killing ability, peptide-pulsed and unpulsed target cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and transferred to the previously immunized mice.   Recipient mice were infected with 5,000 colony-forming units (CFU) of  Listeria monocytogenes expressing chicken ovalubmin (LM-OVA) 7 days intravenously before the CFSE-labeled cell injection.   Inject intravenously 300 µl of the combined cell populations into the tail vein of each recipient. Each recipient should receive approximately 1 x 107 peptide-pulsed target cells combined with 1 x 107 unpulsed target cells.    Wait for 4 h.      Preparation of splenocytes and lymphocytes in the liver for flow cytometry analysis This step is analyzing antigen-specific killing ability in the liver and the spleen by flow cytometric analysis of CFSElow and CFSEhi cell populations.   Prepare splenocytes for flow cytometry analysis.    Wash once with PBS, and 2-300 µl into a 5 ml round bottom tubes through the cell strainer.     Isolate lymphocytes from the liver.   Harvest livers from the recipients and place them on ice.   Make a fresh collagenase D solution by diluting 20 mg/ml stock 1:20 in PBS (a final concentration of 1 mg/ml).",
    "Chop liver with a blade on a slide glass and transfer them into a 50 ml falcon tube.       Add 7 ml of collagenase D (1 mg/ml) and vortex well.   Incubate in water bath for 30 min at 37 °C. Vortex every 15 min.   Put tubes on ice and add supernatant on 70 µm filter on a well of a 6 well plate. Grind chunks of the chopped liver with flat portion of 3 ml syringe. Wash the tube with 5 ml of PBS and repeat grinding.    Transfer them to a 50 ml Falcon tube and spin down at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.   Make fresh 44% and 66% percoll solution: Make 44% final concentration by diluting 100% percoll in PBS, and make 66% final concentration by diluting 100% percoll in RPMI-1640 medium.    Resuspend pellet in 7 ml of 44% percoll, and load them on 3 ml of 66% percoll in 15 ml tube.  Note: The gradient separation is sensitive to agitation. Try not to shake the tube.   Centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C without brake.   Transfer the interphase lymphocytes to a new 15 ml tube.   Pellet cells at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.   Wash once with PBS, and transfer 2-300 µl into a 5 ml round bottom tubes through the cell strainer.     Proceed to flow cytometry analysis with spleen and liver samples (Figure 1b).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140701/20140701045655_2334.jpg Figure 1.

    "The spleen and the liver of the recipients were harvested after 4 h to determine percentages of CFSElow and CFSEhi cells among CFSE+ cells."
