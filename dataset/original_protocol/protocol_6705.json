    "Transient transfection of HEK293 cells with HiBiT-tagged GPCR constructsNote: The transfection conditions described below are recommended for adequate translocation and cell surface expression of HiBiT-tagged GPCRs. These include: Dilution of DNA encoding the HiBiT-tagged GPCR into a promoterless Carrier DNA. This maintains the total amount of transfected DNA but allows for lower expression levels across the population of transfected cells. A 100-fold dilution is generally recommended, however in some cases this might require further optimization. DNA: Transfection reagent complexes should account for 10% (vol/vol) of transfected cell culture. Cultivate HEK293 cells in Culture Medium (Recipe 1) in a TC-75 or TC-150 flask prior to assay.Note: Cell density at time of harvest can affect transfectability. For optimal transfectability use freshly passaged HEK293 cells (ideally within 1-2 days) at 80-95% confluency. Aspirate medium from flask, add 5 ml or 8 ml trypsin to TC-75 or TC-150 flask, respectively and allow cells to dissociate from the flask.Neutralize trypsin using 20 ml or 25 ml Culture Medium (for TC-75 or TC-150, respectively), and pellet cells via centrifugation at 200 x g for 5 min.Aspirate medium and resuspend cells into a single cell suspension using Opti-MEM Assay Medium (Recipe 2).Adjust the cell density to 2.2 x 105 cells/ml in Opti-MEM Assay Medium in a sterile, conical tube.Prepare transfection reagent: DNA complexes.Below is an example for transfection of 10 ml culture:Prepare a 10 µg DNA solution in Opti-MEM without serum. This solution should contain the following ratios of carrier DNA and DNA encoding the HiBiT-tagged GPCR construct:9.9 µg/ml of Transfection Carrier DNA.0.1 µg/ml of DNA encoding the HiBiT-tagged GPCR (100-fold dilution).0.5 ml of Opti-MEM without serum.Mix thoroughly.Combine 30 µl transfection reagent (i.e., FuGENE HD or ViaFect) with 0.5 ml Opti-MEM without serum and mix by pipetting.Note: If using another transfection reagent, follow manufacturer recommendation.",
    "Combine the DNA and transfection reagent solutions and mix by pipetting 10-15 times.Incubate at room temperature for 15 min to allow transfection reagent, DNA complexes to form.Combine one part (e.g., 1 ml) of transfection reagent: DNA complexes with 9 parts (e.g., 9 ml) of HEK293 cells in suspension at 2.2 x 105 cells/ml. Mix gently by inversion 5 times and plate in a white TC-treated 96-well plate at 95 µl/well.Note: Larger or smaller bulk transfections should be scaled accordingly, using this ratio. Incubate for at least 20 h at 37 °C + 5% CO2.NanoBRET GPCR-ligand engagement protocolsSaturation binding of a fluorescent tracer to a HiBiT-tagged GPCR Treat cells with a serial dilution of a fluorescent Tracer.Prepare a 20x serially diluted Tracer.First prepare a 100x serially diluted Tracer in DMSO. Prepare 3-fold serial dilutions starting at 300 µM, which corresponds to a final 1x concentration of 3 µM. In some cases, a higher or lower Tracer concentration may provide a better assay window.Note: Make sure to include within the serial dilution a no Tracer control. Dilute the Tracer Dilution Buffer (TDB) 3-fold in Opti-MEM without phenol red to generate a 0.3x TDB.Dilute the 100x serially diluted Tracer 5-fold in 0.3x TDB to generate a 20x serially diluted Tracer.Add 5 µl of 20x serially diluted Tracer per well of transfected cells (Figure 2 portrays a 96-well plate set-up).Mix briefly on an orbital plate shaker.To determine specific binding treat control cells with excess unmodified compound.Prepare a 20x unmodified compound solution.Prepare a 10% (vol/vol) DMSO solution in Opti-MEM without phenol red.Prepare a 600 µM unmodified compound solution in 10% DMSO, which corresponds to a final 1x concentration of 30 µM.Add 5 µl of the 20x unmodified compound solution to the control wells (Figure 2 portrays a 96-well plate set-up).",
    "Mix briefly on an orbital plate shaker.Incubate plate at room temperature (to minimize receptor internalization) for 90 min protected from light, then proceed to NanoBRET detection section below.Note: Agonist binding promotes receptor internalization to different extents, which can be detected through dose dependent decrease in donor signal (e.g., signal at 450 nm). Still, binding experiments at room temperature (22-25 °C) decease the rate of internalization and the ratiometric nature of BRET further minimizes the influence of internalization on binding analyses. Accordingly, binding analyses at 37 °C may require a shorter incubation time. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3861/bioprotoc-10-24-3861-g002.jpgFigure 2.
