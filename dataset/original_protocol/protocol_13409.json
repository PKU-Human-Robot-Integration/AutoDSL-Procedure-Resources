  "procedures": [
    "When performing a preload challenge using the wireless, wearable Doppler ultrasound system, there are a number of critical steps that the user should consider. Written and informed consent was obtained for this protocol; the study was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Board of Health Sciences North. The procedures followed were in accordance with the local ethical standards of the committee on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.\n1. Identifying an appropriate patient\nIdentify a patient on whom the wearable Doppler ultrasound device will be placed. Ensure that the patient is calm and relatively motionless to minimize phonation and deglutition for the duration of the assessment (1-5 min).\nPosition the patient in the semi-recumbent or semi-Fowler position in the hospital bed or gurney. Specifically, adjust the bed such that the torso is at an angle of 30-45° above horizontal.\n2. Obtaining the carotid artery and internal jugular Doppler signals\nTurn on the wearable Doppler ultrasound by pressing the round button in the center of the ultrasound device. Blue lights around the periphery of the button will flash, signaling that the device is on and ready to pair with a smart device.\nTurn on the dedicated application on the smart device. Press the start button on the smart device application. Observe the list displayed on the application showing the discoverable, wearable, ultrasound devices within physical proximity of the smart device. Match the number affixed to the face of the desired ultrasound device to the indicated device on the application list. Press connect to pair the desired ultrasound device to the application.\nConfirm the desired ultrasound device is paired by observing white flashing lights around the button in the center of the device. Press correct on the smart device application to complete the pairing.",
    "Apply a small amount of ultrasound gel to the large face of the transducer wedge on the back of the ultrasound device.\n\tNOTE: The gel application produces a characteristic Doppler signal artifact, which can be seen on the smart device application.\nTap the large face of the transducer wedge to ensure the device is live and paired to the smart device application. Ensure that the volume on the smart device application is turned on by pressing the volume icon button in the top-right corner of the application display.\nWith the patient's neck slightly extended, note the laryngeal prominence, and hold the ultrasound device so that the large face of the transducer wedge faces downward toward the patient's heart. Place the wedge of the device on the lateral aspect of the patient's laryngeal prominence. Look for an audio and visual response on the smart device application: the top portion of the application will display a waveform spectrum for the carotid artery and jugular vein. The bottom portion of the application quantifies the corrected flow time (ccFT) for each cardiac cycle, displayed as green bars.\nSlide the transducer face on the patient's neck laterally from a perpendicular plane defined by the trachea until the carotid Doppler spectrum is detected both visually and audibly on the smart device application.\n\t​NOTE: In most patients, the audio and visual Doppler spectra of the carotid artery and jugular vein are detected within a few centimeters of the lateral laryngeal border.\n3. Optimizing the carotid artery and internal jugular Doppler signals",
    "While holding the device in place, observe the carotid Doppler spectrum and its features on the top of the application display. A good carotid artery Doppler signal is identified by its characteristic sharp velocity upstroke with a good signal-to-noise ratio and a clear dicrotic notch, which demarcates the end of mechanical systole. The application will automatically begin tracing the Doppler spectrum once a strong enough signal is obtained, indicated by a white line around the maximum of the waveform.\nWhile holding the device in place, observe the velocity measurements using the scale on the top left-hand side of the smart device display. Using the auto-trace over the carotid artery maximum, ensure that the trace is in a typical range. The peak systolic velocity of the carotid artery is typically between 50 cm/s and 120 cm/s, and the end diastolic velocity is typically less than 20 cm/s.\nSlowly slide the ultrasound device laterally slightly by a few millimeters while looking at the dicrotic notch on the artery spectrum to ensure that a clear velocity nadir is observed reliably. If the dicrotic notch velocity becomes difficult to see, repeat this step, but slide the ultrasound device medially.\nRepeat steps 3.1-3.3 over the contralateral carotid artery to assess for the presence of a clearer dicrotic notch velocity.\nAfter observing for the presence of a clear dicrotic notch velocity on both carotid arteries, select the side of the neck to which the device will be adhered. Choose the side with the most obvious dicrotic notch velocity. If both sides of the neck have equally acceptable dicrotic notch velocities, choose the side of the neck with the most robust internal jugular Doppler spectrum.\n4. Adhering the ultrasound device to the neck",
    "Prepare to adhere the device to the chosen carotid artery by visually noting where on the neck the best signal was obtained. If needed, use a skin-marking pen to identify the optimal placement position. Lift the device from the neck, and remove the protective backing from the adhesive attached to the ultrasound device.\nObserve the transducer face on the ultrasound device, and determine if there is a sufficient amount of ultrasound gel remaining. If needed, reapply a small amount of ultrasound gel to the transducer face. Remove excess ultrasound gel from the neck that may have remained during signal discovery as this may interfere with the adhesion of the device.\nReturn the device to the neck to the location identified in step 4.1, with the large face of the transducer wedge pointing downward toward the heart. Smooth the wings of the adhesive across the neck. Remove the protective backing from the tips of the adhesive after pulling tight; place the filming against the skin to fully secure the device to the neck. Monitor the carotid and jugular spectra throughout adhesion to ensure that the signal is not lost.\n5. Performing a preload challenge  via a passive leg raise (PLR)\nEnsure that the patient is in the semi-recumbent position on the hospital bed or gurney, as identified in step 1.2.\nClear the smart device application data by pressing restart on the smart device application. Press begin assessment on the smart device application to obtain the baseline measures for the passive leg raise (PLR). Begin with 30-60 s of resting baseline with the patient in the semi-recumbent position on the hospital bed or gurney. Look for a marker displayed on the bottom portion of the application display to signify the beginning of the assessment.",
    "Prepare the necessary measures to perform a PLR (e.g., obtain extra nursing help as needed).\nOnce ready to perform a PLR, press mark intervention on the smart device application to signify the beginning of the preload challenge (in this case, a PLR). Look for a marker displayed on the bottom portion of the application display to signify the beginning of the intervention. Perform a PLR; without touching the patient, reposition the hospital bed or gurney so that the torso is moved downward to the horizontal and the legs are lifted to 30-45° above the horizontal.\n\tNOTE: The user must take great care to keep the patient fully passive during this maneuver.\nKeep the patient in the PLR position for 90-120 s.\n\tNOTE: Throughout the maneuver, it is imperative that the patient keep their neck completely still so as not to change the insonation angle between the transducer face and the vessels in the neck. If needed, manually stabilize the patient's neck.\nObserve the jugular Doppler spectrum on the smart device application during the intervention; assess for changes in the absolute jugular venous velocity and its pattern as a surrogate for the jugular venous pressure.\nObserve the evolution of the green bars on the smart device application during the intervention; assess for changes in the ccFT before and after the start of the preload challenge. The smart device application automatically quantifies the ccFT for each cardiac cycle and represents this as a green bar.\nOnce the intervention is complete, press end assessment on the smart device application. Look for a marker that will be displayed on the bottom portion of the application display to signify the end of the assessment.\nReturn the patient back to the baseline, semi-recumbent position.",
    "If desired, press save on the smart device application to save the assessment and export the data files (see additional data notes for more details).\n6. Observing the changes in the carotid corrected flow time (ccFT) on the smart device application following the completed assessment\nObserve the assessed changes in the ccFT displayed in a yellow box on the lower-right side of the application.\n\tNOTE: The smart device application automatically quantifies the changes in ccFT between the recorded baseline measurements and the preload challenge/intervention measurements.\nPress save on the application, and wait for the data to be split into the following files: two .txt format files containing IQ and Tick data from the Doppler device hardware; one PKL format file containing the spectrogram information (use this to visualize the real-time collected data online); and two .json format files containing the session information (such as the date and time, smart device hardware settings, user settings, and more) and real-time calculations per cardiac cycle."
