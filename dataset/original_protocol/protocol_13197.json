    "The experimental procedures in this study were approved by the ethical committee of the West China School of Stomatology, Sichuan University (WCHSIRB-D-2021-12544). Adult C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Gempharmatech Experimental Animals Company, Chengdu, China. The whole crown of the maxillary first molar erupts 21 days after birth. Mice for surgery should be older than 21 days with normal vitality11. Here, 6 to 8-week-old mice were used for modeling. Figure 1 is a flow diagram showing the protocol used.\n1. Preoperative preparation (Figure 2)\nObtain the following instruments: Stereoscopic microscope, fixing plate, medical tape, mouth-gag, minimally invasive dental burr with a diameter of 0.6 mm, dental high-speed dental handpiece, 8# C+ file, heating pad, 1 mL syringe, sterile cotton ball, eye forceps.\nObtain the following drugs: anesthesia mix, veterinary ointment.\n2. Preparation of the mouth-gag\nWeigh and anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of anesthesia mix solution at 0.007 mL/g of body weight and confirm proper anesthetization through the toe pinch method. Apply veterinary ointment on the eyes to prevent eyes injury because of desiccation during operation.\n\tNOTE: Medical hats, masks, gloves and overalls and other basic protection are necessary. Make sure both surgery environment and mouse chamber are clean and safe.\nPrepare the mouth-gag as described below (Figure 3).\n\t\nObtain the following materials: Orthodontic arch wire with diameter of 8 µm, young loop bending plier, heavy wire cutter, marker pen, rubber cap with a length of 3 mm and a cross section diameter of 1 mm.\nFirst, straighten the arch wire with left hand for fixation and thumb, index finger of the right-hand bend slightly against the arc of the wire. Repeat this action several times, it will facilitate the bending to the correct three-dimensional Angle.",
    "Use the Yong loop bending plier to bend the top edge (Figure 3G, a-i) of the trapezoid (Figure 3C, a-l-k-b) about 8 mm long at the midpoint of the bow wire. Make sure that point a (Figure 3) is on the edge of the plier beak.\nHold the pliers with left hand, clamp the free end of the bow wire with right thumb and forefinger, and bend the bow wire from point a to make an angle of about 120°. Duplicate the previous action at point i (Figure 3G). Check whether the arch wire is on one plane by putting it on a horizontal table without prying.\nLeave about 9 mm of length on each side (Figure 3D, a-b, l-k) and bend the free-end to a 75° angle by using the same skill as step 2.2.4, while ensuring that each edge is on one plane. Bend this acute angle with the tip of the plier beak.\nFind point c about 5 mm from point b. Follow the same skill to bend a 105° angle on point c. Bend another 105° angle at point d 5mm from point c. Leave about 4.5 mm from point d and find point e. Bend the free end at point e to form an angle of about 100 -105° (Figure 3E).\n\t\tNOTE: The 6-8-week-old C57 mice we used were about 20 g. The spacing of 5 mm could not only jam the upper and lower jaws of the mice without moving, but also would not press the skin of the mice and cause discomfort. If other species or ages of mice are used, please adjust the length of c-d and i-h parts according to the actual situation (Figure 3E,G).\nBend an extra tongue depressor for mandibular part (Figure 3G, j-i-h-g).",
    "Duplicate bending steps of a-b-c part on l-k-j part. Clamp i-k and k-j parts at the same time and bend the free end at point j to make it vertical to i-k-j plane. Clamp point i which is 5 mm from point j, bend the free end to make it parallel to both i-k-j plane and c-d part (Figure 3H).\nLeave 5 mm length from point i, at point h, bend the arch vertical to i-h part and parallel to j-i-h plane. Find point g at 5mm from point h. Clamp j-i-h-g plane and bend the free end symmetrical to k-j part. Then free end after point f should be symmetrical to point e-free end (Figure 3H).\nPut rubber caps on the free end (Figure 3F).\n3. Immobilization\nFix the mouse supine on the fixation plate with limbs secured by skin tape. Compress the free ends of mouth-gag with thumb and index finger.\nFix the mouse front incisors in the trapezoidal groove of two arms. Ensure that the arm with tongue depressor is for mandibula. Adjust the mouth-gag to make sure mouse's tongue is immobilized but not ischemic.\n4. Tooth assessment\nEnsure the maxillary first molar for surgery should be free of dental caries, trauma and odontogenesis. Ensure there is no redness, swelling, or fistula on the surrounding gingiva. Ensure the opposite teeth are healthy and available to act as the healthy control group.\n5. Pulp exposure\nUse dental burr to drill at the occlusal side of maxillary first molar at a speed of 20,000 rpm. Ensure that the enamel is removed. Keep the operation with dental handpiece only in shallow layer of dentine to prevent excessive thermal stimulation on dental pulp tissue12.",
    "At the same time, prevent overheating by using a syringe to drop normal saline on the tooth every 3 min during the operation.\nPut an 8# or 10# C+ file on the lowest position of the drilled pit and pierce through the last dentine to expose the pulp chamber. It will be an obvious feeling of falling when local dentine is thoroughly removed. Do not prob too deep, or dental pulp tissue might be brought out of pulp chamber.\nClean the fragments around the tooth. Take off the mouth-gag; the surgery is finished. Use the opposite maxillary first molar as the control without operation.\n6. Post-operative care\nAfter surgery, place the mouse on the chemothermal heating pad in a prone position until recovery from anesthesia. Feed the mice and provide drinking water. The recovery process should be supervised. No other animals should be in the same chamber until the mouse is fully recovered.\n7. Sample collection and storage\nEuthanize the mouse with cervical dislocation under deep anesthetic condition 24 h after operation or any other time point as per experiment9. Cut the skeleton muscles attached to the maxilla and zygoma with ophthalmic scissors. Remove skeleton, frontal bone and soft tissue and take out the lamina gnathostegite with maxillary molars.\n\tNOTE: According to He et al., it's commended that pulpitis sample should be collected less than 72 h after surgery to avoid extensive necrosis in dental pulp tissue13.\nSagittally divide the gnathostegite in half and store the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 24h-fixation.\n8. Histological analysis\nWash the tissue with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and decalcify them in daily-changed decalcification solution of 5% EDTA and 4% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 2-4 weeks10.",
    "Embed the 1/2 gnathostegite in paraffin and make sure the sagittal face without teeth is at the bottom of tissue cassettes.\nCut the paraffin block to 5 µm thick slices with a paraffin microtome. Adjust the angle of the paraffin block according to the proximal, distal, upper as well as lower relationship observed under the microscope to ensure the complete crown pulp and perforation of the first molar can be cut.\nSubscription Required.
