    "1. Assembly of the Device\nSecure a 100 mL Buchner flask (Figure 1, #4) to a steel ring stand and create a vacuum trap by filling it with 50 g of calcium chloride to serve as a desiccant. Seal the flask with a rubber through-hole stopper, wrap the stopper junction with paraffin film, and run a pipette through the hole.\nUsing vinyl tubing, connect the pipette extending from the stopper to a t-intersection hose connector.\nUsing vinyl tubing, connect the two impinger (Figure 1, #2 & #3) to each other and connect the output of the second impinger to the t-intersection hose connector.\nUsing vinyl tubing, connect the input port of the first impinger to serve as an inhalation port (Figure 1, #1).\nUsing vinyl tubing, connect the side arm of the Buchner flask to the input port of an airflow regulator (Figure 1, #7) and the exit port of the airflow regulator to a vacuum pump.\nAssemble the circuit according to the schematic in Figure 2A.\nUpload the PBASIC program SVL.bs1 (Figure 2B, also available at https://github.com/ChastainAnderson/SVL) to the BS1 microcontroller (Figure 1, #6) by means of a serial adaptor and the manufacturer's software.\nPlace the 510 threaded base (Figure 1 #8) in a ring stand clamp.\nUsing vinyl tubing, connect the solenoid valve (Figure 1, #5) to the free end of the t-intersection hose connector.\n\tNOTE: The device should be complete and ready for operation, check all joints to make sure that they are air tight and apply hose clamps and vacuum grease as needed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56709/56709fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Electrical Schematic and PBASIC Code. Figure 2A displays the electrical schematic for assembling the electrical circuit necessary to activate both the normally open solenoid valve and the heating coil of button activated electronic cigarettes (through the 510 threaded electronic cigarette tank base). The electrical parameters of the heating coil (P: Power; R: Resistance; and I: Current) are projected and should be empirically verified with a multimeter post assembly. Figure 2B displays the PBASIC timing program needed to control the circuit in Figure 2A (also available at https://github.com/ChastainAnderson/SVL). The timing constants SVT & IPT (#5 & #6) are in units of ms and are set to provide an activation time of 2 seconds and a downtime of 28 s.

Sample Storage and Preparation\nStore all unopened conventional and electronic cigarette samples in the dark in airtight plastic bags at room temperature.\nOnce opened, store samples in airtight plastic bags at 4 ºC, with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture.\nPre-equilibrate all samples in a room temperature humidor at ~60% humidity for at least 30 minutes prior to use.\n3. General Operation of Cigarette Smoke/Electronic Cigarette Aerosol Extraction Device\nDetermine the mass of each e-cigarette cartomizer/tank pre-vaping using an analytical balance. The difference in pre/post-post vaping weight will be used to determine appropriate dosing.\n\tNOTE: 3R4F reference cigarettes are assumed to contain 0.7 mg of nicotine, and the nicotine content of commercial cigarette brands can be determined by conventional analytical methods13.\nFor sample application 1, fill the reservoir of the primary impinger with 4.3 mL of endothelial cell culture medium. For sample application 2, fill the reservoir with 5 mL of acetone.\nPrep the electronic cigarette or conventional cigarette for extraction:",
    "If using a conventional cigarette, apply a piece of clear tape around the filter and put an easily visible mark where the cigarette paper joins the filter.\nIf using a cigarette like e-cigarette, make sure the battery is well charged and the cartomizer tightly screwed to the battery.\nIf using an electronic cigarette tank, make sure that an appropriate volume of electronic cigarette liquid is loaded in the tank and screw the tank onto the 510 threaded base.\nInsert the tip of the conventional or electronic cigarette into the inhalation port (Figure 1, #1) and secure with a hose clamp.\nTurn on the vacuum pump.\nAdjust the flow meter to pull 1.65 L/minute to ensure a 55 mL puff over 2 seconds.\nTurn on the microcontroller. If using a conventional cigarette, light the cigarette on the first puff.\nRun until projected desired concentration (in parts per million or % weight/volume) is achieved.\nDetermine the mass of each e-cigarette cartomizer/tank after vaporization using an analytical balance. Compare this measurement to the measurement taken in step 3.1 to determine the total mass consumed. Calculate the concentration of the consumed mass/volume of solvent. Use the molar concentration of consumed nicotine to normalize between products.\nIf an insufficient mass was consumed, return the electronic cigarette to the device and consume further.\nIf a sufficient or excess mass was consumed, proceed.\n4. Filtration and Storage\nIf extract is to be used for cell culture, filter through a 0.22 µm PES syringe filter.\nUse the extracts immediately or store at -80 ºC. As part of the preparation for Anderson, et al.8, electronic cigarette aerosol was demonstrated to be stable for at least two weeks, and the stability of cigarette smoke for up to two years has been established by Crooks, et al.13.\n5. Cleaning the Device",
    "After each extraction, rinse the tubing and reservoirs of the device with 70% ethanol and deionized water to prevent carry over between samples.\nFollowing rinsing, briefly run the empty device to allow airflow to assist the drying of the lines.\n6. Sample Application 1: Neutral Red Uptake Cell Viability Assay\nPerform extract as above into 4.3 mL of endothelial cell growth medium.\nOne day prior, seed human umbilical vein endothelial cells into 96 well plates at a density of 1 x 104 cells/wellin 100 µL of endothelial cell growth medium.\nTreat the cells by replacing the old endothelial cell culture medium with either 100 µL of fresh endothelial cell culture medium to serve as a control or 75 µL of endothelial cell growth medium mixed with 25 µL of a 2 mM consumed nicotine concentration extract (1.4 mg consumed nicotine into 4.3 mL endothelial cell growth medium) for a final concentration of 500 µM to serve as treatment.\nAs many of the components of both cigarette smoke and electronic cigarette aerosol are volatile, use a foil seal to keep the wells airtight.\nIncubate the plate 18–24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPrepare neutral red staining solution:\nCreate a 100x neutral red stock solution by dissolving 33 mg of neutral red dye into 10 mL of buffered salt solution.\nShortly before use, dilute 100x stock solution 1:100 in cell culture medium to create 1x neutral red staining solution.\nIncubate neutral red staining solution at 37 °C for at least 30 min prior to use and use immediately.",
    "NOTE: It is normal for some crystals to precipitate during incubation. Care should be taken to avoid applying these crystals to the cell culture wells. If needed, a .22 µm filter can be used to filter the neutral red stock and staining solutions.\nRemove extract and add 100 µL of neutral red staining solution per well, use excess to create at least three blank wells for proper quantification.\nIncubate the plate at 2–4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove neutral red staining solution and wash 3x by submersion in PBS.\nApply neutral red de-stain solution (50% deionized water, 49% ethanol, 1% acetic acid).\nIncubate at least 10 min at room temperature with shaking.\nRead absorbance at 540 nm.\nAnalyze data by subtracting out the average value of the blank wells and normalizing to the average of the blank adjusted control well value.\n7. Sample Application 2: Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry\nPerform extraction as above into 5 mL of acetone.\nRun the device to achieve a final concentration of ~100 parts per million (weight of e-liquid consumed/volume of acetone) of your sample.\nUsing a precision glass syringe, inject 1 µL into the injector of a GC-MS device. Inject at 250 °C with a 1:20 split ratio into a coupled gas chromatograph/quadrupole spectrometer system equipped with a ZB-5 column with the following oven protocol: 1 min at 50 °C; ramp 10 °C/min to 140 °C; ramp 20 °C/min to 300 °C and hold for 10 min.\nMatch resulting mass spectra to target library to identify aerosol components.\nSubscription Required.
