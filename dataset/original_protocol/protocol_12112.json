    "All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the protocols of the University of California at San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of Live Imaging Media\nPreparation of liquid culture media\nAdd 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 200 µg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 15 mM HEPES to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12 media.\n\t\tNOTE: Live imaging media was freshly made right before the imaging. This media contains phenol-red which may lead to phototoxicity over long time courses of live imaging. Substituting for media without phenol-red may improve long-term imaging.\nPreparation of low melting agarose solution\nDissolve 350 mg of low-melting agarose in 10 mL of autoclaved distilled water to make a 3.5% stock solution.\nMix the agarose solution well and incubate at 70 °C in a water bath to dissolve the agarose completely.\nCool down the agarose solution in a 37 °C water bath before adding it to the live imaging media.\nAdd 1 mL of the agarose stock solution to 5 mL of the liquid live imaging media to make a final concentration (0.6%).\nKeep the media with agarose in a 37 °C water bath to prevent premature solidification.\n2. Preparation of Palate Explant Culture for Live Imaging\nDissection of recently-adhered E14.5 secondary palatal shelves\n\tNOTE: In our experience imaging fusion requires starting with a slightly adhered pair of palatal shelves; this adherence prevents explant movements that prevent fusion from occurring during imaging.\n\t\nDissect E14.5 stage embryos in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and choose green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing (from K14-cre; ROSA26-mTmGflox) or (Red fluorescent protein) RFP-expressing (from Lifeact-mRFPruby) positive embryos using a dissecting microscope equipped with fluorescent lamps. Transfer tissue to pre-warmed live imaging culture media without agarose.",
    "Cut the embryo head and remove upper brain area by using two fine No. 5 forceps (Figure 1A-C). Use one No. 5 forceps to hold the embryo while the other No. 5 forceps to cut away extra tissue outside the palatal shelves.\n\t\tNOTE: Fine scissors can be used to cut embryo head (the first step) instead of one No. 5 forceps. However, two No. 5 fine forceps will give better control to make precise cuts.\nRemove mandible carefully without damaging palatal shelves as shown in Figure 1D and 1E. To reduce the chance of damaging palates, keep the tongue through dissection of the mandible, followed by careful removal of the tongue.\nAfter removing the mandible and tongue, examine the oral side of the secondary palate with a stereomicroscope with fluorescence to confirm strong reporter signal in the MES (Figure 1M).\nDissect out posterior parts including hindbrain and brain stem after removing mandible and tongue (Figure 1F).\nRemove both maxillae with adhered palatal shelves (Figure 1G).\nCut the anterior upper jaw tissue keeping both primary and secondary palate intact (Figure 1H and I).\nRemove nasal septum on nasal side of explant exposing the MES.\n\t\tNOTE: These later steps of dissections need careful attention not to disrupt the contacts between two secondary palatal shelves. Removal of the nasal septum helps to reduce background signal from other areas and also reduce vertical tissue movement, allowing stable imaging (Figure 1J-L).\nAfter dissecting the palatal shelves, examine the midline reporter signal again to make sure that there is no damage to the epithelial layer between the tissues.\nSetting up palate explants in culture dish with live imaging media\nPut live imaging media into 35-mm glass bottom dish.",
    "Put dissected palatal shelves oral side facing down as close to the glass bottom as possible for imaging with an inverted confocal microscope (Figure 1N).\nPlace dry ice pellets on a conductive surface nearby to the culture dish to expedite agarose solidification by decreasing temperature fast or put the culture dish at 4 °C. A cold plate, such as one used for paraffin embedding could also be used at this stage.\n\t\tNOTE: When dry ice is used, agarose media change needs to be monitored carefully to prevent freezing media.\n3. Confocal Time-lapse Imaging of Palate Explant\nImaging and Data acquisition\nAfter agarose was semi-solidified, mount the culture dish in an inverted confocal microscope equipped with 37 °C incubation chamber. Use a white light confocal microscope and cell observer spinning disk confocal microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: We used a modified media containing 15 mM HEPES without CO2 gas.\nPut petroleum jelly between the culture dish and cover using a syringe to prevent evaporation of media (Figure 1N).\n\t\tNOTE: Some condensation on top of the culture dish cover after overnight (O/N) culture occurs but the volume of media does not change suggesting that the petroleum jelly prevents media from evaporating.\nLocate the region of interest with low magnification objectives (10x) and use higher magnification objectives (20x objective with 3x digital zoom or a 40x objective with Immersol W) for time-lapse live imaging.",
    "NOTE: Dissected secondary palatal shelves are not flat. The secondary palate is a curved structure and this makes it difficult to image the entire MES in the same plane. Low magnification (10x) imaging can allow whole palate imaging but 40x objectives will provide better image resolution to examine detailed cellular movements in deeper Z positions. The curvature is high in the middle palate region. Anterior and posterior palate are relatively flat compared to the middle palate. We often image toward the mid-anterior of the secondary palate to avoid regions of greatest curvature.\nScan multiple Z stacks with 5 µm each step for 16-24 h using proper laser excitation (488 nm for GFP and 532/561 nm for RFP) (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: To reduce potential phototoxicity, use minimum laser power and exposure time. This is important especially in case of multi-color imaging. Use 22% of 552 nm laser power for membraneTomato (mT), 30% of 495 nm laser power for membraneGFP (mG) and 25% of 561 nm laser power for membraneRFP. Average exposure time was 550 ms.\nUse image analysis software to perform cell tracking and quantitative analysis.\n4. Data Image Analysis\nNOTE: Here, Imaris was used. Similar data analyses may also be performed with ImageJ or Volocity software packages.\nRendering 3-dimensional (3D) surfaces from image sequences.\n\tNOTE: This section enables the generation of a surface from a movie generated with a membrane GFP signal.\n\t\nClick Edit | Show Display Adjustment and use the histogram slider to adjust the signal intensity so that the membrane signal is clear throughout the length of the movie (Figure 3A).",
    "Correct bleached signal by using Image Processing | Attenuation Correction. Adjust the Intensity Front and Intensity Back values so that the membrane signal is clear throughout the length of the movie. Some trial and error might be required in setting these values.\n\t\tNOTE: The Intensity Back (Deeper Z position) value will be less than the Intensity Front (Surface Z position) value due to limited laser penetration. These values can therefore also be changed to normalize signal intensity in the Z series. Both values may be adjusted to achieve bleaching correction. Attenuation correction is also called Emission attenuation correction19.\nIn order to generate a surface from the membrane signal, select Surpass | Surfaces, choose a source channel and Threshold type (Absolute Intensity) and under the Algorithm Settings select Segment only a Region of Interest and Process of entire image finally, followed by clicking on the forward arrow; continue to push the forward arrow (use default settings, or specify Surface Area Detail Levels and Thresholding method by trial and error), checking whether the generated surface reflects the fluorescence signal. To specify a Region of Interest, select region and time(s) to be rendered by cropping X, Y, Z positions.\n\t\tNOTE: Select Process of entire image finally so that adjustments and thresholds will be applied across the entire movie.\nGenerate a surface by clicking the forward arrow button again. Then adjust the threshold by changing the histogram in Filters to correspond to the membrane signal.\nAfter the surface is generated, choose surface in Surfaces/Settings to visualize the surface signal and finish the surface generation process by pushing the double forward arrow button (Figure 3B).\nGo to Surface | Edit and click Mask all in the Mask Properties to generate a masked channel image.",
    "After clicking ok, the Mask Channel window will automatically open; select the GFP channel, set voxels outside the surface to the maximum signal intensity value (found in Edit | Display adjustment) and voxels inside the surface to the minimum GFP intensity value (also found in Edit | Display adjustment), in Mask Settings to generate a mask of the membrane signal.\nAs the mask of the membrane signal will be shown in Volume view, generate inverted images by using Image Processing | Contrast Change | Invert (Figure 3C).\nDetecting spots from inverted surface images.\n\tNOTE: This section allows the center of each cell to be marked with a unique spot and tracked over space and time.\n\t\nSelect Surpass Scene | Spots | Create; in Algorithm Settings choose Segment only a Region of Interest, Process of entire image finally and Track Spots (over time).\nClick on the forward arrow and specify a Region of Interest; select the region and time(s) to track spots; continue to push the forward arrow, choose the masked channel as a source channel and determine estimated XY diameter of spots.\nAs clicking the forward arrow button will automatically open a filter window; adjust the spot detection threshold by changing values in the histogram to generate single spots at the center of each cell (Figure 3D).\nAs clicking the forward arrow button again will open the Algorithm window., choose Autoregressive motion tracking model20 and specify the maximum tracking distance and maximum gap size to connect tracks that become discontinuous for a short period of time.\nAs clicking the forward arrow button again will open the Filters window, set the track duration threshold by adjusting the histogram so that every cell is tracked. Clicking the double forward arrow button will finalize spot detection.",
    "In order to correct tissue drift, click Spots | Track Editor and select Correct Drift. An Algorithm window will open automatically; select the select Translational drift, Include entire result, and Correct objects positions.\nGenerating vantage plots for quantitative analysis.\n\tNOTE: The program's Scatterplot is a tool to generate multi-dimensional (X, Y, Z, Color and Scale) graphs with multiple objects. These plots are useful for viewing trends of many cell movements over time.\n\t\nMake 2D or 3D plots of cell tracking data using the Vantage-Add New Vantage plot menu (Figure 3E and 3F).\nSelect Volume or Spots and Choose Create/ Category and Plot Type\nAdjust Plot Values to generate different Vantage graphs.\nExport graphs using the Snapshot function.\n\t\tNOTE: Statistical data can also be exported as a spreadsheet for further quantitative analysis by clicking Plot Numbers Area | Save.\nSubscription Required.
