    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAn overview of the procedures is summarized in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. The collected frozen fecal samples are homogenized by metal corn beating (steps 1–8). The total lipids are extracted by single phase extraction (steps 9–17) for untargeted lipidomics using LC-QTOF/MS (steps 18–23) (see the left track of Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The obtained data are analyzed using the MS-DIAL 4 software program (steps 24–25). The FBMN technique clustering similar MS2 spectra is employed to facilitate the identification of bacterial lipid metabolites (steps 26–27). The oxylipins contained in the fecal sample homogenate are enriched by solid phase extraction (steps 28–41) and analyzed by targeted lipidomics using LC-TripleQ/MS (steps 42–48) (see the right track of Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/615-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. An overview of the procedures\nHomogenization of feces samples\nTiming: 1–2 h\nFeces contain various components, including bacteria, fiber, host cells, and mucus. To extract whole metabolites, it is important to homogenize feces into a complete powder form (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/615-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A workflow of fecal sample homogenization\nWeigh the frozen fecal sample (10–100 mg) and place in a 3-mL reinforced homogenization tube.\nPlace a metal corn in the tube.\nClose the tube and place it in liquid nitrogen (LN2) for 10 min.\nCritical: To get the sample cold enough, the tube should be placed in LN2 until the temperature of the homogenization tube is in thermal equilibrium with LN2, i.e., there are no more bubbles produced from gaseous nitrogen boil-off.",
    "Critical: LN2 is a cryogenic fluid (boiling point temperature of −196°C) that can act as an oxygen displacer in confined spaces causing asphyxiation, and can cause severe tissue burns even in instances of brief exposure. LN2 should only be handled by experienced and trained personnel, using appropriate personal protective equipment, and in well ventilated areas according to appropriate institutional use policies, Guidance from Environmental Health and Safety personnel prior to using LN2 is highly recommended.\nInstall precooled tube-holders into multi-beads shocker.\nInsert the sample tubes prepared in step 3 to the holders.\nHomogenize the fecal samples (2,500 rpm, 15 s ×2, pause time, 5s)\nAdd ice-cold methanol (50 μL/10 mg feces) and vortex the samples.\nRemove the metal cone using a magnet.\nPause Point: Feces homogenate can be stored at ‒80°C for one or two weeks.\nSingle phase extraction for untargeted lipidomics\nTiming: 2–3 h\nSingle-phase extraction is used for untargeted lipidomics to extract whole lipids (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/615-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A workflow of single phase extraction\nTransfer a 50-μL volume of fecal homogenate into a jacket tube.\nNote: Fecal homogenate contains fiberous debris. Use large orifice pipette tips to avoid clogging.\nCritical: Chloroform is considered acutely and chronically toxic, and is considered to be a corrosive substance, a reproductive toxin, a carcinogenic substance, and a skin, eye, and respiratory irratant. A laboratory coat, goggles, appropriate gloves, and a chemical fume hood should be used when working with chloroform.\nAdd a 150-μL volume of diluted EquiSPLASH (see. materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nAdd a 100-μL volume of chloroform using a glass tip-installed dispensing burette.\nVortex and incubate for 2 h at room temperature.\nAdd a 20-μL volume of Milli-Q water.\nVortex-mix the sample, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Centrifuge at 2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature using a swinging rotor centrifuge.\nTransfer approximately a 200-μL volume of the supernatant into a glass insert assembled in a glass vial, and then close the cap tightly.\nPrepare a pooled quality control (QC) sample by mixing all the samples (10–20 μL for each depending on the sample numbers).\nCritical: Glassware should be used for tips and tubes in the presence of chloroform.\nUntargeted analysis using LC-QTOF/MS\nTiming: 25 min/sample\nThe lipid containing fecal sample extracts were analyzed by LC-QTOF/MS. The data-dependent acquisition mode is employed for quantitation and identification of unknown lipids.\nPrepare solvents as described in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nInstall the HPLC solvent lines into the HPLC solvent reservoirs.\nPurge the solvent lines for 5 min.\nEquilibrate the LC-QTOF/MS system as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] if the LC shows an error message of excess pressure.\nCreate a batch table. Insert pooled QC samples once every ten times.\nAnalyze samples in both positive and negative ion modes.\nNote: Injection volumes can be changed from 1 to 3 μL, depending on the concentration of the samples. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] if the obtained data are not of good quality.\nCritical: To prevent retention time shifting, the same set of samples should be analyzed within 2–3 days while mobile phase solvents are fresh.\nData analysis using MS-DIAL\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "Untargeted lipidomic data are processed by MS-DIAL (Tsugawa et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The procedures are detailed in online tutorial of MS-DIAL environment (https://mtbinfo-team.github.io/mtbinfo.github.io/[href=https://mtbinfo-team.github.io/mtbinfo.github.io/]). The MS-DIAL forum is also available to ask questions, feedback, and comments to the developers (http://www.metabolomics-forum.com/index.php[href=http://www.metabolomics-forum.com/index.php]). The procedure is explained by the latest version of software programs (December 30th, 2020). The timing for data conversion and processing depends on the number and size of data files, as well as the PC performance. The original file size of a typical LC-MS data file (.wiff and .wiffscan) is approximately 160 MB. Fifty-two sets of LC-MS data obtained in Yasuda et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], including the alignment procedure, were processed in 40 min using a Windows 10 pro 64 bit-based machine with Intel (R) Xeon (R) Silver 4116 CPU @ 2.10 GHz (2 processors) and 192 GB random access memory.\nConvert data format for MS-DIAL by ABF converter (freely available).\nOpen AnalysisBaseFileConverter.exe.\nDrag and drop the wiff file format data into the ABF converter.\nClick the “Convert” button. The abf format data are generated in the same directory.\nAnalyze data in MS-DIAL.\nOpen MSDIAL.exe.\nClick “File” -> “New project” -> “Start up a project”. A new window is shown.\nSelect the directory containing abf files as “Project file path”. The following parameters should be selected: soft ionization, chromatography, conventional LC/MS or data-dependent MS/MS, profile data for MS1 and MS2, negative ion mode (for this paper), and lipidomics project. Then, click “Next”.\nClick “browse”. Choose abf filles. Set the file type of procedure blank as “Blank” Add class ID values appropriately for grouping the samples.\nNote: Data table can be copied using the Ctrl + C shortcut and pasted into Microsoft Excel. After the metadata is organized in Excel, it can be pasted into the data table using the Ctrl + V shortcut.",
    "Set parameters in the analysis setting window as shown in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]. Default values should be used for the other parameters.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_615_13.csv\nNote: Unless an identical LC condition is used, set the retention time tolerance to 100 min and untick “Use retention time for scoring and filtering options” in the identification tab.\nOpen the alignment result by double-clicking in the alignment navigator (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/615-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. A MS-DIAL analysis screen\nSee metabolic profile summary table (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) by clicking the “show ion table” button.\nCheck retention time shifts and intensity drifts of internal standards in samples and QC.\nNote: The peak features exceeding 20% coefficient of variation (CV) values in QC samples are excluded according to the previous report (Dunn et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCurate the MS-DIAL results on the graphical user interface to reduce false positive annotations.\nNote: MS-DIAL can automatically annotate the metabolite peaks by the similarity calculation of retention time, precursor m/z, isotopic ratios, and MS/MS spectra with the reference databases. In lipidomics, the rule-based annotation system is also executed to describe lipid structures based on the quality of the MS/MS spectrum. Unfortunately, there are also false positive assignments in the resulting peak annotations, as well as true positives. Therefore, we recommend that the original result is manually checked and some of the identified peaks are curated and modified. For example, identification of molecules such as fatty acids, for which diagnostic ions are not sufficiently obtained, requires to check whether the peak spots are regularly aligned depending on the carbon numbers and unsaturation degree (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), in adtdition to retention time comparison with the standard compounds. For details on the MS-DIAL graphical user interface, see the online tutorial (https://mtbinfo-team.github.io/mtbinfo.github.io/[href=https://mtbinfo-team.github.io/mtbinfo.github.io/]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/615-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. A curation example of fatty acid annotations",
    "The molecules of free fatty acids often provide no informative MS/MS spectrum for the structure characterization. Therefore, the confirmation of retention time is essential. Since the elution of free fatty acids in C18 column highly depends on the carbon- and desaturation properties, the mis-annotation can be identified by checking the elution behaviors. This figure shows one mis-annotation of FA 20:0 (marked as False 20:0) having the unexpected retention time value when considered to the other FA peaks' behaviors.\nMolecular spectrum networking\nTiming: 10 min\nMolecular spectrum networking is applied to the untargeted analysis to group unidentified lipids based on the similarity of their MS/MS spectra. The Cytoscape program is used for network visualization. Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or AdoptOpenJDK should be installed before installing Cytoscape. The node and edge files are generated in the MS-DIAL environment.\nPerform molecular spectrum networking\nClick “Export” -> “Molecular spectrum networking” in MS-DIAL environment.\nAfter the parameter setting window of molecular spectrum networking is shown, select an appropriate directory for the result export. Click “export” then the node and edge files are generated.\nAdd the appropriate metadata (compound names, ontologies, and abundance fold changes) to the node file. Example files of the node and edge are available in the Data S2 and S3. The metadata is created using the usual MS-DIAL alignment output file, which can be generated by clicking “Export” -> “Alignment result export”.\nVisualize the result in the Cytoscape program.\nClick “File” -> “Import” -> “Network from file...” -> choose the edge file generated by MS-DIAL in step 26-b.\nNote: Check the automatic determination of Cytoscape for the source and target nodes. In our experimental condition, the columns of “source (ID)” and “target (ID)” are set to the source node and target node, respectively.",
    "Click “File” -> “Import” -> “Table from file...” -> choose the node file generated by MS-DIAL in step 26-c.\nNote: The “Key” column should be set appropriately. In our condition, the “title” column is automatically set as the “Key” column by Cytoscape, but here, set “ID” column as the “Key” for mapping the node information into the network.\nCreate an appropriate style to visualize the molecular networking result on the Cytoscape (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). See the online tutorial (https://cytoscape.org/[href=https://cytoscape.org/]) of Cytoscape for further details.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/615-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. A Cytoscape screen of molecular spectrum networking\nSolid phase extraction for targeted lipidomics\nTiming: 2 h\nOxylipins are enriched by a solid-phase extraction step independent from the single phase extraction for untargeted analysis, since their signals are easily masked due to their low abundance in comparison to other groups of lipids.\nMix a 5-μL volume of fecal homogenate obtained in step 8 (equivalent to 1.0 mg feces) and a 150-μL volume of Milli-Q water in a microtube.\nAdd a 10-μL volume of internal standard mix (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nCentrifuge the tube at 17000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nSet a C18-AX spin column on a flow through tube.\nConditioning step:\nAdd a 300-μL volume of methanol to the extraction tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 3500 × g for 30 s at room temperature.\nEquilibration step:\nAdd a 300-μL volume of Milli-Q water to the extraction tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 3500 × g for 30 s at room temperature.\nSample loading step:\nApply the supernatant obtained in step 30.\nCentrifuge the tube at 3500 × g for 1 min at room temperature.\nPrimary wash step:\nApply a 300-μL volume of Milli-Q water to the extraction tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 3500 × g for 1 min at room temperature.",
    "Discard the flowthrough.\nSeconday wash step:\nApply a 300-μL of 50:50 (v/v) methanol and Milli-Q water solution to the extraction tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 3500 × g for 2 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the flowthrough.\nChange the flow through tube to a new collection tube.\nElution step:\nApply a 100-μL volume of 90:2:8 (v/v/v) methanol, acetic acid, and Milli-Q water solution to the extraction tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 3500 × g for 2 min at room temperature.\nCheck the tube to confirm that all of the elution solution has passed through the extraction cartridge. If not, centrifuge again.\nRemove the spin column.\nTransfer the supernatant into the glass insert assembled in a glass autosampler vial.\nAdd a 10-μL volume of the external standards mix (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nClose the cap.\nVortex briefly.\nTargeted analysis using LC-tripleQ/MS\nTiming: [50 min/samples]\nThe extracted oxylipins are analyzed by LC-tripleQ/MS. The separation of oxylipin isomers with slight structural differences (position of hydroxy groups and double bonds) requires relatively slower gradient elution using a longer column than that of untargeted analysis.\nPrepare the solvents as described in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nSet the solvents.\nPurge the solvent lines for 5 min.\nEquilibrate the LC-tripleQ/MS system following Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] if the LC shows an error message of excess pressure.\nAnalyze the samples. Sample injection volume is 1 μL at a maximum.\nNote: See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] if the obtained data are not of good quality.\nOpen the data in MultiQuant software.\nIntegrate the peaks.",
    "Note: To avoid miss annotation, peak picking should be performed by comparing the retention time of each peak with their corresponding authentic standards. We usually prepare a standard mixture containing approximately 300 compounds for each analysis. The experimental deviation of retention time is within 0.05–0.1 min.\nCheck retention time shifts and intensity drifts of internal and external standards.\nNote: The peak features exceeding 20% CV values in QC samples are excluded according to the previous report (Dunn et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])."
