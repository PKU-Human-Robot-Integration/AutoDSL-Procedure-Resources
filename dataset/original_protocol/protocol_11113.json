    "For human subjects research, informed consent was obtained and tissue collection was carried out under the UCSF Internal Review Board approved protocols (IRB, protocol no.: #13-12492, or CC#17-23309). The establishment of organoid cultures from de-identified clinical specimens was performed in collaboration with research partners according to previously published methods13,14,15,16. Organoid cultures were retrieved for maintenance and drug escalation experiments at passage three or later. All the following protocols were performed under aseptic conditions in a mammalian tissue culture laboratory environment.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63039/63039fig1v2.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Protocol schematic of workflow and critical steps in the technique. (A) Experimental workflow including seeding of organoids in 96-well format, treatment with drug escalation at 7 days after seeding, and luminescence-based cell survival readout 5 days after treatment using an ELISA plate reader. (B) An example image of the EGFRdel19-positive TH107 and EGFRL858R-positive TH330 NSCLC organoid cultures. Original cultures, cells at the time of seeding (day 0), and organoids at treatment start 7 days after seeding (day 7) are shown. Scale bar = 100 µm. Changes in organoid diameter over the initial 7-day culture period are quantified and indicate >2-fold increase in organoid size. Relative fold changes in sizes at day 7 compared to average size at day 0 are presented below the representative images. For TH107, a fold change of 2.38 over 7 days is observed, indicating a doubling time of 5.88 days (141.12 h). For TH330, a fold change of 2.41 over 7 days is observed, indicating a doubling time of 5.81 days (139.42 h). Quantification of changes in organoid size and statistical evaluation are presented (right). Statistical significance is calculated by unpaired t-test, p < 0.0001. (C) Treatment layout for drug escalation in organoid 96-well plate format. The number of technical replicates and exemplary doses are indicated, including a negative control. The schematics are created with BioRender, a web-based illustration tool.

Experimental preparations\nPrepare growth medium (GM) as previously reported15: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F-12) with L-alanyl-L-glutamine, supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, 25 nM hRspondin, 1x B27, 5 mM Nicotinamide, 1.25 mM N-Acetylcysteine, 500 nM A-8301, 500 nM SB202190, 50 µg/mL Primocin, 100 ng/mL hNoggin, 100 ng/mL hFGF-10, 25 ng/mL hFGF-7 (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: Mix gently to avoid foaming and filter through a 0.22 µm filtering system. Warm media to 37 °C within 1 h before use.\nPrepare low growth factor media (LGM) as previously reported16 without the addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF): Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F-12), supplemented with 1 mM HEPES, 1x L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 1x Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine, 10 mM Nicotinamide, 1 mM N-Acetylcysteine, 1x B27, 500 nM A-8301, 100 ng/mL hNoggin.\n\tNOTE: Mix gently to avoid foaming and filter through a 0.22 µm filter. Warm media to 37 °C within 1 h before use.\nThaw BME2 (Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Extract, Type 2, see Table of Materials) on ice, at 4 °C, overnight.\n2. Generating single-cell suspension and seeding of cells\nDissociate submerged BME2 organoid culture as described in the following steps (2.1.1-2.1.6).\n\t\nCarefully aspirate media from the culture plates. Avoid touching the submerged BME2 organoid culture.\n\t\tNOTE: Media Aspiration can be done as the researcher prefers, e.g., with a basic fluid aspiration system or using a pipette. Avoid touching the BME2 embedded organoids as this might result in loss of organoid biomass.\nTrypsinize the submerged BME2 organoid culture with a suitable recombinant enzyme (see Table of Materials). In 6-well plate format, add 2 mL per well. Mechanically break the BME2 by repeatedly pipetting up and down. Incubate plates at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator for 5 min.\nTransfer the suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 600 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the recombinant enzyme carefully without touching the organoid pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: Residual BME2 may be present. Repeat the enzyme digestion if needed.",
    "Resuspend the organoid pellet in GM (step 1.1). Add DNase I 1x 100 U/mL and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge at 600 x g for 3 min at room temperature. Pipette off the media carefully without touching the organoid pellet and discard. Resuspend in fresh GM.\nSeeding of organoid single-cell suspension\n\t\nPre-heat a new black, clear-bottom 96-well plate at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Using clear bottom plates is essential to monitor organoid growth and drug response.\nFor counting, prepare a 1:5 dilution of the cell suspension in PBS (total volume: 500 µL) and count the cell suspension using a cell analyzer (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure to multiply by the dilution factor (x 5) to receive the final cell concentration. Alternative counting methods such as a hemocytometer can be used. Cell viability should be monitored using a viability staining assay (e.g., with Trypan Blue17). Using a cell analyzer, viability is assessed automatically. The viability of organoid single-cell suspensions as evaluated by the cell analyzer should be ≥95% (Supplementary Figure 1).\nCalculate the volume of the cell suspension needed to seed for the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: The seeding concentration is 1500 cells/µL BME2, with 5 µL BME2 needed per well (Total number: 7500 cells/well). For one 96-well plate, 6 x 10E5 cells are required. This includes the seeding of 60 wells with organoid domes (4.5 x 10E5) and experimental surplus (calculation for a total of 80 wells).\nPrepare one aliquot of cell suspension in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube per each 96-well plate planned to be seeded if multiple 96-well plates are included in the experiment.",
    "NOTE: Experimental surplus and separate aliquots per seeded 96-well plate are needed to account for the increased experimental bias due to handling BME2.\nAliquot cells from the single-cell suspension as calculated (step 2.2.3) after careful resuspension by pipetting up and down. Pellet cells at 600 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Carefully remove media using a P200 pipette without touching the cell pellet. Place cell pellet on ice shortly (~1 min) and resuspend the cell pellet in BME2.\n\t\tNOTE: Residual media may compromise BME2 structure and rigidity. Pipette off all media carefully. Place cells on ice shortly to acclimate the cell pellet and allow cells to be resuspended in BME2 without clumping. Keep BME2 on ice constantly for it to stay in the liquid state. For one 96-well plate, 400 µL BME2 is needed for resuspension of the cell pellet. Resuspend cell pellets carefully, avoiding the introduction of bubbles.\nTilt your pre-warmed black, clear-bottom 96-well plate towards you. Plate cells using 5 µL of cell suspension per well and seeding cell domes at the 6 o'clock position of each well (Figure 1A).  Seed the cell domes in the remaining inner wells (columns 2-10 and rows B-G of a 96-well plate).\n\t\tNOTE: Reverse pipetting18 is recommended when handling BME2.\nDo not move the 96-well plate and incubate freshly seeded cell domes in the cell culture laminar flow hood for 5 min at room temperature. Then move the plate to the cell culture incubator and incubate it for 10 min at 37 °C.\nCarefully add 100 µL of GM per well to all the wells containing organoids (columns 2-10 and rows B-G of a 96-well plate). Add 100 µL of PBS to the outer wells at the rim of the plate.",
    "Culture BME2 embedded organoids in GM media at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator for a total of 7 days. Inspect growth of organoids under the light microscope regularly.\n\t\tNOTE: Please refer to Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 1 for an example of expected growth progress from seeding to the day of treatment.\nChange the media once after 3-4 days of culture: rotate the plate clockwise by 180° (organoids now at 12 o'clock position), carefully aspirate GM from opposite position to organoid dome using a multichannel apparatus if available, and then add fresh GM.\n3. Drug treatment\nPrepare a serial drug dilution in LGM for the drug of choice, e.g., osimertinib, to treat EGFR-mutant NSCLC organoids. Include a negative control (LGM media + 0.1% DMSO). Prepare sufficient drug aliquots of all doses according to the number of wells seeded plus experimental surplus.\n\tNOTE: A dilution series including ≥8 doses and ranging from 1 nM-10 µM is recommended for targeted inhibitors.\nRotate the organoid plate clockwise by 180° (organoids now at 12 o'clock position). Carefully aspirate GM using a multichannel apparatus preferably.\n\tNOTE: Avoid touching the organoid dome while aspirating the GM as this may result in loss of organoid biomass and impact results.\nAdd 100 µL of control (e.g., LGM media + 0.1% DMSO) or drug solution per well.\n\tNOTE: Please refer to Figure 1C for the drug escalation treatment schematic in 96-well plate format.\nIncubate treated organoids at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator for 5 days.\n4. Readout by luminescence-based survival assay\nHarvest and survival readout\n\t\nPerform the survival assay according to Reference19.\n\t\t\nThaw reagent (see Table of Materials) overnight at 4 °C. Equilibrate reagent in a water bath at room temperature for 30 min before use and mix by inverting.",
    "Add an equal volume of the reagent to each well (100 µL per well). Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down, with the pipette tip placed at the position of the organoid dome. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature in the dark.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, transfer approximately 75% (150 µL) of the lysate (step 4.1.1.2) to a new white, opaque-bottom 96-well plate.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Transferring 75% of lysates to a new plate ensures the absence of bubbles in the later readout without impacting assay sensitivity.\nIncubate for an additional 25 min at room temperature in the dark.\nRecord luminescence using an ELISA plate reader (integration time 0.25-1 s/per well) (see Table of Materials).\nSave data in an appropriate format, e.g., a data table containing all raw reads and recording of the plate layout and drugs used.\nData analysis using statistical analysis software (see Table of Materials)\n\t\nCreate a new XY-table and insert data in an XY format: Rows (X) are negative control followed by escalating drug doses, with doses as log [Inhibitor] in Molar concentration. Columns (Y) are readout values that include replicates stacked along with columns.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of the negative control should be indicated as a minimal value (given 0 is not possible in log scale), e.g., log [Inhibitor], M = -10.\nNormalize values by selecting Analyze > Normalize and using the following parameters: normalize each subcolumn separately, Y = 0 as 0 %, \"last value in each subcolumn (or first, whichever is larger)\" as 100 %, results in percentages, graph the results.\nFit non-linear regression curve on normalized data by selecting Analyze > XY analyses > Non-linear regression > Dose response - Inhibition > log (inhibitor) vs . normalized response -- Variable slope.",
    "Report results as a table of IC50 values outputted after non-linear regression analysis and graph of response curve including normalized data points as mean +/- standard deviation and fitted regression curve."
