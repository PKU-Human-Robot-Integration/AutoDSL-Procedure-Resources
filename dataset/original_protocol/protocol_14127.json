    "This animal experiment was approved and performed under the Institutional Review Board and the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care at Stanford University.\n1. Cell Culture of iPSCs\nGrow human iPSCs derived by lentiviral reprogramming on 6-well plates coated with basement membrane matrix (e.g., matrigel, referred to as matrix hereon).\nDaily change the media of the iPSCs with enriched culture medium (see Table of Materials) incubating at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOnce the cells reach 80–90% confluence (approximately every 4 days), add 1 mL of recombinant cell-dissociation enzyme (see Table of Materials) per well and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, dissociate the cells from the well by pipetting, transfer them to a 15 mL tube, and centrifuge at 300 x g.\nAfter the centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet into enriched culture medium (see Table of Materials) enriched with Y27632 inhibitor at a 1:1,000 dilution.\nPerform a cell count of the dissociated cells and replate the cells on matrix-coated 6-well plates at a density of 2 x 105 to 4 x 105.\n2. Transduction of iPSCs with a Double-fusion Reporter Gene\nPassage iPSCs in 6-well plates as per routine and add enriched culture medium (see Table of Materials) containing 6 µg/mL hexadimethrine bromide.\nNOTE: The ideal colony size is 200–400 cells/colony to yield the highest transduction efficiency.\nConcentrate self-inactivating lentivirus carrying firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein (FLuc-eGFP) driven by human ubiquitin promotor-C by sediment centrifugation with an SW-29 rotor at 50,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C.\nAdd the viral concentrate to the iPSCs in a 6-well plate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and incubate overnight at 37 °C at 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: The multiplicity of infection was determined by the expression of monomeric fluorescence protein analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) scan.\nThe following day, remove the virus by centrifugation of the iPSC 6-well plates at 300 x g for 6 min at room temperature.\nChange the media daily with enriched culture medium (see Table of Materials) and passage as per protocol. Utilize a fluorescence microscope to determine the approximate transduction efficiency for eGFP.\nAn efficiency of 30–40% is sufficient for FACS sorting. Proceed to the FACS of hiPSCs expressing eGFP if at least 30–40% of the cells express eGFP.\nTo confirm FLuc activity ex vivo, plate the cells expressing GFP sorted by FACS at a density of 5,000 cells per well.\nIncubate the transduced cells and non-transduced cells (which will serve as the negative control) with the bioluminescence reporter probe D-luciferin (100 μmol/L) for 6 h. Measure the bioluminescence with a microplate spectrofluorometer.\n3. Transplantation of PSCs in the Dorsal Flank for Teratoma Formation in Immunodeficient Mice\nAdd 1 mL of recombinant cell-dissociation enzyme mix per 6-well plate containing human iPSCs transduced with a double-fusion reporter gene (FLuc-GFP) in culture (see section 2) and incubate for 5 min.\nAfter the incubation period, disperse the cells by pipette aspiration and expression. Add an equal volume of culture medium and then centrifuge at 250 x g for 4 min.\nAfter centrifugation is complete, aspirate the supernatant solution, resuspend the cell pellet in 30 µL of matrix, and place it on ice to preserve its viability prior to injection. Confirm a harvest of 1 x 106 cells using a hemocytometer.\nIf utilizing double-fusion reporter-gene-transfected cells, suspend the double-positive FACS cells (from section 2) in 30 µL of matrix.",
    "Induce anesthesia in 8-10 week athymic nude mice using 2% isoflurance with 1L/min oxygen and then use maintenance 2% isoflurane with 1L/min of oxygen.\nUsing a 28.5 G syringe, inject cell/matrix mixture (see Table of Materials) suspension into the subcutaneous space at the flank, aiming for an injection of in total 5 x 103 to 5 x 106 cells (approximately 100 ul per injection).\nConsider a more caudal injection site if planning to maintain mice for prolonged period and anticipating large tumor growth. \nAnesthetized animals are allowed to recover on a heated pad until ambulatory (typically <1h) with monitoring of respiratory rate, skin color of toes until ambulatory. \n4. Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI) of Transplanted Cells to Assess Cell Survival and Teratoma Growth\nAt the desired timepoints after inoculation, perform an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 375 mg/kg of the reporter probe D-Luciferin into the mice.\n10 min after an IP injection, image the bioluminescence signal in the anesthetized animals (performed as described in step 3.5) for 30 min using 1 min acquisition windows at 5-min intervals.\nNOTE: Weekly image acquisitions are recommended. Anesthesia is maintained during imaging by delivering inhaled isoflurane via a nose cone.\nFor data analysis, draw a region of interest (ROI) over the BLI signal and, then, normalize for the acquisition time to quantify emissions in units of maximum photons per second per square centimeter per steradian (photons/s/cm2/sr).\n5. Teratoma Irradiation Using a Preclinical Image-guided Irradiator (Figure 1)\nAnesthetize a mouse in a knockdown box using 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 1 L/min. After the mouse is fully anesthetized, transfer it to the bed of an image-guided pre-clinical irradiator (see Table of Materials). Maintain anesthesia by 2% isoflurane continuously via a nose cone.",
    "Acquire micro-CT images as a set of 400 projection images over 360° using a 40 kVp, 2 mA X-ray beam, and reconstruct those into volumetric images with an isotropic pixel size of 0.2 mm.\nPlan a radiation treatment using the micro-CT images using the RT_Image software package (http://rtimage.sourceforge.net/) and perform the treatment.\nNOTE: The treatment plan used consists of two 225 kVp X-ray beams, oriented to pass through the superficial target teratoma while skirting the surface of the rest of the mouse and sparing the underlying viscera. The exposure times for the beams are adjusted based on quarterly system calibration data so that the dose at the center of the target tumor was 6 Gy.\nRepeat the treatment process on three consecutive days to deliver a total of 18 Gy to the target tumor.\nMaintain standard post-treatment care of the animals.\nSubscription Required.
