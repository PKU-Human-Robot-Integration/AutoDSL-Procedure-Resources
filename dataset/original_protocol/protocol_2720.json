Workflow diagram presenting the different steps of lentivirus production\nCell culture (HEK293T) preparation prior to transfection\nTiming: ∼7 days\nCells may take up to 7 days to expand after resuscitation and subculture. For successful lentiviral transduction, we recommend using low passages HEK293T cells after thawing (do not use cells that have been passaged more than 10 times).\nNote: It is very important to keep the stock of HEK293T cells upon thawing on geneticin selection (200 μg/mL). Geneticin resistance is encoded by the SV40 large T antigen plasmid that contributes to high titers for the BaEV-LVs.\nRapidly thaw cryopreserved HEK293T cells by gently swirling the vial in a 37°C water bath until there is just a small bit of ice left in the vial.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube containing 9 mL pre-warmed HEK cell culture medium and centrifuge (200 g, 5 min, RT).\nAspirate supernatant and gently resuspend cell pellets into pre-warmed HEK cell culture medium.\nCount HEK293T cells using Malassez counting chamber.\nSeed 1.2 × 106 cells in a 100 mm culture dish supplemented with 10 mL HEK cell culture medium containing geneticin (200μg/mL).\nIncubate cell culture in a humidified incubator at 37°C containing 5% CO2 in air.\nSplit 70–80% confluent cultures 1:4 to 1:10 for expansion.\nNote: Healthy HEK293T cells show viability over 90% at all times, a doubling time of 24 h.\nLentiviral vector preparation\nTiming: 7 days",
    "In this protocol, we produce lentiviral supernatant by transiently transfecting HEK293T cells. This, using a second-generation lentiviral vector system (LentiV2), a cationic lipid Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent, followed by viral particles filtration and concentration using Lenti-X Concentrator. Functional lentiviral vector titers are determined on HEK293T cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. This protocol has been successfully tested with different lentiviral plasmid constructs.\nUsing this protocol, the total yield of 100-fold concentrated Lentiviral vector achieved is usually 3–4×107 IFU/mL (IFU, Infectious Unit) from ten 100 mm dishes recovered 48 h post-transfection.\nLentiviral vector production\nTiming: 4 days\nDay 1, 18–24 h prior to transfection\nCoat 100 mm culture dish with 2 mL of aseptic Poly-L-Lysine solution (0.01%) by gently swirling to ensure uniform coating of the plate surface.\nNote: This is optional if you use culture treated plates and not necessary if you keep the geneticin on the HEK293T cells, they will stay better adherent in that case.\nLeave 30 min at 37°C.\nRemove the excess solution.\nNote: Poly-L Lysine can be stored at 4°C and reused up to 5 times.\nThoroughly rinse the surface with sterile water at RT and aspirate (do not allow to dry at this step).\nNote: HEK293T cells detach easily from culture surface plate. To prevent producer cell detachment during wash and medium replacement steps, Poly-L-Lysine is useful to promote cell adhesion by enhancing electrostatic interaction between negatively charged ions of the cell membrane and the culture surface. After absorption to the culture surface, Poly-L-Lysine increases the number of positively charged cell binding sites.\nImmediately plate 3–4×106 cells HEK293T on the Poly-L-Lysine coated 100 mm plate in 7 mL of pre-warmed HEK cell culture medium. Gently swirl the plate so that cells are uniformly seeded and incubate them at 37°C.",
    "Note: It is necessary to find the appropriate seeding cell number to reach 70–80% confluency at the time of transfection. The optimal seeding is dependent on cell doubling time, culture medium.\nCritical: For transfection and titer determination, HEK293T cells should be seeded without geneticin.\nDay 2, transfection\nAfter 18–24 h incubation at 37°C, plates can be checked and should be ∼70–80% confluency at the time of transfection (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2377-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Estimation of cell confluence using cell confluency web tool (https://ct.catapult.org.uk/ressources/cellconfluencytool[href=https://ct.catapult.org.uk/ressources/cellconfluencytool])\nCritical: Cells at 90% confluency or more should not be used at this step. Indeed, this will dramatically reduce transfection efficiency.\nPrepare the below-mentioned transfection mixtures in 15 mL conical polypropylene tubes.\nNote: This mixture is suitable for one 100 mm plate. Scale up is required according to the number of plates that will be transfected.\nAdd and carefully mix the plasmids DNA in 3 mL of pre-warmed Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium.\nNote: Here, we recommend to use a maximal quantity of 15 μg of DNA. We used a ratio 35.5/29/35.5 to mix DNA plasmids as described in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2377_10.csv\naCMVBaevTR, a gift from E. Verhoeyen\nbhere, sgXIST-BFP or sgCTRL-BFP or pHR-SFFV-KRAB-dCas9-P2A-mCherry\nAdd 15 μL of Lipofectamine PLUS Reagent directly to the DNA. Mix gently and incubate at RT for 15 min.\nAdd 37.5 μL of Lipofectamine LTX, mix by gentle swirling or inverting and incubate the mixture at RT for 25 min.\nNote: Here, Lipofectamine LTX / total DNA ratio used is (2.5:1).\nNote: The plasmids of interest express fluorescent reporter protein (mCherry or BFP). This facilitate the evaluation of transduction efficiencies and viral titers calculation by flow cytometry.\nTransfect cells by adding 3 mL of DNA-lipid mixtures dropwise to 100 mm plate. Gently swirl the plate and incubate at 37°C.",
    "After 4–6 h incubation, aspirate the media from culture dish and replace it carefully with 10 mL of pre-warmed Opti-MEM-1% HEPES. Incubate at 37°C for 48 h.\nDay 3, 24 h post-transfection\nThe qualitative transfection efficiency can be validated at this step by checking expression of the fluorescent reporter protein (mCherry or BFP) using a fluorescence microscope.\nNote: At this step, close to 100% of the HEK293T cells should express the fluorescent reporters indicating efficient transfection.\nCritical: This simple observation of the producer cells provides information about the efficacy of transfection of thus the vector production. If no fluorescence is visible at this step the transfection has failed.\nNote: On Day 3 you can also execute step 22–25.\nLentiviral vector concentration\nTiming: ∼4 h\nDay 4, 48 h post-transfection\nHarvest viral supernatants from vector-producing cells and centrifuge (500 g, 10 min, RT) to remove cells and debris followed by filtering through a 0.45 μm syringe filter.\nNote: If filtering, use only cellulose acetate or polyethersulfone (PES) (low protein binding) filters. Do not use nitrocellulose filters. Nitrocellulose binds surface proteins on the lentiviral vector surface and will retain the vectors on the filter.\nConcentrate clarified lentiviral vector supernatant by adding 1 volume of Lenti-X Concentrator to 3 volumes of clarified viral supernatant (i.e., for 100 mL of clarified viral supernatant add 33 mL of Lenti-X Concentrator).\nmix by gentle inversion and incubate mixture at 4°C for 30 min to 16h.\nAfter incubation, centrifuge sample (1,500 g, 45 min, 4°C).\nAfter centrifugation an off-white pellet can be visible at the bottom of centrifugation tube.\nNote: We tested incubation times ranging from 30 min to one night at 4°C without any loss of yield.\nGently aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Carefully resuspend the off-white pellet in 1% of the original volume using Opti-MEM-1% HEPES or medium adapted for the transduction of the target cells. For ten 100 mm dishes, 1% of the original volume (100 mL) represents 1 mL.\nNote: The pellet can be somewhat sticky at first, but will go into suspension quickly.\nCritical: Let the sample sit for a few min with the resuspended solution. Then gently swirl or pipette up and down. Avoid fast and harsh pipetting. We recommend not to vortex.\nAlternatives: Ultracentrifugation (25,000 rpm, 1h30, 4°C or 3,000 g, 16h) is also a common method to concentrate the viral supernatant.\nImmediately titrate sample or store aliquots of the vector stock at −80°C until use.\nCritical: For long-term conservation of the BaEV-LVs resuspend the vector pellet into Opti-MEM-1% HEPES to stabilize the pH during freezing.\nLentiviral vector titration by flow cytometry\nTiming: 4 days\nThe lentiviral vector titer is calculated by evaluating fluorescent protein expression in transduced HEK293T cells using flow-cytometry.\nDay 3, 18–24 h prior to transduction\nCount untransfected HEK293T cells using Malassez counting chamber.\nSeed 0.2 × 106 HEK293T cells/well in a 6-well plate (wells numbered 1–6) and supplement with pre-warmed HEK cell culture medium to reach 2 mL final volume.\nGently swirl the plate so that cells are uniformly seeded.\nIncubate 16 h at 37°C.\nNote: Cells should reach 20–30% confluency at the time of transduction. Prepare six wells for transduction with serial dilutions of each vector sample. In another plate, seed in one well non-transduced control cells and another one to count the cells at the time of transduction.\nDay 4, transduction\nAspirate the plating medium and without disturbing the cells, replace it with 2 mL of pre-warmed HEK cell culture medium.",
    "Prior to transduction, prepare a stock solution of LV to be used in step 29; in a 1.5 mL tube, add 10 μL of concentrated lentiviral vector to 990 μL of HEK cell culture medium.\nNote: Frozen viral supernatant should be thawed on ice. Aliquots can be freeze-thawed up to two times without altering the viral titer. Vector particles should be stored at –80°C and we advise to use them in the follow-up 3 months. If frozen in Opti-MEM-1% HEPES they are stable for over 1 year.\nThen, in 1.5 mL tubes, perform the following vector dilutions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2377_11.csv\nAdd the mixtures (tubes 1–6) dropwise to each of the seeding wells step #23 (wells 1–6).\nComplete with protamine sulfate to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL.\nGently swirl the plate to ensure homogenous distribution.\nCentrifuge the plate (1,000 g, 90 min, RT, no braking phase) to increase contact between the cells and the vector (spinoculation step).\nNote: Meanwhile, count the number of non-transduced seeded cells at step #23 in the control plate. This cell count is crucial to calculate the lentiviral vector titer (transducing units/mL).\nPlace the plate in the incubator at 37°C and check the percentage of positive cells after 3 d.\nDay 7, 72 h post-transduction\nThis part describes the sample preparation for FACS.\nNote: At 3 d post-transduction, cells qualitative transduction can be checked using a fluorescence microscope.\n3 d post-transduction, aspirate the medium and gently wash the cells with 1 mL of DPBS (1X) avoiding to detach them.\nDetach adherent cells by adding 0.5 mL of Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) solution per well. Incubate for 3 min at 37°C.\nAdd 2 mL of HEK cell culture medium to each well to neutralize Trypsin.",
    "Collect cells from each well in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge (500 g, 5 min, RT).\nRemove the medium and wash the cells with 10 mL DPBS (1X). Centrifuge (500g, 5 min, RT).\nDiscard the supernatant and stain the cells for 10–15 min at RT with the viability dye diluted 1:1,000 in DPBS (1X) to distinguish living/dead cells.\nNote: At this step it is important to use live dead cell dye to avoid misinterpretation of cell transduction.\nWash the cells with DPBS (1X), centrifuge (500 g, 5 min, RT), remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 500 μL of DPBS (1X)-2% Formaldehyde.\nTransfer the cell suspension into FACS tubes. Samples are ready for flow cytometry.\nCritical: Formaldehyde is used to fix the cells and inactivate the vector particles. Samples can be taken outside the contained laboratory for flow cytometry analysis after this step.\nNote: This part describes how to calculate the lentiviral vector titer from the flow cytometry acquisition. (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nLentiviral titer (Infectious Unit/mL) is calculated with dilutions giving 1–20% fluorescent cells with the following formula:\n  T i t e r   (   T U   m L   )  =   c e l l  n u m b e r ×   %  o f  r e p o r t e r  c e l l s  100    1 / 100  L V  d i l u t i o n   (  m L  )    × d i l u t i o n  f a c t o r  \nFor example (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), if 3 × 105 cells are transduced with 50 μL of LV stock solution (step #29 and 5.76% of positive cells are detected, the titer will be:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2377-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The final titer should be an average of the titers obtained from transduction of at least 3 different wells of lentiviral vector supernatant.\nBreast sample dissociation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe breast sample dissociation is divided in two main steps: The mechanical and the enzymatic dissociation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2377-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Workflow diagram presenting the different steps of breast sample dissociation\nNote: Mammoplasty samples have to be collected by a surgeon in a sterile bag and maintained at 15°C–20°C. Dissociation has to start 3 h maximum after the surgery. Before using reduction mammoplasties samples, a pathologist has to perform sampling for medicolegal storage. This sampling has to be performed under sterile conditions. Moreover, a macroscopic analysis of mammoplasty sample by the pathologist is required to approximate the proportion of fatty tissue. This proportion is needed to adapt the dilution of dissociation medium. Before starting breast sample dissociation, make sure you have all the sterile surgical tools available for anatomic-pathological examination and tissue dissociation (Ruler, scissors, surgical tray, scalpels, and sterile aluminum foil).\nMechanical and enzymatic dissociation of breast sample\nNote: During the mechanical dissociation, the experimenter needs to wear sterile gloves on top of cut-proof gloves.\nProceed to a mechanical dissociation of breast sample:\nDivide the sample in several large tissue pieces (≈100 × 50 mm).\nTape dish (150 mm diameter) to the hood workbench (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2377-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

That being said, we never exceed 3 h of dissociation to prevent cell death.\nTransfer dissociated tissue in sterile 2 L trypsinizing flask (deflector Erlenmeyer) using a sterile funnel. Each flask should contain between 600 g and 800 g of dissociated tissue (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nAdd collagenase III dissociation medium and dilute it in a solution of DMEM/F12 (1:1) according to the proportion of fatty tissue.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2377_12.csv\nCover the neck of the flask with a sterile aluminum foil and seal it with parafilm (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nPlace the Flask in a 2D orbital Incu-shaker (37°C, 130 rpm) for 16 h.\nNote: At this step you can prepare the retronectin coated plate for 12h–16h incubation at 4°C (step #64). Alternatively, retronectin coating can be done in the incubator at 37°C for 2 h.\nCollection of breast organoids and dissociation into single cell suspension\nFollowing 16 h of collagenase III dissociation, allow the flask to stand on the bench for about 10 min until the suspended matter has settled in three phases (fat layer, stroma layer, organoid-enriched layer) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).

    "Note: At this step you can freeze the organoid pellets in 1.5 mL of freezing medium/pellet. We recommend using frozen organoids no later than 3 months after freezing. Cryopreserved organoids can be rapidly thawed by gently swirling the vial in a 37°C water bath until there is just a small bit of ice left in the vial. Then, transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube containing 9 mL pre-warmed DPBS (1X)-5% FBS and centrifuge (200 g, 5 min, RT).

Repeat step #55 to #57.\nNote: You can check single cell suspension quality using an inverted phase microscope by transferring 10 μL of the suspension mix with 10 μL of Trypan blue in a Malassez counting chamber. If you observe only single cells you can stop the dissociation process and restart from step #64. If you still observe partially digested organoids proceed to step #59 to #63 (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nCentrifuge 50 mL conical tubes (100 g, 3 min, RT).\nAspirate completely the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.",

Rinse the cell strainer with 5 mL of DPBS (1X)-5% FBS.\nProceed to cell counting using Malassez counting chamber.\nPreparation of transduced cells for FACS-sorting\nIn order to use fully active CRISPRi-engineered primary human mammary epithelial cells for future planned experiments, it is necessary to sort BFP+/RFP+ cells.\nCentrifuge 50 mL conical tubes (100 g, 5 min, RT) and aspirate completely the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in DPBS (1X)-5% FBS supplemented with the viability dye (dilution 1:1,000) at a final concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL to distinguish living/dead cells.\nTransfer cell suspension in 5 mL FACS tube (4 mL maximum volume per tube).\nIncubate 10 min at 4°C in the dark.\nCentrifuge 5 mL FACS tubes (100 g, 5 min, RT) and aspirate completely the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in DPBS (1X)-5% FBS to obtain a final concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL. Samples are ready for flow cytometry.\nCritical: At step #82 filcon cup type needs to be primed by gently tapping it on the top of 50 mL conical tube. Moreover, sometimes if there is a large amount of mammospheres the filcon sterile cup type can be clogged. Do not hesitate to use additional sterile cup type to finalize mammosphere harvesting."
