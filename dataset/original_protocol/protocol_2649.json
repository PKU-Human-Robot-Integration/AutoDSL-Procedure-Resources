In our experiments, these steps are performed in a dark\n      room, with red light as the only light source for illumination. The\n      optogenetic components are extremely sensitive to ambient light (more\n      specifically, the UVA and blue light component (400–500 nm) of the ambient\n      light). Even a brief exposure of the specimen to ambient light would cause\n      premature stimulation.\n    \n        Place an orange-red plastic shield (UV Filter Shield for FM1403\n        Fluorescence Microscope) on the stage of an upright Nikon SMZ-745\n        stereoscope in preparation for embryo collection.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2306-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3. An upright Nikon stereoscope with orange-red plastic\n              shield used for embryo collection\n            \nNote: When collecting the embryos, place\n      the apple juice plate on top of the orange-red shield, which blocks the\n      blue-green wavelengths from the transmitted light used for illuminating\n      the specimen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and protects the sample from\n      unwanted stimulation.\n    \nCritical: All embryo collecting and\n      preparation steps are performed in a dark room, where only red light is\n      used for illumination.\n    \nChange the apple juice plate at the time of embryo collection.\nNote: For collecting embryos at the stage\n      of early embryogenesis, change the apple juice plate 8–16 h (for cups kept\n      at 18°C) before embryo collection.\n    \n        Cover the surface of the plate taken off from the cup with a thin layer\n        of Halocarbon oil 27.\n      \nNote: In 30–60 s, the chorion of the\n      embryo will become transparent, and the embryo will be visible under the\n      stereomicroscope when illuminated with the transmitted light.",

A typical Drosophila embryo at the mid-to-late\n              cellularization stage\n            \n              The black arrow labels the cellularization front that we use to\n              determine the stage of the embryo in cellularization.

Scale bar = 100 μm.\n            \nNote: For our purpose, the embryos at late\n      cellularization are selected in order to monitor mesoderm invagination\n      (also known as ventral furrow formation). The bright field image of an\n      embryo at the stage of late cellularization is shown in\n      Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\n    \n        Remove excess oil from the embryos by gently blotting the embryos on a\n        small square piece of paper towel (∼ 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm in size).\n      \n        Dechorionate embryos using 40% bleach (∼3% sodium hypochlorite) for\n        about 2 min.\n      \nNote: In our laboratory, this step is\n      performed by transferring the embryos onto a small square piece of paper\n      towel (∼ 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) that has been pre-soaked with 40% bleach.\n    \nNote: 40% bleach should be made freshly\n      every 3–5 days.\n    \n        After ∼2 min, pick up the paper towel with a tweezer and place it on a\n        large piece of tissue paper to absorb excessive bleach.\n      \nNote: The embryo side of the square paper\n      towel should always be facing up.\n    \nNote: Throughout the dechorionation and\n      washing steps, make sure that the embryos remain stuck on the surface of\n      the square paper towel.\n    \nRinse the embryos using deionized water for 8 times.\nNote: For each wash step, gently soak the\n      square paper towel into a drop of deionized water and then quickly dry the",
    "paper towel on a tissue paper. Repeat this process for 8 times to remove\n      any residue bleach.\n    \n        Transfer the dechorionated embryo from the square paper towel to a 35-mm\n        glass-bottom dish using an eyelash tool.\n      \n        Add deionized water to the well in the middle of the dish to completely\n        cover the well.\n      \nNote: the embryos should remain stuck on\n      the surface of the glass-bottom of the dish after adding water to the\n      well.\n    \n        Use the eyelash tool to gently adjust the embryos to the desired\n        position and orientation for imaging.\n      \n        Transfer the 35-mm glass-bottom dish with the embryos to the confocal or\n        multiphoton microscope.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2306-Fig5.jpg\n              Figure 5. Light-proof box used for sample transfer\n            \n              We use the SP Bel-Art 100-place polypropylene freezer storage box\n              for this purpose.\n            \nCritical: During the transfer process,\n      avoid any unwanted stimulation from ambient light. In our experiments, we\n      keep the sample in a light-proof box during the transfer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n    \nSetting up the sample on the microscope stage\nTiming: 5 min (for step 13)\n    \n      The purpose for this step is to set up the embryo sample on the microscope\n      in preparation for optogenetic stimulation and imaging. During this\n      process, the key consideration is to avoid premature stimulation of the\n      embryos from ambient light or other light sources associated with the\n      microscope. Protection from premature stimulation can be achieved in\n      different ways for different types of microscopes. In this protocol, we\n      use the Olympus FVMPE-RS multiphoton microscope and the Nikon inverted\n      spinning disk confocal microscope as examples. With some modifications,\n      similar approaches can be employed when using other types of confocal or\n      multiphoton microscopes.\n    \n        Set up the sample for the Olympus FVMPE-RS multiphoton system:\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2306-Fig6.jpg\n              Figure 6.

    "The light-proof black cloth cover is routinely used in regular\n              imaging to protect the light-sensitive detectors. In the\n              optogenetic experiments, it helps to avoid premature stimulation\n              of the embryos.\n            \nNote: In our regular imaging\n          experiments, a light-proof black cloth is routinely used to cover the\n          microscope to protect the light-sensitive detectors. For the\n          optogenetic experiment, this black cloth also provides a superb\n          protection of the samples from unwanted light stimulations (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\n        \n            Transfer the sample to the microscope stage. During this step, all\n            light sources, including the room light and computer monitors,\n            should be turned off to avoid unwanted sample stimulation.\n          \n            Use the eyepiece to identify the embryo of interest and bring the\n            embryo into focus. During this process, only use non-blue light for\n            sample illumination.\n            \nNote: For the multiphoton system\n              used in our experiments, this is achieved by taking advantage of\n              the epifluorescence unit on the system. Specifically, the specimen\n              is illuminated with green excitation light (532–554 nm) by using\n              the standard TRITC filter set to filter out the unwanted\n              wavelengths from a white light source. The green illumination\n              light does not stimulate the optogenetic module while allowing\n              adjustment of the position of the stage and the focus of the\n              embryos. Illumination light with longer wavelength should also\n              work, but we have not tested it on our system.\n            \nNote: The computer screen can be\n              turned on once the sample is protected by the black cloth that\n              covers the microscope.\n            \n        Set up the sample for the inverted Nikon spinning disk confocal\n        microscope:\n        \n            Transfer the sample to the microscope stage with all light sources\n            turned off, including the room light and the light from computer\n            screens.\n          \n            Place an orange-red plastic shield on top of the sample before\n            turning on the transmitted light for sample illumination (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2306-Fig7.jpg",
    "Figure 7. The setup for the inverted Nikon spinning disk\n                  confocal microscope\n                \n                  An orange-red plastic shield is placed between the light\n                  source for the transmitted light and the sample.\n                \nNote: The orange-red shield blocks\n              the blue light component from transmitted light, thereby\n              protecting the sample from unwanted stimulation.\n            \nNote: The computer screen can be\n              turned on at this point, as long as the sample is protected by the\n              orange-red plastic shield.\n            \n            Use the transmitted light for sample illumination when adjusting the\n            position of the stage and the focus of the embryo.\n            \nCritical: Make sure there is\n              no ambient light in the room before taking the sample out of the\n              light-proof transfer box. The computer screen and touch panel\n              controllers (if existing), as well as all other open light sources\n              should be turned off or covered when the sample is not protected\n              from ambient light.\n            \nCritical: Keep the orange-red\n              plastic shield on top of the sample during the entire stimulation\n              and imaging process to avoid accidental stimulation of the sample\n              by ambient light.\n            \nSample stimulation and imaging protocol\nTiming: minutes-hours depends on the\n      purpose of the experiment (for step 15)\n    \n      The purpose for this step is to perform optogenetic stimulation and\n      observe desired phenotype upon Rho1 inhibition. We use the Olympus\n      FVMPE-RS multiphoton microscope and the Nikon inverted spinning disk\n      confocal microscope as examples to demonstrate the sample stimulation and\n      imaging procedures. We will also discuss common considerations that are\n      applicable to other confocal or multiphoton imaging systems.\n    \n        For experiments performed using the multiphoton microscope, we use\n        different lasers to achieve pre-stimulation imaging, stimulation and\n        post-stimulation imaging. The general steps for our experiments on the\n        multiphoton microscope are as follows:\n        \nNote: The Olympus FVMPE-RS multiphoton\n          system used in our experiments is equipped with the InSight DS",
    "Dual-line multiphoton laser for simultaneous dual-wavelength\n          excitation. The laser can generate two pulsed laser beams\n          simultaneously. The wavelength of one laser beam is tunable between\n          680 nm and 1,300 nm, which is normally adjusted to 920 nm in our\n          experiments for exciting green-yellow fluorescent proteins, such as\n          GFP. The wavelength of the other laser beam is fixed at 1,040 nm,\n          which is routinely used for exciting orange-red fluorescent proteins,\n          such as mCherry. Imaging with these multiphoton lasers is achieved\n          through a galvanometer scanner. The multiphoton system is also\n          equipped with an IR/VIS stimulation unit for\n          photo-activation/stimulation, which contains a 458 nm laser and an\n          independent galvanometer scanner to allow photo-activation/stimulation\n          within defined region of interest (ROI).\n        \n            Turn off or cover all light sources in the room before taking the\n            sample out of the transfer box. Make sure there is no other ambient\n            light in the room.\n          \n            Place the 35 mm glass-bottom dish on the stage and locate the\n            embryos using the eyepiece.\n            \nNote: The embryos are illuminated\n              with a beam of green light (532 nm–554 nm) normally used for\n              epifluorescence with a standard TRITC filter set. In our case, the\n              light source for epifluorescence is white light, and the TRITC\n              filter is used to filter out the blue light component to avoid\n              unwanted stimulation. In principle, any wavelength within the\n              green-red range can be used at this step to illuminate the sample\n              without the risk of premature stimulation.\n            \n            Cover the microscope with a light-proof black cloth. Make sure that\n            the sample is fully protected from light before turning on the\n            computer screen and other necessary light sources.\n          \n            Acquire pre-stimulation movies using the 1,040 nm laser. In this\n            experiment, the 1,040 nm laser excites both CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry and\n            Sqh-mCherry.\n            \nNote: For the process we are",
    "interested in (ventral furrow formation), the Sqh-mCherry signal\n              is enriched at the medioapical region of the ventral cells,\n              whereas CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry should remain in the cytoplasm before\n              stimulation. When imaging these proteins in early embryos, the\n              laser intensity we routinely use ranges from 4% to 10%, with a\n              linear increase in laser intensity from embryo surface to a depth\n              of 100 μm. The laser intensity used for pre- and post-stimulation\n              imaging is determined empirically based on the balance between\n              optimal signal-to-noise and prevention of photobleaching.\n              Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\n            \nNote: In general, pre-stimulation\n              images can be acquired by using excitation light that will not\n              stimulate the optogenetic module, such as the 561-nm and 633-nm\n              lasers commonly equipped on the confocal microscopes and the\n              1,040-nm laser on the multiphoton microscopes.\n            \n            Stimulate the optogenetic module within defined ROI using the IR/VIS\n            stimulation unit. Scan the ROI with the 458 nm laser continuously\n            for ∼ 12 s.\n            \nNote: For stimulating the entire\n              embryo, we use 1× zoom and an ROI that is 512 × 300 pixel2\n              in size (1 pixel = 1 μm).\n            \nNote: The laser intensity we\n              normally use for stimulation is 0.1%–0.3%. A more rapid\n              stimulation could be achieved using higher laser intensities.\n              However, under those circumstances, the scattered laser light is\n              sufficient to cause stimulation in regions outside of the ROI,\n              which is less ideal if a spatially confined stimulation is\n              desired. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\n            \nNote: Stimulation of the\n              optogenetic module can be achieved in multiple ways. For laser\n              scanning confocal microscopes, sample can be stimulated by\n              scanning a defined region of interest with a blue laser\n              (400 nm–500 nm). For spinning disk confocal microscopes,\n              stimulation will occur when a 488-nm blue laser is used for\n              imaging GFP- or YFP-tagged proteins. For multiphoton microscopes,",
    "sample can be stimulated by scanning a defined region of interest\n              with a 920-nm laser. Alternatively, stimulation of the sample can\n              be achieved by using a separate photo-stimulation/photo-activation\n              module equipped on the microscope, as described above. Of note,\n              consistent with a previous report,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] 920 nm two-photon laser results in slower\n              activation of the optogenetic module compared to the 488 nm\n              single-photon laser stimulation.\n            \n            Acquire post-stimulation movies using both 1,040 nm and 920 nm\n            lasers.\n            \nNote: In this experiment, the\n              CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry protein, which is excited by the 1,040 nm\n              laser, should show a rapid translocation from the cytoplasm to the\n              plasma membrane after stimulation. The Sqh-GFP protein, which is\n              excited by the 920 nm laser, should show a rapid dissociation from\n              the cell cortex. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and\n              4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\n            \nNote: When imaging Sqh-GFP in\n              early embryos, the laser intensity we routinely use is between\n              0.1% and 0.5%, depending on the imaging depth within the embryo.\n              The laser intensity is determined empirically based on the balance\n              between optimal signal-to-noise and prevention of photobleaching.\n            \nNote: The 920 nm laser will cause\n              stimulation of the optogenetic module in all regions being imaged.\n              Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\n            \nNote: For the experiment\n              demonstrated in this protocol (acquiring mCherry signal for\n              pre-stimulation imaging and acquiring both GFP and mCherry signals\n              for post-stimulation imaging), one advantage of using the\n              multiphoton microscope is that multiple embryos from the same\n              glass-bottom dish can be used for sequential data collection. When\n              acquiring the post-stimulation images for one embryo, the\n              scattered light from the 920 nm beam (used for Sqh-GFP excitation)\n              will not stimulate other embryos on the same dish. These embryos,\n              if at appropriate stages, can be used in subsequent rounds of\n              optogenetic stimulation and data collection. In contrast, when\n              imaging Sqh-GFP using a single photon laser (such as the spinning",
    "disk confocal microscope as described below), the blue laser\n              intensity required for exciting GFP is usually much higher than\n              that required for stimulating the optogenetic module. Under such\n              circumstance, the blue laser scattered from the embryo during\n              post-stimulation imaging may cause stimulation of other embryos on\n              the same dish, preventing the use of them for additional data\n              collection.\n            \nNote: Laser intensity should be\n              adjusted based on the expression levels of the fluorescent markers\n              to achieve optimal signal-to-noise and meanwhile avoid\n              photobleaching of the fluorophore.\n            \nNote: The activation of the\n              optogenetic module by blue light is reversible, but the\n              dissociation rate after turning off stimulation is much slower\n              compared to the rate of light-induced dimerization. In our\n              experiments, the membrane recruitment of CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry\n              resulted from a single round of stimulation (0.3% 458 nm laser for\n              12 s) is still clearly visible 10–15 min after the stimulation,\n              which is consistent with the reported dissociation half-time of ∼\n              9 min.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] However, in order to ensure a complete\n              inhibition of Rho1, we repeat the stimulation step every 3–5 min.\n            \n        For experiments performed using the inverted spinning disk confocal\n        microscope, the general steps we use for our experiments are as follows:\n        \n            Turn off or cover the room light and the computer screens (including\n            any touch panel controllers, if existing) and all other light\n            sources in the room before taking the sample out of the transfer\n            box. Make sure there is no other ambient light in the room.\n          \n            Place the 35-mm glass-bottom dish (sample) on the microscope stage.\n          \n            Place the orange-red plastic shield above the dish to protect sample\n            from unwanted stimulation.\n          \n            Block any light from the computer screen that might stimulate the\n            sample (the computer screen needs to be turned on at this point in\n            order to carry out the next step).",
    "Turn on the transmitted light through the software control and\n            locate the embryo with the eyepiece.\n            \nNote: The transmitted light\n              illuminates the sample from above the stage. No blue light can\n              pass through the orange-red shield, which prevents unwanted\n              stimulation of the sample.\n            \n            Acquire the pre-stimulation movie with the 561 nm laser, which does\n            not stimulate the optogenetic module.\n            \nNote: For imaging Sqh-mCherry in\n              early embryos, we routinely use a laser intensity of 20%. For pre-\n              and post-stimulation imaging, the laser intensity is determined\n              empirically to achieve an optimal balance between adequate\n              signal-to-noise and greatest protection of the sample from\n              photobleaching. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\n            \n            Stimulation of the optogenetic module and acquisition of the GFP\n            signal is performed simultaneously using the 488 nm laser. The\n            561 nm laser is also used in parallel to acquire the signals in the\n            mCherry channel.\n            \nNote: The intensity of the 488 nm\n              laser we routinely use is 10%–20%. Note that this intensity is\n              optimized for imaging Sqh-GFP (which is determined based on the\n              trade-off between signal intensity and photobleaching) but is\n              approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the laser\n              intensity required for optogenetic stimulation. Robust membrane\n              recruitment of CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry is typically observed within\n              the first few seconds of image acquisition.\n              Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7],\n              and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\n            \nNote: Laser intensity should be\n              adjusted based on the expression levels of the fluorescent markers\n              to achieve optimal signal-to-noise ratio while minimizing\n              photobleaching.\n            \nNote: For spinning disk confocal\n              microscope, repeated stimulation is not necessary since the 488 nm\n              laser is constantly stimulating the optogenetic module during the\n              acquisition process. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\n            \nCritical: With the approach\n              described above, due to the strong light scattering from the\n              488 nm laser, the entire embryo is stimulated upon exposure of the\n              sample to the 488 nm laser, precluding the application of",
    "region-specific stimulation. In addition, other embryos from the\n              same dish might also be stimulated by the scattered light,\n              precluding the use of them for further data collection. If imaging\n              the GFP channel is not necessary for post-stimulation acquisition,\n              a much lower laser intensity for the 488 nm laser (e.g., 0.1%) can\n              be used to stimulate the embryo. In this case, other embryos on\n              the same dish will not be stimulated prematurely and can be used\n              for additional data collection.\n              Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]."
