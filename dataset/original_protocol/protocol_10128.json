    "The following methods were performed in compliance with UTA and UCLA IACUC protocols. These experimental groups were used with transgenic Tg(cmlc2:gfp), the wea (weak atrium) or clo (cloche) mutants: (a) wild-type (WT) control, (b) gata1a MO, and (c) tnnt2a MO injections (Table 1).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nModel,Name,Modified Genes,Phenotype,Reference\nControl,Wild type,,,\n,Tg(cmlc2:gfp),Cardiac myosin light chain,Green flourescence specifically expressed in the myocardium,34\nDecreased Wall Shear Stress,Weak atrium (wea) mutant,Atrium-specific myosin heacy chain,\"Atrium cannot contract, compact ventricle, thick myocardial wall, narrow lumen, dialated atrium,\",37\nDecreased Wall Shear Stress,Cloche (clo) mutant,,\"Complete removal of endocardium, unaturally large atrium with small ventricle, nonexistent cardiac cushins\",41\nDecreased Wall Shear Stress,gata1a MO,gata1a,Anemia from lack of red blood cells,4\nDecreased Wall Shear Stress,tnnt2a MO,tnnt2a,,39\nIncreased Wall Shear Stress,EPO mRNA,,\"Severe polycythemia, increase in number of circulating blood cells, increased viscosity\",6\nIncreased Wall Shear Stress,Isoprotenerol,,Increased cardiac rate,7\nTable 1: Zebrafish descriptions. Definitions and descriptions of Zebrafish used in experiments.\n1. Study Setup\nPrepare Nrg1 and EPO mRNA for trabeculation rescue.\n\t\nObtain Human Nrg1 cDNA and amplify from a donor plasmid.\nNote: The Human Nrg1 cDNA was gifted from William Talbot from Stanford University.\n\t\t\nTake out necessary reagents and materials, namely PCR mastermix (stored in -20 °C), primers (See Table 2) (stored in -20 °C), a PCR plate (stored at room temperature), and a 20 μL pipette (stored at room temperature). See Table of Materials for example products.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57763/57763tbl2v2.jpg\nTable 2: Primers for human Nrg1 cloning.\nPrepare the mastermix for each primer set in triplicate using the 20 μL pipette. For 1 set of triplicates, use 37.5 μL of the mastermix, 3 μL of DNA-free water, 4.5 μL of primer. For more triplicates, simply multiply by the number of samples.",
    "Dilute the working solution Human Nrg1 cDNA (20 ng/μg concentration) in the primer strip with DNA-free water so that there is 10 μL total per well per sample.\nNote: Ensure that each solution under step 1.1.1 is evenly distributed. Do this by mixing each solution by pipetting up and down. To prevent cross-contamination, use one pipette tip for only one sample.\nAliquot the Nrg1 cDNA with the 10 μL multi-channel pipette to desired wells in the PCR plate.\nAdd 14.5 μL of the mastermix to the cDNA in the wells. Apply a sticky cover to the PCR plate to seal the wells, and place into the PCR machine.\nStart the PCR machine and ensure that the cycle reaches appropriate temperatures according to the enzymes and primers used.\nClone the Nrg1 cDNA into the plasmid pCS2+ at the BamHI and EcoRI sites using excess enzymes BamHI and EcoRI to ensure cDNA is ligated in all plasmids.\n\t\t\nMix the Nrg1 cDNA with the donor plasmid pCS2+, commercially available master mix solution and primers (Table 2).\nNote: The total reaction volume should be 50 μL with 25 μL of master mix, 3 μL of primers and 1 μL of 20 ng/μL donor plasmid with Nrg1 cDNA.\nPlace the mix from step 1.1.2.1 in the PCR machine and set the parameters to meet the following specifications: 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 5 or 15 s, and 72 °C for 5 s/kb.\nPurify the PCR product using a purification kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Elute the product into 50 μL of elution buffer.",
    "Digest the purified PCR product and 5 μg of pCS2+ with BamHI and EcoRI separately at 37 °C for 2 h in a 200 μL reaction volume. Purify the resulting digestion with a commercial kit and elute in 20 μL and 100 μL of Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), respectively.\nLigate 4 μL of Nrg1 cDNA and 2 μL of the digested pCS2+ plasmid in a 25 μL reaction with 1 μL of a ligase catalyst at 16 °C overnight.\nNote: The procedure can be stopped here for overnight incubation.\nUse 2 μL of the ligation solution from step 1.1.2.5 and transform into 50 μL of E. coli bacteria cells suitable for cloning (see Table of Materials).\nConfirm that the transformation took place by screening the Nrg1 cDNA clones using PCR. Choose clones at random and add to a solution of specific primers, polymerase, and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs).\nNote: The controls were the vector (pCS2+) with and without the insert (human cDNA). Do not pick too big of a colony because excessive bacteria can inhibit PCR.\n\t\t\nPick 8 colonies from the transformation and screen pCS2+-Nrg1 clones using the PCR primers from Table 2.\nCulture one clone with Nrg1 cDNA to isolate the pCS2+-Nrg1 plasmid DNA. Inoculate with 100 μL of E. coli bacteria with pCS2+-Nrg1 plasmid into 100 mL of LB media, and culture by shaking (160 - 225 RPM) at 37 °C.\nTransfect purified pCS2+-Nrg1 plasmid into HEK-293 cells in a 6-well plate using a commercial transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions.\n24 h after transfection, lyse the cells using a lysis buffer and run through an SDS-PAGE gel, transfer to a gel membrane, and then stain with anti-Nrg1 antibody22. Verify Nrg1 protein expression using a Western Blot.",
    "Note: The control is an empty pCS2+ plasmid. Can be paused here if gel membrane transfer occurs overnight.\nSynthesize Nrg1 mRNA using a commercial product similar to that in the Table of Materials and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\t\nTake 5 μL of the pCS2+-Nrg1 DNA from the bacteria isolated culture, and digest with NotI in a 200 μL reaction for 2 h at 37 °C to linearize the plasmid.\nPurify the linearized plasmid with a commercial kit and elute in 20 μL of Tris-HCl (pH 8.5).\nConduct in vitro transcription with a commercial RNA isolation kit in a 20 μL reaction using 5 μL of the linearized plasmid following the manufacturer's instructions.\nAdd the in vitro transcribed Nrg1 to 350 μL of RNA lysis buffer and then purify with an RNA isolation kit. Elute the RNA into 60 μL of Tris-HCl (pH 8.5).\nMeasure the RNA concentration and store at -80 °C for future use.\nFollow steps 1.1.6.1 - 1.1.6.5 above for the EPO cDNA and mRNA preparation but clone the cDNA into the pCS2+ plasmid at EcoRI and XhoI sites instead.\nInject Morpholino into zebrafish\n\t\nDesign23 the MO injections using an online tool (Table of Materials) against the ATG sequence of gata1a4 (5′-CTGCAAGTGTAGTATTGAAGATGTC-3′) and tnnt2a5 (5′-CATGTTTGCTCTGATCTGACACGCA-3′).\nAdd gata1a and tnnt2a MO separately to the nuclease-free water to make the final concentrations of 8 ng/nL and 4 ng/nL, respectively. Repeat with EPO mRNA with a final concentration of 20 pg/nL. Ensure that the final volume is 1 mL.",
    "Inject 1 nL of the 8 ng/nL of gata1a MO and 1 nL of the 4 ng/nL of tnnt2a MO into separate zebrafish embryos at the 1 to the 4-cell stage to reduce ventricular wall shear stress (WSS)24. To increase WSS, inject 1 nL of 20 pg/nL of EPO mRNA6 into the zebrafish embryos at the 1- to 4- cell stage.\nChemically treat zebrafish to inhibit trabeculation\n\t\nUsing a 20 mL pipette, dilute the 10 mg/mL AG1478 in 1% DMSO in E3 medium to a final concentration of 5 μM at 30 hpf into a 15 mL tube. As a control, treat each fish with 1% DMSO only.\nAdd N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenactyl)-L-Alanyl]-S-Phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) in 1% DMSO (100 μM) to E3 medium in a 15 mL tube to inhibit Notch signaling at 40 hpf in a similar fashion. As a control, treat with only 1% DMSO.\n2. Imaging Techniques\n4-D cardiac LSFM Imaging with synchronization algorithm\n\t\nTake 2-D images of the entire fish embryo over multiple cardiac beating cycles using the steps below (Figure 1) . Ensure that the light-sheet thickness is approximately 5 μm. Take 500 x-y frames with an exposure time of 10 ms. Set the z-scanning to 1 μm for lossless digital sampling according to the Nyquist sampling principle25.\n\t\t\nCreate a 1% (w/v) agarose gel by adding 1 g of agarose to 100 mL and heating it until all agarose is dissolved. Load a small plastic tube with the embryo and agarose using a 20 μL pipette and secure it on the stage.",
    "Open the image viewing software and click Live to see the live view of the sample. Adjust the objective using the knob so that the sample is in focus. Similarly, move the stage so that the live view of the sample shows the top of the embryo.\nTake images 500 times for 5 s at 10X magnification using the microscope's software26.\nMove the stage using the motor to a new layer (1 μm in the z-axis) and repeat the imaging procedure.\nRepeat above 2 steps until entire heart is fully imaged.\nEnsure data integrity by disregarding the first and last cardiac cycle images. Find the period of the cardiac cycle by matching images that were taken at the same time point in the cardiac cycle, but in different periods. Use the following equation that was developed to find the period:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57763/57763eq1.jpg (1)\n\t\twhere D is the cost function used for fitting a period hypothesis, Im the captured image, τ' the time the image was captured, zk the z-direction index of the image, xm is the vector of the pixel index, and T' is the periodic hypothesis.\nUse the following equation to find the relative shift between two pictures in similar stages:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57763/57763eq2.jpg (2)\n\t\twhere Qk',k denotes a cost function for the relative shift, R is the possible spatial neighborhood, L is the total time of capturing the image, x is the pixel index, zk and zk' are the first and second z-direction slices, t is time, and s is the relative shift hypothesis.\nConvert the relative shift to absolute shift with respect to the first image and solve the linear equation using the pseudo-inverse approach, to find the absolute relation to align the next section of images as previously described27.",

Using a previously described protocol30, the zebrafish hearts were excised and prepared for RNA isolation.\nIsolate the total RNA, and synthesize the cDNA using the cDNA synthesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nDesign the PCR primers for the Notch ligands Jag1, Jag2, Dll4, receptor Notch1b, and signaling related genes Nrg1 and ErbB2. See Table 3 for the primers we used.",
    "Add the primers from step 3.1.3, the isolated mRNA from step 3.1.2, and a commercial mastermix to the PCR plate. Run the qRT-PCR at the appropriate temperatures and times according to the enzymes used. Normalize the results to zebrafish α-actin.\nNote: This will calculate the expression levels for each of the ligands, receptors, and genes.\n4. In vitro Human Aortic Endothelial Cell (HAEC) Experiments\nDynamic Shear Stress Model\n\t\nCulture HAEC cells with HAEC culture media. Once fully confluent, expose the cells to laminar flow and pulsatile flow of 23 x 10-5 N at the rate of 1 Hz for 24 h.\n\t\t\nWarm up EC media/DMEM 10% FBS in a water bath for 20 min.\nRetrieve HAEC cells from liquid nitrogen tank and place the vial into the water bath until melted.\nUsing a 1,000 μL pipette, remove the thawed cells and put them in a 15 mL tube with 3-5 mL of media. Centrifuge the cell solution at 53 x g for 3 min.\nAspirate the solution off and add enough media for a total volume of 10 mL. Add the cell solution to a sterile T75 flask, cap the flask, and distribute the cells evenly on the bottom of the plate.\nMark the flask with initials, date, cell type, and passage number. Incubate the flask at 37 °C, 5% CO2, until cells are 80% confluent. Remember to change the media every 2-3 days.\nUsing a commercial pump, attach the tubing to the flask, and set the parameters mentioned above in step 4.1.131,32,33.\nAdd GI254023X to 50 mL of HAEC medium at a final concentration of 5 μM for 30 min.\nWith the pre-mixed GI254023X, an ADAM10 inhibitor which suppresses Notch signaling, conduct the same laminar flow or pulsatile flow experiments as in 4.1.1.",
    "Quantify Notch ligands (Jag1, Jag2, and Dll4) and Notch target genes (hairy and enhancer of split [Hes]) using qRT-PCR for four groups of HAEC samples (laminar flow, laminar flow + GI254023X, pulsatile flow, pulsatile flow + GI254023X) described previously32.\n5. Rescue and over-expression of Notch signaling\nInject 1 nL of the prepared Nrg1 mRNA at a concentration of 5 pg/nL (from step 1.1.6) at the 1- to 4-cell stage with the gata1a MO in order to overexpress Notch target genes24.\nInject 1 nL of the Nrg1 mRNA into wea mutant in a similar way24.\nDouble the concentration of Nrg1 mRNA (10 pg/nL) and inject24 1 nL into zebrafish to observe the ventricular morphology.\nInject 1 nL of the 20 pg/nL of EPO mRNA6 into the zebrafish embryos at the 1- to 4- cell stage to augment hematopoiesis to increase ventricular WSS as previously shown24.\nInject 1 nL of the 50 μM Isoproterenol7, which increases the rate of contractility, to the E3 medium for 24 h while zebrafish are cultured as previously shown24.\nPerform 4-D LSFM imaging for each group.
