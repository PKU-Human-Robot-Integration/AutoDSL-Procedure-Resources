    "Animal anesthesia and euthanesia was performed in accordance with \"Principles of laboratory animal care\" (NIH publication No. 86-23, revised 1985) and approved by the Danish Council for Animal Research Ethics.\n1. Instruments\nCollect the instruments presented in the video and listed in the Table of Materials.\n2. Decapitation\nNOTE: Anesthesia was induced by an intramuscular injection of 5 mL of midazolam (5 mg/mL) and 5 mL of ketamine (25 mg/mL). 5-10 min later, when the animal was deeply sedated, an ear vein was cannulated and a lethal overdose (100 mg/kg of bodyweight) of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/mL) was given intravenously. To ensure that the animal was completely euthanized, the interdigital pain reflex was tested as shown by Ettrup et al. (2011)20. Complete euthanization was ensured as described in the ethics statement above and followed by a transcardial perfusion with 5 L of isotonic saline, as demonstrated by Ettrup et al. (2011)20. All the demonstrated procedures are performed postmortem, precluding the need for the welfare precautions necessary for long-term anesthesia and postprocedural survival.\nDecapitate the pig by a high circular cervical incision, using a surgical scalpel, just below the mandibular angle (Figure 1A).\nStill with the surgical scalpel, continue the incision anteriorly through the soft tissue of the neck, including the larynx and the esophagus, until the bony spinal column is reached, approximately at the level of the craniocervical junction.\nAdvance the cut with a surgical scalpel from the anterior side of the craniocervical junction, above the anterior arc of atlas, and through the anterior atlantooccipital membrane, thereby exposing the spinal canal and the spinal cord (Figure 1B). Simultaneously ask an assistant to pull the pig body away from the pig head to ease the access between the skull base and the first cervical vertebra.",
    "Continue the surgical incision through the dural sac and the spinal cord (Figure 1B). Take special care to ensure that a complete transverse section of the spinal cord is achieved.\n\tNOTE: Failure to perform the previous step may result in unwanted traction on the spinal cord and brain during the following steps of the decapitation process.\nForcefully extend the cranocervical junction at the section level (Figure 1C). At the same time, use the surgical scalpel to section the remaining atlantooccipital ligaments to release the articulation between the occipital condyles and the upper articulate process of atlas. Separate the pig head from the body.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55511/55511fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Minipig decapitation. (A) Neck incision (arrow, mandibular angle). (B) Incision through the atlantooccipital ligaments and the dura-surrounded spinal cord (SC) at the craniocervical junction (C1, anterior arc of atlas; OC, occipital condyle). (C) The posterior part of the atlantooccipital articulation is released by a forceful extension (arrows) at the section level. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55511/55511fig1large.jpg]\n3. Skull Opening\nPosition the pig head on a table.\nMake a dorsal longitudinal incision with a surgical scalpel through the skin and the underlying soft tissue from the back of the snout, over the vertex of the head, and down through the posterior part of the occipital region.\nExpose the dorsal and posterior part of the skull by removing the soft tissue located lateral to the initial incision with a surgical scalpel.\nRelease the temporal muscle bilaterally from the skull (Figure 2A) with a surgical scalpel. Make sure that the posterior occipital bone is cleaned of soft tissue.\nUse the posterior entrance of the foramen magnum to remove the occipital bone with a Kerrison bone punch and bone rongeurs and expose the dura-covered cerebellum (Figure 2B).",
    "Return to the exposed anterior side of the skull and select an entry point in the frontal bone, just in front of the eyes. At this point, use a bone chisel with a hammer to penetrate the skull and enter the frontal sinus (Figure 2C).\nUse the extent of the frontal sinus to further the dorsoposterior removal of the outer skull lamina with a bone rongeur or bone punch and expose the inner, thin bony skull lamina covering the cerebrum (Figure 2D).\nGently open the inner bony skull lamina anteriorly with a hammer and a bone chisel to expose the dura-covered cerebrum (Figure 2E).\nContinue the bone removal laterally using a bone chisel and a bone rongeur through the temporal and parietal bone in order to release the final dorsoposterior part of the skull, located between the already exposed parts of the dura-covered cerebrum and cerebellum (Figure 2F).\n\tNOTE: It is often possible, during the final step of this procedure, to use the chisel to break open the remaining posterior skull bone from one side, just like one opens a door.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55511/55511fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Minipig skull opening. (A) Exposure of the dorsoposterior skull surface, including the removal of the occipital and temporal muscles. (B) Removal of the occipital bone (CB, dura-covered cerebellum; OB, occipital bone; OC, occipital condyle; and SC, spinal cord). (C) A hammer and a bone chisel are used to penetrate the skull anteriorly and to enter the frontal sinus at the level of the eyes. (D) The extent of the frontal sinus (FS) is used to remove the outer thick skull bone (1), exposing an inner thin bone lamina (2) covering the cerebrum. (E) Removal of the thin bone lamina, exposing the dura-covered cerebrum (arrow). (F) Finally, a hammer and a bone chisel are used to laterally connect the anterior and the posterior skull openings. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55511/55511fig2large.jpg]\n4. Brain Removal\nUse surgical forceps to lift the dura and create a gentle incision close to the venous superior sagittal sinus using a fine surgical scalpel (Figure 3A).\nUse micro-scissor or a dura-knife to further open the dura covering the dorsal surface of the brain.\n\tNOTE: Special care must be taken when removing the dura corresponding to the cerebellar tentorium (Figure 3B), as preservation of this dural leaf will prevent subsequent brain removal.\nPosition the pig head vertically (Figure 3C).\nUse the bone chisel or a dissector to release the ventroanterior cerebrum by blunt dissection of the olfactory bulb from the dura-covered floor of the cranial cavity (Figure 3D).\nUse a fine surgical scalpel to section the exposed optic chiasm (Figure 3E). Expose and section the pituitary stalk and the oculomotor nerves.",
    "Release the ventral brainstem by sectioning the lower cranial nerves (Figure 3F) with a fine surgical scalpel. Ensure that the dural cerebellar tentorium was completely incised (Figure 3B), as this dural leaf will otherwise cut through the brainstem during the release process.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55511/55511fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Minipig brain removal. (A) Dural opening with surgical forceps and a dura knife. (B) Care must be taken to completely incise the dural leaf (arrow), located between the cerebrum and the cerebellum. (C) The pig head is positioned vertically for better visualization of skull base structures and in order for gravity to assist in the intended displacement of the brain. (D) A dissector or a bone chisel is used to relieve the olfactory bulb by blunt section from the dura-covered skull base. (E) The dissection is continued in a posterior direction along the skull base for exposure and sectioning of the optic chiasm (arrow), infundibular stalk, and oculomotor nerves. (F) The brain release is completed with the section of the lower cranial nerves as they depart from the ventral surface of the brainstem (III, oculomotor nerve; IV, trochlear nerve; V, trigeminal nerve; and VI, abducens nerve). Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55511/55511fig3large.jpg]\n5. Pituitary Removal\nIdentify the pituitary stalk and its surrounding dural leaf (the diapragma sellae) in the skull floor (Figure 4A).\nIncise the dural leaf lateral to the pituitary stalk using a fine surgical scalpel (Figure 4B).\nUse a dissector to release the pituitary and lift it out of the pituitary fossa (Figure 4C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55511/55511fig4.jpg",
