    "Animal procedures were performed in accordance with the approved institutional animal care and use committee of the Institut Curie (CEEA-IC) protocols (C 75-05-18). The work has also been conducted under the approval from the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research for the use of Genetically Modified Organisms (agreement number 5549CA-I).\n1. Preparation of Cryostat Sections\nCollect embryos from naturally ovulating F1 C57BL/6 x DBA/2J mice as described in Shea et al.,12. On day 7 of gestation (E7), sacrifice 8-12 week old mouse by cervical dislocation. Collect the entire conceptus i.e decidua12.\nIsolate E7 conceptuses, as described in Shea et al.,12. Place them in a 60 mm Petri dish containing PBS.\nFreeze the E7 mouse conceptus for cryostat sections.\n\t\nPrepare adapted aluminum foil wells 1cm in height ('home-made' using a glass Pasteur pipet). Deposit a drop of tissue freezing medium on the bottom of this small container. Deposit the conceptus in the correct orientation (i.e., for longitudinal sections the conceptus should maintained in its horizontal orientation).\nFill the well containing the conceptus with tissue freezing medium. Suspend it with forceps in vapor above liquid N2 in order to allow it to freeze slowly – then immerse the block in the liquid N2 for a few sec until it turns white. Subsequently, transfer the block into a freezing vial and store at -80 °C (can store for several months).\nBefore cryo-sectioning, place the frozen block containing the conceptus at -20 °C in the cryostat for 30 min. Perform cryosections of 8 µm thickness. Deposit 4 sections on a slide to enable efficient attachment. Place sections close enough to fit under an 18 x 18 mm2 coverslip.",
    "Check the quality of the sections (intact and without scratches) and the orientation of the embryo (longitudinal sections) with a stereomicroscope and choose the sections suitable for further analysis. As quickly as possible deposit them in a coplin jar and perform RNA FISH (See 3.3.2).\n2. Preparation of Secondary TGCs\nIsolate the Conceptus (see 1.1 and 1.2).\nDissect the E7 Ectoplacental Cone (EPC)\n\t\nUse a stereomicroscope and Petri dishes containing sterile PBS. Dissect the decidua with forceps. Pierce the sample and open forceps to tear the two sides of the decidua apart.\nShell out the embryo. Use tips of closed fine forceps (Dumont No. 5) in a scissor-like action to separate the EPC from the embryo proper. Use special care to obtain a perfectly clean sample, separate from maternal tissue as well as from chorion and yolk sac. Wash out EPC explants in PBS.\nWith a little spoon, transfer individual dissected EPC to a 4-well plate containing a sterile coverslip in medium.\nDerive TGCs from EPCs Short-term Cultures.\n\t\nPrepare 4-well plates containing coverslips. Sterilize 12 mm diameter round glass coverslips by immersing in ethanol, followed by flame-drying.\nAdd 0.5 ml EPC medium to each well (EPC medium: RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% FCS, 0.1mM 2-mercaptoethanol and antibiotics).\nDeposit single, dissected-EPCs at the center of the coverslip in the well along with culture medium. Use fine forceps to apply the EPC on the glass coverslip. Culturefor 3-5 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Individual explant forms an outgrowth that spreads as a monolayer of flattened TGCs (Figure 2A).\n3. RNA FISH\nNOTE: The protocols are based on those described for embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in Chaumeil et al.,8 and Pollex and Heard13.\nAdvanced Preparation of Stock Solutions\n\t\nPrepare a 3M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.2.",
    "Prepare 2x hybridization buffer containing 40 % (w/v) sodium dextran sulfate, 20x BSA, 400 mM Vanadyl Ribonucleoside Complex (VRC) in 4x Saline Sodium Citrate (SSC).\nPrepare mounting medium containing 90% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) p-phenylenediamine, pH 9 in PBS.\nFreshly Prepared Solutions\n\t\nPrepare fixative solution consisting of 3% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Prepare permeabilization solution containing 0.5 % Triton-X-100 in PBS supplemented with 2 mM VRC. Prepare wash buffer by mixing 50% formamide (FA) and 2x SSC and adjust the pH to 7.2-7.4.\nPrepare DNA counter-staining solution consisting of 1 µg/ml DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) in 2x SSC.\nFixation and Permeabilization in Preparation for FISH\n\t\nFor cells on coverslips, wash cells in 1x PBS for 5 min. Fix cells on coverslips, or embryonic sections on slides, for 10 min in fixative (3% PFA) solution at RT.\nRinse cells three times with 1x PBS. Permeabilize cells for 5 min in ice-cold permeabilization solution on ice. Wash cells three times with 70% ethanol. Store coverslips in 4-well plates and slides in 4-slide transport box in 70% ethanol at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Coverslips and slides can be stored for several months at -20 °C. Plates and boxes containing them have to be sealed with parafilm to avoid ethanol evaporation.\nDNA Probe Labeling\n\t\nLabel DNA probes by nick translation using fluorescent nucleotides. Follow the manufacturer's instructions (see Table 1)8.\nFor a 50 µl reaction mix, add 1-2 µg of plasmid, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) or multiple displacement amplification (MDA) (for DNA amplification; see 3.4.4) DNA to 17.5 µl water, 2.5 µl 0.2 mM SR-, SG-, Cy5-dUTP, 10 µl 10 mM each dNTP mix (dGTP, dATP, dCTP), 5 µl 10 mM dTTP, 5 µl 10x nick translation buffer and 8 µl nick translation enzyme.",
    "Incubate for 16 hr at 15 °C in the dark. Inactivate the reaction by freezing at -20 °C. Store probes for months at -20 °C.\nMDA\n\t\tNOTE: For BAC DNA, quantity of DNA obtained after classical preparation is low, therefore one can use a step of DNA amplification before labeling by using MDA. Use a commercial kit and follow the manufacturer's instructions (see Table 1).\nMix 0.5 µl BAC DNA with 9.5 µl sample buffer. Heat 3 min at 95 °C. Immediately quench on ice; leave on ice 10 min. Prepare reaction buffer/enzyme mix: (9.5 µl + 0.5 µl enzyme mix) and keep on ice.\nMix 10 µl DNA mix + 10 µl reaction buffer/enzyme mix. Incubate at 30 °C at least 20 hr. Inactivate enzyme by heating sample 10 min at 65 °C. Cool sample to 4 °C before storing at -20 °C.\nCheck MDA by digestion. Add 1 µl MDA, 2 µl 10x buffer, 2 µl Hind III and 15 µl H2O. Incubate at 37 °C overnight. Run slowly on a 0.8-1% agarose gel to confirm accurate DNA amplification. Clear DNA fragments of high molecular weight should be observed on the gel.\nProbe Preparation\n\t\nUse 0.1 or 1 µg probe per coverslip or slide.\n\t\tNOTE: Add 2-5 µg of Cot-1 DNA if competition is required e.g., most probes as they can contain repeat sequences which otherwise cross hybridize and increase background.\n\t\t\nFor precipitation, add 5 µg salmon sperm DNA, 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 3 volumes ethanol. Spin at 16,000 x g and 4 °C for 25 min. Wash pellets with 70% ethanol and spin down again for 5 min.",
    "Dry pellet for 2 min in a concentrator/speed vac. Resuspend in 100% formamide in half the volume required for hybridization (e.g., 2.5 µl for coverslip or 7 µl for embryonic sections on slide). Place 30 min at 37 °C with shaking in a thermomixer. Denature for 7 min at 75 °C.\nQuench on ice, or if competition is required put directly at 37 °C for 30-60 min. Mix the probe solution with an equal volume of 2x hybridization solution.\nHybridization and Washes\n\t\nDehydrate; coverslips in wells, and slides in a Coplin jar, by sequential washing in 1x 80%, 1x 95% and 2x 100% ethanol for 5 min each. Dry coverslips and slides completely.\nFor hybridization, apply the 5 µl probe hybridization mix (see 3.5) onto a slide and lower the coverslip, with cells facing into the hybridization mix. For sections on slide, apply 14 µl probe hybridization mix (see 3.5) and cover with an 18 x 18 mm2 coverslip.\nPlace slides in a humid chamber (tissue paper soaked in 50% FA/2x SSC) and incubate at 37 °C overnight, in the dark.\nPost-hybridization Washes:\n\t\t\nAdd 1 ml of 50% FA/2x SSC onto the coverslip on the slide to loosen it; remove the coverslip carefully from the slide (taking care not to scrape the cells) and place it cell-side up into a 4-well plate containing 50% FA/2x SSC. For sections on slide, remove the coverslip in a similar manner and place the slide in a Coplin jar containing 50% FA/2x SSC.\nPerform 3 washes, each for 7 min with pre-warmed 50% FA/2x SSC at 42 °C or 44 °C for coverslip or slide, respectively.\nPerform 3 washes with pre-warmed 2x SSC for 5 min each at 42 °C or 44 °C for coverslip or slide, respectively.",
    "Counterstain nuclei by washing in 2x SSC with 1 µg/ml DAPI for 3 min at RT. Rinse twice with 2x SSC.\nMounting of Coverslips and Slides\n\t\nFor small coverslip from cultured TGCs, apply 5 µl mounting medium on a slide. Place the coverslip cell-side down on top of the drop.\nFor slide with sections, apply 15 µl mounting medium on the slide. Place a 22 x 22 mm2 coverslip on top of the drop.\nAvoid bubbles. Wipe off excess mounting solution. Seal the coverslip with a small amount of nail polish. If possible, image slides immediately or store for up to several months at -20 °C.\n4. Microscopy and Analysis\nAcquire 3D sequential z axis images in 0.3 µm using a fluorescence microscope (63X objective) and perform the analysis of 3D image stacks using the imageJ software14."
