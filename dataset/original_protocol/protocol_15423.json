    "1. Materials to Construct\nA jugular vein catheter is constructed from a piece (100 mm) of PE-50 polyethylene tubing, beveled at one end, and then filled with heparin saline (50 U heparin/mL saline).\nThe ECG recording electrodes are constructed from two 100 mm lengths of insulated silver wire (30AWG). One end of both wires is stripped and soldered to a microconnector, and the insulation is twisted to form a third wire that is used as ground.  Five-mm of insulation is stripped from the distal end of the wires and discarded.\n2. Implanting Jugular Vein Catheter\nAnesthetize the animal by administration of Urethane, ip (1.2 g/kg).\nRoutinely check (10 min intervals) depth of anesthesia by evaluating the pedal withdrawal response and/or eye reflexes. If needed, supplement anesthesia.\nAfter the animal is at the appropriate plane of anesthesia, shave the right side of the neck from the clavicle to the chin.\nMake a longitudinal incision (10-15 mm) in the skin above the carotid artery and open the incision.\nUsing blunt dissection techniques, spread the underlying muscle to locate and isolate the right jugular vein.\nPlace two pieces of surgical silk (#2) under the jugular vein, and position the sutures at the rostral and caudal most portions of the incision. Tie the rostral ligature to discontinue flow through the vein.\nRetract the caudal ligature to lift the vessel off the underlying tissue and make a small cut. Then insert the beveled end of the heparin-filled (50 U/ml saline) PE-50 polyethylene catheter (100 mm in length), and advance the tip approximately 8 mm to the level of the right atrium. \nIn order to secure the catheter, tie the caudal ligature around both the vessel and catheter. Finally, close the wound with either wound clips or suture.",
    "During the implantation of the catheter, the exposed end is either clamped with a hemostat or plugged to prevent back flow of blood prior to attachment to an infusion pump.\n3. Implanting CG Electrodes\nPlace the animal on its back and shave the chest. \nFor placement of the electrodes, make two longitudinal incisions (≈ 10 mm), one in the upper right and one in the lower left quadrants of the chest, and free the overlying skin to expose the thoracic muscles.\nSuture one of the exposed 5-mm tips of the silver-wire electrodes into the thoracic muscles in each of the exposed areas, and place the ground electrode subcutaneously.\nClose the incisions with wound clips and plug the microconnector into the recording device.\nWrap the animal loosely in a towel to maintain body temperature during the procedure.\n4. Recording ECG\nRecordings are made using a Powerlab Data Acquisition System and Macintosh computer or similar hardware/software (amplified, 50X; filtered, 1-1000 Hz). \nFollowing a 20-30 min equilibration period, record ECG for 20 min.\n5. Inducing Ventricular Arrhythmias\nAttach the jugular vein catheter to a remote syringe placed in a programmable infusion pump.\nInitiate the aconitine infusion at a rate to deliver a constant dose of 5 ug/kg/min for 7 minutes. \nFollowing ventricular fibrillation or the end of the infusion period, euthanize the animal using an approved procedure. \n6. Analysis of ECG \nThe QT interval represents the total duration of ventricular electrical activity. Fig. 1 shows a model ECG recording and the duration of the QT interval. Calculate the mean time between the initiation of the Q-wave and termination of the T-wave for all recorded heartbeats over a five-minute interval obtained during the 20 min recording period.",
    "To correct the QT interval for differences in heart rate (QTc), use Bazett’s formula, QTc=QT/(RR)½, where RR is the mean interval between heartbeats.  The RR interval is calculated as the duration between successive Q-waves obtained during the analyzed period.\nThe QT dispersion (QTd) is calculated by subtracting the minimum QT from the maximum QT recorded for each animal.\n7. Analysis of Heart Rate Variability\nSoftware programs (i.e. LabChart 7, ADInstruments, Inc.) that analyze variability in the RR intervals obtained during the period of analysis are used for automated calculation of both temporal and/or spectral variance in heart rate. \n8. Analysis of Susceptibility to Ventricular Arrhythmias\nCalculate the latency from the initiation of aconitine infusion to the first premature ventricular contraction (PVC, Fig. 2, Panel 1), ventricular tachycardia (VT, Fig, 2, Panel 2) and ventricular fibrillation (VF, Fig. 2 Panel 3). \n9. Representative Results\nFig. 3 illustrates one measure of HRV in the spectral domain (root mean squared of the standard deviation of the RR \ninterval, RMSSD) in control rats and in animals that underwent SE one week prior to testing. This measure of HRV, which represents changes in the \nparasympathetic control of cardiac function 26, is significantly decreased in animals following status epilepticus. Fig. 4 shows that both \ncorrected QT interval (QTc, Panel A) and QT dispersion (QTd, Panel B) are significantly increased two weeks following SE27.  Taken together, these \ndata predict that SE increases risk of ventricular arrhythmias. This prediction is confirmed by the findings that the periods of aconitine infusion \nnecessary to induce the experimental arrhythmias (PVC, VT, VF) observed in these studies were significantly smaller in animals following SE (Fig. 5)27.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2726/2726fig1.jpgFigure 1.Model ECG recording of a normal heartbeat showing P, QRS, and T waves.

Panel 1) Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are isolated contractions of the ventricles (B) that occur between normal heartbeats (A). PVC recordings are characterized by the absence of P and T waves. \nPanel 2 Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a series of multiple ventricular contractions (C) that occur with no intervening normal heartbeats (A).\nPanel 3 Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the lack of discernable rhythm and no association between QRS and P waves (D).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2726/2726fig3.jpgFigure 3.
