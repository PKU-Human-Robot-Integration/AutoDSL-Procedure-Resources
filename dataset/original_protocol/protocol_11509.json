    "1. Sample Stock Solution Preparation\nAdd gadoterate meglumine (GadM, 0.5 mol/L) to concentrated [1-13C]pyruvic acid to give a final concentration of 1-mmol/L GadM. Add trityl radical tris (8-carboxy-2,2,6,6-tetra-(hydroxyethyl)-benzo-[1,2-4,5]-bis-(1,3)-dithiole-4-yl)-methyl sodium salt (OX063) to this mixture to give a final concentration of 15 mmol/L. Vortex until complete dissolution.\n\tNOTE: This stock solution preparation is designed for usage with a 3.35-T preclinical DNP hyperpolarizer. When a 7-T clinical hyperpolarizer is used, the gadoterate meglumine is not required because, at a higher magnetic field, its benefits are negligible. The addition of a gadolinium-based contrast agent increases the achievable solid-state polarization and also the polarization rate. However, in the liquid state, the contrast agent shortens the T1 relaxation time.\n2. Growing the Cell Culture\nGrow PC3 cells in a culture flask with a 125-cm2 growth area. Use F-12K medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and maintain the cells at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. Before the dissolution step, remove the medium from the culture flask.\n\tNOTE: Each cell line requires a particular preparation protocol for cell propagation. Consult the requirements with the cell line provider.\n3. Preparation of the Cells for the Experiment\nRemove the cell medium and wash the cells with ~ 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 5 mL of trypsin to the flask and return the cell culture flasks to the incubator for 3 to 5 min.\nAdd ~ 5 mL of F-12K medium to deactivate the trypsin.\nCount the cells using an automatic cell counter. Mix 10 µL of the cell solution with 10 µL of the stain solution. Mix well with the pipette and transfer 10 µL of the mixture into the chamber of a \"counting glass\".",
    "Remove and count the cells in the flask(s). Transfer the appropriate volumes containing the desired number of cells (e.g., 5 x 106 up to 108) into plastic vials.\nCentrifuge the cells at 1,200 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the cells in the F-12K medium containing 10% FCS to a total volume of 800 μL and transfer them into a reaction cup (2 mL). Place the reaction cup into a plastic vial filled with warm water.\n4. Dissolution Agent Preparation\nNOTE: The dissolution agent is a liquid that is used to dissolve the hyperpolarized sample. In biological applications, dissolution is usually performed with H2O-based or deuterium oxide (D2O)-based buffers, such as PBS or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), containing 1 g/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).\nPreparation of 20 mmol/L PBS buffer\n\t\nTo prepare 100 mL of the dissolution agent, dissolve 36 mg of monosodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), 247 mg of disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4), and 10 mg of EDTA in a solution of 20 mmol/L sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in D2O. Mix properly until complete dissolution.\n\t\tNOTE: EDTA (1 g/L) is added to the buffer to eliminate possible ferromagnetic ions, which can spoil the hyperpolarization. The NaOH is used to neutralize the pyruvic acid in a 1:1 mol ratio to reach a pH of 7.4.\n5. Variable Temperature Insert (VTI) Cooldown\nIn the DNP-NMR polarizer program main window, click on \"Cooldown.\"",
    "NOTE: This switches on the vacuum pump and evacuates the VTI to approximately 5.0 mbar. Subsequently, the needle valve between the VTI and the liquid helium reservoir fully opens, allowing liquid helium to flow into the VTI. The flow rate is regulated by the needle valve to maintain the optimal amount of liquid helium in the VTI until it reaches the helium boiling temperature. Then, the VTI is evacuated to almost complete vacuum, and the temperature reaches approximately 1.4 K. The VTI is filled with liquid helium up to 65%. At this point, the instrument is ready for sample insertion.\n6. Sample Preparation and Insertion\nUsing a micropipette, add ~ 8 µL of 13C-labeled sample stock solution into a plastic cup.\nAttach the plastic cup to the insertion rod and initiate the sample insertion process by pressing \"Insert sample\" in the main program window. Select \"Normal sample\" and click \"Continue.\"\n\tNOTE: During this process, the needle valve first closes to discontinue the flow of liquid helium into VTI, and the pressure in the VTI then increases. The sample holder inside the VTI is raised from the liquid helium, the inlet valve at the top of the VTI opens, and a gaseous helium flow is introduced from the inlet valve to prevent outside contamination by air moisture.\nWhen prompted, push the insertion rod with the attached plastic cup down into the VTI. Make sure to reach the sample holder at the bottom of the VTI. Otherwise, the gaseous helium can push the sample out of the VTI.\nDetach and remove the insertion rod.\nFinish the procedure by clicking \"Next\" in the dialog window. The sample insertion procedure should not take longer than 10 s.",
    "NOTE: The inlet valve then closes, the gaseous helium flow is discontinued, the sample holder with the sample cup is submerged into liquid helium, and the needle valve is opened to allow the liquid helium to flow into the VTI. After 5 - 10 min, the VTI is cooled below 1.4 K, allowing all of the free electrons to be polarized.\nConfirm that the plastic cup with the sample was introduced correctly into the VTI by checking that it is not attached to the insertion rod or pushed out from the VTI by helium gas. Then click \"Finish.\"\n7. Microwave Sweep (optional)\nNOTE: A microwave sweep allows the determination of the optimal microwave frequency to maximize the hyperpolarization rate of the 13C nuclei in the target compound.\nTo measure the microwave sweep, start the RINMR program, type \"HYPERSENSENMR,\" and click \"Select Config\" and \"Do Microsweep.\"\nTo initiate the process, select the \"calibrate\" tab on the main program window.\nClick \"Generate\" and choose the beginning and ending frequency (e.g., 94.100 GHz-94.200 GHz), the frequency step size (e.g., 20 MHz), the power (100 mW), and the time (60 s). Click \"Continue,\" \"Enable,\" and \"Start.\"\n\tNOTE: With these settings, the hyperpolarizer first polarizes the sample for 60 s using a microwave frequency of 94.100 GHz and a power of 100 mW. Then, it applies a 90° radio-frequency (RF) pulse and acquires the hyperpolarized 13C signal using the built-in spectrometer. These steps are repeated for each step in specified frequency range. For subsequent hyperpolarization, choose the microwave frequency with the maximal signal amplitude measured.\n8. Polarization\nTo measure the polarization build-up, start the RINMR program, type \"HYPERSENSENMR,\" and click \"Select Config\" and \"Solid Build-up.\"\nIn the DNP-NMR polarizer program main window, click \"Polarization\" to initiate the hyperpolarization process.",
    "Choose the optimal microwave frequency (obtained during the microwave sweep) and the power (e.g., 100 mW) for the sample and click \"Next.\"\nEnable \"Polarization build-up monitoring\" and click \"Finish.\"\nPolarize the sample to > 95% (~ 60 min for [1-13C]pyruvate).\n\tNOTE: During the polarization, microwaves are guided into the VTI and to the sample, causing the 13C spins to align with the hyperpolarized unpaired electron spins. To measure the hyperpolarization buildup, RF pulses with a flip angle (FA) of 5° are applied periodically (e.g., every 300 s), and the resulting signal is plotted as a polarization build-up curve.\n9. Dissolution\nWhen the polarization reaches > 95%, initiate the dissolution process by clicking \"Dissolution\" in the DNP-NMR polarizer program main window.\nChoose the dissolution process from the drop-down menu and click \"Next.\"\n\tNOTE: The polarizer allows one to define the desired dissolution process by choosing the timing of the chasing gas.\nLoad ~ 5 mL of the dissolution agent through the top valve into a heated vessel in the dissolution part of the polarizer. Calculate the exact volume of the dissolution agent needed using following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54751/54751eq1.jpg\n\twhere VDA is the wanted volume of dissolution agent, mPA, mOX063, and mGad are the masses of the pyruvate, OX063 and gadoterate meglumine, respectively, added to the sample stock solution.\nPlace the dissolution stick in the active position above the inlet valve.\n\tNOTE: This allows the instrument to connect its dissolution instrumentation to the sample cup in the VTI.\nClick \"Finish\" to start the dissolution process.",
    "NOTE: The dissolution agent is pressurized to 3 bar by helium gas and is subsequently heated up to 200 °C, causing an increase in pressure. When the pressure reaches 10 bar, the needle valve closes to discontinue the flow of liquid helium into the VTI. The sample holder raises the cup from the liquid helium. The dissolution stick is lowered into the VTI and connected to the sample cup. The conditioned dissolution agent is pushed by the pressure, which results from the heating vessel containing the dissolution buffer and helium gas, through the dissolution stick to the cup, causing a rapid dissolution of the sample. The solution then flows out into the collection flask via plastic tubing. The dissolution stick with the attached cup is then raised from the VTI.\nMove the dissolution stick with the attached cup to the \"cleaning\" position and finish the process by clicking \"Finish.\"\n10. Detection of the 13C Hyperpolarized Signal\n13C metabolic magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vitro\nMix 200 µL of the 20-mmol/L dissolved hyperpolarized sample from the collection flask with 800 µL of the cell solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting final concentration of [1-13C]pyruvate is 4 mmol/L.\nMix the suspension well using a micropipette and transfer ~ 600 µL into a 5-mm NMR tube.\nInsert the 5-mm NMR tube into the 1-T NMR spectrometer. In the main window of the software, click \"Run\" to start the measurement, applying series of one hundred 10° RF pulses every 3 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Measure the time between the initial mixing of the hyperpolarized sample with the cells and the start of the spectroscopic acquisition. Ensure that the mixing procedure does not exceed 30 s to minimize polarization loss.\n13C metabolic magnetic resonance imaging",
    "To build a container for the in vitro experiments using the MRI spectrometer, take a 5-mL syringe and connect it to a catheter (d = 1.2 mm) that is long enough to reach from the spectrometer's iso-center to the approachable area of the spectrometer.\nFill the in vitro container with the cell solution of the desired concentration for the experiment (e.g., 108) or with an enzymatic solution.\nPlace an in vitro container at the isocenter of the MRI magnet. Place a 13C-tuned radio frequency receiver coil on the container. Place a concentrated 13C-labeled calibration phantom (e.g., 10-mol/L 13C-urea) nearby.\nInsert the \"in vitro container\" near the iso-center of the NMR scanner.\nRun the scanner's standard 3-plane localization sequence and adjust the in vitro container's position to the iso-center, as needed.\nRun a 1H T2-weighted \"anatomical\" sequence covering the in vitro container localization. Use the following settings: 2D spin echo with axial orientation, repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms, echo time (TE) = 20 ms, slice thickness = 1 mm, field of view covering the in vitro container, and 16 echoes per excitation. Ensure that field shimming is done on protons during this step.\nIn the anatomical images, select 5 contiguous slices centered on the region of interest. Prescribe a 13C spectroscopic calibration acquisition covering the selected anatomical slices. Use the following settings: 2D Block-Siegert calibration sequence with axial orientation 12 x 12 centric encoded, TR = 1,000 ms, slice thickness = 5 mm, field of view matching anatomical images, number of scans (NS) = 64, bandwidth = 5,000 Hz, and FA = 90°.",
    "Select the 13C spectroscopic calibration sequence (for more information, see Schulte et al. 2011)75 from the pulse sequence library. Download the pulse sequence to the scanner from the computer by clicking \"Download.\" Click on \"Spectra Prescan\" to run the spectroscopic prescan. In the spectrum magnitude plot, adjust the peak from the 13C calibration phantom to the center of the scanner frequency. Set the receiver gains to the maximum. Click \"Start\" to run the 13C spectroscopic calibration sequence. Note the reported transmit gain and centric frequency.\nSet a 13C chemical shift imaging (CSI) acquisition covering the selected anatomical slices. Use the following settings: 2D echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) with axial orientation 12 x 12 centric encoded, TR = 400 ms, slice thickness = 5 mm, field of view matching anatomical images, NS = 300, and bandwidth = 5,000 Hz.\n\t\tNOTE: EPSI samples a single line in k-space repeatedly after one RF excitation to acquire both spatial and spectral information simultaneously. For more information about the acquisition techniques, see the article by Durst et al. 201576.\nDownload the 13C CSI sequence and run the spectroscopic prescan. Adjust the scanner frequency and transmit the gain as specified by the calibration sequence output.\nAfter the hyperpolarized solution is deposited in the collection flask, draw up ~ 3 mL into a syringe and then inject it into the catheter connected to the in vitro container. Start the acquisition. After the acquisition is complete, save the raw data file for subsequent reconstruction.\n11. Data Reconstruction\nApply one of the two described kinetic models to analyze the acquired data.\n\t\nIn the first method for describing the LDH kinetics, kinetic value (k), compare the sum of the lactate signal (MLAC) to the signal of all hyperpolarized molecules (Mx)21,77.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54751/54751eq2.jpg",
    "In the other method, measure the lactate and pyruvate signals over time and fit these to a kinetic model17,25,71. To solve the metabolic exchange rate, kPA→LAC, and the effective signal decay rate of lactate, rLAC, use the following linear differential equations using the two-site exchange differential model, yielding for lactate:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54751/54751eq3.jpg\nNote: The effective lactate signal decay rate rLAC is dependent upon the lactate longitudinal relaxation time (T1,LAC), the opposite metabolic exchange rate from lactate to pyruvate kLAC→PA, the applied FA and TR, and the signal intensity of pyruvate (MPA) and lactate (MLAC), taking into account the irreversible signal reduction after each successive excitation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54751/54751eq4.jpg\nTherefore, rLAC results in a single, inseparable term of signal decay. Since it is possible to correct for the flip angle and the repetition time, and even though there is a flux LAC→PA, we assume that the exchange rate from lactate to pyruvate (kLAC→PA) does not need to be included in the calculation, based on the results of Harrison et al. 201278. Their results show that the kLAC→PA does not play as crucial a role as one would assume. This mode allows the T1 relaxation time of lactate to be quantified. This model is independent of pyruvate administration to the measurement, which, in the case of in vitro experiments, is not crucial and can be neglected. It does, however, play an important role for in vivo measurements79.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
