    "Construct of anti-VEGF Fab expressing plasmids and transformation of E. coli host strainNotes: According to the Tm of the primers and the polymerases, set appropriate PCR reaction conditions, and select proper restriction enzymes depending on the restriction sites of the plasmids. The DNA sequence can be amplified from a template or synthesized by companies such as General Biosystems (Chuzhou, Anhui, China) we used. The backbone plasmid pPhoA can be derived from commercial plasmids such as pRSF-Duet by inserting dual phoA promoters followed by STII signal peptides. The transformation approach adapts to all the transformation mentioned in this protocol. According to the process shown in Figure 1, synthesize the entire DNA fragment encoding VL-CL, phoA promoter, STII peptide and VH-CH1 of anti-VEGF Fab expression cassette according to the published sequences. Analyze the sequences of backbone vector and Fab fragments to determine the sites for double restriction enzymes digestion and ligation. Note: If there are no appreciated sites, recombinase mediated homology infusion method can be used. Design the primers with the selected restriction enzymes using Primer 5.0 software. To simplify the insertion of Fab fragments into the vector, it’s optimal to synthesize STII-VL-CL-phoA-STII-VH-CH1 by a company (for example General Biosystems, Chuzhou, Anhui, China).Note: To insert the target fragment into the backbone vector, we firstly determined the restriction enzymes to produce pairing sticky ends. We chose Nde I which holds the translational starting codon ATG as the upstream site. For the downstream site, it’s fine to choose any one listed in the multiple clone sites of the vector. In our study, we chose Bgl II, and the vector could be digested by Nde I and Bgl II to get the linear backbone.",
    "However, the target fragment is rather long (about 2 kb), and there are another two Bgl II sites, making it impossible to digest the target fragment with Bgl II. Therefore, we used Bsa I enzyme and designed its sticky ends the same with that of Bgl II. Then we designed the forward primer with an Nde I site and the reverse primer with a Bsa I site to amplify the fragment from the synthesized template. Finally the Nde I and Bsa I enzymes digested fragment was ligated with the Nde I and Bgl II enzymes digested backbone to construct the recombinant plasmid expressing anti-VEGF Fab.

    "jpgSet the PCR program to be: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 54 °C for 5 s and extension at 72 °C for 30 s and together for 35 cycles. The primers were listed in Table 1.Use 1% DNA agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer (Recipe 4) to verify the PCR products.The remaining of the clones with positive PCR fragments were further cultured in LB broth for sequencing to confirm the correct insertion of desired Fab sequences. Confirm the correct insertion of STII-VL-CL-phoA-STII- VH-CH1 fragments by sequencing, and get the recombinant pPhoA-Fab plasmid as shown in Figure 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917195140_8604.jpgFigure 1. Construction process of pPhoA-Fab plasmid. STII-VL-CL-phoA-STII- VH-CH1 fragment was synthesized, PCR amplified, digested by Nde I and Bsa I, and ligated with backbone vector digested by Nde I and Bgl II, to obtain the recombinant plasmid pPhoA-Fab.Culture the DH5α clone that sequenced to be with the correct insert overnight to extract recombinant plasmid pPhoA-Fab as shown in Figure 1 by the AxyPrepTM Plasmid Miniprep Kit.Using the constructed pPhoA-Fab to further transform BL21 (DE3) using the same heat shock procedures (Steps A6e to A6l), and the successfully transformed clone is used as the expression host strain for anti-VEGF Fab expression.Make the transformed bacteria DH5α and BL21 (DE3) aliquots, add glycerol to a final concentration of 20% and store at -80°C for future use.Extracellular expression of anti-VEGF FabTake a vial of BL21 (DE3) containing pPhoA-Fab from -80 °C, put it on ice for 5 min.Transfer the thawed BL21 (DE3) to an LB agar plate (containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin) using inoculating loop, incubate at 37 °C overnight.Pick a single clone from the LB plate, and inoculate it into a tube containing 5 ml of LB broth (containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin).",
    "Notes: It takes about 12-14 h for preculture, so it’s best to carry out this step in the evening to ensure using fresh E.coli to inoculate.  The ingredients of LB media of various brands are consistent, so any qualified brand of LB medium can be used. Culture the bacteria in the tube in a shaking incubator at 37 °C, 220 rpm for about 12-14 h. No more than 16 h.Inoculate 5 ml culture into 800 ml of fresh LB broth containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Note: Use a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. The LB medium volume should not occupy over 40% of the full capacity of the container. Culture the bacteria at 37 °C, 220 rpm until OD600 reaches 0.8-1.0.Transfer the bacteria to a sterilized 250 ml centrifuge bottles to pellet the bacteria at room temperature by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 min. Note: This step should be performed in the clean bench. Discard the supernatant, re-suspend the bacterial pellet with 800 ml sterilized PLM medium. Note: PLM medium is chemically modified and contains no phosphate. This step should be performed in the clean bench. Here take 1 ml of culture for analysis, marked as ‘Pre’.  Incubate the bacteria in PLM medium overnight at a temperature of 20 °C with a shaking speed of 200 rpm for about 12-14 h. The absence of phosphate in PLM medium promotes protein induction.After induction, quickly raise the incubation temperature to 59 °C in the water bath and incubate for 1 h to improve Fab yields. Note: This step can improve the extracellular yield for some level, it is also OK to skip it.",
    "Then, quickly cool down the culture to room temperature in a water bath and centrifuge at 3,500 x g for 10 min to separate media and bacterial pellet, the expressed anti-VEGF Fab should mostly remain in the medium. Collect the culture medium and further centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min to further remove the contaminants.Note: Immediately before centrifugation, take 2 aliquots of culture for analysis, 1 ml for each, marked as ‘Ind’.Purification of anti-VEGF FabNotes:The Capto L binds to kappa light chains of type I, III, and IV of human IgG but not type II.  KappaSelect resin can be used to purify protein with a type II IgG kappa light chain. The purification process is similar to that of Capto L, but using PBS buffer of pH 7.4 as Buffer A, and 0.1 M glycine buffer of pH 2.7 as Buffer B. Filter the expression medium through a 0.22 μm filter for subsequent column chromatography purification steps.Prepare AKTA Avant 150 by washing the A, B pumps and tubes with 20% ethanol at 2 ml/min until the UV280 reaches baseline. Assemble the prepacked Capto L column with a column volume (CV) of 1 ml at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and continue to wash the system with 20% ethanol at 2 ml/min until the UV 280 nm and Cond baselines are stable.Then, repeat the washing with ddH2O with the same procedure until the UV 280 nm and Cond baselines are stable.Place the B1 tube head in Buffer B and fill the tube with Buffer B.Place the A1 tube head in Buffer A, and equilibrate the system and column for 10-20 CV until the UV 280 nm and Cond reach baseline.Load the sample onto the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min while collecting flow through.",
    "Note: Collect 1 ml of flow through for analysis, marked as ‘FL’. After loading, wash the column with Buffer A until the UV 280 nm reaches the baseline. Set the B pump solution ratio to 100%, elute the target protein by Buffer B with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and collect the target protein when there are UV280 peaks.Immediately adjust the pH of the collected sample with 1 M Tris buffer (pH 9.0) to prevent protein inactivation. Note: Take eluted protein samples for analysis, marked as ‘E’. After the baseline of the elution is stable, flush the tubing with 10 to 20 CV ddH2O until the baselines of UV and Cond are stable. Then, rinse the tubing and column with 15 mM NaOH to clean the column. After the UV280 baseline is stabilized, wash the system, column, and tubes with ddH2O and 20% ethanol successively. Finally, fill the pipeline with 20% ethanol and disassemble the pre-packed column, which should also be kept in 20% ethanol. Test the collected protein by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (WB).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917195214_2414.jpgFigure 2.
