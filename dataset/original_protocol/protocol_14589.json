    "Note: After a patient met all inclusion criteria and was carefully evaluated by a medical oncologist, surgeon and anaesthesiologist, a patient was included in the study. All patients provided written informed consent. Both clinical studies were approved by the Local Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Centre and are performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration.\n1. Pre-procedural Angiography by Interventional Radiologist\nIn preparation for the PHP procedure, perform a pre-procedural angiography20 several days prior to PHP for arterial anatomy mapping. During this procedure perform angiography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), coeliac trunk and hepatic arteries.21\nDuring the angiography, use contrast agent using a pump injector into the common hepatic artery and lobar arteries using a 2.4F or 2.7F microcatheter. (Material list, item 7).\nInject 15 ml of non-diluted contrast (iopromide 300) (Material List, item 14) at a rate of 5ml/sec for angiography from the common hepatic artery and 12 ml at 3ml/sec for lobar injections.21\nDelineate the hepatic vascular anatomy and the vascular tumor supply by injecting contrast as described in step 1.1.2.21\nDetermine the risk of reflux of the chemotherapeutic agent to hepatico-enteric anastomosis (such as the gastroduodenal or right gastric artery).21 Identify vascular variants, such as an aberrant right or left hepatic artery.21\nIn case of a possible risk of reflux, if there is less than ~1 cm of proper hepatic artery distal to the gastroduodenal artery (GDA), embolize this artery with detachable microcoils or vascular plug (Material List, item 15 and 16). Also embolize other gastro- and/or enteric anastomoses to prevent flow of chemotheraputic drugs to other structures.21\nEmbolize arterial branches distal of the site of infusion with vascular supply to the stomach, pancreas and intestines of diaphragm.21\n2. PHP Procedure I: Preparation and Creating a Perfusion Circuit",
    "Preparation by Extra Corporeal Perfusionist (ECP)\n\t\nCollect the chemosaturation tubingpack, chemofilters and the centrifugal pump. (Material List, items 1b and 12) These items are packed in the box provided by the manufacturer.\nFlush the complete extracorporeal circuit with CO2 gas.\nPrime the circuit with NaCl 0.9% and heparin (2,000 IU/L) including the filters.\n\t\t\nRinse the extracorporeal system with 6 L of heparinized 0.9% NaCl, initially by means of the force of gravity as a primeline is already present in the system. After the carbon filters are fully hydrated, use the centrifugal pump to put more pressure on the filters, in order to remove the remaining gas bubbles.\n\t\t\tNote: A little hammer can be used to remove gas bubbles by vibration and resonance.\n\t\t\t\nPrime double balloon catheter line and bypass line.\nPrime left chemofilter (with 1 L) and de-bubble, then prime right chemofilter (with 1 L) and de-bubble.\nHydrate chemofilters (3 L per cartridge) after initial priming of the system slowly. This can take 10-20 min per chemofilter.\nPrime bubble trap (arterial filter).\nCheck and calibrate the flow sensor and pressure monitors, as programmed in the centrifugal pump software menu, according to manufacturer's instructions.\nPatient Preparation on Angiography Room by Anaesthesiologist\n\t\nSet up the required monitoring for anaesthetic management:\n\t\t\nPlace a blood pressure band for non-invasive blood pressure measuring ECG electrodes on patient's chest for ECG monitoring as well as SaO2 monitoring.\nPlace a Bispectral Index Scale (BIS) sensor on patient's forehead to measure the patient's depth of anaesthesia, in this case the anesthesiologist is used to working with this.\nSet up ventilation equipment according to manufacturer's instructions, including ET-CO2  via the ventilation machine and endotracheal tube. Place the ventilation machine on the opposite side of the patient of where the IR is standing, as instructed by the manufacturer.",
    "Place the patient on angiography room table and directly cover the patient with a warm air blanket to mantain normothermia.\nPlace a peripheral venous access in a right arm vein for administration of i.v. anaesthetics and i.v. fluids.\nInduce anaesthesia (with anaesthetics at the anaesthesiologist's preference), perform endotracheal intubation and start intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV).\nMaintain anaesthesia to a BIS = 50, MAP = 65 mmHg, normuria of 0.5 ml/kg/hr.\nPlace a nasopharyngeal body temperature thermometer.\nPlace Train of four (TOF) electrodes for neuromuscular blockade monitoring as described in manufacturer's instructions (at the anesthesiologist preference).\nSet up and prepare a rapid fluid management system/or fluid warmer (Material List, item 2) as described in manufacturer's instructions.\nTurn on the advanced monitor screen (Material List, item 4) and connect all cables.\nInsert a 22 G arterial line into the left radial artery for mean arterial pressure (MAP) monitoring. (Material List, item 3).\nPlace a central venous line for central venous pressure measurement in the left internal jugular vein.\nInsert a urinary bladder catheter.\nMaintain normothermia by warm air blankets and warm intravenous fluids.\nMonitor CVP and intra-arterial blood pressure using an advanced monitor (Material List, item 4) throughout the procedure.\nDetermine a baseline activated clotting time (ACT) by drawing a blood sample and placing it in the ACT meter.\nIn addition, at induction administer intravenous cefazolin 1 g, pantoprazol 40 mg and hydrocortisone 300 mg.\nPreparation by the Pharmacist\n\t\nReconstitute melphalan (3.0 mg/kg body weight (maximal dose 220 mg) (Material List, item 9)) by rapidly injecting 10 ml of the supplied diluent directly into the vial of lyophilized powder using a sterile needle (20 G or larger needle diameter) and syringe.\nImmediately shake vial vigorously until a clear solution is obtained. This provides a 5 mg/ml solution of melphalan.",
    "Immediately dilute the dose to be administered in NaCl 0.9% injection, USP, to a concentration not greater than 0.45 mg/ml.\nComplete administration within 60 min of reconstitution.\nPreparation on Angiography Room by Interventional Radiologist (IR)\n\t\nLay out the necessary tools and supplies (sterile) at a table. (Materials List, items 1a,3,5,6,7,8,11).\nCover the patient with sterile sheets.\nPlacement of the Sheaths by IR\n\t\nUse ultrasound guidance for the placement of sheaths in the internal jugular veins (IJV) both left and right.\nPlace a 7.5F triple lumen intravenous catheter, 20 cm (Material List, item 5) in the left IJV. This sheath is used by the anaesthesiologist for CVP measurement and infusion of sympathomimetic drugs.\nPlace a 10F venous return catheter (Material List, Item 1a) in the right IJV. This sheath is used for the venous return of the filtered blood after extracorporeal chemofiltration.\nPlace a 5F sheath into the left common femoral artery (CFA) (Material List, Item 6).\n\t\tNote: This sheath is used for the coaxially placed microcatheter to infuse the chemotherapeutic agent.\nPlace an 18F sheath into the right common femoral vein (CFV) (Material List, Item 8) after serial dilation with 8-10F and 12-14F dilators. Use the dilators to adjust the insertion opening to the right size to eventually properly place the 18F sheath. Note: This sheath is used to introduce the double balloon catheter (Isolation Aspiration Catheter).\nIsolation of the Hepatic Vein and Creating a Circuit Outside the Body\n\t\nAdminister heparin after all sheaths have been placed; at an initial dose of 300 IU/kg (Material List, item 11).\nMaintain the activated clotting time (ACT) above 50 sec during the entire procedure with additional heparin bolus doses as required.",
    "Start norepinephrine (50 ml 0.2mg/ml) 0.1-2 µg/kg/min and phenylephrine (50 ml 0.1mg/ml) 0.1-2 µg/kg/min and fluid administration (500 ml of crystalloids) to maintain hemodynamic parameters close to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg, and urine output of 0.5 ml/kg/hr.\nThrough the 5F sheath in the left common femoral artery, introduce the 2.7F microcatheter (Material List, Item 7) co-axially and place it in the proper hepatic artery or lobar arteries using angiography monitoring.\nThrough the 18F sheath in the right common femoral vein, introduce the 16F double balloon catheter (Isolation Aspiration Catheter) and place it with the tip in the right atrium using angiography monitoring.\nDirectly after the placement of the catheters, attach these to the extracorporeal system using the special connection points; the venous return line to the sheath in the IJV and the outflow lines to the isolation catheter.\nStart the centrifugal pump as described by the manufacturer:\n\t\tNote: All lines are open now and flow is running over bypass line.\nAfter intravenous infusion of 0.5 L colloid solution (Material List, Item 13), inflate the cranial balloon with a 50% saline and 50% contrast media mixture.\nWith the caudal balloon still deflated, slowly retract the double balloon catheter until the cranial balloon is at the junction of the right atrium and the inferior caval vein (IVC), just above the right hepatic vein (the balloon is now wedge-shaped, as illustrated in Figure 2).\nInflate the caudal balloon with a mixture of 90% saline and 10% contrast media until lateral edges of the inflated balloon start to become effaced by the IVC.",
    "Note: Balloons are inflated with different mixtures of contrast media. The caudal balloon is inflated to obstruct the inferior vena cava above the renal veins, so that hepatic venous outflow is isolated from systemic venous circulation. A volume of maximal 38 ml may be injected into each balloon.\nCheck positioning of the balloons and rule out leakage with venography\n\t\t\nPerform venography by injecting 20 ml of contrast (i.e., iopromide 300) through the fenestration port of the double balloon venous double balloon catheter using a hand injection.\nIf contrast leakage is seen, reposition the balloons or further inflate the balloons and repeat the venography as described in step 2.6.11.1 (See Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53795/53795fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Per-procedural angiogram. Venous double balloon catheter in the inferior caval vein and arterial infusion catheter in the proper hepatic artery.

Ensure that the two chemofilters are closed at this moment in time, while the bypass is open.\nTry to accomplish sufficient flow (Q = 400-500 ml/min) with safe pressures proximal (in general <-70 mmHg) and distal (<100 mmHg) of the centrifugal pump (Material List, item 12).\nTitrate norepinephrine 0.1-2 µg/kg/min and phenylephrine 0.1-2 µg/kg/min and fluid administration to maintain a systolic BP of 160 mmHg, and urine output of 0.5 ml/kg/hr.\nWhen sufficient flows and pressures are reached, open the filters one by one.",
    "Note: Passage of blood though the filters will hemofiltrate the blood and remove the majority of the chemotherapeutic agent. Hemofiltration occurs throughout the procedure as well as in the 'washout' period directly following the chemotherapy-infusion period. During this washout period, chemotherapeutic agent that returns from the liver tissue, is 'washed out' from the circulation.\nWhen a systolic BP between 140-160 mmHg has been reached, close the bypass line.\n\t\tNote: The anaesthesiologist should be prepared to encounter a drop in blood pressure resulting from the reduction in preload due to caval vein occlusion, peripheral vasodilation from passage of blood through the chemofilters removal of vasoactive agents (e.g., norepinephrine and phenylephrine) by the chemofilters and possibly the vasodilative effects of endogenous NO production. Adjust infusion rates of norepinephrine and phenylephrine accordingly maintaining a MAP of 65 mmHg.\nCheck positioning of the double balloon catheter by performing a venography (as described in step 2.6.11.1).\nPerform an angiogram by injecting contrast (iopromide 300) through the microcatheter in the hepatic artery to rule out arterial spasm. If spasm is seen, administer 100-200 micrograms of nitroglycerine into the hepatic artery (as also described in step 1.1 and sub-steps).\n \n3. PHP Procedure II: Infusion of Chemotherapy and Washout Period\nInfusion of Melphalan\n\tNote: After the placement of the delivery system circuit, infusion of melphalan into the hepatic artery is started through the microcatheter.\n\t\nWhen a steady flow rate is established, no leakage is present and the patient's blood pressure is stable, inject melphalan at a dose of 3 mg/kg into the proper hepatic artery or sequentially into both lobar arteries.\n\t\t\nDo not start chemotherapy infusion until the MAP is above 65 mmHg.",
    "Inject the drug in doses of 100 ml using an auto-injector at a rate of 0.4 cc/sec, for approximately 30 min, until the complete dose is injected.\nDuring infusion, at regular intervals, perform an arteriogram to monitor the occurrence of vasospasm and the position and check inflation of the double balloon catheter with contrast flushing. (See step 2.6.11.1 (venography) and 1.1 and 2.7.9 (angiography) for information on the contrast agent).\nIn case of vasospasm, administer nitro-glycerine (100-200 µg).\nAfter the 30 min of chemotherapeutics infusion, continue hemofiltration for an additional 30 min washout period (See Note at step 2.7.5).\nAdminister 10 mg of i.v. morphine for postoperative pain control.\nAfter the washout period slowly deflate the two balloons in the caval vein.\n \nEnd of the Infusion and Removal of the Catheters\n\t\nAt the end of the washout period, empty the extracorporeal circuit as much as possible and then stop the extracorporeal perfusion.\nStop the centrifugal pump and disconnect the tubes.\nRemove the double balloon catheter and the infusion microcatheter, but leave the access sheaths in place until the coagulation is normalized. A vascular closure device may be placed in the common femoral artery to achieve haemostasis.\nKeep the return catheter in the right IJV in place until coagulation profile is normalized.\nKeep the 7.5F triple lumen intravenous catheter in the left IJV in place for this can be used at the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU).\n \nEnd of Anaesthesia and Heparinization\n\tNote: Perform the following steps at the end of the procedure, when the auto-transfusion is finished.\n\t\nClose and remove the bypass circuit.\nStop the infusion of norepinephrine and phenylephrine immediately after double balloon deflation. This is possible due to the return of sufficient preload to the right heart and the termination of the chemofiltration.",
    "Normalize coagulation with protamine (1:1), fresh frozen plasma and/or cryoprecipitate with or without transfusion of thrombocytes. Check ACT afterwards.\nAfter hemodynamic stabilization and termination of norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusion, terminate the anesthetic maintenance medication.\nAfter the patient has returned to spontaneous ventilation and consciousness, extubate the trachea of the patient.\nTransfer the patient to the PACU for 24 hr of monitoring of vital functions (blood pressure and coagulation parameters).\nRemove the vascular sheath once the platelet count >50 x 109/L, APTT <1.5 x normal, and the INR <1.5. Apply manual compression to achieve haemostasis and apply a pressure bandage over both groins.\n \nPostoperative Care\n\t\nMonitor patients at the PACU for the first 24 hr after the procedure.\nCheck hemostasis site of catheter insertion and monitor pulse, blood pressure, temperature, ventilation, fluid balance and pain scores as well as coagulation.\nTransfer the patient to the postoperative ward for 1-2 days.\nDischarge the patient at postoperative day 2 of 3, after a final haematology and chemistry blood test. Check for hepatotoxicity and create a baseline for follow-up on toxicity - prothrombin time (PT) within 2 sec of upper limit of normal, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time(APTT) within normal range, platelets >75,000/mm3 without platelet transfusion or >100,000/mm3 with transfusion, haemoglobin >10 g/dl (>6.2 mmol/L) and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) returned to within 10% of baseline levels.\nAdminister colony stimulating growth factor support (pegfilgastrim, 0.6 ml disposable syringe) upon discharge or within 48 hr after the PHP treatment.\n \nSubscription Required.
