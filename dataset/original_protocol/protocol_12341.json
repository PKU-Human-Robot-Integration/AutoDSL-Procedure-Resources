    "All procedures described must be performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations for the use of vertebrate animals, including prior approval by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of Dissecting Instruments and Culture Media\nPrewash all instruments to be used in dissection with 3% hydrogen peroxide and then autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min. Filter BGJb media with antibiotic and antimycotic solution using a 0.22 µm pore-sized filter with vacuum suction in a hood.\n2. Preparation of Culture Equipment\nCut polycarbonate membrane filters that will support the palatal organs in small triangles, spray with 70% alcohol and allow them to dry. Prepare Center-Well Organ Culture Dish (60x15 mm) by placing a clean and sterilized equilateral triangular-shaped wire grid (20 mm) over the organ culture plate. Then fill the well with 1 ml of BGJb media culture media.  NOTE: The media should be sufficient to reach the level of the grid without submerging the palates. Place the membrane filters, shiny side down, on top of the grid (3-4 membranes per grid).Depending on the experiment, treatment (proteins, antibodies or inhibitors) can be added to the media\n3. Mouse Embryo Collection and Preparation for Culture\nTo obtain wild type mouse embryos, use timed 13.5 pregnant CD-1 mouse genetic background strain. Clean the dissection area with 70% ethanol.  \n\tNOTE: Other strains of mice can be used. We prefer CD-1 mice because of the bigger litter number.\nEuthanize pregnant mice at E13.5 dpc (days post coitus) with 5% Isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation to insure death using approved protocols.",
    "Spray 70% ethanol on the ventral abdominal surface to avoid having the abdominal hair stick to the instruments. Then open the abdominal cavity ventrally using a sharp-blunt operating scissors and micro-dissecting forceps to locate the uterus. Using the forceps, lift the entire uterus and separate it from the body by cutting at the uterine body and at the tips of the uterine horns with a light operating scissors.\nPlace the uterus on a clean paper towel over ice (According to the protocol guide for care and use of laboratory animals). Cover the uterus with another clean paper towel to prevent contamination. Sterilize the instruments using 70% ethanol spray before further use. The uterus and the embryos can be transported to the laboratory on ice.\nIn an open laminar flow hood, carefully make a small opening in the yolk sac using sharp-blunt operating scissors and micro-dissecting forceps. Make the opening wider and then gently push it to exteriorize the embryo from the yolk sac.\nTransfer the embryos immediately to a Petri dish with cold phosphate-buffered Saline 1X (PBS) pH 7.4. To assure the proper stage, examine the embryo under a dissecting microscope for the body, head size and limb morphology.\n\tNOTE: Embryos that are not at the right stage of development are not used for the experiment.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53063/53063fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Limb Bud Morphology. The fore and hind limbs are checked for the degree of webbing indentation between the digits. At E13.5, all the digit condensations are prominent, with the webbing and distal indentations between digits appearing very distinct. The hind digits are behind by a half-day. 12 Upper row: forelimb, lower row: hind limb.\n4. Palate Dissection",
    "Place one embryo at a time in a petri dish with PBS under the dissecting microscope. Using small dissecting scissors and tweezers separate the head from the body of the embryos.\nCarefully holding the mouse cranium above eye level with forceps (avoiding the maxillary process) make two incisions on both sides of the lip line. Then remove the mandible and tongue. Isolate the maxillary process region by making a cut at eye level and remove the brain, eyes, nasal septum and adjoining tissue.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53063/53063fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.Palate tissue collected from 13.5 embryos, when the palate shelves had elevated but not made contact. The palatal shelves were placed in organ culture on a filter at the air media interface for 72 hr in the static model. (A) Level of dissection on E13.5 embryo. (B) Blue stars demarcate areas to hold the tissue with forceps during dissection. (C) View of dissected palatal shelves placed on a trapezoid filter membrane. (D) Side view of culture dish after placement of the dissected palates and addition of culture media.\nPlace the palatal oral side up and remove the nasal septum and the tissue around it, keeping the primary palate attached to help orient it from anterior to posterior. Use a spoon spatula and very carefully transfer the palatal shelves (nasal side down) to the prepared filters on the grids in the culture dishes.  NOTE: Adjust volume of media to allow proper air-media interface.\nUnder the stereo microscope, dissect the primary palate and use tweezers to place the palatal shelves close to each other. The palatal shelves will not fuse if they are not placed in contact. Cut the triangular membrane filter where the anterior part of the palate is located. The trapezoid shape will aid in localizing the anterior portion of the palate.",
    "Culture the palatal shelves individually or with two or three in the same organ culture dish using BGJb culture media.\n5. Culturing Mouse Palatal Shelves\nIncubate the tissues at 37 °C in a humidified gas mixture (5% CO2 and 95% air) for 72 hr, and change the medium every 24 hr.\n6. Palate Processing for Histological Analysis\nFix the palates after 72 hr in culture with 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline O/N at 4° C. Then, gently with a transfer pipette wash the tissue in the culture dish with PBS. Wrap the palates in a piece of laboratory wipes and place in embedding cassettes.  \n\tNOTE: Wrapping the palates in laboratory wipes prevent their loss during the dehydration process.\nDehydrate the tissue following 70%, 80% and up to 100% ethanol washes for 1 hr, followed by the regular paraffin embedding procedure. For embedding, place the anterior part of the palate facing the tray.\nCut Serial 6 µm sections in the coronal orientation from anterior to posterior. A complete section palate will yield 350-450 sections. Stain the sections with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).10 Score every 20th section using the previously described Mean Fusion Score (MFS) scale (Table 1). 8\nSubscription Required.
