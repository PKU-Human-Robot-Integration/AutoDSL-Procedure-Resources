Algal growth in BlueSens photobioreactors\n(A) Cells at the mid-log phase (∼5 μg Chl mL-1) were diluted into 950 mL TAP. Two outlets of the photobioreactors were capped with silicone sponge enclosures to allow air diffusion.\n(B) The cells were taken for further protocol steps after three days of growth under high white light (∼250 μmol m-2 s-1) at a Chlorophyll concentration of 15 μg mL-1.\nGrow the cells at 25°C under constant illumination (∼90 μmol m−2 s−1, cool white led strips; measure with photometer) and constant agitation (magnetic stirrers or vertical shaker).\nTo estimate the culture’s density, determine the chlorophyll (Chl) concentration according to (Jeffrey and Humphrey, 1975[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]):\nTake 1 mL from the culture and centrifuge for 2 min at max speed (14,000–16,000 g).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend with 1 mL 80% Acetone.\nIncubate at 4°C for 10 min and then centrifuge for 2 min at max speed (14,000–16,000 g). Keep the supernatant.\nSpectrophotometrically, measure the supernatant’s absorption (abs) at 663, 645 and 750 nm.\nPlace the reads in the following equation to extract the Chl concentration:\n  C h l  [  μg / mL  ]  = 6.43 ×  (  a b s   ( 664 )  − a b s   ( 750 )   )  + 18.07 ×  (  a b s   ( 647 )  − a b s   ( 750 )   )",
    "When reaching the mid-log phase, at approximately 5 μg Chl mL-1, dilute the cells into 950 mL TAP to receive a final volume of 1 L culture inside a 1.15 L PB (in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, an example of a 90 mm diameter PB).\nNote: Large volumes such as 1 L should be preferably mixed from this step on with a magnetic bar (2–3 cm) and a stirring device.\nPlace the PBs under high white light; ∼250 μmol m−2 s−1.\nNote: As a variable parameter, light intensity should be determined according to each strain of interest (lighting preferences or limitations, growth rates, etc.). In addition, technical specifications, such as the PB’s diameter (for the light path distance) and the light source heat output, should be taken into consideration.\nFor a 1 L assay, cells should be grown to at least 6–7 μg Chl mL-1 (usually within 48–72 h of growth after 50 mL dilution, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Based on the desired cell density for the H2-producing phase of the experiment, either return cells for further growth or continue.\nNote: A higher concentration of cells may allow higher light intensities because cells shadow one another. As a result, each cell can benefit from high amounts of photons for short periods of time, thereby avoiding photoinhibition. Higher light intensities promote higher photosynthetic activity and, therefore, higher yields of H2 production. The minimal cell density against each light intensity should be calibrated to prevent photoinhibition.\nReplenishment of acetate supply\nTiming: 10 min",
    "In this step, prior published protocols (Nagy et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Steinbeck et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) involved a centrifugation step followed by resuspension with either sulfur depleted TAP or fresh TAP. This was done both to keep the cells in an anaerobic state, maintained by sulfur deficiency, and in view of the fact that the culture consumed the growth medium’s nutrients, and therefore it was necessary to renew it. We discovered, however, that by adding glacial acetic acid as a carbon source, the culture maintains a healthy physiological profile and can also produce H2.\nAdd 1 mL of pure glacial acetic acid (>99%) into the PB to obtain a final concentration of 17.4 mM.\nNote: Depending on the initial pH of the culture, after the addition of acetic acid, the pH should drop in-between 5.5–6.\nNote: Before the H2 production phase, pH is elevated from 7.2 (during the growth phase) to 7.8 based on (Kosourov et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) findings, that higher pH is ideal for the activity of the H2 producing enzyme – hydrogenase, resulting in increasing yields of H2 photoproduction.\nUsing a pH meter or a pH-indicator strip, adjust the pH to 7.8 using NaOH 10 M, dropwise (roughly 1 mL).\nMake sure all outlets are hermetically closed to prevent air from entering. Ensure that one outlet is closed with a needle-permeable cap (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], black arrow).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1922-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. BluSens 1-L photobioreactor system – upper view\nThe PB is equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) for O2 and H2 (recorded by BlueVIS software, blue arrows) and multiple air outlets. All outlets are capped and sealed during the experiment, except for one outlet, which is connected to the gas flow counter (red arrow). At least one cap is needle permeable for the inert gas flush (black arrow).",
    "Note: Steps 7–9 should preferably be performed under sterile conditions (inside a biological hood). However, if this is impossible, it could be performed quickly in an unsterile working environment.\nSetting up your H2 measuring system\nTiming: 10 min\nOnce the PB has been hermetically enclosed, place it into the experimental setup. It is recommended to connect a continuously discharging one-way outlet, especially when measuring large volumes of culture. Commercial options, such as BlueVcount gas sensor (BlueSens), as well as self-built counters, as described in (Melis et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), can be used to count gas flow [mL]. From this point on, any changes in air pressure observed in the PB’s headspace result from an exchange of gases initiated by the culture. Higher air pressures from microalgae, for example, are most likely due to the production of oxygen (O2), H2, or CO2.\nThis step involves setting different experimental conditions, such as lighting, temperature, and stirring speed.\nAdjust the light intensity before the PBs are placed in the experiment position.\nNote: The setup should take into account the confluency of the culture, the light path length of the PB, and the physiological background of the strain tested.\nExample: For Chlamydomonas strain CC-5101 (known as t222+), a light intensity of 350 μmol m−2 s−1 can be used for a concentration of as little as 6 μg Chl mL−1 in a 90 mm diameter PB.\nShut down the light source and place the PBs into their experimental position.\nSet the magnetic stirring plate to 800 rpm.\nNote: It is recommended to use a hot magnet stirring plate.\nSet the temperature at 34°C (for room temperatures between 22°C–24°C). As the temperature rises, the H2 solubility decreases, and gas output increases.\nNote: Various algal strains may require calibration of this condition.",
    "Open one of the air outlets of the PB, and connect it to the gas flow discharger and counter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], red arrow).\nCaution: perform this step quickly to prevent contaminations.\nPromoting anaerobic conditions for ideal H2 production\nTiming: 2.5 h\nThe next steps involve an anaerobic induction, during a 2 h dark incubation, necessary to express and mature the H2 evolving enzyme hydrogenase (Grossman et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nFor about 1 min, inject into the headspace of the PB a constant stream of an inert gas through an inlet needle, such as Argon or Nitrogen. As a safety measure, inject an additional outlet needle along with the built-in gas discharger; gas flow should still be noticed on the gas flow counter. Replacing the composition of gases in the PB’s headspace with 100% inert gas will ensure that any change in air pressure after the experiment has begun is a consequence of a gas generated by the culture.\nCaution: Wear protective eyewear.\nNote: This step is not biologically mandatory. The inert gas flush helps removing O2 from the headspace. When this is done, for a 1 L culture, 2 h of dark incubation is sufficient to remove the necessary amount of O2 to induce Hydrogenase. If not, O2 will still be removed, however this will be exclusively by the cells mitochondrial respiration. Yet, this process might take longer than 2 h since the O2 from the headspace might extend the overall respiration time required. If a gas flush could not be performed due to technical limitations, the dark incubation period should be calibrated for each volume of PB and culture.\nWhen using a gas analyzer system such as BluVIS (BlueSens), monitor the O2 levels, and stop gas purging when O2 levels reach zero.",
    "Example: When working without an online gas monitor, for a headspace volume of 150 mL, 5–10 min of an inert gas flush are sufficient.\nReset the gas flow counter.\nAllow 2 h of dark incubation by turning off the surrounding lights in the room.\nWhen the dark incubation phase is complete, turn the lights back on (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). H2 production should be noticed within minutes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1922-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. H2 production in BluSens 1-L photobioreactors under continuous illumination\n(A and B) (A) After 10 min of inert gas flushing and 2 h of dark incubation, a continuous white light at 350 μmol m-2 s-1 is applied, and H2 production is observed (B) as bubbles on the culture surface within minutes.\nH2 quantification throughout the experiment\nWhen online analysis of the gas composition in the PB is unavailable, to confirm H2 as the sole contributor to the gas output, a continuous sampling from the headspace should be taken to a Gas Chromatograph (GC) for air composition analysis. This method is described by (Eilenberg et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nAdditionally, to an H2 gas accumulation data (in volume units), an absolute amount of H2 in μmol can be calculated:\nWhen H2 is recorded online as percentages, use the following conversion equation:\nBased on the equation of   P V = n R T  .\n  P  [  a t m  ]  × H e a d s p a c e  v o l .  [ L ]  = n × 0.082 × 297  [ K ]   .\nThe pressure is presented as the percentage of H2 in the air composition:\n  P  [  a t m  ]  ×  H 2   [ % ]  =  H 2  / 100 .",
    "Example: following 1 h of lighting, if the TCD detectors reported a 5% H2 in a 1 L BluSens photobioreactor headspace with a volume of 150 mL:\n   [ 5 ]  / 100 × 0.15  [ L ]  = n × 0.082 × 297  .\n  n =  H 2   [  m o l  ]  = 0.000308 = 308   H 2   [  μ m o l  ]  .  \nWhen H2 is recorded manually by gas chromatography, the percentage of H2 is demonstrated by the chromatograph area where H2 leaves the column. To convert the measurement of the area to nmol, a calibration curve of H2 should be generated, followed by a similar   P V = n R T   calculation.
