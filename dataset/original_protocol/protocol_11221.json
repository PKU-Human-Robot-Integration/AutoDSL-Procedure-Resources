    "These methods can be applied to both rat and mouse models and were performed with institutional approval (Kent State University, IACUC Approval #359 and #340 CN 12-04). Prior to the implementation of the protocol, animals should be housed in conformance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Preparing the transponder reader\nNOTE: Prior to use, the transponder reader must be set; the following steps only include the setting changes necessary for this study. This portion of the protocol is directly associated with the DAS-8027-IUS portable readers; other reader models should follow instructions provided by the manual to achieve programming results.\nSet Audio Beep to OFF.\n\t\nTurn on the device by pressing the SCAN button and wait for the lighting to appear on the OLED display. Press and hold the BACK/MENU button to get to the menu screen.\nUsing the NEXT/ENTER button, scroll through the options until OPERATIONAL SETUP. Here, toggle the up or down arrows to turn YES and open the operational submenu.\nUsing the NEXT/ENTER button, scroll to AUDIO BEEP. As the default setting is ON, toggle the up or down arrows and change the setting to OFF.\nPress the NEXT/ENTER button to save this setting change.\nSet Vibrate Upon Read to ON.\n\t\nFollow step 1.1 through step 1.2 or complete the next step directly after step 1.4.\nUsing the NEXT/ENTER button, scroll to VIBRATE UPON READ. As the default setting is OFF, toggle the up and down arrows and change the setting to ON to feel, via vibration, when the reading has been completed regardless of being able to view the screen.\n2. Program transponders",
    "NOTE: Each implanted transponder should first be programmed with an animal identification (animal ID or transponder ID). This nomenclature can be used as secondary identification for the test subject (e.g., four digits for mouse strain abbreviation, location of transponder, and an additional three to four digits to indicate animal number). Programming can be completed days in advance of surgery while keeping the transponders sterile prior to surgery.\nEnter the ID Code on the transponder.\n\t\nApply a booster coil to the reader head—a specific accessory for model DAS 8027-IUS, which helps in the programming procedure.\nUsing a gloved hand, place the transponder (within the applicator) into the booster coil.\nTurn on the device by pressing the SCAN button and wait for the OLED display to light up. Press and hold the BACK/MENU button to get to the menu screen.\nUsing the NEXT/ENTER button, scroll through the options until WRITE TRANSPONDER ID. Here, toggle the up or down arrows to turn YES.\nUsing the NEXT/ENTER button, toggle to ENTER ID CODE.\nUse the up and down arrow keys to scroll through numbers and letters. Press NEXT/ENTER after each character selection to move to the following character.\nWhen the ID code is complete, press SCAN to write the transponder.\nRemove the transponder from the booster coil and repeat as necessary. Check that the transponder reads temperature changes by warming the enclosed transponders between gloved hands and measuring using the temperature scanner.\n\t\t​NOTE: AUTO MULTI WRITE and SEQUENTIAL COUNT settings can be set to ON to allow for multiple or sequential transponder programming during a session. Each transponder should be tested during programming.\n3. Prepare \"home cage balls\"\nPlace 5 cm x 5 cm odorless/control towel into a tea ball.",
    "Place these home cage balls in new home cages after surgery to begin habituating the animal to the method in which the contextual stimuli will be presented during testing. Replace these home cage balls every 2 weeks.\n4. Surgery and postoperative care\nWeigh and record the subjects' pre-surgery body weight. Using an induction chamber, provide anesthesia (e.g., 2-5% isoflurane) to the animal.\nUsing electric clippers, completely shave the hind limb. Administer analgesia (e.g., 5 mg/kg of ketoprofen, s.c.) in compliance with institutional guidelines.\n\tNOTE: Additional analgesia may be required if this procedure is combined with other surgical methods.\nClean the area with 70% alcohol (or commercially available sterile alcohol wipe) and povidone-iodine wash (or commercially available sterile, individually wrapped betadine swabs) alternating at least three times, ending with povidone-iodine.\nReturn the animal to the induction chamber, and anesthetize the animal to surgical levels. Then, set up the mouse in a face mask for continued exposure to anesthesia. Apply neomycin ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the animal to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: The procedure should not start until the mouse shows no evidence of pain reception (i.e., corneal reflex, tail pinch response, toe pinch reflex).\nUsing only surgical scissors, make a shallow cut through the skin on the right hind limb.\nMoving parallel to the gastrocnemius, place the sharp edge of a preprogrammed and uncapped sterile transponder into the incision. Ensure that the green plunger faces up and is visible. Continue pushing the transponder applicator into the incision until the opening of the transponder applicator is no longer visible.\n\tNOTE: Do not accidentally press the green plunger on the transponder applicator during step 4.6. Premature discharge of the transponder will lead to improper placement.",
    "Turn the applicator 180°, resulting in the green plunger facing down toward the mouse's limb, no longer visible to the experimenter. Push the transponder applicator into the final location. Once in ideal placement, adjacent to or partially enclosed in the gastrocnemius, push the green plunger, allowing the applicator's pressure to guide the investigator's hand back away from the mouse.\nUsing forceps, hold together the opened skin and place a wound clip with a sterile autoclip or sterile suture. If needed, use absorbable sutures prior to the sterile autoclip to close the fascia layer. Using the transponder-reader, check the temperature of the mouse muscle.\nRemove the mouse from anesthesia and place it in a clean home cage placed atop a water-circulating heating pad set to low for recovery. Ensure that the home cage includes a tea ball with an odorless towel to begin habituation.\n\tNOTE: The mouse should awaken from surgery within 15 min. Food can be placed at the bottom of the cage for easy access during recovery days.\nPostoperative care\n\t\nRecord mouse weights and temperatures daily using a transponder-reader for at least 2 days after surgery or until mice regain or stabilize body weight.\nAdminister non-narcotic analgesia (e.g., 5 mg/kg of ketoprofen, s.c.) once daily to the mice for at least 2 days post surgery, with additional doses provided as needed.\n\t\tNOTE: Mice and rats should fully recover within 5-8 days of surgery and can undergo habituation and testing procedures.\n5. Testing preparation - home cage\nConstructing risers\n\tNOTE: The below step is based on 194 mm x 181 mm x 398 mm mouse filter-topped cages. To fit larger cages (e.g., a rat home cage), the width will need to be adjusted.",
    "Cut the PVC pipe with a ratcheting PVC cutter into eight sections and assemble following Figure 1C. This will give an open tabletop structure that can hold approximately four cages. Make the desired number of risers.\nRoom setup\n\t\nAssign a location to each riser within the testing room. Separate the risers set to receive different contextual stimuli (i.e., odors) by a minimum of 2 m to avoid confounding variables.\n\t\tNOTE: Each mouse should have an assigned testing location within the testing room and on the physical risers as much as is feasible to avoid developing associations between different locations and thermogenic stimuli.\nUsing magnetic strips, attach surgical sheets or gowns across the risers, creating a visual barrier between the researcher and the test subjects. Set this barrier to minimize temperature changes resulting from mouse activity when viewing experimenters moving toward the cage or around the testing room.\n(Optional) Place mirrors on the surface below the risers to ease viewing of the cage bottom during testing.\n\t\tNOTE: Risers can be sanitized through a cage wash system. Cloth or surgical sheets should be laundered prior to habituation and testing.\nTea ball preparation\n\t\nPrepare tea balls with control and PO towels (approximately 5 cm x 5 cm). To avoid cross-contamination, prepare control-odor tea balls first.\n\t\tNOTE: Predator-odor towels should be pathogen-tested prior to use. These towels should also be contained, and materials that interact with them should be immediately sanitized (i.e., cage wash), preventing exposure of the odor to other animals.\n6. Temperature testing - home cage\nNOTE: Animals need to be habituated to the entire testing procedure, excluding experimental contextual, or pharmacological stimuli. This should be completed a minimum of 4x before testing.",
    "Transfer the animals to the prepared testing room. Place the animals in a preassigned location on the riser. This location should be the same throughout all habituation and testing procedures.\nRemove the \"home cage ball\" from the mouse home cage and re-cover the cages with a cloth or surgical sheet. Allow the mice to acclimate to the testing space for 1-2 h.\nAfter acclimation is complete, use the scanner to measure and record the baseline temperature of each subject. Avoid manipulating the cloth coverings during measurements.\n\tNOTE: Pharmacological agents can be applied here. Wait time post injection or application can be added as needed before testing. Recording a secondary baseline directly before testing is recommended after the addition of a pharmacological agent to monitor the response to pharmacological stimuli. If odor response is not being tested, temperature measurements of the mice can begin directly after injection. Randomization should be employed when providing any stimuli.\nUncover the cage and place the tea ball (control or PO) onto the floor of the home cage. Replace the cage lid and cloth covering.\nBegin the stopwatch. Measure the temperatures of the test subjects in the same order of tea ball placement. Record temperatures and clock time of measurements following the desired time points.\nWhen the experiment is complete, remove the treatment ball. Place the mice that received PO in a new home cage with the original \"home cage ball\". Return the \"home cage ball\" to the cage of the mice that received control odor. Transfer the mice to the housing location.\n\t​NOTE: The above procedure can be translated to rat models within appropriately sized cages. Adjustments to the measurements suggested in Figure 1C may be required to allow for better access to the bottom of the home cage.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64264/64264fig01.jpg",

Temperature testing - treadmill walking\nAssign each animal a treadmill as their assigned location for habituation and testing procedures.\nPrepare the treadmills for testing, ensuring that the shockers are functional.\n\tNOTE: For treadmill walking, treadmills should be set at the lowest available pace that promotes continuous movement but not running for both habituation and testing. For the 1012M-2 Modular Enclosed Metabolic Treadmill, this is 5.2 m/min for mice and 7 m/min for rats. This pace may need to be adjusted based on the obesity of the subject. Shockers should be set to an intensity and repetition rate of 5.0.\nHabituation\n\t\nMove the mice to the testing room. Allow mice 1-2 h to acclimate to the room transfer in their home cages.\nAfter acclimation, guide the mice to the opening of their assigned treadmill and close the treadmill. Start the belt, shocker, and stopwatch.",
    "Allow the mice to walk on the treadmills for 15 min, using shock stimulus as motivation for movement. Stop the test immediately if an animal remains on an active shocker for an extended period.\nAfter the test, remove the mice and return them to the home cages.\nClean the treadmills using liquid detergent and water.\nTesting\n\t\nMove the mice to the testing room. Allow the mice 1-2 h to acclimate to the room transfer in their home cages.\nMeasure and record baseline temperature prior to moving the mouse to the treadmill.\n\t\tNOTE: For tests including pharmacological agents, apply or inject them here, following the schematic shown in Figure 2A. Wait time after injection can be added as needed before the mice are placed on the treadmill. Randomization should be employed when providing any stimuli.\nPlace 5 cm x 5 cm squares of control or PO towels within the treadmill closest to the front of the treadmill. Adhere the towels to the ceiling of the treadmill or underneath for easy placement and removal.\nGuide the mice into the assigned treadmill. Turn on the treadmill belt and shocker.\nStart the stopwatch. Take measurements of the test subjects in the same order in which the mice were set up in the treadmills. Record the temperatures and clock time of the measurements following the desired time points.\n\t\tNOTE: Temperature can reliably be measured from outside the treadmill while a mouse is inside an enclosed treadmill during walking activity. For rats, the treadmill size and transponder-reader distance limitations may require an experimenter to keep the back of the treadmill open to insert the reader inside the treadmill, closer to the subject.",
    "When the test is complete, turn off the shockers and treadmills; return the mice to their home cages. Transfer the mice to the housing location.\nClean the treadmills using liquid detergent and water, paying specific attention to remove any residual PO.\nWhen experiments are complete, euthanize the animals (e.g., using CO2 inhalation), and visually confirm the transponder location.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64264/64264fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Activity-controlled temperature testing.
