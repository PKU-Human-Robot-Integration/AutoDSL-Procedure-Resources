    "Informed consent was provided for the use of the human 3243A>G cybrid cells and the immortalized m.5024C>T MEFs used in this study. Ethical approval was not required in this instance as the patient cells were not collected at the University of Cambridge. The use of human fibroblasts may, however, require ethical approval. It is highly recommended to follow best practices for PCR setup when preparing the sample DNA for pyrosequencing. Frequent amplification using identical primers can lead to amplicon contamination and introduce bias to the subsequent genotyping if strict separation between the pre-PCR and post-PCR areas is not observed. The pipeline presented here uses specific equipment from a sole manufacturer; the details can be found in the Table of Materials. The primer design for the PCR can be performed manually if so desired; however, it is recommended to use existing software for this purpose (see the Table of Materials).\n1. Pyrosequencing primer design and assay selection\nObtaining primer candidates with software\n\t\nObtain an mtDNA sequence file for the species being genotyped, and identify the position of the SNP. Ensure that the reference sequence used employs the appropriate base numbering for the mutation studied so that the position of the SNP can be easily identified.\nCopy 1,000 base pairs upstream and downstream of the SNP site, and paste the truncated sequence into the software intended for the pyrosequencing primer design (see the Table of Materials).\nSet the analyzed SNP base as the target of the pyrosequencing assay in the software by highlighting the polymorphic base and right-clicking on and then selecting set target region.\nPress the play icon in the top right-hand corner of the interface to launch primer selection.",
    "Wait for the software to now automatically generate primer trios: two primers for preamplification of the template DNA and a third primer for sequencing by synthesis in the pyrosequencing machine. Retain all the primer sets by right-clicking on and selecting copy all primer sets.\nSelecting the optimal primer sets from the generated list\n\t\nRetain the primer sets with the highest quality score based on the software output, which provides primer sets in descending order based on the quality score. If possible, omit primer sets with a score below 80.\nFor the retained primer sets, identify and copy the amplicon produced by the amplification primers.\nAlign the amplicons produced with the entire genome of the organism to be genotyped using NCBI Blast by using the online submission portal at https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. From the dropdown menus during submission, select the following:\n\t\t\nSelect Database | Genomic + Transcript databases.\nSelect Human or Mouse in the dropdown menu, depending on the SNP analyzed.\nSelect Optimize for | Somewhat similar sequences (Blastn).\n(Optional) If genotyping an organism other than a mouse or human, select the following during submission:\n\t\t\nSelect Database | Standard database.\nSelect RefSeq Representative genomes in the dropdown menu\nSelect Optimize for | Somewhat similar sequences (Blastn)\nWhen possible, omit any amplicons that have perfect homology to the mtDNA amplicon, particularly if the primer binding regions are perfectly homologous (see the discussion).\n\t\tNOTE: The BLAST alignment tool will return any sequence with considerable homology to the pre-amplification amplicons. This allows for the detection of the NUMTs described in the introduction, which if not accounted for, can induce a bias as they are co-amplified with the mitochondrial DNA.",
    "Order the oligos obtained via this pipeline. Make sure that 5' biotin modification is added to the correct amplification primer during the synthesis order, such that the sequencing primer will be complementary to the biotinylated strand.\n\t\t​NOTE: The choice of sequencing primer is more flexible than the amplification primers, and it is recommended to have at least one base separating the 3' end of the sequencing primer and the variable position.\n2. Preamplification PCR optimization\nPrepare the DNA samples by extracting the total genomic DNA using an appropriate method.\n\tNOTE: This will largely depend on the number of cells being genotyped and their origin. If isolating DNA from single cells using a lysis buffer containing proteinase K, the sample must be denatured at 95 °C for 10 min so as not to disrupt the polymerase during the subsequent PCR.\nPCR setup and thermal block settings\n\t\nSet up the PCR with a high-fidelity polymerase of choice. Prepare a Master Mix for four reactions. As only 10 µL of PCR reaction are required for a pyrosequencing run, prepare 25 µL of PCR reactions (to allow for a technical repeat if necessary). Use 40 cycles of PCR with approximately 10 ng of genomic DNA as the starting material with 1 µM of both the forward and reverse primers.\nSet the extension time according to the manufacturer's specifications for the polymerase used, taking into consideration the length of the chosen preamplification primers.\nUse a thermal cycler with variable annealing temperature settings. As the annealing temperature can differ depending on the primer sequence, the salt content of the polymerase buffer, and other factors, program four different annealing temperatures into the thermal cycling program.\n\t\tNOTE: The worked example in the representative results used the following temperatures: 55 °C, 60 °C, 65 °C, and 70 °C.",
    "Split the Master Mix into four 200 µL PCR tubes, and set them to run at each of the four selected annealing temperatures in the thermal cycler for 40 cycles.\nPreamplification band visualization\n\t\nDuring the PCR run, prepare a 2% (w/v) agarose gel in 1x TBE with SYBR Safe or ethidium bromide as a visualizing agent.\n\t\tNOTE: A higher percentage gel is recommended for visualization as the amplified fragments are usually short, typically ranging from 100 to 500 base pairs.\nAfter the PCR in step 2.2 is complete, mix 10 µL of the reaction with an appropriate amount of DNA loading buffer, and run on the 2% agarose gel at 7 V/cm for approximately 45 min.\nVisualize the resulting DNA fragments on a UV transilluminator.\n\t\t​NOTE: The thermal cycling conditions selected for the preamplification step should produce a single clean band of the expected size. Lower annealing temperatures can occasionally result in off-target amplification, which can introduce biases to the subsequent pyrosequencing.\nSelect the lowest annealing temperature that produces a clean band of the correct size for subsequent amplifications.\n(Optional) Excise a band of the expected size, purify using a gel extraction kit of choice, and analyze by Sanger sequencing to confirm the approximate heteroplasmy of the sample as a reference.\n3. Instrument setup and run\nNOTE: Once the PCR step in the previous section is optimized, the next step involves programming the pyrosequencer with the correct nucleotide sequence to analyze for the specific SNP. This involves entering 10 bases directly downstream of the 3' end of the sequencing primer. This is detailed in the following section.\nAssay configuration\n\t\nOpen the run software provided with the pyrosequencer, and select New Assay in the top-left corner of the interface.\nSelect the Allele quantification assay template.",
    "Input the Sequence to be analyzed into the corresponding box by typing in the nucleotides to be incorporated directly downstream of the sequencing primer, which should be upstream of the SNP of interest. For the variable position, denote the two possible bases separated by a slash (e.g., A/T).\nPress Generate dispensation order, and let the software automatically determine a suitable order for the nucleotides to be dispensed in the sequencing-by-synthesis reaction.\nSave and provide a name for the assay.\nReagent preparation and storage\n\t\nDilute the sequencing primer ordered to 4 µM in the Annealing Buffer provided in pyrosequencer reagent kit.\n\t\tNOTE: The sequencing primer can first be diluted in water to 100 µM as a stock solution and subsequently further diluted in Annealing Buffer to 4 µM as needed.\nEnzyme and substrate preparation and handling\n\t\t\nWhen first unboxing, redissolve the lyophilized enzyme and substrate as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Store at −20 °C when not in use.\nUpon subsequent use, thaw the enzyme and substrate vials from −20 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: All the other reagents in the provided kit can be kept refrigerated at 4 °C. Diluted sequencing primers can also be kept at 4 °C.\nPlace the required amount of each reagent on ice.\nKeep the remaining components required, namely the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, absorber strips, and pyrosequencing disks, at 4 °C.\nRun execution\n\tNOTE: When an assay is first designed, it must be calibrated using PCR products of known heteroplasmy, which ensures that the assay can accurately distinguish heteroplasmies. Researchers can use mixtures of PCR products of known heteroplasmy as standards. Samples can also be verified by other methods mentioned in the introduction and the discussion, notably NGS.",
    "Dilute the DNA to be analyzed to 5 ng/µL. Particularly in the first run, be sure to include samples of known heteroplasmy as a reference and/or wild-type samples.\nPerform a presequencing PCR of 5 µL of diluted DNA in 25 µL reactions using the amplification primers and parameters identified in section 1 and section 2. Perform technical PCR replicates for each sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The preamplification PCR can be stored short term at 4 °C or long term at −20 °C before proceeding to sequencing.\nRun file setup\n\t\t\nSelect New Run in the top-left corner of pyrosequencer software.\nThe pyrosequencer can simultaneously sequence 48 separate preamplified reactions, with an empty square representing a single sequencing well on a pyrosequencing disk. Load the assays configured in section 3.1 by right-clicking on a square and selecting load assay. If required, sequence up to four separate assays with different sequencing primers.\nSet the primer dispensation mode to Automatic to automatically assign an injection chamber for each sequencing primer used for the run.\nSet Run mode to Standard unless running four different types of assays on one sequencing disk.\nEnsure the number of assays on the run template file matches the number of PCR reactions being amplified.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If running more than 48 samples, additional run files will need the be set up.\nSave the run files to a USB drive.\nPriming the pyrosequencer\n\t\t\nPress the Cleaning button on the main touch screen of the device, and clean all injectors with high-purity water following the instructions on the screen. When inserting the absorber strip into the machine, ensure that the ends meet in the \"9 o'clock\" position (directly left of the center).\nPlug in the USB stick with the runs set up in step 3.3.3, and load the run files defined in step 3.3.3.",
    "NOTE: The run files must be saved outside any directory or folder on the USB or they cannot be read by the machine.\nFollow the instructions on the device to load and prime the reagents as required into the corresponding injectors on the machine.\nSample disk preparation and assay launch\n\t\t\nAllow the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads to equilibrate to room temperature.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These beads will enable the device to capture the biotinylated strand from the preamplification PCR step. They need to be purchased separately from the kit.\nLoad 3 µL of beads into the wells defined in the run file from step 3.3.3.\nLoad 10 µL of each PCR reaction to be sequenced into the corresponding sample, and pipette up and down to mix the sample with the magnetic beads. Avoid bubbles if possible.\nLook for the indication in the primed pyrosequencer that the disk can be loaded into the machine. Unscrew the plate holding nut before aligning the loaded sample plate with the metal pin in the disk compartment.\nOnce the plate is firmly screwed into the plate compartment, launch the sequencing run by pressing the start button on the touchscreen interface.\n4. Result acquisition\nOnce the run is complete, remove the USB drive from the machine, and plug it back into the computer running the pyrosequencer software. While proceeding with the following steps, proceed with cleaning the pyrosequencer following the prompts if it is the final run of the day.\nWait for the newly generated run file to appear on the USB drive, and double-click on the run result file. This automatically analyzes the luciferase output of each well upon nucleotide incorporation and quantifies the mitochondrial allele of interest defined during the assay configuration in section 3.1.",
    "Look for the following color scores shown by the software based on the quality of the reads. Blue indicates an optimal run, yellow a run with a warning, and red a failed run. To save the results, select Reports in the top window | Full report to generate a .pdf file containing the pyrograms and results from each well of the run. Alternatively, download the results in other formats under the Reports tab.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
