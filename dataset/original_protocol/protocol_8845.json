    "1. Electroporate the Construct of Interest in the Neural Tubes of HH12-13 Chicken Embryos In ovo\nUse a fluorescent reporter, preferably in a bicistronic transcript or fused to the protein of interest with an intercalating viral 2a peptide11, to enable quick identification of individuals with satisfactory levels of transfection. NOTE: Typical incubation time for this stage is around 48 hr at 37.8 °C.\nOpen a small window in the eggs after removing 3 ml of albumin with a syringe coupled to a 18 G x 1 1/2 needle. To enhance embryo visualization, inject a small amount of Indian ink diluted 1:50 in sterile Ringer’s solution underneath the embryo1-4.\nAfter covering the embryo with sterile Ringer’s solution, inject a 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2 and 0.1% Food Dye (F, D & C) solution containing 2.5 µg/µl DNA through the posterior end of the neural tube until it fills up to the hindbrain region. To electroporate, position platinum electrodes (0.5 mm in diameter) separated by 4 mm1 along the flank region and deliver 5 pulses of 50 msec and 20 V with an interval of 100 msec between them4.\nAfter electroporation, incubate manipulated embryos for 48 hr more until they reach stage HH23 and identify individuals presenting high level of transfection at the flank region under a fluorescent stereomicroscope.\n\tNOTE: The duration of incubation after electroporation depends on the aim of the experiment. The electroporated plasmids can generate significant expression levels after 2 hr2. Thus, if the interest lies in early onset genes the post-electroporation incubation period can be reduced.\n2. Harvest Successfully Transfected Embryos and Dissect the Electroporated Spinal Cord Halves",
    "NOTE: This procedure lasts from 2-3 hr for each 10 embryos and yields 1-2 µg total RNA per embryo. The dissection of neural tubes requires fine movements and some practice sessions may be necessary before applying it to experimental samples.\nDecontaminate metallic dissection tools with RNase decontamination solution or by baking at 150 °C for 4 hr12 and prepare DEPC-treated PBS. Use only new certified RNase-free plasticware.\n\tNOTE: After harvesting, it is important to follow standard care to prevent RNase contamination during dissection.\nHarvest the embryos using a pair of fine dissecting scissors and a sieved collection spoon. Keep the embryos in cold DEPC-treated PBS in a 100 mm Petri dish.\nWith a pair of fine tweezers, cut out the whole flank region (between the posterior limit of the anterior limb bud and the anterior limit of the posterior limb bud) and transfer this section to a new dish containing cold DEPC-treated PBS.\nUse two fine glass needles to perforate at three different points on each dorsolateral side of the embryo between the neural tube and the paraxial mesoderm.\nIntroduce the two glass needles in the central perforation and slowly move one of them away along the neural tube anterior-posterior axis. Repeat this for the perforations that were not reached by the first movements. Remove the detached paraxial mesoderm with a pair of fine tweezers.\nTurn the embryo sideways, insert the tips of the tweezers between the neural tube and the notochord and slide them in opposite directions along the anterior-posterior axis to separate the two structures.\n\tNOTE: This should also remove most of the mesoderm still attached to the neural tube.",
    "If necessary, remove any larger pieces of mesodermic tissue that remain attached by pulling with a pair of tweezers while lightly holding the neural tube with another pair of tweezers. When finished, gently transfer the neural tube to another dish containing cold DEPC-treated PBS using a RNase-free glass Pasteur pipette coupled to a manual pipette pump and keep on ice until all the tubes are dissected.\nDivide the neural tubes into two halves. For this, insert the sharp tip of a closed pair of tweezers in the lumen and open the roof plate by moving the tweezers out through it. After this, separate the halves by cutting the floor plate with the tweezers tips.\nSort electroporated from non-electroporated halves under a fluorescent dissecting scope and transfer to a 1.5 ml tube filled with ice-cold DEPC-treated PBS. If necessary, flick the microtubes gently to release any tissue attached to the plastic walls and to promote sedimentation of the tubes.\nSpin at 100 x g for 3 sec and remove very slowly as much PBS as possible with a 1 ml micropipette. Do this while looking at a light source that shines through the microtube to monitor if any embryonic material is sucked to the pipette tip; if this happens, slowly discharge and repeat the centrifugation.\nAdd 70 µl of lysis solution for RNA extraction per neural tube half and flick the tube to mix contents. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min and vortex vigorously. Repeat the 5 min incubation and vortexing two more times. Store at -80 °C.",
    "Collect at least eight neural tube halves per sample to ensure an adequate yield for the next step. Pool smaller samples if several electroporation/dissection sessions are required to amass sufficient number of neural tubes. Store sufficient samples for duplicates or triplicates for each condition.\n3. Purify RNA and Prepare Libraries for Illumina Sequencing\nRemove samples from -80 °C storage and place on ice for 15-30 min. Resume thawing at room temperature until complete.\nVortex well and leave at room temperature for 5 min. Vortex again and centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min to pellet insoluble material.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new tube and proceed to RNA extraction according to the total RNA isolation kit manual instructions. Elute in the minimum recommended volume to increase concentration.\n\tNOTE: DNase treatment after clean-up is recommended in order to avoid potential contamination of genomic DNA sequences in RNA-Seq datasets.\nFlick the tube to mix contents and remove 5 µl for quality control analysis. Store the remaining sample at -80 °C until library preparation; these samples should be thawed only once to avoid RNA degradation.\nRun purified RNA in a Bioanalyzer instrument using the RNA 6000 Nano kit; RIN value must be at least above 7 to proceed.\nGenerate libraries using an Illumina compatible RNA-Seq library preparation kit and multiplex up to 4 libraries in one lane of a HiSeq instrument set to generate 100 bp single reads. If possible, include all samples in the same run to minimize potential technical artifacts.\n\tNOTE: This should yield up to 50 million reads per sample, which is more than enough to obtain coverage for most genes13.\n4. Compare RNA-Seq Datasets in the Galaxy Public Server10.",
    "NOTE: Server storage space is limited and experiments comparing many samples may require deletion of intermediate files generated in the filtering steps.\nCreate a user account in the Galaxy public server (https://usegalaxy.org[href=https://usegalaxy.org/]) and FTP upload the Illumina datasets in fastq format.\nPrepare uploaded files with the FastqGroomer14 tool under the NGS:QC and manipulation menu; if the quality scores are already encoded in Phred+33 (Sanger), skip this step by simply changing the file type to fastqsanger under the Attributes for each dataset.\nAnalyze the general quality of each dataset using the FastQC tool under the NGS:QC and manipulation menu.\n\tNOTE: Special attention should be given to the resulting graphics for per base sequence quality and per base sequence content, as these will provide estimates for the parameters used for trimming the ends of the reads.\nTrim reads to discard 3’ ends with low quality data using the tool FASTQ Quality Trimmer14 under the NGS:QC and manipulation menu. Set the tool to process only 3’ ends for quality score below 20.\nRemove adapter sequences from reads using the Clip tool (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/[href=http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/]) under the NGS:QC and manipulation menu. Set the tool to discard reads with less than 45 bp left, input the sequence of the adapter used and choose the output to include both clipped and non-clipped sequences. Additionally, opt not to discard sequences with unknown bases since most low quality bases were already removed in the last step.\nUsing the tool Trim sequences (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/[href=http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/]) under the NGS:QC and manipulation menu, trim the first bases of the reads to remove 5’ sequence bias detected by FastQC (typically 10).\n\tNOTE: At this point, it is a good idea to run FastQC again and compare with the previous analysis to determine if the dataset quality was improved.",

    "To check results visually with coverage graphs, first convert BAM files to bedGraph format using the tool Create a BedGraph of genome coverage17 under the BEDTools menu. Disable reporting of regions without coverage, choose to treat spliced entries as distinct intervals and scale the coverage by a factor that normalizes sequencing depth for all the datasets being compared.\nConvert the resulting bedGraph file to bigWig format using the tool Wig/BedGraph-to-bigWig (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/[href=http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/]) under the Convert Formats menu. Upload the bigwig files as custom tracks in the UCSC genome browser (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/[href=http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/]) for the galGal4 assembly and search a gene of interest to visualize the coverage in the datasets.\nSubscription Required.
