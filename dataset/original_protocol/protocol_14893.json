MRI Scanning\nAcquire with the MRI scanner a pilot image for localizing both breasts and determine the field of view (FOV), number of slices and slice thickness to completely cover both breasts with extension to the axilla and to the chest wall.",
    "In all the following scanning sequences performed with the MRI scanner, keep the same value of the FOV, slice number and slice thickness for each case. For example, acquire 60 axial slices with FOV of 360 mm in the read and phase direction, slice thickness ranging between 2 to 3 mm, depending on the size of the breasts, and a phase encoding direction L >> R or R >> L.

Verify that the irradiation frequency is centered on the water resonance frequency.",

Ensure that the sequence includes acquisition of 2D transversal gradient echo (GE) images with two different in-phase echo times, and that the phase encoding direction is the same as in the DTI sequence (step 2.5). Fix the parameters that will pop up on the screen according to their values in the column “2D GE Field mapping” in Table 1.\nApply through the user interface computer a dynamic contrast enhanced protocol using a 3D fast gradient echo sequence without fat-suppression, with parameters optimized according to the three time point (3TP) method32.

Image Processing\nTransfer the entire dataset obtained by all the scanning sequences (described in steps 2.4 - 2.9) to a remote workstation or personal computer and process the entire datasets of images with software programs devoted to analyze breast diffusion tensor imaging and DCE-MRI.\n\t\nHere, perform the steps described below using the homebuilt software package written in C++ that was verified by using the programing environment of MATLAB19. In general, commercial scanners provide image processing tools for brain DTI experiments that can be adapted for the breast but may not have all the processing functions applied by our homebuilt software package\nPerform Image processing of the DTI datasets using a dedicated DTI image processing software following the steps in the flowchart of Figure 7.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048fig7highres.jpg\nFigure 7: Flowchart of the steps involved in DTI processing.",
    "Use the DTI software program to evaluate the noise level outside of the breast and the remaining tissue in 3 to 4 regions of interest (of approximately 1 cm2) and find the maximum noise level.\nUse the DTI software program to calculate pixel by pixel, in all pixels above the maximum noise level and in each of the 60 slices, the six diffusion coefficients, Dxx, Dyy, Dzz, Dxy, Dxz, Dyz, of the symmetric tensor D described below 33 (see Figure 8)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048eq1.jpg\n\tWhere Dxy=Dyx, Dzy=Dyz, Dzx=Dxz.\nIn order to calculate the tensor components use a non-linear regression fitting program based on the Stejskal-Tanner equation: Si,j(b)=Si(0)exp(-bD), where Si,j(b) is the signal intensity of pixel i with a diffusion gradient in the direction j and Si(0) is the signal intensity of the same pixel at b = 0 mm2·s. This fitting minimized the sum of the squares of the 30 nonlinear functions for each diffusion gradient direction in the six diffusion tensor variable components by a modification of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm34.This step was performed by the free software cminpack (http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/cminpack/index.html[href=http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/cminpack/index.html]).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048fig8highres.jpg\nFigure 8: Schematic drawing of the calculation steps yielding the symmetric diffusion tensor.\nUse the DTI software to diagonalize the symmetric diffusion tensor in each pixel by applying principal component analysis (PCA)35.",
    "NOTE: PCA is a commonly used method to reduce the dimensionality of the data and find a linear transformation that maps the correlated pixel parameters into a new coordinate system of uncorrelated and orthogonal axes. This process yields for each pixel three eigenvectors (ν1, ν2, ν3), defining the diffusion direction in three orthogonal axes of an ellipsoid shape that coincides with the diffusion frame of the tissue, and the corresponding three diffusion eigenvalues, arranged from high to low, that determine three directional diffusion coefficients (λ1, λ2, λ3) (see Figures 9 and 10).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048fig9highres.jpg\nFigure 9: Schematic drawing of the calculation steps yielding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors coinciding with the diffusion frame of the tissue and the modeling to ellipsoid.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048fig10highres.jpg\nFigure 10: Schematic drawing of the main processing steps that calculate the diffusion eigenvectors and eigenvalues in normal ductal tissue and in cancer tissue.\nUse the DTI software program to calculate for each pixel the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) defined as the average of the three eigenvalues < λ > = (λ1 + λ2 +λ3) / 3.\nUse the DTI software program to calculate for each pixel the maximal absolute anisotropy index defined as the difference (λ1 – λ3).\nUse the DTI software program to calculate for each pixel the fractional anisotropy (FA) index that ranges between 0 (isotropic diffusion) to 1 (free diffusion in one direction) according to the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048eq2.jpg\nUse the DTI software program to display pixel by pixel in each slice throughout both breasts a vector map showing the direction of the prime eigenvector, ν1, and a color coded map with three colors indicating the main directions of ν1 and overlay them on a T2 weighted image of the same slice (Figure 9). This step was performed using the free software gtk (http://gtk.org[href=http://gtk.org]) for graphics.",
    "Use the DTI software program to construct the diffusion tensor imaging parametric maps that display pixel by pixel in each slice throughout both breasts the values of all the diffusion tensor parameters λ1, λ2, λ3, ADC, λ1-λ3, and FA and overlay them on a T2 weighted image of the same slice (Figure 11).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048fig11highres.jpg\nFigure 11: Output of parametric DTI maps of a central slice in the breasts of a 24 year old healthy volunteer overlaid on the T2 weighted image of the same slice.

Note that the vectors in the vector map are marked in white lines. All diffusion coefficients and the maximal anisotropy index are in units of 10-3 mm2/sec. FA is unit-less. The scale bar in the vector map refers to a length of 20 mm and the scale bar in the T2 image refers to a length of 20 mm in all the remaining images.\nUse the DTI software program to correct, if necessary, geometric distortions by loading the phase difference map obtained as described in step 2.6. Shift the range of the phase difference map in all pixels above the noise level in the gradient echo image to a range of -π to +π representing the phase shift Δɸ (x,y,z) in radians (Figure 12).\n\t\nUse the DTI software program to calculate the spatial shift in pixels according to:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048eq3.jpg\n\t\tΔTE is the time difference between the two echoes equals 2.46 x 10-3 msec and BWp is the phase bandwidth in the experiment equals 13.2 Hz/pixel. Shift the pixels according to the field map and recalculate the diffusion tensor parameters (Figure 12).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52048/52048fig12highres.jpg",

In the first column on the left T2 weighted image and a phase difference map of a slice with cancer in the left breast are displayed. In the second and 3rd columns λ1 maps before correction are displayed in the first row and λ1 maps after correction are displayed in the second row. The λ1 maps are overlaid on the corresponding T2 weighted image. In the 2nd column the full range of diffusion coefficients of water (0.8-3.0) x10-3 mm2/sec is used for the color coded scale and in the 3rd column a reduced range is used with a threshold of 1.7 x 10-3 mm2/sec that emphasizes the contrast between the cancer in the left breast and the normal breast tissue. The scale bar in the T2 image refers to a length of 20 mm in all the images.\nPerform image processing of the DCE-MRI datasets using a software that provides pixel by pixel maps of the kinetic parameters of the enhancement such as the 3TP image processing software 17."
