    "The outline of the method is depicted in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913032005_8135.jpgFigure 1. The outline of the method. After ‘quick-freezing’ of yeasts, the cytoplasm is exposed by ‘fracturing’ of frozen cells with cooled knife. The ‘etching’ procedure induces sublimation of water in the cytosol and the organelle lumen. This makes lipid droplets stand out because lipid esters in the lipid droplet core do not sublimate. Vacuum evaporation of platinum and carbon onto the surface makes a ‘replica’ of the cellular ultrastructure.Quick freezingPrepare round-shaped copper discs of 3 mm in diameter using a hole puncher. Clean the discs by soaking them in acetone (Figures 2A and 2B).Concentrate yeast cells by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 1 min. Place yeast cells on an EM grid (200 mesh) by dipping the grid into a pellet or spreading ~0.6 μl of pellet on the grid using a pipette tip (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913032130_3888.jpg Figure 2. Tools used for quick-freezing and freeze-fracture-etching. A. Copper foil (20 μm thick). The left portion (arrow) has already been used to prepare round-shaped discs. B. The sample sandwich subjected to quick-freezing: a 200 mesh EM grid impregnated with yeast cells is placed between a 20-μm-thick copper disc and an aluminum disc. C. A specimen table of Balzers BAF400. The sample sandwiches are placed in the two round indentations (arrows).Sandwich the EM grid impregnated with yeast cells between a 20-μm-thick copper foil and a flat aluminum disc (Figure 2B) (see Note 1).Quick-freeze yeast cells using an HPM 010 high-pressure freezing machine (or a similar device) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep the frozen samples in liquid nitrogen until they are transferred to the cold specimen stage of a freeze-fracture apparatus.Freeze-fracturing and etchingMount the frozen sample onto a specimen table of the freeze-fracture apparatus (Figures 2C and 3).",
    "Here, the procedure for the Balzers BAF400 will be described, but it can easily be adapted to other devices.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170913/20170913032255_0131.jpgFigure 3. Freeze-fracture apparatus (BAF400) for freeze-fracture-etching. Electron beam guns for carbon and platinum deposition are located at 80° and 20° to the specimen surface, respectively. Specimen table is set on the temperature-controlled specimen stage.Transfer the specimen table to the pre-cooled specimen stage of the freeze-fracture apparatus (Figure 3). The specimen stage needs to be cooled below -120 °C before this transfer.Keep the specimen temperature at -120 °C for 10 min, and then at -102 °C for 3 to 5 min by using the temperature controller of the specimen stage.Cool the knife to the lowest-possible temperature (e.g., near the temperature of liquid nitrogen).After the vacuum reaches below ~5 x 10-7 mbar, fracture the specimens at -102 °C by separating the copper disc from the aluminum disc using the pre-cooled knife (see Note 2).Keep the fractured specimens at -102 °C for another 2 min to induce sublimation of water from the fractured surface.Evaporate platinum-carbon (Pt/C) and carbon (C) onto the specimen using the electron beam gun. First, evaporate 2 to 4 nm of Pt/C at an angle of 20° to the specimen surface, then 10 nm of C at an angle of 80°. Rotate the specimen stage at maximum speed during evaporation. Control the thickness of the Pt/C and C deposition using a crystal thickness monitor (Figure 3). Break the vacuum, bring the specimen into the atmosphere, and transfer the freeze-fracture replicas to household bleach to digest biological materials for more than 2 h.Rinse the replicas with water.Mount the replicas on the formvar-coated EM grids under a stereoscopic microscope. The formvar-coated EM grids are prepared by a standard protocol (Slot and Geuze, 2007).Observe the replicas by transmission EM (see Note 3)."
