    "All animal experiments were approved by the animal care and use committee of the School of Applied Science, Temasek Polytechnic.\n1. Preparation of DMN\nPipette 200 µl of DMN (1 g/ml stock solution) and add 19.8 ml of PBS to prepare 10 mg/ml DMN solution for the injection.\n\tNote: DMN is carcinogenic. Use a fume hood to prepare the DMN and perform the animal injections.\n2. Intraperitoneal Injection of DMN\nUse male Wistar rats with an average weight of 150 - 200 g. Acclimate rats for 4 - 7 days before the start of the experiment.\nMaintain rats at room temperature of 22 ± 1 °C, with 12 hr light and 12 hr dark cycles. Provide rat chow and water ad libitum.\nMeasure food and water intakes daily. Measure body weight weekly.\nCalculate the amount of DMN for each rat based on a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. Use a 1 ml syringe with a 25 gauge needle to draw the calculated volume of DMN solution into the syringe.\nRestrain the rat for intraperitoneal injection21.\nWith the rat properly restrained, introduce the needle into the lower right quadrant of the abdomen, draw back on the plunger of the syringe (nothing should be aspirated) to check for the correct placement of needle within the abdominal space and slowly inject DMN solution.\nWhen the dose of DMN has been administered, slowly withdraw the needle and dispose into the sharps bin.\nPerform the intraperitoneal injections of DMN for 3 consecutive days a week for 4 weeks. Administer the injections at the same time each day. Re-calculate the dosage based on the body weight at the start of each week of injections.\nCollect blood from the tail vein weekly to measure biochemical parameters: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)22.",
    "Measure serum ALT and AST using a commercial Vet Test Chemistry Analyzer.\n3. Gross Examination and Harvest of Liver \nEuthanize the rats by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight. Ensure death by checking for the lack of heartbeat.\nPrepare for the post mortem and assess the condition of the animal as described by Parkinson et al.23 Place dead rats onto dissecting board in dorsal recumbency with the abdomen facing upwards.\nDisinfect and moisten the skin with 70% ethanol.\nUsing scissors, incise the skin the full length of the ventrum from the anus to the chin, and reflect the skin. With the scissors, incise the abdominal wall from the anus to the xiphoid cartilage, to expose the abdominal viscera.\nExamine the abdominal organs in situ to check for any abnormalities. Note any changes in color, size, location of organs and the presence of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. Examine the consistency of organs and note the presence of any odors.\nUsing scissors and forceps, dissect the entire liver free of its ligaments and attachments.\n\t\nBegin at the hilus where it is attached to the diaphragm and work to free all the liver lobes of attachments. Carefully cut all ligaments and blood vessels.\nTransfer the liver onto a petri dish and weigh the liver.\nUsing a scalpel, cut 2 - 5 mm thick sections of liver lobes. For consistency, always take samples from the same liver lobe. Take a wedge about 5 mm diameter in thickness, from the right lateral lobe24 about 1 cm from the edge of the lobe.Immediately place into 10% buffered formalin for fixation. Ensure the tissue to formalin volume is 1:10 or more.",
    "Harvest and immediately freeze portions (using liquid nitrogen) of liver lobes at this point if required for other studies. As for (3.8), sample from the same liver lobe for consistency.\n4. Processing, Embedding and Sectioning of the Liver\nFix the liver samples in 10% buffered formalin for a minimum of 24 hr.\nAfter fixation, trim the liver, place into cassettes and load them into the basket of the automated tissue processor.\nPlace the basket with cassettes into the first station which contains 10% buffered formalin. Ensure the cassettes are entirely submerged. They can remain in this chamber for up to 12 hr until the cycle begins.\nProgram the tissue processor to rotate the cassettes for 1 hr each, through successive stations containing the following solutions: ethanol at concentrations of 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% (2 stations), xylene (2 stations) and liquid paraffin (2 stations).\nTransfer the liver samples into the wax bath of the embedding station. Ensure that the embedding machine is switched on at least one hour earlier.\nUsing pre-warmed forceps (65 °C), remove each cassette from the wax bath and place onto the warm plate (65 °C) of the embedding machine. Dispense sufficient amount of liquid paraffin into the stainless steel base mold (pre-warmed to 65 °C) till half full. Transfer the section of liver from the cassette into the mold. Ensure the specimen is placed with the cut surface (to be examined microscopically) flat on the bottom of the mold.\nFill the mold completely with liquid paraffin, mount the empty cassette on top and place the mold onto the 4 °C plate of the embedding machine to cool for at least 30 min.",
    "Check that the wax has cooled and solidified, and remove the paraffin block from the mold. The block should pop out easily and not stick or crack. If this happens, melt the block and repeat this step. The paraffin block can be sectioned once it solidifies. Blocks can be stored at room temperature for many years.\nPlace the paraffin block into the microtome and section at 10 µm thickness until the wax layer is removed sufficiently for the embedded liver tissue to be visible.\nChange the setting on the microtome to cut at 5 µm thickness. Using forceps, pick up a well cut section by holding it at the edge and carefully float the section in the water bath at a temperature of 40 °C.\nGently place a clean glass slide under the floating section and lift it onto the surface of the glass slide. Place the slide onto a slide warmer at 37 °C overnight.\n5. Masson Trichrome Staining\nBefore applying the stains, treat the slides to remove the wax and rehydrate the tissues as follows:\n\t\nImmerse the sections in xylene for 5 min. Repeat 2x.\nImmerse the sections in 100% ethanol for 3 min. Repeat 1x.\nImmerse the sections for 1 min each in the following solutions of ethanol: 90%, 80% and 70%.\nRinse the slide under tap water to remove any existing ethanol on the slide.\nImmerse slides in Iron Hematoxylin for 10 min to stain the nucleus.\nRinse the slides with water to remove the excess stain from the slide.\nImmerse the slides in Biebrich Scarlet-Acid Fuchsin for 2 min to stain the cytoplasm.\nRinse the slides with water.\nPlace the slides in Phosphotungstic/Phosphomolybdic Acid Solution for 10 min to promote the uptake of Aniline blue. Change the Phosphotungstic/Phosphomolybdic Acid Solution after 2 rounds of use.",
    "Place the slides in aniline blue solution for 10 min to stain the collagen fibers.\nRinse the excess stain with water and place the slides in 1% acetic acid solution for 1 min to allow differentiation to take place to render the color of the slide more delicate and transparent.\nRinse the slides with water and proceed to dehydrate the tissue sections. The dehydration steps are as follows:\nImmerse the slides successively for 10 sec each time, in the following concentrations of ethanol: 70%, 80%, 95% and 100%.\nImmerse the slides for 30 sec in 100% ethanol. Repeat 1x.\nRinse the slides through 3 stations of xylene for 5 min each to remove ethanol.\nMount a glass cover slip onto the specimen with mounting media (e.g., DPX mountant) and allow to dry.\n\tNote: DPX is a synthetic resin that dries quickly, preserves stain and protects the tissue section.\n6. Fibrosis Scoring on Masson's Trichome Stained Sections of Liver\nHave a veterinary pathologist assess the severity of fibrosis according to the fibrosis score25. It would be optimum if the fibrosis scoring is done by two or three pathologists independently in a blinded manner. In such a scenario, obtain a final score after discussion and group review to sort out any differences in scoring.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nScore,Description\n0,No fibrosis\n1,\"Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa\"\n2,\"Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa\"\n3,\"Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, occasional portal to portal (P-P) bridging\"\n4,Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (portal to portal (P-P) as well as portal to central (P-C)\n5,Marked bridging (P-P and/or P-C) with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis)\n6,\"Cirrhosis, probable or definite\"",
