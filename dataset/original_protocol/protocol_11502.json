    "Data on all patients treated with EBUS-guided cisplatin were reviewed. The institutional review board at the University of Florida approved this study (#IRB201400823). All data was prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Use the following enrollment criteria.\n1. Patient Selection\nSelect patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years who have a biopsy-confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and have a pathologically-confirmed recurrence. Enroll patients who have received at least 50 gy of radiation to the hilar and mediastinal structures for 6 months or longer. Include patients with limited recurrence to the hilar, mediastinal, and peribronchial structures (lymph nodes, nodules, and masses) accessible through EBUS and distant metastases.\nPresent all such patients to a multi-disciplinary thoracic oncology tumor board and obtain consensus on proceeding with the intratumoral cisplatin due to a lack of other localized therapeutic options. The decision to proceed with EBUS-guided ITC should be a joint recommendation of the institutional thoracic oncology tumor board.\n2. Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS)-guided Cisplatin Injection\nUse a convex-probe EBUS, which has a built-in ultrasound probe on a flexible bronchoscope and enables real-time visualization of hilar, mediastinal, and peribronchial structures for ITC.\nEnsure that the patients abstain from oral food and fluids for at least 6 h prior to the procedure.\nCreate an aqueous cisplatin solution at a concentration of 1 mg/mL with a maximal dose of 40 mg per session, based on previously-published literature9,10. Dissolve lyophilized cisplatin powder in 0.9% NaCl solution just before use.\nGive 10 mg of dexamethasone and 8 mg of ondansetron intravenously at the beginning of the procedure to prevent nausea.\nPerform the procedure with conscious sedation using midazolam and fentanyl intravenously (IV). Use topical anesthesia in the form of 5 mL of 4% lidocaine nebulization prior to the procedure.",
    "Start out with an IV injection of 2 mg of midazolam and 50 µg of fentanyl. Reassess the patient every 1-2 min and give an additional 1 mg midazolam and 25 µg fentanyl bolus to achieve and maintain conscious sedation (a minimally depressed consciousness such that the patient is able to continuously and independently maintain a patent airway, retain protective reflexes, and remain responsive to verbal commands and physical stimulation). Do not exceed the maximal permissible doses of fentanyl and midazolam, 200 µg and 10 mg, respectively.\nUse standard monitoring, including a continuous 3-lead electrocardiogram monitoring the heart rate, continuous pulse oximetry, and respiratory rate measurements. Provide local anesthesia and supplemental O2 as required.\n Advance the scope through the vocal cords in the airways. Identify and locate the target lesion.\nTurn on the EBUS processor and inflate the balloon at the tip of the scope using 1-2 mL of normal saline. Flex the scope across the airway wall and locate the lesion. The location of the lesion will depend on CT/PET findings, but some of the common sites include the subcarinal area, the right and left paratracheal areas, and the right and left hilar areas.\nDeploy a 22 G EBUS needle that is housed in a sheath through the working channel of the scope and lock it in position.",
    "NOTE: Although there are no precise surgical coordinates for the injection site, some of the commonly-treated sites include the subcarinal (medially at the junction of the left and right main bronchi), the right paratracheal (laterally at the right main bronchus, just above the right upper lobe orifice), the left paratracheal (at the junction of the distal trachea and the left main between the arch of the aorta and the left pulmonary artery), the right hilar (laterally at the proximal bronchus intermedius, below the right upper lobe opening), and the left hilar (at the junction of the left upper lobe and the left lower lobe bronchi).\nUnder real-time ultrasound guidance, puncture the tracheobronchial wall and place the needle in the target lesion. Remove the stylet within the needle and inject cisplatin into the lesion 10 mL (1 mg/mL of cisplatin) at a time. Retract the needle within the sheet.\nTreat each lesion with four punctures per session at different locations to facilitate the injection of the medication throughout. Inject 10 mg of cisplatin per puncture.\nTreat one to two lesions per session. If more than one lesion is treated per session, inject each site with 20 mg of cisplatin, with total dose per session not exceeding 40 mg.\nRemove the needle from the working channel of the scope.\nSuction any additional drug from the distal airways and remove the bronchoscope.\nAllow the patients to recover as per hospital protocol and discharge them on the same day.\nRepeat the cisplatin injection (steps 2.7-2.13) once a week for a total of 4 weeks (on days 1, 8, 15, and 22).\n\tNOTE: Once treated, a particular lesion should never be considered for retreatment with ITC on subsequent encounters.\n3. Post-injection",
    "Evaluate the response by a follow-up chest computed tomography (CT) or a positron emission tomography (PET/CT) scan 8-12 weeks after the last treatment session. Define the local recurrence as the recurrence at the site of treatment and the regional recurrence as the recurrence in the mediastinum, hilum, or supraclavicular fossa.\nSubscription Required.
