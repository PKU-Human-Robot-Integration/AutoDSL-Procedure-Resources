    "Studies employing this technique have received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Board at the University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.\n1. Evaluating diaphragm thickness and thickening fraction during tidal breathing\nIdentifying the diaphragm\n\t\nPlace the patient in a semi-recumbent position (30°-45° from parallel) on their back. Remove any article of clothing from the right side of the chest.\n\t\tNOTE: A similar procedure may be used to visualize the left hemidiaphragm; the left side is generally more difficult to visualize, and measurement precision is reported to be much lower19.\nPower on the tablet powering the portable ultrasound unit and initiate the appropriate application (see Table of Materials). Initiate a musculoskeletal exam with a high-frequency linear array transducer (minimum of 12 MHz).\n\t\tNOTE: Any ultrasound system may be used to perform this technique.\nCover the tip of the linear array transducer with a sufficient amount of ultrasound gel and ensure the ultrasound is in B-mode for positioning. Hold the probe by enclosing the tip of the probe with the thumb and index finger (Figure 2A).\nPalpate the chest wall surface to locate the right eighth, ninth, or 10th intercostal spaces between the mid- and anterior axillary lines, as shown in Figure 1C and Figure 2A, and place the probe in the zone of apposition (typically around the eighth intercostal space).\nAngle the transducer in the sagittal plane so that it is situated entirely between the ribs (Figure 2A) and no rib artifacts are visible in the image (Figure 2B). If a rib appears in the image, adjust the angle of the probe by tilting up or down. If a rib is still visible, rotate the probe until only the diaphragm is visible. If visualization of the diaphragm continues to be problematic, slide the probe up or down to a new intercostal space.",
    "On the ultrasound monitor, identify two bright white parallel lines immediately superior to the liver, indicating the pleural and peritoneal membranes (Figure 2B). The relatively hypoechoic costal diaphragm can be visualized between these lines.\nAdjust the depth of the image by clicking on the increase or decrease depth button to optimize the size of the diaphragm. Ensure the diaphragm is centered on the display monitor. This will ensure maximum resolution of the pleural and peritoneal lines from surrounding structures.\nIf the image remains suboptimal (i.e., the lungs or the ribs are visible in the image or the pleural and peritoneal membranes are not clearly visualized), adjust the probe for better visualization by shifting the probe up and down along the rib space, back and forth from the base, or rotate. See Table 1 for examples of common issues in transdiaphragmatic ultrasonography.\nOptimizing images\n\t\nOnce the transducer is in the correct location, optimize the image quality by altering the following components prior to data collection.\n\t\tNOTE: On different ultrasound unit software, there are model and software differences. In this software, we have performed the following button clicks to achieve the goal.\nOn the ultrasound unit software, click on the gain button to alter the brightness of the image. Increase the gain by clicking the increase button, to make the image appear brighter. Conversely, click the decrease button to darken the image. If the gain is too low, structures may be difficult to ascertain. If the gain is too high, extraneous echoes can appear and the image will appear too bright.\nIf available on the ultrasound unit, click on the focus button to adjust the focus to alter the image quality. Click the increase button to increase the focus or the decrease button to lower the focus.\nAcquiring images",
    "Once placement and image quality have been optimized, place the ultrasound in M-mode by clicking the M-mode button on the ultrasound software.\nA single vertical scan line will appear on the imaging screen. Place the line between the section where the pleural and peritoneal lines are clearest.\n\t\t​NOTE: There may be some variability between ultrasound devices in obtaining M-mode images. Ensure a clear area where well defined pleural and peritoneal membranes are visualized prior to the initiation of M-mode. Place the scan line in a location where pleural and peritoneal membranes are well defined throughout the respiratory cycle and no lungs or ribs enter the field of view.\nRun M-mode over a full cycle of inspiration and expiration during tidal breathing and then click on the freeze and then save buttons to capture the actual state and save the image. If available, adjust the sweep speed by clicking on the sweep speed button to adjust the rate of collection to ensure two respiratory cycles are obtained. Repeat this process to obtain another image.\nWith a skin safe marker, mark the location of the probe on the patient's body, to help ensure the exact same position of the diaphragm is measured over time. This is essential to maintain the reproducibility of the measure, as diaphragm thickness varies over its surface area19.\nFrom these images, the diaphragm thickness (Tdi) and thickening fraction (TFdi) can be measured. If the values from the second M-mode image are not within 10% of the first image, repeat the M-mode image acquisition until two images with a set of values within 10% of each other are obtained. See details on image analysis below.\nOnce the exam is complete, click the end exam button on the ultrasound software.",
    "To export files, click on Export images and ensure the files are exported in DICOM format.\nWipe the patient's side if there is any remaining gel and sanitize the ultrasound equipment with appropriate disinfectant wipes.\nAnalyzing images\n\t\nOpen the necessary DICOM files in MicroDicom DICOM viewer or similar software.\nClick on the \"distance\" tool (may be called calipers or straight line) and draw a straight line from the inner edge of the pleural membrane to the inner edge of the peritoneal membrane at end expiration (Tdi,ee).\nEnsure both membranes are not included in this measurement and that both ends of the straight line are placed directly across (vertically) from each other such that there is no time difference between the markers, which may artificially increase the distance, as per Figure 2B17.\nRecord this value as diaphragm thickness (Tdi,ee).\nRepeat step 4.2 at peak inspiration of the same breath to obtain the diaphragm thickness at peak inspiration (Tdi,pi).\nIf the patient does not appear to be breathing, and no diaphragm thickening fraction is evident during inspiration, measure the Tdi,pi at a location representative of diaphragm thickness during the inspiratory phase (in this case, it will be approximately the same as Tdi,ee), as seen in Figure 3.\nBoth Tdi,ee and Tdi,pi should be analyzed from the same breath, as seen in Figure 2C, to assess the diaphragm thickening fraction during tidal breathing (TFdi).\nUsing Tdi,pi and Tdi,ee, calculate the TFdi for each breath:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65431/65431eq01.jpg\nObtain a second pair of measurements from the same M-mode image (see Figure 2C).\nRepeat steps 1.4.1-1.4.9 on the second M-mode image. At this point, four measurements of Tdi,ee and four measurements of TFdi have been obtained.",
    "If the values from the second M-mode image are not within 10% of the first image, repeat the M-mode image acquisition until two images with a set of values within 10% of each other are obtained.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65431/65431fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Overview of diaphragm anatomy and placement of ultrasound probe. (A) Anatomical structures for ultrasound of the costal diaphragm. The diaphragm consists of the central tendon, costal diaphragm, and crural diaphragm. (B,C) To visualize the the costal diaphragm at the zone of apposition on ultrasound, the patient is placed in the semirecumbent position and the eighth, ninth, or 10th intercostal space is located. A high frequency (>12 MHz) linear array ultrasound probe is placed parallel to the ribs in the intercostal space along the midaxillary line to visualize the costal diaphragm as a cross-section.

(A) The probe is placed at the eighth, ninth, or 10th intercostal space to visualize the diaphragm as a cross-section. (B) In the B-mode image, the white arrows demonstrate the hyperechoic pleural and peritoneal membranes. (C) The M-mode image projects variation in diaphragm thickness at a particular point over time. From left to right, the yellow lines measure diaphragm thickness at end expiration (Tdi,ee) and diaphragm thickness at peak inspiration (Tdi,pi) of the first breath, and red lines denote that of the second breath. Diaphragm thickness (Tdi,ee) measures 1.20 and 1.25 mm, and TFdi 26% and 23%, respectively, in a healthy male subject.

Evaluating the maximal diaphragm thickening fraction",
    "NOTE: The maximal diaphragm thickening fraction may be assessed during the same experimental session as diaphragm thickness.\nAcquiring images\n\t\nUtilizing the same methodology as described above, identify the diaphragm using the B-mode ultrasound and optimize accordingly.\nIn mechanically ventilated patients, ensure that there is adequate respiratory drive for diaphragm functional assessment by measuring the airway occlusion pressure (P0.1) on the ventilator. The P0.1 should be at least 2 cm H2O to proceed. If it is less than 2 cm H2O, consider having sedation or ventilatory support reduced to increase respiratory drive prior to ultrasound imaging.\nOnce the respiratory drive is adequate in mechanically ventilated patients, reduce the ventilatory support to a minimum level (e.g., pressure support ventilation (PSV): 0 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): 0 cm H2O; modest levels of PSV or PEEP may be maintained if needed for gas exchange) to augment diaphragmatic contractility temporarily.\n\t\t​NOTE: The removal of ventilatory support increases respiratory drive and effort to facilitate the assessment of diaphragm function.\nPlace the ultrasound into M-mode by clicking the M-mode button.\nWhile running M-mode, coach the participant to perform a maximal volitional inspiratory effort against a non-occluded airway (i.e., inspiratory capacity maneuver), instructing the participant to \"take a big breath in\" if able.\n\t\nIf the patient is unable to follow commands to make maximal inspiratory efforts, apply a brief airway occlusion maneuver (the Marini maneuver)20 for up to 20 s to stimulate increased respiratory effort. Then, release the occlusion and measure the TFdi,max after releasing the occlusion.\nFreeze the recording and save the image.\nRepeat steps 2.1-2.4 twice more to obtain a total of three M-mode images for analysis, or until the sonographer is confident that the patient has made maximal volitional efforts.\nExport M-mode images in DICOM format for careful offline blinded analysis.",
    "Wipe the patient's side to clean any remaining gel and sanitize the ultrasound equipment with appropriate disinfectant wipes.\nAnalyzing images\n\t\nOpen the necessary DICOM files in MicroDicom DICOM viewer or similar software.\nClick on the distance tool (may be called calipers or straight-line) and draw a straight line from the from inner edge of the pleural membrane to the inner edge of the peritoneal membrane at end expiration (Tdi,ee) and peak inspiration (Tdi,pi) during a maximal inspiratory trial, as seen in Figure 3B.\nEnsure all measurements exclude the pleural and peritoneal membranes and both ends of the straight line are placed directly across (vertically) from each other, such that there is no time difference.\nTFdi,max for each breath is computed as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65431/65431eq02.jpg\nRecord the highest value of at least three consistent attempts as TFdi,max.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65431/65431fig03v2.jpg",
    "Figure 3: Examples of minimal and maximal diaphragm thickening fraction. (A) Ultrasound diaphragm thickness (Tdi) and thickening fraction (TFdi) were measured in the presence of minimal diaphragmatic contraction. If necessary, adjust the sweep speed; two breaths are used to assess for TFdi. In the absence of clear peak inspiratory thickness, the timing of inspiratory effort is determined clinically at the bedside. TFdi here is calculated as 11%, but would be averaged over a further two breaths (total of four breaths captured in two images). (B) Maximal diaphragm thickening fraction measured during maximal inspiratory efforts (TFdi,max) is stimulated either by coaching the patient to make maximal volitional efforts, or following a Marini mauver if the patient is unable to be coached and there is a P0.1 >2 cm H2O. TFdi,max is calculated here as 208%, however the largest value obtained after several (at least three) attempts would be recorded as the TFdi,max. There are pronounced difference in TFdi and Tdi during a maximal inspiration (B) compared to a minimal inspiratory effort (A).
