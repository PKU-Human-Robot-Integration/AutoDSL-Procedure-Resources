    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe basic principle of this assay is based on the ISO 10872 guideline (ISO, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], Höss et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nL1 preparation: day 0\nTiming: 1–2 h\nSynchronous L1 larvae are isolated.\nIsolate eggs as described in step 3 of the “Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section.\nLet eggs hatch for at least 12 h in the absence of food at 20°C in the dark while shaking gently in horizontal position to synchronize (L1 arrest).\nL1 exposure: day 1\nTiming: 1–2 h\nL1 larvae are exposed to chemicals of interest\nPreparation of master mixes for chemical treatments\nPrepare fresh S-Complete medium.\nDilute OP50 suspension with S-Complete to desired concentration to keep worms and offspring well-fed over the 96 h incubation time.\nCritical: Since master mixes are further diluted in the test wells, master mix concentrations should be 1.25 fold higher than the final concentration.\nNote: We applied 109 cfu/mL as final OP50 concentration in our published experiments (Wittkowski et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). To apply OD600 instead of cfu (see note under step 1d in the “Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section) the protocol was adapted using a final OP50 concentration of OD600 = 1.35 which in our hands gives comparable and reproducible results for growth and reproduction.\nAdd chemicals of interest and solvent controls to diluted OP50 suspensions (120 μL per well required). Remember to concentrate 1.25 fold higher than the desired final concentration.\nCritical: Nematode growth and reproduction should be unaffected by solvent controls. Pre-test solvent controls and choose concentrations accordingly. For instance, DMSO affects C. elegans reproduction significantly at concentrations of ≥1% (Wittkowski et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Hence, a lower final concentration of 0.2% DMSO was used.\nPreparation of 96 well plates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/331-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. 96-well plate preparation and chemical treatment of L1 larvae",
    "Fill the 36 edge wells of a 96 well plate (CellCarrier 96, PerkinElmer) with 150 μL water and the 60 inner wells with 30 μL S-Complete.\nNote: Edge wells are excluded since they tend to dry out quicker than inner wells.\nUse a plate shaker to ensure the liquid is on the bottom of the wells.\nDilute synchronized L1 larvae with S-Complete in a petri dish.\nManually pick one individual L1 to each inner well of the prepared 96 well plates (see Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Use a 2.5 μL pipette and a stereo microscope with darkfield illumination. For experienced staff, up to six plates per hour can be handled this way.\nCritical: Worms tend to stick to the surface of plastic equipment. Hence, we recommend to use low retention tips.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S1. Picking L1 larvae into 96-well plates (step 4d)\nUsing a multistep pipette, add 120 μL of the master mix per well and note the exposure starting time.\nIncubate plates for 96 h in a covered box at 20°C in the dark without shaking.\nCritical: Covering the box slows down evaporation of the test wells in the incubator. As the 36 outer wells are filled with water, no additional precautions to prevent the drying of the 60 inner wells should be necessary.",
    "Note: The sample size that should be used depends on the effect size and the targeted statistical power and significance level. Within the setup of this protocol, we use 30 individual worms for the solvent control as well as for each treatment (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Here, the 96 well treatment pattern is important for automatic data acquisition and quantification. In order to use the supplied tools without further adjustments, two treatments should be placed per plate (“Treatment 1”: wells B2–G6 and “Treatment 2”: wells B7–G11). For instructions how to adjust the supplied tools, please be referred to Problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9] in the Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nSample preparation and image acquisition: day 5\nTiming: 1–2 h\nWorms and offspring are stained with rose bengal and food bacteria are removed prior to image acquisition.\nPlate preparation for image acquisition.\nAdd 15 μL rose bengal staining solution (300 mg/L in ddH2O) to each inner well of the plates and distribute by using a plate shaker.\nNote: The staining with rose bengal, a fluorescein analog used to stain dead microorganisms, fulfills two purposes. Firstly, it stains heat-killed worms and offspring bright red (visible spectrum), so that it is easier to control if worms are lost during washing steps (see step 5d). Secondly, the fluorescence of rose bengal allows for the image acquisition (see step 6).\nHeat the plates in an oven to 80°C for 20 min.\nNote: Heat-killing is beneficial for image analyses, because the worms stretch.\nShake the plates vigorously at 900 rpm for 10 s to disperse worms, offspring, and food bacteria.\nNote: Rose bengal stains worms, eggs, and bacteria. Stained bacteria need to be removed for proper image analysis.",
    "Add 100 μL ddH2O to each inner well and let the worms settle for at least 5 min. Do not centrifuge as this will also lead to the settling of stained bacteria you want to wash away. Gently aspirate 100 μL of each well without aspirating worms and offspring using a preferably electronic 100 μL multi-channel pipette (see Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] and Troubleshooting Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S2. Washing 96-well plates (step 5d)\nRepeat step 5c and d up to four times until most of the stain and bacteria has been removed.\nRecord images of whole wells with the Opera Phenix High Content Screening System (PerkinElmer, MA USA). Use a 5× air objective and a fluorescence filter (emission: 570–630 nm; excitation: 561 nm, illumination time: 100 ms at 100% intensity) to generate 9 tiles per well without overlap.\nOptional: Use manual fluorescence microscopy to image whole wells if no high-content device is available (see Troubleshooting Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nData acquisition: day 6\nTiming: 1 h\nThe images are processed for the acquisition of growth and reproduction data (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/331-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overview of data acquisition and quantification steps\nThe following two steps (7 and 8) are only required if using the Opera Phenix High Content Screening System (PerkinElmer, MA USA). When using another device, e.g., manual fluorescence microscopy to image whole wells please see Troubleshooting Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nUse the device software “Harmony” (Perkin Elmer) to export “measurements”, which include images in TIFF format and metadata in XML format. These TIFF files use a 16-bit gray color definition. Using a regular picture viewer (e.g., previewer from Windows) will show far too dark pictures.",
    "Merge image tiles without overlap for whole-well images. As a merging tool, we use “CombineTIFF”, a self-programmed MATLAB-based program specialized for our needs when processing images generated with the Opera Phenix High Content Screening System. Find the software tool (CombineTIFF.exe) and the associated code (CombineTIFF.m) in Mendeley Data (folder: CombineTIFF_Software_and_Code).\nInstall v.9.2 of the MATLAB Runtime on a Windows-based operating system.\nStart “CombineTIFF.exe” and choose the Harmony export directory including raw images and the XML file.\nOptionally give images a suffix, select the channel(s) and choose to merge images without overlap.\nIf single tiles are missing in a well, choose to skip those wells.\nIn the input folder, CombineTIFF generates a new folder named “combinedTIFFs” in which the merged images are stored along with an info TXT file.\nNote: Raw images and the XML file of two example wells can be found in Mendeley Data (folder: Test_data_for_CombineTIFF). Merged test data images of the 60 inner wells of a 96 well plate can also be found in Mendeley Data (folder: Test_data_combinedTIFFs). Here, “Treatment 1” (wells B2–G6) represents a positive control (4 μg/mL prochloraz) and “Treatment 2” (wells B7–G11) a solvent control (0.2% DMSO).\nFor automatic acquisition of worm growth and offspring count, use the open-source software CellProfiler (Carpenter Lab MIT, MA, USA) and open the pipeline “C.elegans_assay.cpproj” that can be downloaded from Mendeley Data (folder: CellProfiler_pipeline). Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows a detailed description of all pipeline steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/331-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Description of CellProfiler pipeline steps\naIn contrast to “Worms_4d” and “Worms_4d_small”, offspring objects are not expanded prior to object measurements to improve the separation of objects.",
    "bChemical treatment may massively affect nematode growth up to a point, at which it is not possible to discriminate small 4-day-old worms (Worms_4d_small) and offspring of unaffected worms (Offspring) by size. Hence, “Worms_4d_small” need to be identified separately. Images of “Worms_4d_small” tend to have more background signal due to an increased amount of stained food bacteria remaining in the wells. In order to avoid false “Offspring” identification, “Worms_4d_small” are defined to have no offspring during data evaluation.\nSee CellProfiler pipeline “C.elegans_assay.cpproj” (Mendeley Data, folder: CellProfiler_pipeline).\nImport the merged images into the pipeline. When using CombineTIFF, these can be found in the “combinedTIFFs” folder (see step 8e). The “Image” module offers a filter option. Use it if you want to filter out other channel images (e.g., brightfield).\nSelect the “ExportToSpreadsheet” module and choose an “output file location” for the excel output files. Change other settings only, if needed. Next, choose the “output file location” of the output images in the six “SaveImages” modules. Here, prefixes describe which objects are highlighted in the output images (“Worms_4d”, “Offspring” and “Worms_4d_small” of both treatments (“_1” and “_2”). We recommend to create a new folder for each set of images.\nStart the analysis by pressing the “Analyze Images” button.\nNote: Run one pipeline for each 96 well plate (60 images). If the well exposure pattern is chosen as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], the “Metadata” and “NamesAndTypes” modules automatically group the treatments. Both treatments run the same pipeline separately and generate separate output data. “Treatment 1” is defined as wells B2–G6 and “Treatment 2” is defined as wells B7–G11. If you plan to choose a different sample size or treatment pattern, see Troubleshooting Problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nData processing of CellProfiler output files",
    "Open the CellProfiler output folder you chose in step 9b. Measured shape parameters of identified “Worms_4d” and “Worms_4d_small” are located in the respective CSV output files “Test_data_Worms_4d.csv” and “Test_data_Worms_4d_small.csv” with the suffix treatment identifier “_1” or “_2” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Information on the identified “Offspring” objects for both treatments are located in the “Offspring.csv” file.\nOpen the CellProfiler CSV output files “Test_data_Worms_4d_1.csv”, “Test_data_Worms_4d_2.csv”, “Test_data_Worms_4d_small_1.csv” and “Test_data_Worms_4d_small_2” and convert the text into columns by “comma” separation.\nCritical: Excel should use a point as decimal delimiter to avoid number alterations in the CSV files.\nCreate one new column in an arbitrary position per file named “Scoring”, starting with a capital letter.\nNow, look at each of the respective CellProfiler “Worm_4d” and “Worm_4d_small” output images (see step 9b) and check if the 4-day-old worms were identified correctly.\nScore objects that were correctly identified as “0” in the “Scoring” column in the respective CSV file, otherwise score them as “1”. Register one score for each object in the “Scoring” column and save the modified files as CSV files. Score objects as “1”, if objects are a) no actual 4-day-old worms (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D), b) fragmented or cut 4-day-old worms (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) and c) major offspring appendages or multiple worms merged together (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). 4-day-old worms with minor offspring appendages are part of the assay variability and can be scored as “0” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/331-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Manual scoring of “Worms_4d”\n(A) Example images: 4-day-old worms with minor offspring appendage (Scoring = 0).\n(B) Example images: 4-day-old worms with major appendage (Scoring = 1).\n(C) Example images: Cut or fragmented 4-day-old worms (Scoring = 1).\n(D) Example images: No actual 4-day-old worms (Scoring = 1).",
    "(E) Test data: identification of \"Worms_4d_2\" (image numbers 17, 19, 29 f.l.t.r.). All test data output images and data CSV files can be downloaded from Mendeley Data (folder: Test_data_CellProfiler_Output).\nNote: Each row describes an identified object in an image. Images with no identified objects are not represented in extra rows. Compare the suffix numbers of the images with the “ImageNumber” column in the excel files to identify the matching row for each image. If two or more objects are identified in the same image, compare the outlined worm area on the images with the values in the “AreaShape_Area” column.\nNote: Include the new “Scoring” column also in empty “Test_data_Worms_4d_small.csv” files.\nNote: As an example, one full set of CellProfiler output CSV files and images of one 96 well plate (“Treatment 1” = 0.2% DMSO, “Treatment 2” = 4 μg/mL prochloraz) can be downloaded from Mendeley Data (folder: Test_data_CellProfiler_Output). Here, “Worms_4d” images of solvent control wells (“Treatment 2”) were all scored “0” except for the offspring clusters in image numbers 17 and 19 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). In “Treatment 2” wells, there are no “Worms_4d_small”, thus, objects can be scored as “1” here. “Worms_4d” of positive control wells (“Treatment 1”) were all identified correctly and scored as “0” accordingly. Image number 11 of “Treatment 1” contains one correctly identified “Worm_4d_small”, which is scored as “0” while all other objects are scored as “1” in the respective CSV file.",
    "Critical: During data evaluation, all wells will be excluded that do not contain exactly one “Worm_4d” or one “Worm_4d_small”, if no “Worm_4d” can be found in the well. According to that, automatic data evaluation excludes all wells not containing exactly one score “0” object. Thus, make sure that only wells with exactly one “Worm_4d” or “Worm_4d_small” have exactly one score “0” object. For instance, if two “Worm_4d” are visible in the same well (compare test data “Treatment 2”: image number 29, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E), always score both of them equally as “1” or “0” in order to exclude this well from evaluation."
