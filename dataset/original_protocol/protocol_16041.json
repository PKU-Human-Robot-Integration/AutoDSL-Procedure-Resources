    "In this protocol, the user will design the target RNA as a hairpin construct. The user will perform secondary structure prediction to confirm that the target RNA retains the structural features of the native (wild-type) sequence. A stable scaffold is crucial when studying small structures like bulges, base mismatches, or base pair switches. Therefore, features like 5′-GG/CC-3′ and UUCG tetraloop are introduced to stabilize the structural region in the RNA stem (see Figs. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0002]). The protocol describes an iterative procedure in which the user modifies the RNA sequence, performs a secondary structure prediction, and compares the fold of the generated target RNA with the native sequence. In addition to the minimum-free-energy structure, higher-energy structures are also analyzed to account for potential variability in the conformational ensemble. After Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0001], the user will obtain an RNA sequence that will be used to design a DNA template, which will be then used to synthesize and purify the RNA target. Typically, a 5′-GG sequence is introduced to stabilize the stem and to provide higher yields in the IVT reaction, as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002]. If this is not possible (e.g., due to destabilization of the predicted structure), the user should consider the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0003], as it is not dependent on the initiation sequence of the RNA.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8e7f0d46-1392-4fc2-8ffe-fd0b11efa946/cpz1159-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Example of RNA construct design. The first row shows nucleotide 1427–1434 and 1467–1474 of h44 of the 16S ribosomal RNA of the small subunit of the E.coli ribosome (Moazed, Stern, & Noller, 1986[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-bib-0015]), predicted as a part of 102mer sequence corresponding to h44 by MC-Fold 2.32, as our target construct. The middle row shows the first designed construct, a 27mer hairpin construct, containing enclosing GG/CC base pairs at the 5′/3′ end, respectively, and a UUCG tetraloop. The 27mer construct contains the desired sequence (blue part) from the h44 RNA target, and similar secondary structures to those of the full sequence within the same free energy range are predicted. The bottom row shows a redesign, as it became evident by NMR measurements that the UUCG loop did not form properly. Therefore, an additional GC base pair (red) was added to stabilize the construct even further, which led to the proposed structure confirmed by NMR.

Input target RNA sequence 5′ to 3′ as one string of letters (A/U/G/C) into MC-Fold.\n2. Consider whether addition of 5′-GG/CC-3′ or a central UUCG loop can be incorporated into the sequence or if the sequences would perturb the biological function. If the sequences would not perturb function, add them to the MC-Fold input.\n3. Inspect output and folding properties of the RNA sequence with and without the added 5′-GG/CC-3′ ends, considering:\n         \nDoes the molecule fold as expected? That is, does the smaller RNA fragment show a similar base-pairing pattern or secondary structure compared with a known secondary structure or the predicted structure of the sequence within the larger RNA molecule (Figs. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0002])?\nA known secondary structure could, for instance, come from existing structural data.",
    "Are the wanted secondary structure properties stable over a large energy range? In other words, does the change in base paring pattern agree between the smaller RNA fragment and the secondary structure pattern of the large RNA when looking at higher energy structures?\nHow would deletion or addition (±1) products affect the folding? For instance, would deletion products be more prone to fold differently or show unfolded structures? Would ±1 products lead to more excessive base pair openings within the same free energy interval as the full-length product?\nNote that deletion and addition products are unwanted common byproducts of IVT, and while the protocols described here will aid in reducing them, they might still be present.\nIf adding 5′-GG/3′-CC or ±1 products leads to unwanted folding, consider using the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0003] to create a DNA template for tandem transcription instead.\nIs it feasible to add GG to the 5′ end and CC to the 3′ ea end of the RNA to improve transcription?\nIf the intention is to create a size-reduced hairpin construct that contains a part of a larger biological molecule, addition of 5′-GG and 3′-CC is feasible and advisable. An example where this might not be feasible is if a biologically active RNA imposes restraints on the sequence at the 5′ or 3′ ends, such as a microRNA or part of a messenger RNA.\n4. Repeat steps 1 through 3, modifying your RNA sequence, and study how sequence modifications are predicted to impact the overall fold.",
    "When the small RNA fragment has a sequence that displays a similar set of secondary structures as the large RNA within the same free energy interval, and the small structure does not seem to unfold, a suitable sequence has been obtained and the user can proceed to IVT following either Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002] or the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0003].",
    "This protocol describes how to take the RNA sequence designed in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0001] and generate a ssDNA template for it. The user will add a T7 promoter to the target sequence. As the T7 RNA polymerase can transcribe from both ssDNA or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates but requires a 17-base-pair dsDNA promoter region, the user will then anneal a T7 promoter DNA oligo to the target sequence. Despite the selected sequence having a 5′-GG, yield and length heterogeneity are sequence dependent, and thus the transcription reaction should be optimized. Initial conditions for such an optimization screen, in a small-scale volume (50 µl), are provided (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-tbl-0001]). The results of the screen are then analyzed via denaturing PAGE (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0003]) to select the optimal transcription conditions. The best conditions (i.e., those producing the highest yield) are then used for a large-scale IVT reaction (>10 ml), which is then purified (see Basic Protocols 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0004] and 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0005]).

    "It is recommended to prepare several volumes of 30 μl annealing mixtures in order to have sufficient amounts of DNA for optimization and large-scale transcription reactions (plan for 16 μl annealed DNA/ml transcription reaction). Avoid pipetting small amounts as the error is usually larger.\n6. Heat 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes with the annealing mixtures in a heating block at 95°C for 5 min.\nIf the construct has a high GC content (>60%) or is particularly long (DNA coding for RNA >40 nt), heating might need to be extended to 10 min.\n7. Cool immediately on ice mixed with a small amount of NaCl to increase cooling effect, and continue cooling for 30 min.\nThe DNA template is now ready for transcription.\nThe annealed DNA templates can be stored at –20°C for several months. It is recommended to label this tube, as one might want to reuse in the future.\nOptimize in vitro transcription\n8.

Start with these 14 test reaction conditions, and adjust if needed.\n9. Once all reactants—except T7 polymerase—have been mixed in the microcentrifuge tubes, preheat tubes in a water bath at 37°C for 5 min.\n10. Add T7 polymerase to each test tube according to the manufacturer's specification.",
    "11. Incubate reaction tubes in a water bath at 37°C for 2 hr.\nPerform analytical gel electrophoresis\n12. Set up Protean II gel casting system, or equivalent available system, according to the manufacturer's specifications.\n13. Mix 50 ml PAGE solution with 300 μl of 10% (w/v) APS and 30 μl TEMED, and pour into gel casting system. Let gel polymerize for 15 min.\n14. Mount polymerized gel in the electrophoresis system, and fill apparatus with 1× TBE. Preheat gel at 12 W power (or according to manufacturer's instructions for other systems) for ∼15 min.\nA homogeneous temperature in the gel while running is important in order to obtain good migration of the bands; temperature differences will create a “smiling” gel. In some gel systems, it is possible to fill the inner chamber with water, normally used for cooling of nondenaturing gels; use of an aluminum plate is an alternative. Filling with water without cooling can help increase temperature homogeneity and, therefore, reduce “smiling.”\n15. Mix 1 μl of each individual transcription reaction with 9 μl formamide-based gel loading solution in a new, labeled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n16. Heat tubes at 95°C for 1 to 2 min.\n17. Clean wells of the gel from excess urea with a syringe.\n18. Load 9.5 μl mixtures from step 15 onto the gel. Add ladder or reference with the correct expected size. Run gel at 12 to 14 W for 2 hr to achieve good resolution (until the first dye is at the end of the gel).\n19. Stain gel for 10 min in ethidium bromide prepared by adding 20 μl of 1% (v/v) ethidium bromide solution to 1 L water (alternative: SYBR™ Gold).\nUse double gloves when handling the ethidium bromide and stained gels.",
    "20. Destain gel in water for 10 min to obtain an even stain.\n21. Inspect how the transcription reactions performed by analyzing gel using a UV board and camera (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0003]).\nThe reaction exhibiting the strongest target band with the correct size and the fewest side products (e.g., Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0003]), especially with regard to ±1 products, indicates the most promising condition for further optimization (which would involve repeating steps 8 to 21). Typically, two to four rounds of optimization are required for a good yield with low amounts of side products. The higher the yield and purity at this point, the easier and more successful the HPLC purification step will be.\nPerform large-scale transcription reaction\n22. Based on the outcome of the analytical gel electrophoresis, band intensities, and distribution of deletion products, choose the best-performing reaction conditions.\nFor a well-optimized reaction condition, the fluorescence of the band from the main transcript should be as intense as possible in relation to possible deletion or addition products. If several conditions give similar band intensities, choose the one that uses the smallest amount of expensive reagents.\n23. Scale up optimum reaction condition, commonly at a 10- to 15-ml reaction scale, depending on required yield (3% to 7% typical yield of input-limiting NMP). Prepare reaction in the same way as the small-scale reactions, but incubate at 37°C overnight.\nIt is wise to plan the large-scale reaction thoroughly, to treat expensive reactants (e.g., 13C-/15N-labeled NTPs, RNaseOUT, etc.) with great care, and to be careful to avoid RNase contamination. Also consider the cost factor for a linear scale-up of a reaction condition that uses large amounts of certain reactants (e.g., RNaseOUT, iPPase), as perhaps a slightly worse performing reaction condition can result in a better yield:cost ratio.",
    "This protocol can be used instead of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002] in order to produce the target RNA designed in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0001]. We have found this protocol to be particularly useful when addition of a 5′-GG sequence to the target RNA is not feasible or when the approach described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0001] yields little and/or impure RNA. The procedure is based on transcribing repeated units (in tandem) from a plasmid template, followed by RNase H processing, which releases the target RNA units for further HPLC purification in a sequence-specific manner (Feyrer, Munteanu, Baronti, & Petzold, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-bib-0006]). The use of the tandem template and further cleavage of target units allows the use of a high-yield initiation site. The high sequence specificity of RNase H is provided by a chimeric cleavage oligo (12 nt), which results in high-purity target RNA at the end of the protocol (see Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0004]). Since a plasmid template is used, initial cost and effort are increased, as the plasmid needs to be amplified in bacteria first. Design and preparation of both the plasmid template and the cleavage guide oligo are described at the beginning of the protocol. In vitro transcription and RNase H cleavage are tested first in a small scale, similar to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002], and are thereafter scaled up for RNA production. Escherichia coli RNase H is fully active in T7 IVT buffers, and the transcription and cleavage reactions can therefore be performed in the same tube. Many constructs do not need an annealing procedure for the RNase H cleavage guide, and the cleavage reaction can be performed simultaneously to the transcription reaction. After this protocol, the user will obtain an RNA sample ready for purification with Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0005] (ion-exchange [IE] HPLC).",
    "The RNA produced following this protocol contains fewer abortion products, which facilitates purification. Therefore, Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0004] (RP-IP HPLC) is generally skipped when following the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0003].",

In the example described here, the target sequence is 20 nt long. All sequences are written as “sense” strands, meaning the target RNA sequence can simply be converted to a DNA sequence by changing U to T. Gene synthesis will automatically produce the reverse complement template.\n1. Open cloning tool of choice (e.g., SnapGene or SerialCloner) to design the sense strand of the template.\n2. Start with the T7 promoter sequence as a sense strand, and add the high-yield initiation sequence (standard T7 promotor: 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TA^G GGA GA-3′).\nRNA transcription will start at the position indicated with ^.\n3. Add the last 8 nt of the target RNA sequence as a 5′ spacer (using T instead of U; Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0004]).\n4. Add tandem repeats of the RNA target sequence (using T instead of U) until nucleotide limit of the chosen manufacturer is reached (e.g., 600 nt limit from GenScript).",
    "5. Add the first 4 nt of the target RNA sequence at the end as a 3′ spacer (using T instead of U).\n6. Add a BamHI restriction sequence (or other unique restriction site; Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0004]).\n7. Order high-copy plasmid (e.g., pUC19) with above designed insert.\nDesign cleavage guide oligo\nThe 12 nt cleavage guide oligo is comprised of four central DNA nucleotides, which are crucial for the activity of E. coli RNase H. The enzyme cleaves the RNA strand opposite the DNA 5′ end. This sequence is flanked by 2′-OMe modified nucleotides, which enhance specificity and cleavage efficiency but do not change the cleavage site. In brief, the cleavage guide oligo is designed to overlap with 8 nt of the first repeat and with 4 nt of the second repeat and cleaves so that the DNA 5′ end aligns with the separation of first and last repeats (Inoue, Hayase, Iwai, & Ohtsuka, 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-bib-0010]; see Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0004]).\n8. Take the last 8 nt of the RNA sequence (5′–3′), and add the first 4 nt on the 3′ end.\nExample for a 20 nt sequence: 5′-N13-N14-N15-N16-N17-N18-N19-N20-N1-N2-N3-N4-3′, where N1 refers to the nucleotide number of the target RNA generated in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0001] taken from the 5′ end.\nCheck if this sequence appears more than once, even with mismatches, in the flanking regions. If it does, extend flanks to create a unique oligo of up to 18 nt. If this is not possible, the tandem transcript method might not be applicable for your construct.\n9. Create the complimentary DNA strand of this sequence (e.g., with IDT oligo analyzer: https://eu.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer[href=https://eu.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer]).\nExample: 5′-C4-C3-C2-C1-C20-C19-C18-C17-C16-C15-C14-C13-3′, where C1 refers to the complementary Watson–Crick partner of N1.",
    "10. Convert the first four and the last 4 nt to 2′-OMe-modified versions by adding “m” before the base identity (U stays mU for synthesis reasons). Order the oligo from IDT or other commercial supplier.\nExample: 5′-mC4-mC3-mC2-mC1-C20-C19-C18-C17-mC16-mC15-mC14-mC13-3′, where mC1 is the 2′-OMe-modified version of C1. HPLC purification is not required.\nPrepare plasmid\n11. Amplify plasmid (ordered in step 7) in E. coli using a commercial maxiprep kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\n12.

The plasmid can be stored at –20°C for several months and thawed right before use. A cleanup of the reaction is not necessary but is recommended (e.g., using Monarch DNA/PCR cleanup kit; New England BioLabs, cat. no. T1030S).\n13. Confirm linearization on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel:\n         \nDissolve 1 g agarose in 100 ml of 0.5× TBE by heating in a microwave.\nAdd 10 µl GelRed and mix well.\nPour hot agarose solution into electrophoresis chamber, and let cool for ∼30 min. Insert comb.\nOnce solidified, insert chamber into the running tank, and fill with 0.5× TBE until the gel is covered.\nPrepare samples at a total amount of 50 to 100 ng plasmid, and add DNA loading dye (shipped with restriction enzyme).\nRemove comb and load samples by carefully pipetting into wells. Add DNA ladder.\nRun gel at 150 V for 30 min.\nImage gel using a UV illuminator.",
    "Successful linearization is shown by a single band that is slightly shifted upward compared with the band representing the nonlinearized plasmid. Note that the circular plasmid (run as a negative control) often shows multiple bands from multiple supercoiling states.\nPerform small-scale in vitro transcription\n14.

After 1 hr, the reaction is usually not complete, and higher molecular weight species from multimeric tandem repeats are to be expected. Despite higher molecular weight species, the user can move on to the overnight reaction scale-up if the target band appears clearly after 1 hr.\nPerform large-scale in vitro transcription reaction\n17. Prepare 10-ml reaction with the concentrations described in step 14.\n18. Run reaction overnight at 37°C.\n19. Analyze transcription and cleavage on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. If only the target band and cleavage guide are visible, move on to IE HPLC purification (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0005]), and skip RP-IP HPLC (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0004]).",
    "Lane 2 in Figure 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0004] shows a successful cleavage reaction ready for IE HPLC purification.\nDue to the absence of RNAs of similar length, larger amounts of RNA can be purified in a single HPLC step. If a well-performing gradient has been found, up to the equivalent of a 20-ml transcription reaction can be injected at once.\n20. If higher molecular compounds are still present, perform an annealing step and another RNase H cleavage reaction:\n         \nHeat reaction mixture (from step 15) in a conventional microwave for 10 to 15 s at 450 W in a closed 50-ml centrifuge tube.\nThe solution might reach the boiling point.\nLet solution cool for 30 min at 37°C and then for 30 min at room temperature.\nA precipitate may form.\nAdd the same amounts of iPPase and RNase H as in step 14.\nIncubate at 37°C for 3 hr, and analyze cleavage success on a denaturing gel.\nIf cleavage is still incomplete, repeat step 20.\nHeating large amounts of RNA solution can take a long time, which allows for Mg2+-catalyzed RNA hydrolysis. Use of a microwave oven significantly reduces this time and avoids the need for aliquoting the sample. So far, we have not seen adverse effects of microwave irradiation.\n21. Quench reaction by adding EDTA to 50 mM and vortex thoroughly.\n22. Filter solution through a 0.22-µm syringe filter, and concentrate using an Amicon Ultra concentrator for injection into HPLC, depending on injection loop size (e.g., 5 ml).",
    "This protocol describes the purification of the in vitro‒transcribed RNA material from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002], first with a crude purification step using RP-IP HPLC. During the preparation phase, precipitated magnesium pyrophosphates (iPP) are dissolved with an EDTA solution (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0002]; Karlsson, Baronti, & Petzold, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-bib-0012]) and proteins precipitated by heat denaturation. After this preparation, initial purification with RP-IP HPLC removes many of the shorter IVT products, reaction components, and possible residual, microscopic iPP particles. Therefore, performing the RP-IP purification step reduces the load on the IE column in the second HPLC purification step described in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0005].

Remove large-scale transcription reaction from the water bath (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002] step 23), and centrifuge potential iPP pellet 5 min at 2000 × g, 4°C.\n2. Distribute supernatant between several microcentrifuge tubes (∼1 ml each), taking care not to disturb the pellet.\n3. Dissolve iPP pellet using 40 mM EDTA. Aliquot this material into new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (∼1 ml each).\nTypically, addition of 3 to 5 ml EDTA should dissolve the pellet immediately.\n4. Heat all microcentrifuge tubes (ones containing supernatants and ones containing dissolved iPP pellet) in a heating block for ∼3 min to denature proteins. Cool tubes on ice, forming a precipitate.\nFor large-scale transcription reactions containing DMSO, it is advisable to heat the tubes in a ventilated area/fume hood.\n5. Once tubes are cold, briefly centrifuge using a table-top microcentrifuge.\n6. Using a syringe and syringe filter, filter supernatants into an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit.\n7. Concentrate filtered material to a volume suitable for the injection loop of the HPLC system. Keep RNA material on ice.\nFor the RP column and buffer system suggested here, it is recommended to inject volumes corresponding to 3 to 5 ml of the original transcription reaction mixture.\nEquilibrate column\n8.

It is recommended to perform a test injection with a smaller amount of material pooled from optimization tests. It is especially important to confirm that the gradient and expected elution times are correct before injecting expensive, isotope-labeled RNA. Always collect material eluted earlier and later separately, and discard only when the desired RNA sample has been confirmed by analytical PAGE.\n11. Inject RNA material onto the RP column using the gradient from step 10. Once the HPLC run is completed, label fraction tubes, and store in the freezer.\nAn example of a chromatogram is shown in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b9e66b35-5a08-4741-ba81-853ed844de5f/cpz1159-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nExample RP-IP chromatogram of a 29mer RNA construct.

Load 1 to 5 μl on a gel, and analyze according to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002] steps 12 to 21.\nPreparing gels while the HPLC is eluting and running gels in parallel with following HPLC runs will help optimize time.\n15. Based on PAGE results, pool all HPLC fractions in which the transcript of interest is dominating (i.e., band intensity of the wanted transcription product is higher than of unwanted products; Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0005]).\n16. Concentrate pooled fractions using an Amicon Ultra concentrator. Store concentrate at –20°C if the IE step is not performed immediately.\nThe pooled fraction can now be used in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0005].\nMake sure that the pooled fractions from the RP-IP purification do not contain a higher concentration of acetonitrile than what is tolerable for the centrifugal filter units. For Amicon Ultra-15, this value is 20% (v/v). If the acetonitrile content is higher than that, dilute the pooled fractions with water before adding them to the centrifugal filter. Even if the acetonitrile concentration is below the limit, monitor absorbance of the flow-through at 260 nm using a UV spectrophotometer to avoid unnecessary loss of material, as the filter unit might leak after prolonged use. If the total volume of the wanted fractions is large (i.e., in the range of 50 to 100 ml solution), several concentrator filters can be used in parallel to speed up this step and avoid loss of RNA due to membrane leakage.",
    "This protocol describes the final purification step of the workflow, in which RNA is purified with IE HPLC. Here, the user purifies the RNA material by distributing it between several injections onto a heated IE column and separates it using a perchlorate-based buffer system.

It is advised to perform a test injection prior to injecting important and/or expensive material as suggested in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0004]. This can be done using, for instance, non-isotopically labeled RNA material from IVT optimization tests that were used for possible tests on the RP-IP system in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0004].\n4.

Perform PAGE according to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002] steps 12 to 21.\n6. Prepare HPLC fractions that are expected to contain the desired target. Load fractions on a gel, and analyze according to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0002] steps 12 to 21 (see Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-fig-0006]).\nPreparing gels while the HPLC is eluting and running gels in parallel with following HPLC runs will help optimize time.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4996c36a-6f7c-4c1a-b4b2-04b5b3842d17/cpz1159-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",
    "Example IE chromatogram of a 29mer RNA construct. (A) Injection of 2 ml of a transcription reaction that has been prepurified by RP-IP following Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0004]. The chromatogram represents one of five injections. (B) Close-up of fractions from the green area of the chromatogram in A loaded on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The green arrowhead indicates the target band. (C) Pooled and concentrated fractions at high concentration to estimate purity. The three samples on the left are from HPLC fractions that were purer (e.g., right-most two fractions in B), whereas the three samples on the right are from fractions considered less pure. In this example, all of these fractions were pooled to a final sample with a concentration of 0.84 mM in a volume of 250 μl. HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; IE, ion-exchange; RP-IP, reversed-phase ion-pairing. Adapted and reprinted with permission from Karlsson et al.

Pool fractions considered pure in an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit, and start concentrating material in a centrifuge at 2000 × g, 4°C.\nFor Amicon Ultra concentrators with a 15-ml reservoir volume and 3-kDa cutoff size, a centrifuging session of 20 min is a good starting point. As in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.159#cpz1159-prot-0004], several filter units can be used in parallel to speed up concentration.\n8. Once the material has been concentrated to <1.5 ml, exchange buffer to one suitable for subsequent experiments of interest (e.g., NMR buffer) by performing a 10-fold dilution and reconcentrating at least three times.\nAt this stage, users can choose any type of buffer suitable for their experimental goals. See Reagents and Solutions for a buffer suitable for NMR experiments.\n9. Fold RNA by distributing the sample (∼10 ml) into several microcentrifuge tubes, heating to 95°C for 3 min, and cooling rapidly on ice.",
    "This is done to ensure homogeneous folding of the RNA.\n10. Once the material has cooled after the folding step, continue with the final concentration down to the final volume.\nIn order to obtain very small volumes and high concentrations, as might be desirable for NMR samples, use the smaller 0.5-ml Amicon Ultra concentrator."
