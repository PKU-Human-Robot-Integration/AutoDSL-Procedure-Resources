    "1. Prepare Affinity Capture Devices16\nClean the silicon nitride E-chips by incubating them in 15 ml of acetone for 2 min followed by 15 ml of methanol for 2 min (Figure 1A). Allow chips to dry under laminar air-flow.\nIncubate the dried chips on a heated stir plate (without stirring) for 1.5 hr at 150 °C, then allow them to cool to room temperature before use.\nUse Hamilton syringes to compose lipid mixtures in small glass tubes to contain 25% chloroform, 55% DLPC (1,2-dilauroyl-phosphocholine) in chloroform (1 mg/ml) and 20% Ni-NTA lipid (1,2-dioleoyl-iminodiacetic acid-succinyl-nickel salt) in chloroform (1 mg/ml) for a total volume of 40 μl.\nApply a 1 μl aliquot of the mixture over each 15 μl drop of Milli-Q water on a piece of Parafilm in a humid Petri dish (Figure 1B). Incubate samples on ice for at least 60 min.\n2. Capture Macromolecules17\nPlace an E-chip with a 150 nm integrated spacer on top of a monolayer sample and incubate for 1 min (Figure 1C).\nGently lift the chip off of the sample and add a 3 μl aliquot of His-tagged Protein A. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature (Figure 1D).\nBlot away the excess drop using Whatman #1 filter paper and immediately add a 3 μl aliquot of antibody solution. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature.\nRemove the excess solution using a Hamilton syringe and immediately add a 1 μl aliquot of rotavirus DLPs (0.1 mg/ml) in buffer solution containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2. Incubate for at least 2 min at room temperature. The preparation of DLPs has been described previously18.\n3. Assemble the Microfluidic Chamber and Load the In situ Specimen Holder",
    "Load the wet E-chip containing the viral sample into the tip of the microfluidic specimen holder. Glow-discharge a second flat E-chip for 1 min then loaded on top of the spacer chip (Figure 2, panels 1-5).\nAlternatively, to increase the contrast of biological macromolecules, heavy metal stain (e.g. 0.2% uranyl formate) can be added to wet specimens prior to placing the second E-chip on the wet specimen. However, the E-chip containing the specimen will need to be washed with Milli-Q water prior to adding the contrast reagent.\nSandwich the entire assembly together to form a sealed enclosure, held in place mechanically within the holder by 3 brass screws (Figure 2, panels 6-8).\nFollowing assembly, the tip of the holder is pumped to 10-6 Torr using a turbo-pumped dry pumping station before placing the holder inside the TEM.\n4. Imaging in Liquid Using a Transmission Electron Microscope\nLoad the in situ specimen holder into a Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI Company) equipped with a LaB6 filament and operating at 120 kV.\nTurn on the TEM filament and adjust the eucentric height of the microscope stage with respect to the specimen by using the wobbler function to tilt the sample from -15° to +15° back and forth in the column. This procedure adjusts the stage in the z-direction to help account for the proper thickness of the liquid chamber. This step also ensures an accurate magnification is used when recording images.\nRecord images along the edges and in the corner regions of the microfluidic chamber first. These areas typically contain the thinnest solution. Record images of specimens under low-dose conditions (1-3 electrons/Å2) using a CCD camera. Use nominal magnifications of 6,000X - 30,000X.",
    "Determine the proper defocus value by focusing at the edge of fluidic chamber. Use a value of -1.5 μm to record images at 30,000X magnification. If thick solution is encountered or if contrast agent is not used in the specimen preparation, use higher defocus values in the range of -2 to -4 μm.\nTo ensure solution is contained in the microfluidic chamber throughout the experiments, focus the electron beam until the bubbles are formed in the liquid within the device.\nSubscription Required.
