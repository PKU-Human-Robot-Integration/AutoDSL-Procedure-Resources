    "1. Preparation of methacrylated coverslips\nNOTE: Glass coverslips are methacrylated to covalently link PA hydrogels and therefore prevent their detachment during the incubation with cells. Microscope glass coverslips are used to achieve high image quality.\nTo prepare a 300 mL solution, take a clean 400 mL glass beaker and place it inside a fume hood.\nAdd 10 mL of double distilled water (ddH2O) into the beaker. Add 18.75 mL of acetic acid (≥99.8% pro analysis, p.a.), 18.75 mL of 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate and 252.5 mL of ethanol (≥99.8% p.a.) using a serological pipette. Pour the solution into a crystallizing dish.\nClean 24 mm round glass coverslips with precision wipes. Place the coverslips in a custom-made polytetrafluorethylene rack.\nImmerse the rack into the solution and incubate for 15 min at room temperature (RT).\nTake the rack and rinse all coverslips with ethanol (99.8% p.a.). Dry the coverslips under air flow.\n\tNOTE: Methacrylated coverslips can be stored for up to 1 month at RT.\n2. Micropatterning of extracellular matrix proteins on glass coverslips\nNOTE: Glass coverslips are first coated with a layer of molecules, comprising of protein and cell repellent. This layer is then removed using a photopatterning technique, to allow the subsequent deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in micropatterned regions.\nTake a 15 mm round glass coverslip and place it on a Petri dish. Use a diamond pen to mark the upper side of the coverslip. Then, proceed to cleaning via oxygen plasma treatment at 0.4 mbar and 200 W for 2 min.\nPipette 100 µL of 0.01% poly-L-lysine solution on the surface of each coverslip. Incubate for 30 min at RT. Wash the coverslips with 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 8.5. Remove any excess liquid but keep the surface wet.",
    "Pipette 100 µL of 50 mg/mL poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether succinimidyl valeric acid (mPEG-SVA) in 10 mM HEPES pH 8.5 on the surface of each coverslip. Incubate for 1 h at RT. Rinse the coverslips with 10 mM HEPES pH 8.5 and dry off under air flow.\nAdd 2 µL of UV-sensitive photoinitiator (e.g., PLPP-gel) followed by 40 µL of ethanol (≥99.8% p.a.) onto the surface. To obtain a homogeneous distribution of the gel and ethanol on the surface, gently tilt the Petri dish back and forth. Wait for 5 min for the solution to polymerize.\nPlace a single coverslip inside a 35 mm Petri dish with a 20 mm hole at the bottom. This allows the laser beam coming from underneath to directly reach the glass surface.\nTurn on the microscope and a light patterning module (working with this device is only permitted after a safety introduction from the laser safety officers). Calibrate the UV-A laser on the 20x air objective. Put the sample with the photoinitiator on the stage. Adjust the focus on the surface of the glass and turn on the focus control. Load and lock the pre-drawn pattern.\n\t\nPrepare the pattern using a graphics software like Inkscape. Ensure that the pattern file does not exceed the DMD dimensions (1824 x 1140 px, which corresponds to 552 x 325 µm on 20 x lens (0.28 µm/px)).\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use the DMD size (1824 x 1140 pixels) as the pattern file size, as this will ensure no error during the patterning. For example, do not produce a pattern file with 1830 x 1130 pixels dimension.",
    "For the purpose of pattern transfer to polyacrylamide, ensure that the patterning is done only up to 60%-70 % of the radius from the center of the glass to the edge.\nFor patterning a single cell, use a diameter of 50-100 µm with the distance of 100 µm between patterns and a diameter of 150-300 µm for a cell group. The appropriate pattern size highly depends on the typical cell size, and it has to be sufficiently large to allow cells to adhere.\nStart the patterning by UV dose of 30 mJ/mm2. The patterning duration depends on the number of patterns. Making a single pattern takes approximately 1 s.\nAfter completing the patterning step, rinse the surface with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times. Incubate the sample with 100 µL of 25 µg/mL fibronectin dissolved in 1x PBS and 25 µg/mL fibrinogen Alexa488 conjugate in PBS for 1 h at RT. For other ECM proteins, find the optimal concentrations completely covering the patterned regions.\nRinse the surface with 1x PBS three times. Ensure that the patterned glass is immediately used for glass-PA transfer. Store the patterned glass in PBS at RT during the hydrogel preparation.\n3. Fabrication of patterned polyacrylamide hydrogels\nNOTE: Polyacrylamide hydrogels are prepared, including oxidized N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide (HEA) to present reactive aldehyde groups for the covalent binding of matrix proteins on the surface. Additionally, a dual-layer approach to embed fluorescent beads only on the top layer of the hydrogel is used to improve the recording of bead displacement during traction force microscopy experiments.\nPut the methacrylated glass coverslips into a Petri dish.",
    "To prepare fresh oxidized HEA solution, add 9.55 mL of double-distilled water into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Then, add 0.5 mL of HEA, and 42 mg of sodium(meta)periodate to get 10 mL of the solution. Continuously stir the solution in the dark for 4 h.\nMix acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, and double-distilled water according to Table 1, to get 10 mL of stock solution hydrogel (do it under the fume hood, monomers are neurotoxic). Degas and close the lid to an airtight seal.\n\tNOTE: The stock solution can be kept in aliquots for up to 1 year at 4 °C. Always characterize the Young's modulus of the hydrogel prior to use.\nPrepare a dual-layered PA hydrogel (do it under the fume hood, monomers are neurotoxic).\n\t\nStart with the bottom layer by gently mixing 99.3 µL of stock solution, 0.5 µL of 1% ammonium persulfate (APS), and 0.2 µL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) in a 1.5 mL tube. Take 10 µL from the solution and pipette it dropwise on the center of the methacrylated coverslip.\nCarefully place a 15 mm round coverslip on the droplet and wait for 45 min for polymerization. Gently detach the top coverslip with a scalpel.\nFor the top layer, gently mix 93.3 µLof stock solution with 1 µL of fresh oxidized HEA solution, 5 µL of fluorescent beads (corresponding to three beads per square micron for beads of 200 nm sized beads), 0.5 µL of 1% APS, and 0.2 µL of TEMED in a 1.5 mL tube. Take 5 µL from the solution and pipette it dropwise on the center of the already polymerized bottom layer.",
    "Gently place the micropatterned coverslip on the droplet. Wait for 45 min at RT for the droplet to polymerize. Make sure the patterned side touches the droplet. Gently detach the coverslip with a scalpel.\nGlue the 24 mm coverslips to the bottom of custom-drilled 6-well plates using two-component silicone-glue. After 5 min, add PBS to the wells.\nCharacterize the Young's modulus of the polyacrylamide hydrogel samples by atomic force microscopy (AFM).\n\t\nMount a spherical tip cantilever on the AFM holder.\nCalibrate each cantilever by acquiring a force-distance curve (3-4 V setpoint) on a hard substrate (e.g., glass or mica), extrapolate the cantilever sensitivity, retract from the surface, and perform a thermal tune to get their spring constant.\nPlace the calibrated cantilevers over the hydrogel sample and acquire force curves in PBS buffer, using the following parameters: 20-30 nN force setpoint, 5 or 10 µm/s approach and retraction speed, 5 µm ramp size.\n\t\tNOTE: An inverted optical microscope, equipped with an air 40x objective and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) filter was used to visualize and target ECM-micropatterned areas within the PA hydrogel samples.\nPlot the acquired force versus distance curves with the AFM analysis software.\nFind the contact point and convert force versus distance curves into force versus indentation curves.\nFit the indentation part of the curve with Hertz model (or a suitable mechanics model in function of the tip geometry), using a Poisson ratio between 0.2 and 0.5.\n4. Local release of cell traction forces by UV-A laser illumination (LUVI-TFM)",
    "NOTE: UV-A laser is applied to release traction forces in cells localized in defined regions of the hydrogels. The UV-A laser (i.e., λ = 375 nm solid-state laser, <15 mW) is a class 3B laser. The unshielded laser beam is dangerous to the eyes and often for the skin. Reflected and scattered light and radiation can be dangerous. Moreover, UV radiation may cause skin cancer. Working with devices is only permitted after safety introduction from the laser safety officers.\nAspirate the PBS from the wells.\nSeed 3 x 106 cells per 6-well plate in growth medium. For fibroblasts, use high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing L-glutamine and supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Incubate the cells overnight at 37 °C/5% CO2. Wash samples to remove floating cells before starting microscopy.\nTurn on the microscope incubation chamber and gas supply to obtain a temperature of 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nTurn on the microscope and the laser patterning module. If necessary, re-calibrate the UV-A laser on the 20x air objective using the Leonardo software. Place the custom-made 6-well plate with the samples on the stage. Adjust focus on the surface of the PA.\nSetup the illumination pattern and mark the cells of interest. Refocus on the surface of the hydrogel. Acquire the image of the cells in the brightfield channel. Switch to the Cy5 channel (far-red filter, 650 nm excitation, 670 nm emission) and take an image of beads in the deformed state.\nShift to the laser channel. Turn on the laser for 3 min. In our particular setup, this corresponded to a light dose of 6,000 mJ/mm2.\nSwitch to the Cy5 channel and acquire an image of the beads in the undeformed state.",
    "NOTE: For experiment using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wait for 15 min post-exposure to record the reference/undeformed image (See the Representative Results section). It might be different for other type of cells. Repeat steps 4.5-4.7 again for another cell(s) of interest.\nTo measure the elevated oxidative stress after UV-A illumination, use the commercially available reagent (CellRox). CellRox is non-fluorescent in the reduced state and, when oxidized by reactive oxygen species, fluoresces with an emission maximum of ~665 nm.\nAccording to the provided protocol, add 5 µM reagent into the imaging media and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C/5% CO2. Then, wash the cells 3x with warm 1x PBS and replace the imaging media. Record the Cy5 signal by fluorescence imaging before and after UV-A illumination using a similar light exposure.\n5. Image processing, particle image velocimetry and calculation of traction forces\nNOTE: Cell traction forces are recorded by analyzing displacement of fluorescent beads and calculated using image analysis tools based on particle image velocimetry.\nOpen fluorescent beads images, before (i.e., deformed) and after laser (i.e., undeformed) using Fiji. Merge two images as one stack (Image | Stacks | Images to Stack).\nCorrect lateral drift between the two images using StackReg plugin (P. Thévenaz, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). Change images to 8 bit (Image | Type | 8 bit) and re-scale to 1024 x 1024 pix (Image | Scale). Save as an Image Sequence (TIFF format) with the reference image always at the beginning.\nAcquire the displacement vector field using a cross-correlation technique19 from the PIV-field as implemented in the OpenPIV project.\n\t\nEnsure that the relaxed (undeformed) image and the deformed image are covered with search windows of size wR and wD in pixels. For each search window, define a cross-correlation function using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63121/63121eq01.jpg",
    "Here, R(i,j) and D(i,j) describe the intensity fields of the two images truncated to the selected search window and subsequently mirror padded. imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63121/63121eq02.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63121/63121eq03.jpg describe their mean value. The window sizes are chosen to be wR = 32 and wD = 32 and an overlap of 70% is used between the neighboring search windows.\nFor each search window determine a displacement vector imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63121/63121eq04.jpg that optimizes the cross-correlation function and assign to the center position of the search window. Subpixel accuracy is obtained using a Gaussian fit around the maxima region as described20.\nFind and remove ambiguous displacement vectors. Displacement vectors corresponding to search windows where the ratio between two highest local maxima of the cross-correlation function below a threshold of 1.5 are considered as ambiguous21.\nDiscard displacement vectors that fail the normalized median test for a residual threshold of 1.522.\n(Optional) Correct the remaining lateral drift by subtracting a fixed vector imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63121/63121eq05.jpg from all displacements. This is done because the displacement in a selected area far away from the cell vanishes.\nInterpolate the resulting displacement vector field to a regular grid with spacing of 4 px of the input images using a cubic polynomial interpolation. Missing datapoints are filled using a smooth bivariate spline extrapolation. A displacement vector in pixels is related to a local deformation by the pixel ratio of the image (0.33 µm/px for 20x air lens).\n(Optional) Mirror pad the image to reduce ringing artifacts in the subsequent analysis.\nMultiply the deformation field by a Tukey window function to eliminate the edge effect due to the drift correction, with a parameter of 0.2-0.3. In this experiment, the micropatterned area which is in the center of FOV is of interest.",
    "Reconstruct the traction using regularized Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry (FTTC)18. As regularization we use the simplest reasonable choice, namely, 0th order Tikhonov (L2) regularization23,24,25. An optimal regularization parameter λ is chosen such that it minimizes the Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) function defined by26:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63121/63121eq06.jpg\n\tHere τλ is a stacked vector containing the x and y components of the reconstructed traction field for the given value of λ for all Fourier sampling modes and G is the linear operator mapping traction fields to their corresponding displacement field, as defined for FTTC. The sum is running over vector components. ui are the x and y components of the displacement field for all Fourier sampling modes. GCV is widely used in the field of ill-posed inverse problems and is a good alternative to the L-curve criterion often used in TFM. A Lanzcos filter is used to reduce artifacts introduces due to the limited frequency space and the displacement field upsampling. The traction calculation depends on the Young's modulus of the PA (e.g., 11.3 kPa) and Poisson's ratio (e.g., for PA in the range between 0.2 and 0.5 depending on crosslinker concentration)."
