    "Isolation of white-blood cells from spleenTake the spleen from each vaccinated mouse at pre-determined time points under aseptic conditions.Note: The time points selected for the evaluation of vaccination-induced cellular immune responses vary according to the vaccination protocol followed in each lab. Usually, spleens are obtained at the end of vaccination protocol (i.e., 2 weeks post last injection) in order to detect the existence of antigen-specific memory and effector T cell populations. Under a sterile biosafety cabinet, put each spleen into a Petri dish containing 5 ml of complete RPMI medium.Using a circular motion, press spleen against the bottom of the dish with the plunger of a 5 ml syringe until mostly fibrous tissue remains (Figure 1).Filter cells to avoid tissue debris by passing cell suspension through a 70 μm Nylon Cell strainer into a 15 ml sterile conical tube (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190529/20190529231538_1908.jpgFigure 1. Representative procedure of spleen cells isolationWash the spleen cells suspension with complete RPMI medium by centrifugation at 350 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 3 ml of ice-cold ACK to lyse red blood cells. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature with occasional shaking.Stop lysis reaction by adding complete RPMI medium to a final volume of 10 ml.Wash twice the cells with complete RPMI medium by centrifugation at 350 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 ml of complete RPMI medium.Mix 10 to 20 μl of cell suspension to Trypan blue exclusion dye in an Eppendorf tube to a final dilution of cells of 1:10 or 1:20. Allow mixture to incubate about for 3 min at room temperature. Apply a drop of trypan blue/cell mixture to a Neubauer chamber.",
    "Note: Cells should be re-suspended in serum-free medium since serum proteins stain with Trypan blue and produce misleading results. Also, the final dilution of cells in Trypan blue dye depends on the approximate number of cells present. If the sample is not diluted enough, the cells will be too crowded and difficult to count. If it is too dilute, the sample size will not be enough to make strong inferences about the concentration in the original mixture. By performing a redundant test on a second chamber, the results can be compared. Thus, the aliquot should contain a convenient number of cells to count in a Neubauer. Usually, 1:10 final dilution of cells is suitable when a spleen is dispersed to a 5 ml RPMI.  Count separately the unstained (viable) and stained (nonviable) cells under a light microscope.Note: Trypan blue exclusion test is based on the principle that living cells possess intact membranes that exclude certain dyes such as Trypan blue, whereas dead cells do not. Thus, a viable cell will have a clear cytoplasm whereas a nonviable will have a blue cytoplasm. Also, caution is needed to the time the cells are left with the dye since longer incubation periods will lead to cell death and reduced viability counts. For that reason, cells should be counted within 3 to 5 min of mixing with Trypan blue.  Determine cells per ml by the following calculations:Cells/ml = average count per square x dilution factor x 104Total cells = cells/ml x total original volume of cell suspension from which sample was takenRoutinely, one mouse spleen gives about 1 x 108 splenocytes. Note: Splenocytes recoveries vary significantly with age, gender and strain of mice. Resuspend cells in complete RPMI medium-10% FBS at a final concentration of 2 x 106 cells/ml.",
    "Proliferation assayFor the assay incorporate the following controls:No antigen stimulation (negative control; splenocytes in complete RPMI-10% FBS only).Positive control with a lymphocyte mitogen (splenocytes with the mitogen Concanavalin A). Prepare 2-fold dilution series on the antigens of choice in 15 ml conical tubes using complete RPMI-10% FBS. The recommended dilutions are: 20, 10 and 5 μg/ml. Plate cells in a 96-well U-bottom cell culture plate. Consider 2 x 105 splenocytes per well (i.e., 100 μl of splenocyte suspension). Each condition should be assayed in triplicate.Note: When using unfractionated splenocytes from recently primed mice, usually 1 x 105-5 x 105 cells are plated per well in order to have a significant proliferation assay. In this case, unfractionated splenocytes contain accessory cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells that serve as antigen-presenting cells of the added antigen as well as a source of secondary signals to responder T cells, thus enhancing their proliferative response.  Add 100 μl of diluted antigens or ConA per well to a final volume of 200 μl per well. Final antigen concentrations should correspond to 10, 5 and 2.5 μg/ml for antigens and 3 μg/ml for ConA.To negative controls add 100 μl of complete RPMI-10% FBS.Incubate for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity.Add 25 μl of diluted [3H]-Thymidine to complete RPMI per well corresponding to 0.5 μCi per well. [3H]-Thymidine should be added gently as a drop, without mixing in the well so as not to disrupt cell clusters (Figure 2).Note: [3H]-Thymidine is a radioactive material. All the procedures need to be done with dedicated incubators, hoods and pipettes in certified laboratories. Consult material safety data for proper handling instructions and get training to work with radioactive materials. Incubate for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity.",
    "Note: Incubation time is dependent on cell number used.  Lyse cells and harvest their labeled DNA onto glass-fiber filtermats using a semi-automated cell-harvester. Let dry filtermats at a dry oven for about 30 min at 60 °C.Put filters into bags and add scintillation fluid with a disposable plastic pipette.Seal bags and count [3H]-Thymidine incorporation in a beta-scintillation counter.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190529/20190529231607_2470.jpgFigure 2.

Proliferating T cell clusters are indicated by arrows. Magnification 20x.Cytokine detectionDilute antigens in complete RPMI -10% FBS beginning from as described above.Plate cells in a 24-well cell culture plate. Consider 4 x 106 splenocytes per well (i.e., resuspend cells so as 4 x 106 cells would be in 500 μl of complete RPMI-10% FBS). Each condition should be assayed at least in duplicate.Add 500 μl of diluted antigens per well to a final volume of 1 ml per well. Final antigen concentrations correspond to 10 μg/ml.To negative controls add 500 μl of complete RPMI-10% FBS.Incubate for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity.Collect supernatants to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 2,330 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris.Collect cell-free supernatants into new Eppendorf tubes and store at -70 °C until used.On the day of analysis, thaw samples at room temperature. Measure cytokine production with the mouse 5-plex Luminex panel (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-10) following exactly the outlined protocol in the Milliplex manual.Note: Avoid multiple (> 2) thawing-freezing cycles since it would cause protein degradation leading to cytokine production underestimation.",
    "Also, in some cases culture supernatants may require a dilution in the case of samples with cytokine concentrations above the dynamic range of the assay (range over which there is a linear relationship between the cytokine concentration and the absorbance reading). Run the samples on the Luminex® 200TM system with xPONENT® software according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Note: In the case of not having a Luminex multi-analyte profiling system, a cytometric bead array that it is compatible with flow cytometers can be used as an alternative, i.e., Cytometric Bead Array Mouse Th1/Th2 Cytokine Kit (BD Biosciences), LEGENDplex Mouse Th1/Th2 Panel (8-plex) (Biolegend), FlowCytomix mouse Th1/Th2 10plex (Bender MedSystems)."
