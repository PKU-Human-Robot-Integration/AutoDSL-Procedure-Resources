    "Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0001] is a widely used method in rodent models to induce alcohol dependence via exposure to alcohol vapor. The procedure involves intermittently exposing rodent models to vaporized alcohol over an extended period, typically from several days to several weeks, to induce alcohol dependence. This protocol is based on the principle that continuous exposure to alcohol vapor produces physiological and behavioral changes similar to those observed in humans with AUD. This protocol requires careful monitoring of animal health and behavior to ensure the reproducibility and accuracy of experimental results.\nMaterials\nMice, 2-3 months old, male/female (e.g., C57BL/6), group-housed\n200-proof ethanol (Koptex, UN1170, Ethyl Alcohol, 3, PGII)\nTap water\nVapor inhalation system (Any commercialized vapor system will work.

    "4. Connect rubber tubing from the glass beaker to the vapor inhalation system.\n5. Connect rubber tubing from the vacuum line to the vapor inhalation system.\nFor more information regarding tubing connections, please refer to the assembly instructions for the vapor inhalation system being used. See Figures 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0001] and 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0001] for the tubing connections in our vapor inhalation system.\n6. Place the wire cover over the mouse cage(s).\nThe wire cage permits the vapor to circulate in and out of the home cage (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0001]). If a cage other than the animal home cage is used, animals should be kept in the same groups as in their home cage.\n7. Fill the standard drinking bottle with water.\n8. Place the bottle in the cage so the animal can access it.\n9. Place rat and mouse cubes on top of the wire cage so the animal can access them.\n10. Place the cage(s) in the vapor inhalation system.\n11. Turn on the vacuum system.\nThe noise produced by the vacuum should be barely audible.\n12. Turn on the air system.\nThe alcohol solution in the beaker should be bubbling. See Figure 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0001] for reference. The ratio of alcohol to vacuum level should be roughly 3:4. See Figure 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0001] for reference.\n13. Leave mice in the vapor inhalation system for the desired time.\nCheck on the mice after the first 15-20 min in the vapor inhalation system to ensure they are not showing signs of adverse effects from the level of alcohol. If they are, turn down the alcohol level and check on them again in another 15-20 min.\nThe experimental demands dictate the overall time in the vapor inhalation system, though animals typically are left in the chamber for ≥10 hr a day.",

    "Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0003] are commonly used in AUD research to drive high levels of voluntary alcohol consumption or to determine animals’ preference between an alcohol solution versus water. This protocol involves offering rodent models access to both the alcohol solution and water and subsequently measuring the difference in consumption between these two liquids. Animals can be group- or single-housed, although this protocol will focus on group-housed animals. Two primary protocols are employed for group-housed animals: the acquisition phase (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0002]) and the measurement phase (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0003]). Throughout the procedure, it is essential to adhere to appropriate animal handling and care guidelines to ensure the well-being of the animals. Additionally, precise record-keeping and environmental control are necessary to ensure the reproducibility and accuracy of experimental results.\nMaterials\nMice, 2-3 months old, male/female (e.g., C57BL/6), group-housed\n200-proof ethanol (Koptex, UN1170, Ethyl Alcohol, 3, PGII)\nTap water\nMouse home cage (Tecniplast, GM500 for mice, green line)\n60-ml clear graduated bottles (Qorpak, clear graduated medium round bottles, GLC-01472)\nRubber rodent water bottle nozzle (Alternative Design, Neoprene Stopper, and Straight Open Sipper Tube)\nStandard drinking bottle for water (Tecniplast, animal water bottles, 600 ml)\n1. Select the schedule of access to alcohol.\nMice should alternate between 24 hr of access and 24-48 hr of alcohol withdrawal. An example schedule of access would be 24-hr concurrent access to alcohol starting at 11 A.M. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with the bottle removed at 11 A.M. on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.\n2. Fill a 60-ml bottle with 20% alcohol solution and a standard drinking bottle with water for each cage.\nFor example, if there are three cages, you will need three 60-ml bottles with 20% alcohol and three standard drinking bottles. See Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0002] for reference.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/03353689-606f-4bc7-b810-5e3294579d5e/cpz1831-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

Repeat as necessary for the desired number of sessions.\n7. Alternate placement (left or right) of each solution between sessions.\nThis prevents the animals from forming a bias for a specific side and potentially biasing the data. For example, if the bottle with alcohol solution was placed to the left of the standard drinking bottle for water in one session, it should be placed to the right in the next session.",
    "Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0003] outlines the measurement phase for the two-bottle choice procedure. During this phase, rodent models are removed from group housing and individually subjected to the two-bottle choice procedure. The mice are given access to both the alcohol solution and water for 24 hr, with their alcohol consumption measured at the end of the 24-hr period. We recommend repeating this procedure at least twice, with an interval of around 24 hr between trials to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. This allows for the recording of the amount of alcohol consumed by individual animals. As discussed in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0002], it is essential to adhere to appropriate animal handling and care guidelines and maintain precise record-keeping and environmental control to ensure the well-being of the animals and the reproducibility and accuracy of experimental results.\nMaterials\nMice used in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0002]\n200-proof ethanol (Koptex, UN1170, Ethyl Alcohol, 3, PGII)\nTap water\nAdditional cages (enough for every mouse to be individually housed; Tecniplast, GM500 for mice, green line)\n60-ml clear graduated bottles (Qorpak, clear graduated medium round bottles, GLC-01472)\nRubber rodent water bottle nozzle (i.e., Alternative Design, Neoprene Stopper, and Straight Open Sipper Tube)\nDigital scale (Scout Pro)\n1. Weigh the mice and ensure that the data is recorded.\nThis information will be necessary for future calculations to measure drinking data. Weight should be recorded in or converted to kilograms. Programs such as PcWedge can be connected to the scale to ensure accuracy and efficiency. See Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0002] for reference.\n2. Label each mouse to ensure data can be attributed to individual mice in future sessions.\nLabeling methods can differ by lab; we use a permanent marker to write a number on each mouse's tail.\n3. Move mice into individual cages so that they are housed individually rather than group housed.",
    "4. Fill a 60-ml bottle with 20% alcohol and a 60-ml bottle with tap water for each cage.\nIf there are five mice, 5 bottles of alcohol solution and 5 bottles of water will be needed. The same type of bottle should be used in the measurement phase as weights are very important for data analysis—using different types of bottles will make future analyses more complicated.\n5. Attach a rubber nozzle to each bottle.\n6. Label each alcohol and water bottle according to the cage/animal to which they are assigned.\nSee Figure 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0002] for example labels.\n7. Fill three extra 60-ml bottles with 20% alcohol and three extra 60-ml bottles with water and attach the rubber nozzles.\nThe extra bottles are used to measure leakage. This data, combined with the amounts of alcohol and water consumed by the animal, can be used to determine consumption in grams per kilogram per hour.\n8. Weigh all bottles to assess starting levels of solution and ensure that the data is recorded.\n9. Place alcohol and water bottles in each cage.\nFor control groups, place two 60-ml bottles of tap water into the home cage.\n10. Place the surplus filled bottles in an empty cage.\n11. Weigh all the bottles after 24 hr to assess how much of each solution has been consumed and ensure the data is recorded.\n12. Return mice to their home cages.\n13. Repeat the procedure at least once more after 24 to 48 hr of alcohol withdrawal.",
    "Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0004] describes the use of sucrose fading within the two-bottle choice procedure. Sucrose fading is used whenever mice refuse to drink alcohol. This method involves initially using a high concentration of sucrose solution to stimulate drinking and gradually reducing the sucrose concentration over time until only alcohol is present. This process is used within the acquisition phase of the two-bottle choice procedure. However, even though consumption is not usually measured during the acquisition phase, measuring it during sucrose fading is useful to determine when the animals have reached higher consumption levels for each new solution. It is important to note that the concentrations of the solutions below are examples, and different concentrations can be used as needed so long as the sucrose is gradually faded out. In addition, if a slower sucrose fading protocol is necessary, then the concentration of alcohol in the solution can initially be reduced and then slowly increased before fading out the sucrose.\nAdditional Materials (to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-prot-0002])\nPurified sucrose crystals (Thermo Fisher Scientific, code: S25590B; Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.831#cpz1831-fig-0003])\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8b1e24c4-d545-47c1-a74e-d025366be511/cpz1831-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nEquipment for making solutions.

Fill a 60-ml bottle with 20% alcohol/20% sucrose and ensure that the standard drinking bottle for water is filled.\n4. Attach rubber nozzle to each bottle.\n5. Measure the bottle with the alcohol solution to assess starting levels of solution and ensure that the data is recorded.",
    "6. Place both bottles in the home cage on days when the mice are scheduled to have access to alcohol.\nFor control groups, place a 60-ml bottle of tap water in the home cage.\n7. Weigh both bottles to assess how much of each solution was consumed by each cage after scheduled access to alcohol has ended and ensure that the data is recorded.\n8. Repeat this procedure for the next two sessions with the same solution.\nThere should be a minimum of three sessions for each level of sucrose. However, if after three sessions with a particular alcohol solution the animals still have low consumption levels, it could be useful to run extra sessions with that solution until consumption increases.\n9. Alternate placement (left or right) of each solution between sessions.\nThis prevents the animals from forming a bias for a specific side and potentially biasing the data.\n10. Switch the alcohol solution to 20% alcohol/17% sucrose after completing the three sessions with 20% alcohol/20% sucrose.\n11.
