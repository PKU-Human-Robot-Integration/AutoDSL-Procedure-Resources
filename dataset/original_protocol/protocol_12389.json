    "1. Preparation of Feeding Bacteria\nNOTE: This section describes the preparation of feeding bacteria (E. coli strain OP50).\nIsolate a single colony of E. coli strain OP50 from a lysogeny broth (LB) agar plate and aseptically inoculate into 300 ml of autoclaved LB broth.\nAllow the inoculated culture to grow overnight in a shaker at 200 rpm and 37 °C, until saturation is reached.\nTransfer the OP50 into 6 sterile, pre-weighed 50 ml conical tubes. Pellet the bacteria by centrifuging for 5 min at 6,000 rpm (5,000 x g).\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the bacteria with 50 ml of sterile M9. Repeat twice.\nAfter the second wash remove the remaining M9, ensuring that no M9 is left in the tube.\nDetermine the weight of the pellet by weighing the tube containing the bacteria pellet and subtract the weight of the 50 ml conical tube.\nResuspend the pellet in M9 at a concentration of 100 mg/ml.\nStore the OP50 solution at 4 °C until it is used for the worm culture.\n2. Preparation of Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) Petri Plates\nNOTE: This section describes the preparation of NGM Petri plates, which are the plates where the C. elegans worms are routinely maintained in the laboratory.\nAutoclave the NGM agar medium.\nUsing sterile procedures, dispense 17 ml of NGM agar solution into 6 cm Petri plates using a peristaltic pump.\n\tNOTE: A constant amount of agar in the plates reduces the need for refocusing the microscope when switching from one plate to another.\nLeave the plates at room temperature for 2-3 days before use to let the agar solidify and allow the excess moisture to evaporate.",
    "Seed the NGM plates using a sterile technique. Apply 1-2 drops of OP50 liquid culture and spread using a glass rod. Make sure not to spread the bacteria lawn all the way to the edges of the plates.\nAllow the OP50 lawn to grow for 1-2 days at room temperature before using the plates to grow worms.\n3. Preparation of a Synchronous Worm Population\nNOTE: The life cycle of C. elegans is comprised of the embryonic stage, four larval stages (L1-L4) and adulthood. This section describes the preparation of an age-synchronous population of worms. All materials coming in contact with C.elegans after the bleach treatment must be sterile.\nDay 1 – Preparation of Gravid Worm Population\nUse NGM plates in which the majority of the worm population consists of starved L1 larvae.\nCollect the L1 larvae with a sterilized worm pick and transfer them to fresh 6 cm NGM plates seeded with OP50. Incubate for approximately 65 hr at 20 °C until the majority of the worms are gravid adults. To avoid plate overcrowding and allow the worms to grow without depleting the bacteria, do not transfer more than one or two clusters of L1 larvae to each fresh NGM plate.\nDay 4 – Establishment of a Synchronized L1 Larvae Population\nCollect the gravid worms from the NGM plates by washing them with 1-2 ml of M9 and transfer them to a conical 15 ml tube.\nLet the gravid worms sediment to the bottom of the 15 ml conical tube for approximately 5-10 min. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the worm pellet.",
    "Transfer the worm pellet to 2-4 microcentrifuge tubes and add 1 ml of bleach/NaOH solution. Incubate for 2-3 min at RT. Monitor the progress of the reaction under the stereomicroscope to confirm all the worms are dead. Do not bleach longer than 5 min as the embryos could die.\nCollect the worms by centrifuging for 1 min at 3,000 rpm (900 x g). Remove the supernatant and add 1 ml of sterile M9 to neutralize the reaction.\nWash the worms twice by centrifuging for 1 min at 3,000 rpm (900 x g).\nRemove the supernatant and add M9 to up to 100-200 µl.\nUsing a glass Pasteur pipette add a drop of the worm/M9 mix to clear NGM plates and incubate them for at least 24 hr at 20 °C to allow the embryos to hatch.\n\t\tNOTE: Without food the larvae’s growth will be halted at the L1 stage.\nDay 5 – Establishment of a Synchronized L4 Larvae Population\nCollect the L1 larvae from the clear NGM plates by washing the plates with 1-2 ml of M9 and transfer them to a conical 15 ml tube.\nLet the dead adult worms sediment to the bottom of the 15 ml conical tube for approximately 5 min.\nCollect the supernatant, where the L1 worms are, in a new conical 15 ml tube, and precipitate the worms by centrifuging for 2 min at 2,600 rpm (1,000 x g).\nRemove the supernatant leaving approximately 500 µl.\nDetermine the concentration of worms in the M9 solution by counting the number of worms in 10 µl drops using a stereomicroscope. Count at least 5 drops.\nAdjust the concentration of the worms to 20-25 worms/µl and add 50 µl of the worm/M9 mix to NGM plates seeded with OP50.",
    "Incubate for 65 hr at 15 °C (for incubation through the week-end) to allow the L1 synchronized population to grow until they reach the L4 stage.\n4. Exposure of Worms to Chemicals in 96-well Plates\nNOTE: This section describes the use of Pxol1::gfp transcriptional reporter containing C. elegans strain to screen for the induction of aneuploidy.\nCollect the L4 larvae from the clear NGM plates by washing the plates with 1-2 ml of M9 and transfer them to a conical 15 ml tube.\nLet the L4 worms sediment to the bottom of the 15 ml conical tube for approximately 5-10 min. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the worm pellet.\nAdd 3-5 ml of M9 and determine the concentration of worms in the M9 solution by counting the number of worms in 10 µl drops using a stereomicroscope. Count at least 5 drops for each sample.\nResuspend the worms at a concentration of 1,000 worms/ml in M9.\nDilute the OP50 bacteria from section 1 10-fold with M9. Make sure the resuspended bacteria reach room temperature because lower temperature affects worm development.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, first add 100 µl of the worm/M9 mix (from step 4.4) and then add 400 µl of the diluted OP50 bacteria (from step 4.5) to each well of a 2 ml deep round bottom 96-well plate. At the end, each well will have 100 worms in 500 µl.\nAdd 0.5 µl of either the test chemical or the appropriate control to the desired wells, to achieve a suggested final concentration of 100 µM, a concentration commonly used in chemical screens in C. elegans12. Expose ethanol or DMSO solvent controls at a final concentration of 0.1%.\n\tNOTE: We recommend the use of nocodazole (100 µM) as positive control.",
    "Seal the plate using adhesive film. Be sure to seal the plate well to prevent cross contamination between wells.\nWrap the plate with aluminum foil.\nTransfer the plate to a shaker (170-180 rpm) of the appropriate temperature for the suitable length of time (24 or 65 hr). The temperature of the room affects the growth of the worms; maintain the temperature around 20 °C.\n5. Image Acquisition of Gravid Worms in a 384-well Plate\nNOTE: This section describes the use of a high content microscope to image the exposed Pxol1::gfp worms, to visualize the expression of GFP in the embryos within the uterus of adult hermaphrodites. For each 384-well plate to be screened, use worms from 4 x 96-well plates.\nAfter chemical exposure in the shaker, let the 96-well plate rest for 10-15 min to allow the adult worms to sediment to the bottom of the plate.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, remove 350 µl of the M9, being very careful not to disturb the worms in the bottom of the plate.\nWash the worms with 1 ml of M9 and repeat step 5.1.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, remove 1 ml of the M9, being vey careful not to disturb the worms in the bottom of the plate.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, resuspend the worms in the remaining M9 and collect 100 µl of the worm/M9 mix from the 96-well plates and load it into the wells of a black walls/clear bottom 384-well plate. Repeat the process using worms from 4 x 96-well plates, until all the wells of the 384-well plate have been loaded.",
    "NOTE: It is important for all the wells to have the same volume in order to increase the efficiency and speed of the autofocus during the image acquisition process. Each well should contain between 80 to 100 worms.\nAdd 1 µl of levamisole (100 µM) to each well and let the worms incubate for approximately 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Levamisole acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist and immobilizes the worms.\nTransfer the plate to a widefield high content microscope capable of providing automated imaging.\nFor image acquisition, use a high content image acquisition and analysis software according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Select the 4X objective to acquire 1 image per well.\nBefore starting the image acquisition, adjust the GFP imaging parameters to 45 msec of exposure and image resolution to 2,160 x 2,160.\nCollect the data as the number of GFP positive worms divided by the total number of worms in the well, the latter measure being relatively consistent between wells.\nSubscription Required.
