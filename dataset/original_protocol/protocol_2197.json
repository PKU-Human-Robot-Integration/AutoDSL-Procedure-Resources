    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHigh-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution of C. albicans biofilms\nTiming: 5 days\nPlace the chemically fixed biofilms of C. albicans in a Petri dish and cut them in 4 × 4 mm squares with a scalpel.\nInsert the biofilm square in the 200 μm cavity of a type A sample carrier filled with PBS and cover with the type B carrier to close the sandwich. Freeze with a Leica EM ICE high pressure freezer.\nNote: Biofilms of C. albicans cultured on Aclar films are deposited within the type A sample carrier and oriented toward the type B sample carrier. Also, coat the flat part of the 6 mm type B sample carrier with 1-hexadecene to prevent C. albicans from sticking (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nTransfer the type A sample carrier within a cryotube and store in a liquid nitrogen dewar.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1805-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Pictures summarizing the different steps of high pressure freezing\n(A) Type A sample carrier containing C. albicans biofilm on the Aclar film (blue arrow). The type B sample carrier is shown with the red arrow. The assembly of both sample carriers is pinpointed with the orange arrow.\n(B) Plastic half cylinders (top and middle) and middle plate (bottom) used to transit samples in the high-pressure freezer are indicated with yellow arrows. The sample carrier is shown underneath.\n(C) Picture showing the assembly of plastic half cylinders and the sample carrier on the high-pressure freezer.\nNote: the type A sample carrier contains the frozen biofilm of C. albicans on the Aclar film.\nAll steps of the freeze-substitution are performed in the tank of the Leica EM AFS2 apparatus (steps #4 to #9). See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].",
    "Note: Plastic Pasteur pipettes are used to change buffers along the freeze-substitution procedure by using the middle hole of the flow-through ring.\nTransfer biofilms from cryotubes to a flow-through ring that contains 10 mL of a solution of acetone/0.2% uranyl acetate/2% methanol and incubate the samples at −90°C for 2 h (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1805-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Picture of the AFS2 apparatus tank during the freeze-substitution procedure\nThe tank is partially filled with 100% ethanol. The flow-through ring (10 positions) containing the lower part of the different sample carriers is placed on a metal stand. Arrows use the following color code: blue (metal stand), red (Flow-through ring), yellow (sample carrier) and black (plastic Pasteur pipette).\nNote: the tweezers as well as the solution (acetone, uranyl acetate and methanol) should be precooled at −90°C.\nThen, heat up biofilms to −50°C (the slope is 20°C per hour). From this stage, samples are kept at −50°C until the second step of UV polymerization (step #9).\nWash frozen biofilms every 20 min with 100% ethanol, cooled at −50°C, for 1 h.\nNote: Ethanol used for the freeze-substitution procedure (either in washing steps or to dilute the HM20 resin) needs to be treated with molecular sieves before use to remove water molecules. The presence of water molecules in ethanol would compromise the freeze-substitution, and subsequently negatively impact the ultrastructure of fungal biofilms.\nInfiltrate samples with several solutions of Lowicryl HM20 resin following the order below:\n75% ethanol/25% HM20 for 2 h.\n50% ethanol/50% HM20 for 16 h.\n25% ethanol/75% HM20 for 2 h.\n100% HM20 for 2 h.\n100% HM20 for 2 h.\n100% HM20 for 16 h.\n100% HM20 for 4 h.",
    "Note: The solutions of resin correspond to a mix of ethanol and HM20 that follows specific ratios over time. To ensure good infiltration, pure HM20 needs to be replaced at each step.\nAfter the final incubation with 100% HM20, place samples within the AFS2 apparatus under UV light at −50°C for 44 h to allow resin polymerization.\nDuring the HM20 polymerization under UV light, set up a temperature increase from −50°C to 20°C with a slope of 10°C per hour.\nAfter reaching the temperature of 20°C, the HM20 polymerization could be continued under direct sunlight for several hours.\nCritical: Samples must be kept at −196°C (liquid nitrogen temperature) until their transfer within the acetone solution. Any premature warming of the sample may lead to ice crystal formation and induce severe alterations of biofilm ultrastructure (step 4).\nCut samples with an ultramicrotome and arrange the sections on electron microscopy grids\nTiming: 4 h\nRemove the type B sample carrier and the Aclar film from the polymerized HM20 resin block (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1805-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(D) Toluidine blue staining of a plastic section (150 nm) which contains C. albicans biofilm. A fungal cell growing as a filament is indicated with a black arrow. Contacts between C. albicans cells are indicated with orange arrows.\nUnder a binocular microscope, localize the area containing C. albicans cells and trim the block of HM20 as a thin triangle with a razorblade.\nFor tomography experiments, cut sections of 150 nm with an ultramicrotome. For immunogold labeling and contrasting, use sections of 70 nm.\nNote: Sections of 150 nm and 70 nm are done with different diamond knives to avoid any damage to the knives.\nAdd a droplet of the toluidine blue solution stain on each section and incubate on a heat block for 5 min, then wash thoroughly with distilled water (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: The toluidine blue staining is used to check the presence of C. albicans cells in the sections. To do so, place some sections on a microscope glass slide before staining them with the toluidine blue. Subsequently, observe the sections under a light microscope.\nAfter checking for the presence of C. albicans biofilm cells, place the following sections (unstained) on a copper grid for TEM analysis.\nCritical: The area containing fungal cells within the HM20 resin looks whitish due to a very high cellular density. Sections should be made in this area. Polymerized HM20 resin without cells is translucent (step 12).\nSample preparation for TEM observations\nTiming: 4 h",
    "Immunogold labeling. Immunogold labeling will be used to detect specific antigens in samples with a transmission electron microscope. The protein of interest can be fused to a tag that will be used as a target for the primary antibody. Subsequently, protein A-gold particles will specifically recognize the primary antibody to generate the complex antibody:protein A-gold particle. The gold particle will create a highly dense area toward electrons that will appear as a black dot (the size of the gold particle) on the phosphoscreen of an electron microscope. Thus, antigens of interest will be specifically pinpointed on the sections with a black dot. All the following steps are performed at room temperature, and the droplets are deposited at the surface of sealing film (such as Parafilm®).\nFor each grid, prepare 5 droplets of PBS 50 mM NH4Cl on Parafilm®. Wash the grids in the droplets for 2 min. Repeat this step 4 times.\nIncubate each grid in a droplet of blocking solution (PBS BSA 1%) for 5 min.\nIncubate grids on 10 μL-droplets containing the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.\nNote: For each grid, prepare a droplet of PBS BSA 1% that contains the primary antibody properly diluted. In this work we used an α-GFP antibody diluted 200 times.\nWash the grids in 10 μL-droplets of PBS BSA 0.1%. Repeat this operation 4 times.\nWash the grids in 10 μL-droplets of PBS. Repeat 4 times.\nPrepare one 10 μL-droplet of PBS BSA 1% containing protein A conjugated to 10 nm gold particles (working dilution 1/50) per grid. Incubate the grids in the mixture for 20 min.\nNote: Protein A-Gold particles tend to aggregate. Hence, do not incubate the sections more than 20 min with protein A-Gold particles mixture to avoid particles clustering.",
    "Wash the grids in droplets of PBS. Repeat this operation 5 times.\nIncubate the grids in droplets of PBS 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min.\nFinally, wash the grids in droplets of water. Repeat the washes 8 times.\nBefore being observed with a TEM microscope, the grids need to be contrasted. Contrasting should be done directly after the washes.\nCritical: To ensure immunogold labeling specificity, working dilution of the primary antibody needs to be carefully assessed (step 16.c). See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for additional assistance.\nContrasting protocol. Contrasting can also be used alone, without immunostaining, to increase contrast on biological sections. To do so, uranyl acetate and lead citrate are added onto the sections. This will result in an increased scattering of electrons from the heavy atoms absorbed from the sample, and therefore a better contrast.\nIncubate the grids in droplets of 4% uranyl acetate for 30 min.\nNote: Tweezers used for the contrasting protocol need to be sonicated in a water bath before use. This will remove any uranyl acetate from the tweezers and avoid a contamination of the samples with uranyl acetate aggregates.\nWash 5 times in droplets of water.\nBlot away the excess of water from the grids on a Whatman filter paper.\nIncubate the grids in droplets of 2% lead citrate for 2 min.\nNote: Lead citrate tends to precipitate in the presence of CO2. To avoid this precipitation, place sodium hydroxide pellets in close vicinity to lead citrate droplets. This is sufficient to remove the surrounding CO2 from the lead citrate droplets and avoid precipitation.\nWash 5 times in droplets of water.\nBlot away the excess water from the grids on a grade 4 Whatman filter paper.",
    "Allow the grids to air dry for at least 24 h on a filter paper at room temperature.\nSample preparation for electron tomography.\nPrepare a fresh aliquot of protein A-Gold particle (10 nm in diameter) diluted 30 times in water. Here, protein A-Gold particle is used as a fiducial marker.\nNote: The three-dimensional tomographic volume of samples is reconstructed based on a tilt series of projection images recorded by TEM. In this case protein A-Gold particles are not used for immunostaining but rather as fiducial markers. The fiducial markers are used to accurately align/register the projection images of the tilt series before the actual tomographic reconstruction step takes place.\nPrepare two 100 μL-droplets of diluted protein A-Gold particle per grid to be imaged using electron tomography.\nIncubate each grid in the first droplet of protein A-Gold particle with section oriented toward the mixture (“face up” toward the surface of the drop) and incubate for 10 min.\nNote: The section is attached on the treated side with the formvar/carbon of the grid. This side is called “face up”. The other side of the grid, that is not treated with formvar/carbon, is called “face down”. The “face up” side of the grid looks dull under visible light, while the “face down” side is shiny. The fiducial marker is mandatory on both side of the grid. Hence, each side of the grid is soaked in the protein A-Gold particle mixture.\nWash the grids in a water drop and blot immediately on a Whatman filter paper.\nSubsequently, immerse each grid in the second droplet of protein A-Gold particle with section oriented toward the air (“face down” toward surface of the drop) and incubate for 10 min.\nWash the grids in a water drop and blot immediately on a Whatman filter paper.",
    "Incubate the grids with sections facing down in 4% uranyl acetate droplets for 30 min.\nWash the grids 5 times in droplets of water.\nIncubate the grids with sections facing down in 2% lead citrate droplets for 2 min.\nWash 5 times in droplets of water and blot away the excess of water with a Whatman filter paper.\nLet the grids dry at room temperature for 16 h before performing electron tomography.\nData acquisition with transmission electron microscopes\nHere we describe the basic steps to record tilt series with a transmission electron microscope. Because the use of transmission electron microscopes is particularly challenging, especially for users who are not familiar with electron microscopy, it is strongly suggested to collaborate with TEM specialists.\nFill up the cryo-trap dewar of the Tecnai microscope with liquid nitrogen allowing the temperature of the cryo-trap to go down to −196°C.\nNote: At −196°C, the cryo-trap will catch any sample contamination from remaining dirt within the column of the microscope.\nMount the grid on the sample holder.\nNote: Usually sample holders for electron tomography are allowing tilt series acquisition with a tilt angle range of +/−70°.\nInsert the sample holder in the stage of the electron microscope.\nNote: Make sure that column valves are closed to not disrupt the vacuum of the microscope. Users should also verify that both the objective aperture and the cryo-box, which are 2 components of the electron microscope, are not inserted.\nOpen the SerialEM software which will provide an interface to record micrographs, as well as acquiring tilt series, of fungal biofilms.\nNote: Detailed instructions on how to use SerialEM are available on the following websites:\nhttps://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/[href=https://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/].\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=SerialEM[href=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=SerialEM].\nCenter the condenser aperture and bring the sample to eucentric height.\nCollect a Full Grid Map (FGM) at low magnification (150×) using SerialEM.",
    "Insert and center the objective aperture.\nFind an area with fungal biofilm on the FGM and collect a Middle Magnification Map (MMM) at 2500×.\nAdd a marker (point) on every area of interest suitable for data acquisition on the MMM using SerialEM’s navigator (Add Points).\nNote: An area suitable for data acquisition is characterized mainly by preserved fungal ultrastructure. Also, the contrast in this area should be sufficient to observe ultrastructures of interest and acquire data.\nAcquire a tilt series of every area designated with a marker on the MMM.\nNote: Before each data acquisition, users must perform the following routine: (i) cook the sample by sending a total dose of 1500 electrons per square Ångström, (ii) refine eucentricity, (iii) autofocus, (iv) raise the magnification to 49,000× and (v) launch tilt series acquisition. Repeat these 5 steps for every point of interest found on the MMM.\nFor dual axis tomography, close the valves and take the sample holder out. Rotate the grid clockwise manually through an angle of 90° and put back the sample holder in the stage of the electron microscope.\nRedo steps 23 and 25.\nNote: The second time you are inserting the grid you have to increase the stage registration in number 2 on the Navigator. Collect a new FGM in this registration and use registration points between the new and old FGM maps to shift the previous coordinates to the new stage coordinates. There is no need to redo the MMM. The shifted coordinates will be used to collect tilt series at the same area.\nCollect new tilt series in the same areas of interest as in step 28.",
    "Note: Tilt series acquisition could be done either one-by-one or in batch. For the batch processes, users should create an anchor map to avoid losing the field of view during the serial imaging. Subsequently, set up the routine as described in the note (step 28) and start tilt series acquisition.\nCritical: To record classical TEM micrographs (contrasting and immunogold labeling), it is not required to produce FGM, MMM and collect tilt series. User should follow the following procedure: (i) mount the grid in the sample holder, (ii) insert the sample holder in the stage of the microscope, (iii) open the valves, (iv) center condenser aperture and bring the sample to eucentric height, (v) center the objective aperture, (vi) go to the appropriate magnification and (vii) record micrographs with SerialEM.\nTomographic reconstruction\nTiming: 10 h\nTomographic reconstruction is performed with the IMOD version 4.9 software (Mastronarde and Held, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The fully detailed procedure is available online at the following address: https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/etomoTutorial.html[href=https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/etomoTutorial.html].\nHere we cite the major steps allowing tomographic reconstruction for dual-axis tomography performed on C. albicans biofilms. For dual-axis tomography, tilt series should be recorded with two perpendicular tilt axes called A- and B-axis.\nMoreover, tomographic reconstruction is also a complicated process that could require the help of specialists of image processing.\nStart the tomographic reconstruction by setting up ETomo which is the graphical user interface to the IMOD package.",
    "Note: To do so, users should sequentially enter the following information: (i) dataset name, (ii) indicate that tilt series were performed on plastic sections, (iii) select dual axis tomography, (iv) enter the size of the fiducial marker (10 nm) and (v) tick the box “extract tilt angles from data”. Then, press the “Create Com Scripts” to open the ETomo main window. Every step used by IMOD for tomographic reconstruction is displayed under the form of clickable sections on the left part of ETomo main window.\nGo to the pre-processing section and click sequentially on “Create Fixed Stack” and the “Use Fixed Stack” buttons.\nNote: The first step to build up tomograms is the pre-processing procedure. To avoid contrast problems or artifacts in the tomograms, the pre-processing will remove extreme pixel values in the tilt series.\nGo to the coarse alignment section and click on the “Calculate Cross-Correlation” button. Then, press the “Generate Coarse Aligned Stack” button.",
    "Note: This step will create an alignment between consecutive images coming from the tilt series by generating a coarse-aligned stack. Pressing the “Calculate Cross-Correlation” button will launch the tiltxcorr program that will use cross-correlation to calculate XY shifts between successive images of the tilt series. For cross-correlation to take place the program first stretches the image with the larger tilt angle perpendicular to the tilt axis. The resulting file consists of a list of calculated shifts which will be applied to the dataset in the next step. Xftoxg will run once users will press the “Generate Coarse Aligned Stack” button. Xftoxg will use the output of tiltxcorr to compute a global set of alignments. Then, the program Newstack will apply the global set to the tilt series and generate a new image stack that the user is able to observe by pressing the “View Aligned Stack In 3dmod” button.\nGenerate a seed model on the zero-angle tilt micrograph based on gold particles positioning and then, track the gold particles on all other sections of the tilt series to generate the fiducial model.\nNote: The algorithm that uses the seed model to track beads in all other sections of the tilt series can fail in cases of bad contrast or if the beads are outside the field of view in particular tilt angles. This will generate gaps in the fiducial model which can be added manually with the bead fixer. It is important to mention that an accurate fiducial model is mandatory to complete the next step of tomographic reconstruction namely the “fine alignment”.\nRefine gold particle tracking with the help of residual errors in every section of the tilt series.",
    "Note: The refinement of gold particles throughout all sections performed by the tiltalign program will not be perfect. Some gold particles will have to be repositioned from one section to another. Users should correct this displacement manually with the bead fixer.\nSample three regions of the tomogram (top, middle, and bottom parts of the tilt series) by pressing “Create Sample Tomograms”. Then add the top and bottom surfaces from every reconstruction by pressing the “Create Boundary Models”. Subsequently, press on “Compute Z shift and Pitch Angles” button.\nNote: This step is to fit the reconstruction into the smallest volume possible (Tomogram positioning section). Pressing the “Compute Z shift and Pitch Angles” button will allow tomopitch to reconstruct the flattest possible tomogram and fit it in the smallest volume possible.\nGenerate the tomogram of the axis A using Weighted Back Projection (WBP).\nBecause we used dual-axis tomography, users should now reconstruct the tomogram corresponding to the second axis (B axis).\nStart the reconstruction of the B axis by doing the pre-processing and the coarse alignment on the dataset corresponding to the axis B as you did for axis A.\nBy using transferfid (press the “Transfer Fiducials From Other Axis” button), create a seed model for the B axis based on the fiducial model from the axis A.\nNote: It could happen that some fiducials failed to transfer from axis A- to the B-axis. Users could correct that by adding points to the seed model.\nOnce the seed model is completed, track gold particles throughout all sections of the tilt series to generate the fiducial model linked to the B-axis. Fill the gaps with the bead fixer.\nRepeat steps 36–38 on the dataset corresponding to the B-axis.",
    "Start the process of dual-axis tomogram combination by creating command files to run different programs used for the combine procedure. Press the “Start Combine” button. Then, press the “Open Combined Volume” to visualize the final tomogram.\nTrim the volume of the final tomogram along the X, Y and Z axis.\nNote: The final tomogram displays some areas in X, Y and Z with no information regarding fungal ultrastructures. The Trimvol tool will remove those areas and the resulting tomogram will be focused on the biological material. Furthermore, the file size corresponding to the trimmed tomogram will be smaller.\nCleanup intermediate files.\nNote: IMOD generates plenty of intermediate files that can be removed once the final tomographic volume is obtained. To save several gigabytes of space, it is strongly recommended to delete all intermediates files.\nRepeat steps 32–45 for all tilt series acquired by dual-axis tomography on fungal biofilms."
