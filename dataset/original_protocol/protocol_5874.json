    "Note: Samples are kept on ice unless otherwise specified, and all work is done in a sterile, laminar flow hood to prevent contamination of the RNA. All buffers, Eppendorf tubes, and glassware are autoclaved before use. Preparing dialysis tubingPrepare a solution of 2% sodium bicarbonate, 1 mM EDTA is in a glass beaker.Cut the Dialysis tubing into 4-in segments and boil in the solution of 2% sodium bicarbonate, 1 mM EDTA for 10 min. Rinse the tubing thoroughly with ddH2O, and then boil for 10 min in ddH2O. Cover the tubing with ddH2O once again. Autoclave, and store at 4 °C.PolyU synthesisNotes:The synthesis protocol used herein was developed from existing protocols used by Vanzi et al. (2003) and van den Hout et al. (2011), and has been used in our recently published work (Beren et al., 2017).  Polynucleotide phosphorylase from Synechocystis sp. is used to polymerize fluorescent polyU from UDP monomers, which is initiated by a short ‘seed’ oligo (500 pmol of a 5’ tagged cy5 polyU oligo 20-mer, but, in principle, this can be any length or sequence). Mix 500 pmol of seed oligos with 20 mM UDP, 1 μl of RNase Inhibitor and 300 ng of PNPase in Synthesis buffer in a total volume of 80 μl. Incubate at 37 °C to start the reaction.After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the UDP concentration is increased to a final concentration of 40 mM. Incubate the solution for another 2 h, for a total time of 4 h at 37 °C. Thoroughly wash the product three times with TE buffer on a 100-kDa Amicon filter using a tabletop centrifuge operated at 5,000 x g and 4 °C for 6 min.",
    "Determine the amount of polyU synthesized by measuring UV-Vis absorbance, and the absorbance ratio at 260 nm/280 nm is used as a measure of RNA purity (A260/A280 greater than 2.0).PolyU purificationFifty micrograms of fluorescent polyU per lane is electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/TAE RNA electrophoresis gel at room temperature and 90 V for 2 h alongside 2 outer lanes containing 7 μl of ssRNA ladder.Before loading on the gel, denature the ladder with formamide (70% of sample volume per lane) and heat to 70 °C for 10 min to eliminate all secondary structure. Note: We found that formamide denaturation is not necessary for polyU RNA, as it already lacks secondary structure in the absence of formamide. Typically we run 7 μl of ssRNA ladder, and add 15 μl of formamide. After disconnecting the power source, soak the gel in TAE buffer for 15 min, allowing the ladder to reform secondary structures and to be stained with ethidium bromide (or equivalent nucleic acid stain).Cut the fractions containing polyU of 500-1,500, 1,500-2,500, 2,500-3,500, 3,500-5,000, 5,000-7,000, and 7,000-9,000 nt from the gel and electroelute into dialysis bags with TAE buffer for 1 h at room temperature at 90 V. Briefly, excise a portion of the gel corresponding to the desired RNA length using a scalpel and place it inside a dialysis tube, which is then filled with the minimum volume of TAE needed to fully submerge the gel. Then place these tubes back into the electrophoresis tank and the desired RNA is eluted out of the gel and into the dialysis bag. It is important that during electroelution the gels are oriented to create the shortest possible path for the RNA to be eluted from the excised gel.

    "This video illustrates the procedure of gel electroelution described above in Procedure C (PolyU Purification). The video illustrates Step C4, wherein the portion of the gel containing the desired RNA is excised and the RNA is then electroeluted out of this band into TAE buffer in dialysis tubing.After electroelution, wash the RNA three times with TE buffer using a 100-kDa Amicon filter, as described above. Determine the concentrations of polyU by UV-Vis spectrophotometry using the absorbance at 260 nm (using an extinction coefficient of 40 ng-cm/microliter). The purity of the electroeluted sample is subsequently verified by RNA gel electrophoresis.Determination of the size of polyU in solutionDetermine the hydrodynamic radii of three polyU RNA fractions (500-1,500, 1,000-2,500 and 2,500-3,500 nt) and three normal-composition RNAs (the 3,200-nt-long Brome Mosaic Virus (BMV) RNA1, and two truncations of it that are 500 and 2,000 nt long, respectively) by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (see Figure 3) (Hovanessian and Justesen, 2007). Perform these measurements on a Malvern particle sizer Nano-ZS with a sample concentration of 1 g/L in RNA Assembly Buffer (raw data are shown in Figure 3A). Radius against length in Figure 3B shows that the polyU radii exhibit N1/2 power-law scaling and that the normal-composition RNAs exhibit N1/3 power-law scaling, the scaling predicted for normal-composition RNAs by previous work using folding algorithms (Fang et al., 2011). In addition, the radii of polyU RNAs are approximately 25 percent larger than those of normal-compositions of similar length.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180830/20180830032421_1517.jpgFigure 3.

    "Plot showing how the hydrodynamic radii of polyU and normal-composition RNAs (500, 2,000 and 3,200 nt) vary with nt length. The magenta line that has been drawn through the data represents N1/2 power-law scaling (polyU), while the black line represents the N1/3 scaling expected for RNAs with secondary structure. Note that though the raw data exhibit a large standard deviation, the standard deviation of the mean (error bars) is relatively small, indicating that the average size is reproducible across measurements.
