All procedures involving the drug should be performed in a\n          Class II cytotoxic Biosafety cabinet only by trained laboratory\n          personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Needles,\n          syringes, tubes and unused 5-FU stock solutions should be disposed of\n          according to institutional regulations as cytotoxic waste.\n        \n            Prepare 5-FU for injection into mice by taking 3 parts 5-FU\n            (50 mg/mL) + 2 parts sterile saline (e.g., 1500 μL 5-FU + 1000 μL\n            saline for 18 mice).\n          \n            Inject 125 μL of 5-FU into each mouse (150 mg/kg dose) through the\n            tail vein using a ½ or 1 CC insulin syringe fitted with a 29 gauge\n            (G) needle.\n            \nNote: Alternatively, 5-FU can be\n              administered intraperitoneally (IP).4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] However, diarrhea\n              and weight loss have been reported for mice when treated with\n              100–200 mg/kg 5-FU (IP injection) within a 7 day period starting\n              as early as 3 days post injection.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\n              We have not seen such effects with intravenous injection of 5-FU.",
    "The method of injection needs to be selected based on\n              the expertise available in the lab as well as the institutional\n              ethical approval for the procedures on mice.\n            \n        BM harvest from 5-FU injected donor mice- Day 5.\n        \nCritical: All steps involved in\n          the BM harvest from mice must be performed under sterile conditions in\n          a certified Class II Biosafety cabinet to avoid contamination of the\n          harvested cells.\n        \n            Dissect the long bones comprising the femur, tibia and pelvis from\n            each mouse injected with 5-FU on Day 1.\n          \n            Separate the femur, tibia and pelvis and thoroughly clean the flesh\n            off the bone.\n          \nPlace a 40 micron cell strainer over a 50 mL tube.\n            Flush the marrow from each bone using a 3 mL syringe with a 22G\n            needle and PBS + 2% FBS through the cell strainer.\n          \n            Collect marrow from the 2 mice into 50 mL PBS + 2% FBS.\n            \nCritical: Use fresh PBS + 2%\n              FBS for each flush to avoid passing the BM cells multiple times\n              through the needle which may lead to lysis of the cells.\n            \nNote: Alternatively, the BM cells\n              can be harvested by other methods such as crushing and washing the\n              bones to dislodge the marrow cells (useful when handling a large\n              number of mice)7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] or centrifugation\n              based separation of the marrow cells (faster technique than\n              flushing).8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\n            Centrifuge flushed BM @ 300 g for 7 min at 4°C.

    "on the plate up and down 5–10 times to collect as much BM cells.\n          \n            Transfer BM cells from 10 cm dish into a 50 mL conical tube (try not\n            to disrupt the GP+E86 layer). All BM from the same\n            construct can be pooled at this stage.\n          \nAdd 4 mL of fresh “BM culture medium” + 6.4 μg/mL Polybrene.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 16–20 h.\n            Spin down/centrifuge the BM collected in the 50 mL tubes @ 300\n            g for 7 min at 4°C.\n            \nResuspend the BM pellet in 3–5 mL “BM culture medium”.\nPlate in a 6-well non-adherent plate.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 16–20 h.\nNote: Steps d & e are to collect any\n      residual BM stuck to the GP+E86 cells the next day\n    \n        Select for transduced BM cells - Day 9.\n        \nNote: This protocol makes use of GFP\n          which is expressed with the gene of interest to facilitate selection\n          of transduced BM cells.

The exact dose needed should be titrated in each\n              individual facility, as dosage will depend on the radiation\n              source, animal facility and ambient conditions. Environmental\n              noise and vibration may also render mice more sensitive to\n              radiation.\n            \nCritical: Since the mice are\n              irradiated at a lethal dose, they need to be transplanted within\n              3–4 hours of irradiation to ensure their survival.\n            \n            Euthanize 1 recipient mouse without irradiation to harvest “helper”\n            BM cells.\n            \nNote: Since the cells harvested\n              from donor mice are enriched for HSPC, co-transplanting whole bone\n              marrow helper cells ensures survival of the irradiated recipients\n              until the donor HSPC engraft and generate enough mature blood\n              cells to do so.\n            \n            Dissect 1 leg (femur and tibia) and harvest the BM cells by flushing\n            and perform RBC lyses as detailed above.\n          \n            Count cells and resuspend in sterile saline at a concentration of\n            2 × 106 cells/mL.\n            \nThus, 50 μL = 100,000 helper cells.\n            Collect sorted transduced BM cells from the plate into 1.5 mL tubes.\n          \n            Count cells and resuspend in sterile saline at a concentration of\n            3 × 106 cells/mL.\n            \nThus, 100 μL of cells = 300,000 transduced BM cells.",

This\n      requires destroying the HSPC from the marrow for a second time. Since mice\n      have already irradiated during the 1st transplant, to avoid\n      irradiation-induced toxicity, the second myeloablation is done by\n      injecting the mice with busulfan.\n    \nNote: Donor and recipient mice used for\n      the second transplant are wild-type mice that express the CD45.1 isoform.\n      We used 8–12 week old B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ\n      (CD45.1) mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.

Make fresh\n                  solutions of busulfan before each use.\n                \n                Weigh the recipient mice to determine volume of busulfan\n                solution to inject to provide a dose of 25 mg/kg (see Example\n                3).\n                \nNote: EXAMPLE 3- For a mouse\n                  weighing 18 g (0.018 kg), one would need to inject\n                  0.45 mg busulfan to get a final dose of 25 mg/kg. Thus, from a\n                  working stock of 3 mg/mL, one would need to inject 0.15 mL\n                  (150 μL) to deliver 0.45 mg busulfan to the mouse.\n                \n                The calculated volume of busulfan is delivered to the mouse via\n                intraperitoneal injection.\n              \n            Day 2 busulfan treatment.\n            \n                Repeat steps i–iii of Day 1 busulfan treatment for the 2nd\n                dose of busulfan treatment.\n              \n                Place the busulfan treated mice in sterile cages with sterilized\n                bedding, food and sterile water containing 86 μg/mL\n                Ciprofloxacin and 0.5 mM HCl as they may be temporarily\n                immunocompromised.\n              \n                The mice are monitored as per the approved animal handling\n                institution protocols post irradiation and post busulfan\n                injections.\n                \nNote: Busulfan treatment is\n                  harsh on mice. Busulfan treated mice especially after\n                  irradiation may become lethargic, dehydrated and experience\n                  weight loss in some cases more than 10% of their body weight.\n                  Apart from overall well-being, studies have shown busulfan\n                  treatment to immunocompromise mice due to low WBC counts, and\n                  have gonadotoxicity.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Providing the\n                  mice with subcutaneous saline injections in the days\n                  immediately following busulfan treatment can keep the animals\n                  hydrated and minimize weight loss (20 μL/g mouse of 0.9%\n                  sterile saline given once a day, alternating the site of\n                  injection each day with a maximum of 40 mL/kg given in total).",
    "2 days after the 2nd dose of busulfan treatment,\n            transplant donor BM cells into the busulfan-treated mice as\n            described above.\n          \n        BM transplant into myeloablated recipient mice.\n        \nNote: To study the effect of marrow\n          niche on supporting hematopoiesis, in the second transplant wild-type\n          BM cells transduced to express either GFP or YFP reporter proteins are\n          used. As an example, transplant Gene1-conditioned mice with YFP\n          expressing wild-type BM cells and Gene2-conditioned mice with\n          GFP expressing wild-type BM cells. The transplanted cells can be\n          identified based on the expression of GFP or YFP as well as expression\n          of the CD45.1 isoform.\n        \n        The protocol for the 2nd transplant is similar to the 1st\n        transplant involving the following steps-\n        \n5-fluorouracil (5-FU) Injection of donor mice.\nHarvest BM from 5-FU injected donor mice.\n            Co-culture of BM cells with GP+E86 retrovirus producing\n            cells – The GP+E86 cells in this case are empty\n            vector-expressing either GFP or YFP reporter proteins.\n          \nCollect BM after transduction.\nSelect for transduced BM cells.\n            Transplant transduced cells into busulfan treated recipient mice at\n            the appropriate transduced: helper cells ratio as outlined above.\n          \n            After transplant, the mice are monitored for 2 weeks to allow for\n            engraftment of the transplanted cells before proceeding for the\n            competitive (3rd) transplant.\n            \nNote: After the 2nd\n              transplant, the mice are monitored for their recovery after\n              undergoing Busulfan treatment and BM transplant as detailed above.\n              Monitoring for engraftment at this stage (2 weeks post transplant)\n              can be difficult as it takes a minimum 4 weeks for the engraftment\n              to be consistently measureable in the peripheral blood. However as\n              detailed in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], engraftments are\n              measured after the 3rd competitive transplants.\n            \nCompetitive (3rd) bone marrow transplant\nTiming: 1 day preparation before 3rd\ntransplant\n      2 weeks after 3rd transplant for engraftment of transplanted\n      cells.",
    "In the final transplant, BM cells are harvested from the secondarily\n      transplanted mice and injected into healthy wild-type mice to measure bone\n      marrow chimerism and reconstitution capabilities.\n    \nNote: As an example, the\n      Gene1-conditioned YFP-expressing wild-type BM cells and\n      Gene2-conditioned GFP-expressing wild-type BM cells are mixed in\n      equal proportions before transplanting into wild-type recipients. The\n      effect of marrow niche conditioning can then be studied by monitoring the\n      GFP and YFP chimerism in the peripheral blood and BM of the 3rd\n      transplant recipients.\n    \nNote: For the 3rd transplant\n      donor cells are harvested from the recipient mice of the 2nd\n      transplant. These mice are transplanted with BM cells expressing the\n      CD45.1 isoform (see 2nd transplant “donor and recipient mice”\n      note). Recipient mice are wild-type mice expressing the CD45.2 isoform. In\n      this example we used 8–12 week old C57BL/6J mice as recipients.\n    \n        2 weeks after 2nd transplant, harvest the BM from the 4 long\n        bones of the recipient mice from the 2nd transplant as per\n        the steps outlined above.\n      \nLyse RBC and count live cells as outlined above.\n        Mix cells from Gene1-conditioned mice (YFP-expressing cells) and\n        Gene2-conditioned mice (GFP-expressing cells) at a 1:1 ratio to\n        make up 1 mouse equivalent cell numbers/ recipient mouse in 150 μL of\n        sterile saline.\n      \nNote: At this stage, the cellularity of\n      the marrow is not taken into account. All marrow obtained from the 4 long\n      bones of a mouse is used as 1 mouse equivalent. To ensure consistent cell\n      numbers are transplanted, cells of the same genotype from all donors are\n      mixed and then redistributed to all transplant recipients equally while\n      maintaining a 1:1 ratio of the two conditions tested.\n    \n        Inject 150 μL of mixed cells through the tail vein using a ½ or 1 CC\n        insulin syringe fitted with a 29G needle into lethally irradiated",
