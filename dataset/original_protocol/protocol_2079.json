    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThymus Dissection\nTiming: 15–25 min\nThis section describes how to break down the thymus into the cells that will be used in the next sections. While we have successfully isolated CD34+ cells from thymuses processed up to 24 h after surgical collection, for best results and when isolating CD34– cells we recommend beginning the process of cell isolation within 2 h of surgical collection. Following surgical collection, the thymus should be immediately placed in D10 in a sterile container, and the container should be kept on ice until processing is begun.\nDecontaminate working spaces and equipment with UV light and 70% ethyl alcohol before beginning.\nPut the thymus into a petri dish and add 10 mL DPBS to the petri dish. Place a cell strainer in the petri dish with the thymus (do not place the thymus in the strainer until it has been sliced).\nAdd 10 mL 20°C–22°C (room temperature) D10 to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and place a cell strainer on top of the tube.\nCritical: D10 will maintain cell viability during the dissection process. Keep the cells at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) when processing (this is important for the density gradient centrifugation step).\nIn the petri dish, hold the thymus with the tweezers and slice the thymus with the scalpel.\nNote: Depending on the size of the thymus, not all of it needs to be used (to save time). A 1 inch3 piece of thymus yields 1–5 billion cells based on how finely it is sliced. 1 billion thymus cells yields roughly 1 million CD34+ cells.\nRepeatedly cut the thymus until it is in 1 cm chunks and place the chunks into the cell strainer in the petri dish.",
    "Hold the cell strainer and mash the chunks with the flat end of a 5 mL syringe piston (the piston should be removed from the syringe) to filter the cells into the petri dish and create a cell suspension in DPBS. The DPBS in the petri dish will turn cloudy as cells are released into it.\nPipette the cell suspension into the 50 mL centrifuge tube through the cell strainer to further remove clumps.\nNote: Clumps of thymus cells may clog the pipette tip; break or cut the tip of the pipette to increase the bore size of the pipette inlet, thereby preventing clogging.\nAdd additional DPBS to the petri dish and continue to use the syringe piston to mash chunks through the cell strainer until the mashing does not release more cells into the dish. Transfer the cell suspension to the 50 mL tube.\nNote: Highest cell numbers were achieved with very fine slicing, additional 20–30 mL DPBS, and 10–20 min of mashing.\nDensity Gradient Centrifugation\nTiming: 150–180 min\nDensity gradient centrifugation is done to separate mononuclear cells from red blood cells (RBCs), neutrophils, and dead cells. Ficoll with a density 1.077 g/mL is used in this protocol.",
    "Note: We have successfully performed bulk RNA-seq and differentiation studies of cells isolated from human thymi without using density gradient centrifugation (Casero et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], Ha et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).While we expect that density gradient centrifugation could be omitted if fluorescence-activated cell separation (FACS) is used to remove dead cells and RBCs prior to single cell RNA-seq, we have used density gradient centrifugation for isolation of thymic cells in all single cell RNA-seq experiments in order to minimize dead cells and RBCs. Directly proceed from step 9 to step 27 and use the cell count from step 9 for calculating buffer, blocking reagent, and microbead amounts in steps 29 and 30 if omitting density centrifugation.\nCritical: Ficoll should be at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) to maintain ideal density for separation of layers.\nCount the cells using a method that excludes RBCs (pre-Ficoll cell count).\nNote: We use acetic acid to lyse RBCs in the aliquot of cells used for counting. We typically dilute a 10 μL aliquot of the cell suspension in 3% acetic acid (AA) (1:500–1,000) for counting on a hemocytometer. Other methods such as automated cell counter approaches that exclude RBCs can be used for cell counting. However, since thymus cells tend to be smaller than the default cell size settings on some automated cell counters, the cell size settings on automatic counters may need to be adjusted to accurately count thymus cells.\nCalculate the number of cells needed for the experiment and dilute the sample to 20 million cells/mL with DPBS.\nNote: Using higher cell concentrations per tube may result in poor cell separation and recovery. Use a 2:1 volume ratio of diluted cells to Ficoll; we use 50 mL centrifuge tubes in this protocol (30 mL diluted cells and 15 mL Ficoll per tube).",
    "Calculate the number of 50 mL centrifuge tubes needed and add 15 mL Ficoll to each tube.\nBefore adding cells to each prepared Ficoll tube, mix the cells by pipetting to ensure even concentration of cells.\nSlowly layer 30 mL of the cells (600 million cells) onto the Ficoll in each tube; avoid mixing the cells with the Ficoll.\nCritical: Cell recovery will decrease if the Ficoll has been overly disturbed. When layering, pipette very slowly while directly touching the top of the Ficoll. As the cell layer rises, raise the pipette above the Ficoll and you may pipette more quickly.\nKeep the Ficoll tubes with cells at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) while adding cells to additional Ficoll tubes.\nCentrifuge all tubes at (400 × g, 30 min, 20°C–22°C (room temperature), No Brake (Decel=Off)).\nCritical: It is critical that the brake is off otherwise the buffy layer of mononuclear cells will be disrupted and recovery will decrease.\nOnce centrifugation is complete, set the temperature of the centrifuge to 4°C.\nAspirate and discard the upper layer containing plasma, leaving 10–15 mL of plasma above the mononuclear cell layer (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A for details).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/167-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Density Gradient Centrifugation for Isolation of Human Thymic Mononuclear Cells\n(A) Expected layers created by density gradient centrifugation (step 15).\n(B) Pooling cell pellets from multiple tubes following density gradient centrifugation (step 24).\nNote: While it is okay to have plasma with the cells, post-Ficoll cell recovery drastically decreases if too much Ficoll is collected, which is why it is important to leave some of the plasma layer in the tube while collecting the buffy layer.\nCollect the buffy layer containing the mononuclear cells and transfer to a new 50 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Repeat the process with each additional tube, transferring each buffy layer of cells to a separate, new tube.\nCritical: The buffy layer from each tube needs to be transferred to a separate new tube to prevent the presence of an excessive amount of Ficoll during centrifugation; an excessive amount of Ficoll will prevent cells from pelleting.\nBring each tube up to 50 mL with DPBS and centrifuge (300 × g, 10 min, 4°C, Low Brake)\nCritical: From this point on, cells must be kept on ice or refrigerated and reagents that have been precooled on ice or at 4°C should be used to minimize cell death.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new container. The supernatant from all the tubes can be combined into one container. Place the container on ice.\nNote: If the cells have not formed a pellet (due to excess Ficoll), it is possible to recover them with an additional dilution with DPBS and centrifugation but viability and cell number will likely decrease.\nAdd 10 mL Miltenyi Buffer to one of the tubes (tube 1) and re-suspend the pellet\nTransfer the 10 mL of re-suspended cells to the next tube (tube 2) and re-suspend the cell pellet in tube 2 in this 10 mL.\nContinue the sequential transfer of the 10 mL of re-suspended cells to each of the remaining tubes to re-suspend all the cell pellets so that at the end of step 24 all of the cells are combined into a single tube in 10 mL of Miltenyi Buffer (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B for details).\nAdd an additional 10 mL Miltenyi Buffer to the first tube and transfer similarly to steps 22–24 to recover any remaining cells (i.e., at the end of this step, all cells should be in one tube in 20 mL Miltenyi Buffer).",
    "Count the recovered cells using a method that excludes RBCs (post-Ficoll cell count).\nNote: Expected post-Ficoll cell count recovery is 30%–70% of the pre-Ficoll cell count. Minimization of processing times and Ficoll carry over with the buffy layer increases cell recovery. We count cells on a hemocytometer using 3% AA to lyse red cells (see note in step 9 for details and alternative counting methods). If the post-Ficoll count is lower than expected then the supernatant saved in step 21 could be centrifuged to attempt retrieval of cells that did not pellet in step 20 due to excessive Ficoll carry over.\nBring up the volume of cells to 50 mL with Miltenyi Buffer and centrifuge (300 × g, 10 min, 4°C, Low Brake).\nRemove the supernatant and proceed with the column purification.\nIsolation of CD34+ and CD34— Cells via Magnetic-Activated Cell Separation (MACS)\nTiming: 90–120 min\nCD34+ cells can be isolated from mononuclear cells with this process\nCritical: All cells and reagents should be kept on ice during this process to prevent cell death\nRe-suspend the cells in 300 μL of Miltenyi Buffer for every 400 million cells.\nAdd 100 μL of FCR blocking reagent and 100 μL of Anti-CD34 (Anti-Hapten) Microbeads for every 400 million cells. Mix by gently tapping the tube.\nNote: The manufacturer recommends using 300 μL of buffer, 100 μL of FCR blocking reagent, and 100 μL of microbeads per 100 million cells. However, we have found the lower ratios of reagent volumes (buffer, blocking reagent, microbeads) to cell number mentioned in steps 29 and 30 to be effective.\nIncubate the cells in a refrigerator for 30 min.\nRemove the cells from the refrigerator, bring up to 50 mL with Miltenyi Buffer, and centrifuge (300 × g, 10 min, 4°C, Low Brake).",
    "While the cells are spinning, attach the magnet to the magnetic stand in the biosafety cabinet, place the LS column in the magnet holder, and the pre-separation filter in the LS column.\nPlace a 50 mL tube under the column to collect CD34– cells. The CD34– cells will be in the flow through from the column.\nEquilibrate the column by pipetting 3 mL Miltenyi Buffer into the pre-separation filter.\nNote: Limit the number of cells per LS Column to two billion. Use multiple columns if necessary (e.g., use two columns for 4 billion cells).\nRemove the supernatant and re-suspend cells in 5 mL Miltenyi Buffer.\nAdd the re-suspended cells to the pre-separation filter/column.\nRinse the centrifuge tube with 3 mL Miltenyi Buffer to recover remaining cells.\nWait for the first 5 mL of cells to completely pass through the column first, then add the next 3 mL of rinsed cells to the pre-separation filter/column.\nAfter the rinsed cells have passed through, wash the pre-separation filter/column 6 times with 3 mL Miltenyi Buffer.\nNote: This process will take approximately 45 min.",
    "Critical: When adding a new wash, wait until the previous wash has completely filtered through. It is important to do 5–6 washes for maximum purity. The rate at which the Miltenyi Buffer passes through the column decreases with each wash. During the final two washes, the buffer will drip through the column slowly (20 min per wash in some cases) - this is normal. If the Miltenyi Buffer takes more than 20 min during the 5th wash then skip the final wash to minimize the time the CD34+ cells stay in the column. If the Miltenyi Buffer stops flowing through the column, it is possible to remove the excess buffer (that is not in the bead area of the column) and continue with step 39.\nAfter the last wash is completed, remove the magnet, magnet stand, and pre-separation filter. Keep CD34– cells on ice. Perform a viable cell count for CD34– cells.\nPlace the magnetic column over a new 15 mL conical and add 5 mL Miltenyi Buffer into the column.\nInsert the plunger into the column and push hard to extract the CD34+ cells from the magnetic beads into the 15 mL conical tube.\nPerform a viable cell count for CD34+ cells.\nNote: We use trypan blue and a hemocytometer for counting viable cells. The expected yield of CD34+ cells is 0.2%–0.5% of the post-Ficoll cell count. An automated cell counter (e.g., ThermoFisher Countess II) can be used for this step.\nImmediately proceed with FACS for isolation of highly enriched populations of viable CD34+ or CD34– cells for single cell RNA-seq.",
    "Pause Point: The CD34+ cells can be cryopreserved and FACS sorting for further isolation of these cells for single cell RNA-seq can be performed at a later time. Post-thaw cell recovery will be approximately 30%–50% of the pre-freeze cell count. Cryopreserved and freshly prepared CD34+ cells have yielded similar results in single cell RNA-seq studies done in our lab (Le et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). CD34– thymic cells predominantly consist of CD4+CD8+ (double positive, DP) cells. Less than 10% of DP cells in the thymus undergo positive selection and survive while the remaining DP cells undergo apoptosis (Klein et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Due to this high physiological death rate among CD34– cells, we recommend using fresh CD34– cells rather than cryopreserved CD34– cells for FACS isolation of cells for single cell RNA-seq in order to maximize the viability of the input cells for single cell RNA-seq. See Optional Sections: Cryopreserving Isolated Cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5] and Thawing Cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6] for additional details.\nFACS Sorting for Single Cell RNA-Seq\nTiming: 45–90 min\nThis section is for sorting live (DAPI-) CD34+ progenitor (CD34+Lin–), CD34– leukocyte (CD34-CD45+GlyA–), CD4 single positive (CD3+CD4+CD8–), and CD8 single positive (CD3+CD4–CD8+) cells for single cell RNA-seq (intended input cell concentration of 400–1,500 cells/μL for library preparation). Lin: CD4, CD8, and Glycophorin A (Gly A) (GlyA for removing RBCs).",
    "The hematopoietic progenitor cells that migrate from the bone marrow and initiate T-cell differentiation in the human thymus are characterized by expression of CD34. The initial stages of thymopoiesis are marked by two processes, the induction of expression of T-lineage genes (specification) and the loss of alternative (non-T) lineage potentials (commitment). The earliest thymic progenitors (CD34+CD7–CD1a–, Thy1) possess myelo-erythroid and full lymphoid (B, T, and NK) potential (Hao et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Successive stages of commitment are marked by the sequential upregulation of CD7 (CD34+CD7+CD1a–, Thy2) and CD1a and a progressive loss of alternative lineage potentials, resulting in the generation of CD34+CD7+CD1a+ (Thy3) cells, the earliest fully committed progenitors, which subsequently give rise to immature single positive (ISP, CD3–CD4+CD8–) cells. ISP expressing a rearranged TCR (T-cell receptor) β chain proliferate via pre-TCR signaling and differentiate into double positive (DP, CD4+CD8+) cells (β-selection). Only the DP expressing a TCRαβ receptor reactive to a self-peptide/MHC (major histocompatibility antigen) complex survive (positive selection) and differentiate into mature naïve single positive CD3+T cells (CD4+ or CD8+) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Cells with high TCR reactivity to self-peptides are eliminated via negative selection (Plum et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/167-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schema for Human Thymopoiesis\nHPC, hematopoietic progenitor cells; ISP, immature single positive cells; DP, double positive cells; SP, single positive cells.\nNote: All cells and reagents should be kept on ice during this section of the protocol to prevent cell death.\nSeparate 20 million CD34– cells, 20,000 CD34+ cells (unstained control), and the remaining CD34+ cells.\nCentrifuge the CD34+ and CD34– cell suspensions (300 × g, 4°C, 5 min).\nWhile the cells spin, prepare the following antibody mixes:\nMix A (for up to 20 million cells, scale up accordingly):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_167_8.csv\nMix B (for up to 2.5 million cells, scale up accordingly):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_167_9.csv",
    "Note: Preparation of an antibody mix reduces the cell loss associated with pipetting multiple antibodies into a low volume of cells. It is always recommended to create a mix when using multiple antibodies.\nAspirate the supernatant to the following volumes:\nCD34–: 40 μL buffer/20 million cells\nCD34+: 20 μL buffer/2.5 million cells\nNote: If using cryopreserved CD34+ cells then the CD34+ cells need to be blocked in 40 μL of blocking buffer for 5 min on ice prior to the addition of flow cytometry antibodies. Blocking reduces non-specific binding of antibodies to cells. The addition of FCR blocking reagent when processing cells for MACS (step 30) obviates the need for a separate blocking step prior to staining cells with flow cytometry antibodies if performing FACS using fresh cells directly after MACS.\nAdd the appropriate antibody mix to the cells and incubate for 15 min at 4°C (in the fridge, covered with foil).\nAntibody Mix A: add to CD34– cells\nAntibody Mix B: add to CD34+ cells. CD7 and CD1a antibodies were included to enable additional enrichment for the earliest thymic progenitor (Thy 1: CD34+CD7–CD1a–) cells\nAdd 3 mL PBS + 1% FBS to each tube and strain the cell suspension into a new Filter FACS tube.\nNote: We recommend loosening the filter cap before adding the cell suspension in order to aid filtration. Be careful when loading the cell suspension to prevent overflow since the cell suspension does not usually filter immediately. If the cell suspension is stuck in the filter cap, lightly tap the bottom of the tube against the floor of the biosafety cabinet. Tap repeatedly until the cell suspension begins to filter before adding more cells.",
    "Centrifuge (300 × g, 4°C, 5 min) and bring down volume of supernatant to achieve concentration of roughly 5 million - 10 million cells/mL.\nNote: We use an aliquot of stained cells for area scaling and setting sort gates\nTo enable exclusion of dead cells, add 2.5 μL sterile DAPI a few minutes prior to starting FACS.\nNote: The DAPI is only added just prior to FACS in order to prevent overstaining that can occur with prolonged exposure of cells to DAPI\nSort desired populations into 100% FBS in sterile, capped tubes and transfer onto ice.\nNote: See Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for gating strategies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/167-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gating Strategy for Sorting CD34+Lin– and CD34+CD7–CD1a– Cells\nThy1, CD34+CD7–CD1a–; Thy2, CD34+CD7+CD1a–; Thy3, CD34+CD7+CD1a+. Figure reprinted with permission from Le et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/167-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Gating Strategy for Sorting CD34–CD45+GlyA–, CD3+CD4+CD8–, and CD3+CD4–CD8+ Cells\nFigure reprinted with permission from Le et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\nNote: A 70 μm nozzle is recommended to minimize sort time and dilution of the FBS in the collection tube from sheath fluid volume carry over, which can negatively affect cell viability. Cells should be run on the flow cytometer at a rate of 500–3,000 events/s during FACS.\nCritical: 100% FBS is used to maintain the viability of the sorted cells. Collection tubes should be inverted to coat the sides of the tube with FBS, free of air bubbles, and on ice prior to sorting. For best results, the preparation of cells for downstream droplet based single cell RNA-seq (10x or InDrop) should be completed within 30 min after FACS to prevent excess cell death. Cells and reagents should also be kept on ice to prevent cell death.",
    "Note: Due to sheath volume carry over from the cytometer, up to 5 × 105 cells can be sorted into 300 μL of 100% FBS in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Higher numbers of cells should be sorted into 1 mL 100% FBS in a 5 mL FACS tube. The maximum number of cells that can be sorted into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube will be lower if using a larger nozzle. After the sort, mix each collection tube by inversion to suspend the cells in FBS. We typically sort 400,000 CD34+Lin– cells into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and 1 million CD34–CD45+GlyA– cells into a FACS tube.\nNote: Since the earliest thymic progenitor population (CD34+CD7–CD1a–) represents less than 5% of CD34+ cells, additional CD34+CD7–CD1a– cells can be sorted into the collection tube for CD34+Lin– cells to ensure adequate representation of the earliest progenitors in the single cell RNA-seq data for CD34+ cells. We typically sort an additional 10,000 CD34+CD7–CD1a– into the same collection tube into which 400,000 CD34+Lin– cells have been previously sorted.\nTransfer the sorted cells to a 15 mL conical tube. Rinse out any leftover cells in the original collection tube with additional Miltenyi Buffer and transfer to the 15 mL conical tube.\nBring the volume up to 15 mL with Miltenyi Buffer.\nCentrifuge (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C, Standard Brake) and then aspirate the supernatant to leave behind a volume of ∼40 μL.\nBring the volume up to 4 mL with D10.\nRemove the filter cap from a Filter FACS Tube, hold it over a 15 mL conical tube, and filter the cell suspension into the 15 mL conical.",
    "Note: The cell suspension needs to be concentrated for single cell RNA-seq and it is easier to aspirate from a 15 mL conical compared to a Filter FACS Tube. Trying to aspirate to volumes below 200 μL in a Filter FACS Tube may lead to loss of cells.\nCentrifuge (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C, Standard Brake) and aspirate the supernatant down to a volume of 50–80 μL.\nNote: Cell loss can be avoided by using a P200 to aspirate when the volume is below 500 μL in the conical\nRe-suspend the cell pellet with a P20 or P200 micropipette to avoid cell loss.\nCount cells using a cell counter and a hemocytometer and proceed with single cell RNA-seq library preparation.\nCritical: An accurate cell count is critical for successful library preparation with droplet based single cell RNA-seq protocols (e.g., 10x, InDrop). Refer to the protocol for the 10x or InDrop kit that you are using to determine the ideal input cell concentration needed for library preparation. We have used this protocol for isolation of CD34+ and CD34– cells for the downstream generation of 10x (v2 and V3.2) and InDrop (v2 and v3) libraries.\nNote: CD34– thymic cells tend to be small in size making default settings for cell detection on some electronic cell counters (e.g., ThermoFisher Countess II) inaccurate. Cell counter settings should be adjusted for CD34– and CD34+ human thymic cells prior to use. A hemocytometer count done in parallel is recommended. Cell counts may vary by two fold between the hemocytometer and automated counts done on the same sample. Larger variations indicate improper settings on the electronic counter or counting errors when using the hemocytometer. Electronic cell counter results were used in this protocol for determining the input volume of the cell suspension for library preparation.",
    "Note: Standard hemocytometers and the Countess II require 10 μL of sample to be loaded, so use a 1:1 ratio of cells to Trypan blue (5 μL cell sample + 5 μL Trypan blue). The optimal dilution for other electronic cell counters may vary, so use the lowest amount of cell sample to meet the recommended dilution.\nCryopreserving Isolated Cells (Optional)\nTiming: 10 min\nIf time is a limiting factor, it is possible to cryopreserve CD34+ cells following MACS (Pause Point at step 43) and resume processing at a later time.\nNote: To maximize cell viability, use FBS + 10% DMSO that was prepared no more than a week ago.\nCentrifuge cells (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C, Standard Brake) and remove as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the cells.\nAdd FBS + 10% DMSO to cells to a volume of 1 mL per tube and re-suspend cells\nNote: Post-thaw cell recovery is best when vials are frozen at 2–5 million cells per vial.\nAliquot cells into cryovials and into a freezing container before transferring to a −80°C freezer.\nNote: DMSO is toxic to cells - cryovials should be transferred to a −80°C within 2 min of adding the FBS + 10% DMSO.\nAfter 24–48 h, transfer the vials from the freezing container into a container in a liquid nitrogen freezer.\nThawing Cells (Optional)\nTiming: 10 min\nThis section outlines how to thaw cryopreserved MACS enriched CD34+ cells for further processing. If cryopreserved cells are used then proceed with the protocol starting from step 44.\nWarm D10 to 20°C–22°C (room temperature) by leaving it in a low-light area or in a heated water bath for 5–10 min.",
    "Note: To maximize cell viability, the D10 should be no more than 2 weeks old. Using 20°C–22°C (room temperature) D10 is important in order to prevent cell death due to sudden temperature changes.\nRemove the cryovial containing 1 mL of frozen cells from the liquid nitrogen freezer and immediately place it into a 37°C water bath.\nThaw the cells by gently swirling the vial in the 37°C water bath until just a tiny sliver of ice remains in the vial (1–2 min).\nSpray the outside of the vial with 70% ethanol and transfer the vial into the biosafety cabinet to prevent contamination.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL conical.\nSlowly add the 20°C–22°C (room temperature) D10 in dropwise fashion into the tube containing the thawed cells to bring the volume up to 15 mL. Shake tube while adding D10.\nNote: It is important to add the 20°C–22°C (room temperature) D10 slowly in order to prevent sudden changes in the temperature of the cells, which could lower viability. If thawing multiple vials, up to two vials of frozen cells can be pooled per 15 mL conical. Thawing more than two vials is not recommended due to the amount of DMSO present in freezing medium; if the DMSO is not properly diluted, cell viability will decrease.\nCentrifuge cell samples at 300 × g, 5 min, 20°C–22°C (room temperature).\nAspirate as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet to remove as much DMSO as possible.\nGently re-suspend the cells in appropriate media or buffer for downstream studies.\nCell recovery after thawing is 30%–50% of frozen cells, we recommend performing a cell count after resuspending cells in the appropriate buffer or medium."
