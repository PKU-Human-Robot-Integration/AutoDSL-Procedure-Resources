Three molecular and consecutive transformations are required to obtain Franken Sphingomonas-X (X = target protein) namely, Franken Sphingomonas-MSP4 or Franken Sphingomonas-HSP70. A representative scheme of the following steps is disclosed at the end of this section (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2971-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

A further dilution might be done if concentration is too high for volume processing.\nQuantify DNA concentration using a NanoDrop and dilute to an optimal working concentration (if needed). We recommend to dilute DNA solution to a 5–10 ng/μL.",
    "Pause point: PCR product can be stored at −20°C until further processing.\nClone resulting purified PCR products (5–10 ng of fresh PCR product in a final volume of 0.5–4 μL) using a pENTR Directional TOPO cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Escherichia coli TOP10 competent cells following manufacturer protocols Thermo Fisher (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/K240020[href=http://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/K240020]). pENTR/D-TOPO plasmid includes a cassette for kanamycin resistance.\nPerform TOPO cloning reaction by chemical transformation.\nNote: Manufacturer's instructions recommend for optimal results a 0.5:1 to 2:1 molar ratio of PCR product:TOPO vector. 5–10 ng of fresh PCR product in a final volume of 2–4 μL should be enough to succeed in chemical transformation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2971_10.csv\nMix the TOPO reaction gently and incubate on ice for 15–20 min.\nAdd 2 μL of the TOPO cloning reaction to 1 vial of One Shot Chemically Competent E. coli cells and mix gently by vortex for 15 s.\nIncubate on ice for 20 min.\nHeat-shock on a thermoblock for 30 s at 42°C without shaking. Immediately, transfer the mix to ice.\nAdd 250 μL of SOC medium prior equilibrated to room temperature (18–25°C).\nOptional: If SOC medium is not available, fresh LB broth equilibrated to room temperature without antibiotics is also optimal in this step.\nIncubate the transformed cells-containing tube horizontally at 37°C for 1.5 h with gentle shaking (200 rpm).\nSpread cells on LB agar plates enriched with kanamycin at 50 μg/mL.\nNote: It is recommended to spread plates with different volumes (50 μL and 100 μL) of cells mix to optimize transformation and obtained colonies.\nIncubate plates overnight at 37°C.\nOn the following day, pick 5–6 antibiotic-resistant colonies and plate again on new LB agar plates with kanamycin at 50 μg/mL.",

One intended for bacterial stock stored at −80°C, and the other one for plasmid purification using GeneJet Plasmid kit following manufacturer's instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Flr_clonaseii_man.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Flr_clonaseii_man.pdf])\nCentrifuge bacterial cultures at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nPurify the plasmid of interest using GeneJet Plasmid kit, quantify DNA concentration and store at −20°C until further processing.\nGenerate an expression construct using plasmid pVHD (Addgene plasmid #61303) herein, pVHD, pVHD-msp4 and pVHD-hsp70) by performing LR recombination reaction (recombination reaction between attL and attR sites) between the entry clone and a Gateway destination vector.\nFor Sphingomonas transformation, a vanillate-inducible gene expression is chosen as destination vector for Gateway cloning (tetracycline resistance plasmid). Plasmid details are available: https://www.addgene.org/61303/[href=https://www.addgene.org/61303/]\nPerform Gateway Cloning following manufacturer's instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assehttps://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Flr_clonaseii_man.pdfts.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Flr_clonaseii_man.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assehttps://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Flr_clonaseii_man.pdfts.thermofisher.com/TFS]).\nNote: For the entry clone (TOPO vector), it is recommended to add 100 ng in a final volume of 5 μL to the LR reaction to obtain an appropriate and working number of colonies.\nTransform One Shot Chemically Competent E. coli cells as described above (Step 2) with 1 μL of each LR reaction.\nSpread cells on LB agar plates enriched with tetracycline 20 μg/mL and incubate overnight at 37°C.\nPick 5–6 antibiotic-resistant colonies and validate gene insertion by PCR. Grow positive colonies in a small volume (10 mL) of LB broth with tetracycline at 20 μg/mL in replicates overnight (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).",
    "Purify the plasmid of interest (pVHD-msp4 or pVHD-hsp70) using GeneJet Plasmid kit, quantify its concentration by NanoDrop (or microplate reader) and store at −20°C until further processing.\nNote: To ensure an accurate expression construct, it is highly recommended to perform a restriction analysis and sequence DNA from positive transformed E. coli colonies once the plasmid of interest is purified.\nGrow Sphingomonas SpAR92 at 30°C in 250 mL of sterilized broth R2A medium until O.D. 600 nm reaches 0.7–0.8.\nCentrifuge 50 mL of the bacterial culture at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nWash pellet twice with 10 mL of chilled 10% glycerol.\nResuspend pellet in a small volume (400–500 μL) in chilled 10% glycerol.\nMix 100 μL of the SpAR92 cell suspension with 1 μg of the purified expression construct.\nNote: It is recommended to add 1 μg of purified expression construct in 3–4 μL to the cell suspension. Then, after quantify plasmid purified concentration on Step 7, prepare a DNA dilution around 0.2–0.4 μg/μL.\nIntroduce purified expression construct generated into Sphingomonas strain by electroporation9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] to obtain Franken Sphingomonas:\nPut bacterial-expression construct mix (Step 12: 100 μL of SpAR92 cell suspension and 1 μg of purified expression constructs) into 0.2 cm electroporation cuvettes.\nPerform electroporation using a Gene Pulser (or similar) with a single pulse at 2.5 kV.\nImmediately, carefully add 600 μL of SOC medium at room temperature for recovering directly to the cuvette.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a new 2-mL tube and allow cells to grow horizontally for 2 h at 30°C with gentle shaking (200 rpm) (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nSpread cells on R2A agar plates with tetracycline(Step 3, resistance cassette included in p-VHD plasmid) at 20 μg/mL for colony selection.\nIncubate plates overnight at 30°C.",
    "Note: Depending on the purpose of the experiment, it is recommended to additionally transform Sphingomonas with pVHD destination vector with no insert fragment (pVHD plasmid alone) to have a good experimental control in the experiment (herein, Sphingomonas-pVHD).\nOn the following day, pick 5–6 antibiotic-resistant colonies and plate again on new R2A agar plates with tetracycline at 20 μg/mL.\nValidate positive colonies carrying pVHD, pVHD-msp4 and pVHD-hsp70 (Franken Sphingomonas-pVHD, Franken Sphingomonas-msp4, Franken Sphingomonas-hsp70 plasmids by PCR as described (Step 1) and 1.25% agarose gel.\nGrow SpAR92 positive colonies in R2A broth with tetracycline at 20 μg/mL at 30°C to mid-exponential phase (O.D. 600 nm = 0.6–0.8) in a small volume (50 mL) and induce gene expression by the addition of 250 μM Vanillate for at least 6 h.\nNote: Grow SpAR92 positive colonies in at least two replicates. One intended for preparing bacterial stocks to be further stored at −80°C and the other one for characterization of Franken Sphingomonas.\nNote: If characterization and co-infection assay are going to be done continuously, grow SpAR92 colonies in at least three replicates of two different volumes: 50 mL for bacterial stock, 50 mL for characterization by flow cytometry and 250 mL for co-infection assay.\nPause point: If the researcher does not have time to continue with the following steps continuously, a bacterial stock at −80°C can be defrosted, inoculated in 250 mL of R2A broth with antibiotic (tetracycline 20 μg/mL) and grow at 30°C with shaking to mid-exponential phase (O.D. 600 nm = 0.6–0.8) for further characterization.",
    "Critical: the time for inducing gene expression depends on target protein, bacterial culture and plasmid introduced in the cell suspension. It is recommended to set an appropriate induction time for each protein. Below, is described a protocol for setting gene expression induction time in Franken Sphingomonas by flow cytometry.\nCharacterization of Franken Sphingomonas by flow cytometry\nTiming: 1–2 days\nIn this section, a detailed protocol for characterization of Franken Sphingomonas by flow cytometry to analyze targeted protein production (herein, MSP4 and HSP70 proteins) in permeabilized cells at different induction times (0, 3 and 6 h) is described. Target protein could be located on the surface or inside cells.\nInduce gene expression by addition of 250 μM Vanillate to 100 mL of Franken Sphingomonas-pVHD, Franken Sphingomonas-MSP4 and Franken Sphingomonas-HSP70 bacterial cultures at O.D. 600 nm = 0.6–0.8.\nTake 1-mL aliquots in replicates (3–4 replicates for each bacterial culture and induction time) at 0, 3 and 6 h induction times.\nNote: If needed, dilute aliquots until an O.D. 600 nm = 0.6 is reached with PBS +1% FBS.\nWash bacterial cultures twice with PBS +1% FBS by centrifugation for 5 min at 7000 × g at room temperature.\nNote: For Franken Sphingomonas transformed with pVHD plasmid alone, directly resuspend pellet as described in Step 3. This experimental condition will be used as a control for flow cytometry with no-protein detection.\nFor non-permeabilized replicates:\nIncubate each separate cell suspension (Franken Sphingomonas-MSP4 and Franken Sphingomonas-HSP70) with 50 μL of rabbit anti-MSP4 primary antibody (1:50, 0.4 mg/mL) and monoclonal anti-HSP70 primary antibody (1:100, 0.7 mg/mL), respectively for each bacterial culture in PBS +5% FBS for 2 h at room temperature.\nWash by adding 1 mL PBS +1% FBS and centrifugate for 5 min at 7000 × g.",
    "Incubate with respective secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC for MSP4 and goat anti-mouse IgG FITC for HSP70) at 1:100 dilution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nCritical: Do not forget to add Franken Sphingomonas with no antibody (FrankenSph-MSP4 and FrankenSph-HSP70) and with only respective secondary antibodies as background control for cytometry analysis for non-permeabilized cells.\nFor permeabilized cells, use Intracell Solution kit (https://shop.immunostep.com/accesory-reagents/1281-intracell.html[href=https://shop.immunostep.com/accesory-reagents/1281-intracell.html]) following manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications:\nAdd 100 μL of Intracell Reagent A to the cell suspension. Mix well and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nWash with 1 mL PBS +1% FBS and centrifugate for 5 min at 7000 × g.\nRemove supernatant carefully.\nAdd 100 μL of Intracell Reagent B (permeabilization) carefully to the cell pellet, trying not to make bubbles.\nNote: vortexing is strongly not recommended in this step to avoid foam.\nAdd corresponding primary antibody to the cell suspension mix and incubate for 2 h at room temperature.\nWash with 1 mL PBS +1% FBS and centrifugate at 7000 × g.\nRemove supernatant carefully.\nAdd 100 μL of Intracell Reagent B (permeabilization) carefully to the pellet, trying not to make bubbles.\nAdd respective secondary antibody to the cell suspension mix and incubate for 1 h in the dark at room temperature.\nCritical: do not forget to include Franken Sphingomonas with no antibody (FrankenSph-MSP4 and FrankenSph-HSP70) and with respective only secondary antibodies as background control for cytometry analysis of permeabilized cells.\nWash with 1 mL PBS +1% FBS and centrifugate at 7000 × g.\nResuspend pellet with PBS +1% FBS and ensure that the cell pellet is in suspension.\nAnalyze samples using a flow cytometer (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2971-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Flow cytometry analysis of Franken Sphingomonas-HSP70 and Franken Sphingomonas-MSP4 after 6 h of induction time with 250 μM Vanillate",
    "Represented data have been obtained from experimental assay described by Mazuecos et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Abbreviations: ab, antibody; FrankenSp, Franken Sphingomonas.\nNote: A FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used for the flow cytometry analysis. Laser, wavelength and photomultiplier will depend on cytometer used and antibodies conjugates. In this case, we use fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for excitation at 488 nm, and photomultiplier FL1.\nNote: Our flow cytometry analysis revealed that HSP70 protein is predominantly produced intracellularly (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). However, MSP4 protein is located at similar levels both inside cell and in the surface of bacterial membrane, as observed in results obtained in non-permeabilized cells (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C) and permeabilized cells (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D). It is highly recommended to add Franken Sphingomonas-X with no antibody incubation (grey graph) as internal control together with secondary antibody control (blue graph).\nFranken Sphingomonas-A. phagocytophilum co-infection of I. scapularis ISE6 tick cells\nTiming: 4–5 days\nHere is described a protocol for co-infection analysis of Franken Sphingomonas with A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis ISE6 tick cells (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Franken Sphingomonas-MSP4 has been reported to compete with A. phagocytophilum and reduce pathogen infection in both ISE6 and HL-60 cells and in I. scapularis ticks fed on A. phagocytophilum-infected C3H/HeN mice.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] A. phagocytophilum infection in ISE6 tick cells is further analyzed by qPCR and confocal microscopy analysis is performed to obtain representative images of the co-infection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2971-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Produced proteins or vector alone control are shown in parenthesis. Abbreviation: FrankenSph, Franken Sphingomonas.\nNote: Calculate the final volume for resuspending the bacterial pellet (O.D. = 0.1) considering that for the co-infection assay 100 μL/mL of Franken Sphingomonas are needed for each replicate. For example, to make 4 replicates of each experimental condition, we need a final volume of 400 μL of Franken Sphingomonas-MSP4. We recommend to prepare a final volume of 0.5 mL. In case of the control Franken Sphingomonas-pVHD, we need 800 μL (Franken Sphingomonas-pVHD is used as control , see number of replicates in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). In this case, we recommend to prepare 1 mL final volume at O.D. = 0.1.\nCulture ISE6 tick cells in L-15B300:R2A medium (1:1) and culture 500,000 cells per well in a 24 well-plate (500,000 cells in 1 mL final volume).\nNote: If confocal microscopy is going to be done in parallel with co-infection assay, culture two 24-well-plates with same experimental conditions.\nIncubate at 31°C with 100 μL/mL of Franken Sphingomonas or culture medium alone for control wells for 12 h.\nInfect appropriate wells with 100 μL of semi-purified A. phagocytophilum (O.D. 600 nm = 0.1) or culture medium for control wells and incubate for additional 72 h at 31°C.",

Remove supernatant.\nPause point: Cell pellet can be stored at −20°C for at least 1 week until further processing. For long-term storage, store at −80°C.\nExtract total DNA from cell pellet by using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit following manufacturer's instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit]).\nQuantify DNA concentration by nanodrop or microplate reader of all samples.\nAnalyze A. phagocytophilum infection in ISE6 tick cells by qPCR targeting Anaplasma msp2 gene and normalize against tick 40S ribosomal protein S4 (rpS4) gene.
