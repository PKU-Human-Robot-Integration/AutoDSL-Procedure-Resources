    "All procedures described must be performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations for the use of vertebrate animals, including prior approval by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Generating Fluorescently Labeled Tumors and Tumor-associated Macrophages\nGenerate fluorescently labeled tumor cells by crossing the spontaneous, autochthonous, genetically engineered mouse mammary cancer model where the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat drives the polyoma middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) with transgenic mice with fluorescent reporters [i.e., enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) or Dendra2]8,9.\nFluorescently label macrophages in PyMT animals with fluorescently labeled tumor cells by crossing genetically engineered mouse models with myeloid- and macrophage- specific fluorescent reporters [i.e., MacGreen15 or MacBlue mice Csf1r-GAL4VP16/UAS-ECFP16] .\nAlternatively, generate fluorescently labeled tumors through orthotopic transplantation of fluorescently labeled PyMT tumor cells (syngeneic), human breast cancer cell lines or primary human patient derived tumors (xenografts)11,17.\n\t\nImplant fluorescently labeled PyMT tumor cells into syngeneic mice with fluorescent protein-labeled myeloid cells to generate animals with fluorescently labeled tumor cells and myeloid cells13.\nInject 100 µl of 10 mg/kg fluorescent 70 kDa dextran by intravenous (i.v.) tail vein into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice with xenograft tumors of human cell lines or patient-derived primary tumors to fluorescently label macrophages 2 hr prior to the start of intravital imaging.\n2. Microscope Setup and Imaging Preparation\nNote: This procedure describes the set-up for intravital imaging on a multiphoton microscope8.\nTurn on all microscope and laser components including two-photon lasers and the detectors.\nTurn on the heating box to 30 °C to pre-warm the stage. This step is critical for maintaining the physiological temperature of the animal.",
    "For use on an inverted microscope place the custom-made stage insert on the microscope stage. The custom insert is a sheet of 1/8\" thick aluminum machined to fit in the stage insert space and with a 1\" diameter through-hole in the center for imaging.\n\t\nWipe the microscope stage and stage insert with 70% ethanol and air dry.\nPlace a large drop of water on the 20X, 1.05 NA microscope objective to maintain optical contact with the cover glass.\nPlace cover glass (#1.5 thickness) over the imaging port on the microscope stage insert. Secure in place with lab tape.\nUse a hole punch to punch a 2 cm x 2 cm hole in a flexible rubber pad and place the rubber pad on the microscope stage with the hole in the pad aligned with the hole in the custom stage insert.\n3. Preparation of Tail Vein Catheter and Reagents for Injection during Imaging\nCut a 30 cm length of polyethylene (PE) tubing.\nUsing forceps, move the metal needle of a 31 G needle back and forth until it breaks off of the plastic fitting.\nUsing forceps, insert the blunt end of the detached needle into the PE tubing.\nInsert a 31 G needle into the other end of the PE tubing.\nFill a 1 cc syringe with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and insert it into the 31 G needle and flush all air out of the tubing and needle with PBS. PBS is used for maintaining hydration and blood osmolarity9,18, however isotonic saline may also be used.\nFill a 1 cc syringe with 200 µl of 3 mg/kg 155 kDa dextran-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) or quantum dots for vascular labeling.",
    "Prepare any other injectable proteins such as a 165 amino acid isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA165) in a 1 cc syringe and place on ice. Inject 0.2 mg/kg VEGFA16519 at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml.\n4. Insertion of the Indwelling Tail Vein Catheter\nPlace the animal under anesthesia using an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane with O2 as the carrier gas.\nTransfer the mouse to the surgical platform once it is fully anesthetized and does not respond to a toe pinch.\nOpen isoflurane anesthesia line to the surgical platform, close the anesthesia line to the induction chamber and place the nose cone over the animal's snout. Reduce the isoflurane from 5% to 2.5%.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mouse to prevent dryness during anesthesia.\nHeat the animal under the heating lamp for an additional 2 min to increase circulation in the tail as circulation slows with deep anesthesia.\nSterilize the mouse tail vein with 70% ethanol.\nInsert the tip of the 31 G needle from the catheter constructed in Section 3 into the lateral tail vein of the animal and push the needle in 2-3 mm.\nPull back on the syringe to see blood, ensuring the catheter is placed in the tail vein.\nUse a 1 cm length of lab tape placed over the needle to hold the needle in place parallel to the vein along the length of the tail.\n5. Skin Flap Surgical Procedure to Expose the Mammary Tumor\nWith the animal on the surgical platform swab the tumor and the ventral surface with 70% ethanol. Note: As described, this procedure is not performed completely aseptically.  For long imaging sessions where infection can become a confounding factor, it is recommended to use proper aseptic technique.",
    "Using sterile forceps, lift the ventral skin and with sterile scissors make a subcutaneous incision along the ventral midline approximately 1 cm in length. Avoid puncturing the peritoneum during the incision.\nGently cut the connective tissue attaching the mammary gland and tumor away from the peritoneum to expose the mammary tumor.\nUsing scissors and forceps, gently remove and cut away the fascia and fat from the exposed surface of the tumor while maintaining the integrity of the tumor vasculature and minimizing bleeding. This step is critical in maintaining the tumor architecture and vasculature supply of the tumor.\n6. Animal Preparation for Microscopy\nTransfer the animal to the pre-warmed imaging stage with the exposed tumor placed on the coverslip on the stage insert over the microscope objective for imaging. Take care to transfer the tail vein catheter gently with the animal so as not to dislodge the needle.\nPlace the anesthesia nose cone over the animal's snout to maintain anesthesia set to 3% isoflurane.\nPosition the animal so that the tumor rests in the hole of the rubber pad and makes contact with the glass coverslip.\nUse two rubber pads to gently hold the tumor in place and fix them to the microscope stage with lab tape to reduce movement during image acquisition.\nFill the chamber from the rubber pad with PBS to keep the tissue hydrated and maintain optical contact with the coverslip.\nStart monitoring the animal's vital signs with a pulse oximeter probe. Attach a clip sensor to the thigh of the animal. Alternatively a collar that is configured to fit around the neck can be used.\nPlace the heating box over the animal to maintain 30 °C 20.\nSlowly reduce the level of isoflurane to 0.5-1% to maintain anesthesia and maintain blood flow.",
    "7. Image Acquisition and Injection of Fluorescent Dyes and Injectable Proteins\nUsing the microscope eyepiece focus on the fluorescent tumor cells on the surface of the tumor.\nSelect an area of interest by finding areas with flowing blood vessels. The selection of an area of interest with flowing blood vessels is critical for assessing tumor vasculature.\nOnce a region of interest has been selected switch the microscope into multiphoton imaging mode.\nSet the upper and lower limits of a z-series. Set the upper limit of the z-series by using the focus adjuster to move the objective to the desired start location and clicking on the Z position \"Top\" button. Determine the upper limit of the z-series by visualizing the collagen fiber network at the surface of the tumor in the second harmonic generation (SHG) channel and observing when no cells but only collagen fibers are visible.\n\t\nSet the lower limit of the z-series by moving the objective to the desired imaging depth (typically 50 - 150 µm) and clicking the Z position \"Bottom\" button.\nSet the step size by typing the desired value into the step size field. Determine step size based on considerations for resolution and acquisition time (typically 2 µm is used for high-resolution 3D reconstruction and 5 µm otherwise).\nSet the time-lapse interval by switching to the Time-Lapse panel and entering the desired lapse time into the Time-Lapse field. For optimal temporal resolution set the time interval to 0 sec for continuous imaging. Note: For long time-lapse imaging it is recommended to set the time interval to 10 sec between acquisitions to replenish the objective immersion liquid.\nOnce the parameters for imaging have been determined, slowly inject 155 kDa dextran-TMR.",
    "Remove the syringe with PBS in the tail vein catheter and replace with the syringe containing 155 kDa dextran-TMR taking care not to introduce any bubbles into the line.\nSlowly inject 155 kDa dextran-TMR into the mouse, with a maximum volume of 200 µl, and replace the syringe with syringe containing PBS. CRITICAL STEP: Perform the injection slowly and take precautions to avoid getting solution outside of the vein.\nStart the acquisition of the Z-stack time-lapse imaging by clicking on the Z-Stack and Time-Lapse buttons to depress them and then clicking on the record button.\nIf other fluorescent dextrans, i.e., 10 kDa dextran-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), or proteins, i.e., VEGFA165, have been prepared in advance, inject them after the start of image acquisition for a t = 0 min start.\n\t\nRemove the syringe with PBS in the tail vein catheter and replace with the syringe containing 10 kDa dextran-FITC or VEGFA165 taking care not to introduce any bubbles into the line.\nSlowly inject injectables into the mouse through the tail vein catheter and replace the syringe with a syringe containing PBS.\nEvery 30-45 min, slowly inject 50 µl of PBS or saline to maintain hydration of the animal.\n8. Euthanasia\nAt the termination of image acquisition, euthanize the animal.\n\t\nIncrease the isoflurane to 5%.\nKeep the animal under 5% isoflurane until 30 sec after it ceases to breathe and remove the animal from the stage.\nPerform cervical dislocation to ensure complete euthanasia.\n9. Image Processing\nAcquire images at 16-bit TIFF files for each individual channel at each time point and save sequentially.\nPerform separation of spectral overlap (i.e., GFP and CFP), elimination of x-y drift and the generation of movies from time-lapse sequences using established methods in ImageJ9. Perform 3D surface reconstructions of high-resolution images13.",
