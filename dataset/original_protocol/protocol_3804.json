    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPostnatal electroporation\nTiming: 1–3 h\nAnimal Preparation, Glass Pipette Loading, and Plasmid Injection\nPrepare a mix of ice and water for animal anesthesia by hypothermia.\nInstall a glass pipette filled with mineral oil on an injector arm. Cut the tip of the pipette, and lower the metal plunger of the injector to expel some oil from the pipette.\nLower the tip of the pipette into a 1-μL drop of DNA solution, and pull the metal plunger upward to draw the solution into the pipette.\nSet the voltage of the electroporation generator for 5 square pulses, 50 ms/pulse at 100 volts, with 950 ms intervals.\nPlace one postnatal day 0–1 pup (P0-P1) on ice for anesthesia.\nAfter approximately 5 min, determine the state of anesthesia using the foot pinch response. If no movement occurs, proceed with an intraventricular injection of plasmids.\nPlace the pup in the stereotaxic apparatus, making sure that the head is straight (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/723-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Electroporation procedure\n(A) Anesthetized animal placed on stereotaxic setup. Note that the head is properly fixed and straight.\n(B) Photograph illustrating the pup following electroporation. The site of injection is visualized with Fast Green dye.\nSterilize the head with ethanol and chlorhexidine using cotton swabs.\nOpen the skin with the scissors by approximately 2 mm along the sagittal line of the skull starting from the lambda.\nLower the pipette to the level of the lambda and zero all coordinates. Lift the pipette and move it along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis in an anterior direction by 1.8 mm.\nReadjust the medio-lateral (ML) coordinate by zeroing on the sagittal suture and move 0.8 mm laterally (hemisphere of choice).\nTouch the skull and zero dorso-ventral (DV) coordinates.\nLower the pipette slowly into the brain by 1.6 mm.",
    "Inject the DNA solution.\nPlace electrodes coated with conductive gel on the surface of the bones with the positive side on the lateral side of the hemisphere where the DNA was injected.\nInitiate current transfer by pressing the pulse footswitch pedal.\nCritical: Current transfer should be initiated as fast as possible after DNA injection.\nNote: For better area covering, sweep the electrodes from the dorsal to the lateral side at ∼25° angle intervals. For more details and how to target different NSC pools see also (Fernandez et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). For detailed video protocols of the electroporation procedure see publications by Feliciano et al. and Sonego et al. (Feliciano et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Sonego et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nClose the wound with forceps and apply Vetbond surgical glue.\nCritical: If Fast Green was used, the lateral ventricle should be visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). If the dye is not visualized or present in the 3rd ventricle the SVZ cells will not be labeled.\nPlace the electroporated pup on a heating pad for recovery.\nReunite the pup with the mother.\nElectroporation efficiency checking\nTiming: 24 h\nFollowing electroporation and before implanting the GRIN lens cannula, we recommend checking electroporation efficiency by sacrificing 1–2 pups from the electroporated litter. To study adult NSCs, we use P60-P90 mice as only slowly dividing cells such as NSCs or non-dividing cells such as niche astrocytes retain the label at this age. A comparison of the number of cells in the SVZ at post-electroporation days 10 and 60 is presented in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A. The adult NSCs co-expressing GFP and mCherry proteins driven by two different promoters are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/723-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. NSCs labeling in the adult SVZ",
    "(A) Sagittal sections of P10 and P60 mouse brains that had been electroporated at P0-P1 with CMV-GFP plasmid. Note reduction in the number of electroporated cells at P60 because of plasmid dilution. LV, hipp. and str. indicate, respectively, lateral ventricle, hippocampus and striatum.\n(B) Images of adult NSCs co-labeled with CMV-GFP and P2-mCherry plasmids.\nPerfuse the animals to collect their brains.\nDeeply anesthetize the animals using sodium pentobarbital (12 mg/mL; 0.1 mL per 10 g of body weight).\nPerfuse the animals intracardially with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nCollect the brains and post-fix them from 12 to 16 h at 4°C in 4% PFA.\nCut sagittal sections of the brains using a vibratome.\nCheck for fluorescently labeled NSCs in the SVZ.\nNote: Verifying the amount and location of fluorescently labeled NSCs in the SVZ is useful for adjusting the implantation coordinates along the dorso-ventral and/or media-lateral coordinates, depending on the location of electroporated cells in the SVZ (see also troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nMini-endoscope installation and fixation\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThe following section describes the installation of the mini-endoscope on 2- to 3-month-old animals electroporated at P0-P1.\nPerform isoflurane anesthesia (2%–3% isoflurane, oxygen flow at 1) by placing the animal in an induction chamber.\nWhen the animal is anesthetized, shave the hair on the head and inject a local anesthetic and a non-inflammatory drug subcutaneously.\nPlace the animal on the stereotaxic setup under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5%–2% isoflurane, oxygen flow at 1) and remove any remaining hair on the head using depilatory cream. Disinfect the surgical site.",
    "Cut the skin on top of the head from between the ears to the anterior region of the eyes. On each side of the initial cut, also cut out a small piece of skin in the region that will be surrounding the cannula once it is put in place. Use four small clamps to pull aside the skin in front and in back of the cut to expose as much skull as possible (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/723-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The GRIN is lowered along the z axis to approach it to the surface of the brain.\n(E) Photograph illustrating the end of the descent of the GRIN lens into the brain. Note the small space between the protrusion ring and the skull of the animal.\n(F) Application of gel glue with a needle to fill the space between the skull and the protrusion ring.\n(G) Photograph illustrating the sealing of the cannula to the animal’s head using dental cement and after snapping off the imaging camera. Note that dental cement was applied all around the GRIN lens implant.\n(H) Photograph showing a mouse with the implant, 4 weeks post-implantation.",
    "Prepare a glass pipette (the same type as that used for performing the electroporation) and install it on an injector arm. Cut the tip of the pipette to get an approximately 50–75-μm diameter tip.\nAfter zeroing the coordinates at the bregma, move to the targeted coordinates for implantation. Drill a hole at this coordinate using a medium tip burr (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The diameter of the drilled hole should be about two times larger than the diameter of the GRIN lens to allow for adjusting the coordinates during implantation and to prevent the GRIN lens from touching the sides of the hole. Avoid making the hole too large as this may result in too much pressure being put on the brain tissue when the GRIN lens is inserted.\nLower the glass pipette progressively into the brain tissue to prevent bleeding. The path created by the pipette will be used as a “track” in the brain to facilitate the insertion of the GRIN lens.\nNote: Lower the pipette into the hole multiple times without going as deep as the targeted coordinates. For instance, if your targeted z depth is 3 mm, do not lower the pipette any further than 2.5–2.6 mm into the brain.\nClean the surface of the brain well using sterile saline solution and presoaked hemostatic sponges.\nCritical: It is important that there is no bleeding on the surface of the brain before starting the insertion of the GRIN lens since it can alter imaging quality.\nRemove the injector from the stereotaxic frame and install the fluorescence microscope holder to which the camera is attached.\nCarefully fix the GRIN lens cannula with the protrusion ring onto the microscope.",
    "Note: To equilibrate the weight of the microscope on the head of the mouse, it is important to place the microscope in such a way that the back of the camera is positioned backwards on the animal’s head. The camera may also be slightly oriented toward the center if GRIN lens cannula is implanted in a lateral region.\nTurn on the microscope driver and launch the imaging software (Doric Neuroscience Studio).\nSet microscope exposure time, gain, and LED efficiency to be able to visualize background fluorescence.\nStart live imaging with the imaging software and make sure that the excitation light correctly exits the GRIN lens.\nNote: It is possible to use GRIN lenses several times (see implant removal steps). If a GRIN lens that has already been used is to be installed, it is important to make sure that the light spot coming out of the GRIN lens is circular (this can be done using a small piece of white paper) and that there is no major background on the image. If there is major background, carefully clean the tip and sides of the GRIN with water and soap and then with 70% ethanol using a piece of Kimtech tissue.\nLower the GRIN lens to the bregma and zero coordinates (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: The excitation light makes it easier to perform this step as the diameter of the blue circle decreases as the GRIN lens is lowered close to the surface of the skull. Center the excitation light spot on the bregma and set the XY coordinates to 0. If a 45º prism-coupled GRIN lens is used, center the bregma at the midline of the prism.",
    "Position the GRIN lens above the hole previously drilled in the skull at the targeted XY coordinates and lower along the z axis to approach it to the surface of the brain (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Set the z coordinates to 0.\nDraw an ROI on the acquired image using the imaging software.\nNote: Drawing an ROI makes it possible to assess changes in fluorescence intensity on the graph of fluorescence intensity in the Doric Neuroscience Studio software during the implantation of the GRIN lens.\nImplant the GRIN lens in the brain\nLower the GRIN lens into the brain using a relatively fast first push of approximately 100–200 μm to break into the tissue. Wait approximately 3–5 min for the brain to stabilize.\nNote: You should be able to clearly visualize the moment at which the GRIN lens enters the brain on the resulting fluorescence graph by changes in background fluorescence that then stabilizes as the tissue surrounding the implant stabilizes.\nContinue lowering the GRIN lens along the z axis in 50–100-μm increments. Wait approximately 30 s to 1 min between each increment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).",
    "Critical: Track any significant change in background fluorescence levels when lowering the GRIN lens into the brain. If the fluorescence intensity decreases while lowering the GRIN lens, this indicates that the brain tissue is being pushed too much, which results in tissue squeezing. If this happens, we recommend decreasing the speed of insertion or increasing the pause between each increment. Alternatively, completely remove the GRIN lens and begin lowering it into the brain again. If regular small increases in fluorescence intensity occur at every increment, this may either indicate that the surface of GRIN is getting dirty or that some bleeding is occurring. In this case, we recommend removing the GRIN lens from the brain, cleaning it with 70% ethanol, and lowering it into the brain again.\nAs the GRIN lens gets closer to the targeted z depth, slow down the insertion and check for any change/increase in background fluorescence intensity on the fluorescence graph. An increase may be a sign that the region containing NSCs has been reached. Since NSCs are a rare population of cells and are sparsely labeled, it is possible that only a small increase in background fluorescence will be observed or that some cell “shadows” may appear in the field of view without causing any increase in overall background fluorescence. When using a prism-coupled GRIN lens, fluorescently labeled cells can already be seen in the field of view during installation, which is a great advantage when working with a rare population of cells such as NSCs.",
    "Critical: Regularly check the remaining distance between the skull and the protrusion ring. When the ring starts to touch the skull, stop lowering the implant. On the other hand, if the target z depth is reached and the distance between the spacer and the skull is still too large (1 mm approximately), this will make it more difficult to fill the gap with glue and dental cement, and may lead to instability during long-term imaging. If the distance is too large, we recommend removing the GRIN lens from the brain, changing the protrusion ring for a thicker ring, and restarting the implantation using the previously described steps (steps 15 to 21).\nOptional: If after lowering the GRIN lens no significant change in background fluorescence is visible, the GRIN lens may be removed from the brain. It can be cleaned and re-installed at slightly adjusted XY coordinates. This operation, however, should not be repeated more than 2–3 times.\nFix the implanted GRIN lens cannula on the animal’s skull (see also troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E–3G, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nFill the space between the skull and the protrusion ring using a needle and gel glue, being careful not to touch the camera and the place where the baseplate is attached to the camera. Concentrate on filling the parts where there is the most space, especially if GRIN lens cannula is installed at lateral coordinates (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nWhile the glue is drying, prepare the Metabond dental cement that will be used for the first layer. We recommend mixing 2 spoons of cement powder with 4 drops of solvent and 1 drop of catalyst, according to the manufacturer instructions.",
    "Apply the first layer of cement with a disposable brush, being careful not to put dental cement on the camera or where the baseplate is attached to the camera (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nPrepare cement for a second layer by mixing two spoons of cement powder with 2–3 drops of solvent and 1 drop of catalyst, and clean the brush with ethanol if you wish to reuse it.\nWhen the second layer of cement is dry, carefully remove the camera from the GRIN lens cannula (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nApply a third layer of cement, mixing half as much of every ingredient in order to fill any remaining empty spaces between the protrusion ring and the skull.\nNotes:\nWe recommend that the cement used for the first layer be more liquid than the cement used for the second and third layers.\nTo make sure that no drift in the implant position occurs when sealing with the glue and cement, we recommend taking snapshots of the imaged field of view while the glue and cement are being applied.\nWhen the cement is completely dry, remove the four clamps holding the skin, place the skin back on top of the skull covered with dental cement. Since small pieces of skin on each side of the initial cut were removed, the skin should now surround the GRIN lens cannula baseplate.\nCritical: Before putting the skin back in place, check for any cement on the skin and ensure that the edges of the cement are rounded and adhere well to the skull. Sharp edges, especially near the eyes, may be harmful for the animal and cause excessive scratching. If such sharp edges are present, cut them with a small pair of scissors.\nSew the skin back together in front of and behind the implant.",
    "Critical: Caution should be taken when sewing the skin back close to the animal’s eyes. Too much tension in the skin may cause some discomfort to the animal and cause it to scratch and possibly hurt itself.\nNote: We recommend cutting the nails of the implanted animals once a week to prevent any scratching-related injuries.\nPause Point: Post-surgery, mini-endoscopic imaging can usually start 10–14 days after the insertion of the side-view GRIN lens and 3–4 weeks after the implantation of the flat GRIN lens (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Mini-endoscope fixation on the animal head, related to (step 22)\nStep 22a of cannula fixation consists in filling free space between animal skull and protrusion ring with glue gel. Application is performed using a bended needle and on the parts where this space is visible. Following glue application and drying, dental cement is applied with a disposable brush, all around the implant (Step 22c). Finally, the microscope is detached from the fixed cannula (Step 22e).\nIn vivo imaging of adult NSC activation and physiology\nTiming: 3–5 h (Ca2+ imaging) to 2–3 days (NSC division imaging)\nFollowing the recovery of the animal and the stabilization of the tissue, in vivo imaging of adult NSCs can be performed. We recommend habituating the mice to mini-endoscopic imaging by progressively increasing the time of consecutive imaging sessions from 1–2 h to 24–48 h (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/723-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Imaging NSC activation in vivo in freely behaving animals\n(A) Schematic of the electroporation of a CMV-GFP plasmid in the lateral ventricle of P0-P1 pups that were then implanted with a side-view GRIN lens at P45-P60. Mini-endoscopic imaging started 2-4 weeks post-installation.",
    "(B) Snapshot images illustrating the division of an NSC (white arrow) labeled with the CMV-GFP plasmid. In this particular example, cell division started at 6:15 h, which corresponded to the first time-frame preceding the reduction in fluorescence intensity. The cell division ended at 8:15 h when two daughter cells were clearly distinguishable. For other examples of snapshot images and videos of NSC division see (Gengatharan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nCarefully clean the lens of the camera as well as the top and sides of the implanted cannula with 70% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol using a cotton swab.\nNote: It is important, especially when cleaning the microscope, to use a swab that is not too wet to prevent any liquid from penetrating below the lens.\nDry the camera lens and the top of the cannula well using compressed air to remove residual dust or humidity.\nSnap the mini-endoscope camera into the cannula baseplate using forceps to separate the lateral brackets.\nNote: To reduce as much as possible the pressure applied on animal’s head and skull due to consecutive attachments of the microscope body with the cannula during the 2–3-month period, we recommend positioning the animal with the top of the head facing down while attaching the microscope on its baseplate.\nTransfer the animal to the imaging chamber.\nConnect the wires (camera cable and optic fiber) to the mini-endoscope driver.\nLaunch Doric Studio imaging software.\nSet the acquisition parameters (exposure time, gain, and LED efficiency) for one or both channels, depending on the microscope used (i.e., one- or two-color mini-microscope).\nLaunch live imaging to check for fluorescent labeling in the field of view and adapt the acquisition parameters, if needed (see also troubleshooting 3 and 5).\nIf the labeling is satisfactory, launch acquisition.\nNotes:",
    "For one-color imaging of GFP or GCaMP6, we used 458/35 and 525/40 excitation and emission filters, respectively. For two-color mini-endoscopic imaging, we used LED and YAG illumination sources with 430–477 nm and 558–564 nm excitation filters for GCaMP6s (or GFP) and mCherry imaging, respectively, and 520/35 and 615/45 emission filters.\nTo image NSC division, we acquired images at a frame rate of 5–10 images (which were averaged offline to obtain a single image) every 15 min continuously for 2–3 days. An example of NSC division is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nTo perform Ca2+ imaging of adult NSCs, 5–10 images, which were averaged offline to obtain a single image, were acquired every 30 s for 2–3 h.\nOptional: During adult NSC imaging, animal activity in the arena can also be monitored. In addition, some naturalistic behaviors such as food and water intakes can be evaluated by the addition of photobeams at the food and water ports of the cage. To do so, we used custom-made, 30 cm × 24 cm cages with water and food ports equipped with photobeams as shown in our previous publication (Gengatharan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) or a slightly modified version where food port is placed in middle right part of the cage (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nAt the end of the acquisition period, stop the imaging software, unplug the cables from the driver, and remove the animal from the arena.\nDisconnect the camera from the GRIN lens cannula and put the animal back in its housing cage.",
    "Note: Like when the microscope body is fixed to the animal’s head, we recommend holding the mouse in the hand upside-down (the top of the head facing down). Lateral brackets on the sides of the microscope body can be rapidly detached from the baseplate using forceps, which quickly unplug the microscope body from the baseplate. This minimizes the impact of microscope manipulation on the animal’s head.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. In vivo mini-endoscopic imaging in freely behaving mice, related to (step 33)\nThe mice implanted with a mini-endoscope were placed in custom-made behavioral cages on a 12-h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature (22°C) with food and water ad libitum. NSC imaging was performed for 2–3 days. The food and water ports were equipped with photobeams to calculate water and food consumption.\nGRIN lens cannula removal\nTiming: 30min – 1h\nThe following section describes the steps to remove the GRIN lens and to clean it at the end of an experiment (see also Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nPerform isoflurane anesthesia (2%–3% isoflurane, oxygen flow at 1) by placing the animal in an induction chamber.\nWhen anesthetized, place the animal on the stereotaxic setup under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5%–2% isoflurane, oxygen flow at 1).\nFix the dummy version of the microscope on the fluorescence microscope holder and install it on the stereotaxic frame.\nSnap the microscope to the GRIN lens baseplate by lowering it down the z-axis arm.\nCarefully drill the dental cement surrounding the baseplate using a medium tip burr.\nNote: This step will produce a large amount of dental cement dust. We recommend that this dust be regularly removed using compressed air to maintain good visibility around the implant.",
    "Continue drilling around the implant until no residual resistance is experienced when the fluorescence microscope holder is pulled up using the z-axis arm and the baseplate is no longer attached to the animal’s skull.\nCritical: Proper and complete drilling is required to remove the GRIN lens from the animal’s head to avoid damaging the brain, especially if fluorescent labelling or correct GRIN lens location needs to be evaluated.\nTo perform post-mortem analysis of implanted brain tissues once the implant is removed, stop the isoflurane anesthesia and perfuse the animal to collect the brains as per steps 2 to 4 above.\nTo reuse a GRIN lens for another experiment, carefully clean it as follows:\nUse a small blade to remove the spot of glue used during the GRIN lens cannula preparation steps to adhere the protrusion ring to the implant baseplate\nUnscrew the protrusion ring from the implant baseplate.\nNote: The protrusion ring can occasionally be difficult to unscrew, especially after being fixed in place on the animal’s skull for several months. Soaking the implant, when it is still attached to the ring, in a mixture of water and soap for approximately 12h may facilitate this step by dissolving residues that have built up between the parts.\nSoak the implant for approximately 12 h in a mixture of distilled water and soap.\nCarefully and thoroughly clean the implant using a cotton swab or a piece of Kimtech paper and 70% ethanol.\nNote: The quality of the implant cleaning is of particular importance if you plan to use the GRIN lens for another experiment. The last two steps for cleaning the GRIN lens can be performed several times if some deposits or background are visible on the image before the lens is implanted in the brain.",
    "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Mini-endoscope removal, related to (steps 36–41)\nFor removal of the GRIN lens cannula, start drilling the cement surrounding the protrusion ring using a medium tip burr. The drilling of the cement should be performed all around the protrusion ring until no resistance is experienced when the fluorescence microscope holder is pulled up using the z-axis arm of the stereotaxic device."
