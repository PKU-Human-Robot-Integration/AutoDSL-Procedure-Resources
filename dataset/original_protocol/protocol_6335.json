  "procedures": [
    "Note: As Chlamydia trachomatis is a BSL2 pathogen, all steps must be carried out in a biosafety cabinet (BSC). Ensure all solutions are sterile prior to beginning the purification. Seeding and preparing HeLa CellsSeed 8 T175 flasks with early passage HeLa cells (< P10) at a cell concentration sufficient to reach confluency in 1-2 days.Note: We have propagated C.t. in immortalized primary epithelial cells of several lineages (vaginal, cervical, conjunctival, foreskin), but have not carried out large scale purifications from these cells lines, primarily due to the exorbitant cost of the reagents needed to propagate these cells. Theoretically, the purifications would proceed identical to what we describe in this protocol with the only changes being the media for each respective cell type. Decant the media from 8 T175 flasks of confluent HeLa cells.Gently wash the cells using 5 ml of 1x Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) per flask. Ensure most of the wash is removed using a 5 ml serological pipette.Add 5 ml Trypsin to each flask, gently swirl to ensure it covers the entire bottom of the flask, and incubate cells at 37 °C for 5-10 min or until cells detach.Add 5 ml RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS to each flask. Combine cells from 8 flasks into 1 flask.Prepare 20 new T175 flasks by adding 30 ml RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS.Add 4 ml diluted cell mixture (Step A4) to each new flask. Seed enough cells to obtain confluency (1 x 107/flask).Incubate cells at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 for 24 h or until HeLa monolayers are confluent.Infection (20 Flask Batch)Remove aliquot of Chlamydia trachomatis L2 from -80 °C freezer and let thaw at room temperature. Prepare Chlamydia trachomatis inoculum in 5 ml RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide using a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) 2.",
    "5 assuming 2 x 107 cells/flask at confluency. Use 100 ml total for 20 flasks.Note: For mutants with a lysis or toxic phenotype, reduce MOI to 0.5. Include any relevant antibiotic for mutant selection in the RPMI 1640. Decant the media from each flask.Add 5 ml of inoculum from Step B1 to each flask and incubate at 37 °C with slow shaking or rocking for 30 min-1 h.Add 25 ml RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide to each flask.Note: Cycloheximide prevents host cell synthesis to facilitate bacterial replication Incubate for 36-48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.PurificationDecant the media from each of the 20 flasks.Add 8 ml ice-cold 1x K36 (Recipe 2) to each of the 20 flasks.Scrape each flask using a large cell scraper. Rinse the back of each flask with the 1x K36-cell mix and transfer cell suspension from 10 flasks to a 250 ml centrifuge bottle on ice. Repeat for the next 10 flasks with another 250 ml centrifuge bottle.Note: The cell suspension from 10 flasks should be added to each of two 250 ml centrifuge bottles. Splitting the 20 flasks of cell suspension into two 250 ml centrifuge bottles will provide adequate space for mixing and a balance for all centrifugation steps moving forward. A total of four 250 ml centrifuge bottles will be needed for the entire purification. Two 250 ml centrifuge bottles will be used through Step C6 and two will be used starting on Step C7. Rinse the back of the T175 flask with 5 ml K36, transfer to another T175 flask. Continue to rinse and transfer for 5 flasks in total. After washing the 5th flask, add the cell suspension to the 250 ml centrifuge bottle on ice. Discard the first 5 T175 flasks.",
    "Repeat procedure with remaining flasks.Sonicate at 60-100 watts for 20 s, immediately return centrifuge bottle to ice. Repeat sonication step for two sonication cycles total per 250 ml centrifuge bottleNote: An N-95 mask should be worn during the sonication and sonication should be conducted in the BSC. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer each supernatant to a new pre-chilled 250 ml centrifuge bottle on ice.Resuspend each pellet in 100 ml ice-cold 1x K36.Sonicate at 60-100 watts for 20 s, immediately return centrifuge bottle to ice. Repeat sonication step for two cycles in total per 250 ml centrifuge bottle.Centrifuge at 500 x g 10 min at 4 °C.Add supernatant to the pre-chilled 250 ml centrifuge bottles from Step C7.Centrifuge at 30,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant from each 250 ml centrifuge bottle (there are 2) and resuspend each pellet with 30 ml 1x K36. Disperse using an 18 ga cannula on a 10 ml syringe. Solution should be slowly dispersed to prevent frothing and should be passed 3-5 times or until the solution is homogenous.Add 8 ml of 30% Gastrografin (Recipe 4) to a thick-walled polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube.Note: Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solutions allow for optimal density gradient isolation of chlamydial elementary bodies with minimal host debris and negligible loss of bacteria or toxicity. They are normally used as contrasting agents in radiography due to the iodine content. Gently layer the suspension from Step C13 over the Gastrografin. Top the tubes with 1x K36.Centrifuge at 40,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Decant supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1x K36 using 1 ml per T175 flask (10 ml per pellet for a 20-flask prep).",
    "Note: To prepare 30% seed stock instead of doing the full purification, resuspend pellet in SPG (Recipe 3). Transfer to an oak ridge tube, and centrifuge at 30,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Resuspend pellet in 5 ml ice-cold SPG, aliquot and store at -80 °C. Prepare Gastrografin density gradient by very slowly layering the following in order into a thick-walled polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube: 8 ml 54%, 12 ml 44%, and 5 ml 40% Gastrografin.Gently add the suspension from Step C17 to the gradient and top with K36.Centrifuge at 40,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C.Collect the white elementary body band between the two lower layers (54% and 44%) using a cannula and transfer it to a pre-chilled oak ridge tube on ice (Figure 2A).Add approximately 10 volumes of ice-cold SPG.Centrifuge at 30,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Resuspend pellet in 1 ml/flask of SPG. Use a cannula to disperse if necessary. Aliquot (50-100 μl) into sterile O-ring tubes using a P200 pipette and store at -80 °C.Test sterility by inoculating a blood agar plate, yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) agar plate, and RPMI 1640 media with 10 μl of purified EBs.TitersSeeding HeLa Cells for titer platesDecant the media from T175 flask of confluent HeLa cells.Gently wash the cells using 5 ml of 1x PBS per flask. Ensure most of the wash is removed using a serological pipette.Add 5 ml Trypsin to each flask, gently swirl to distribute along the back of the flask, and incubate cells at 37 °C for 5-10 min or until cells detach.Add 5 ml RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS to flask.Add 1 ml of cells to 20 ml of RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS.Add 1 ml of diluted cell mixture to each well of a 24-well plate.",
    "Cells should be seeded to obtain 1 x 105 per well.Incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. The cells should be confluent.Infect cellsThaw an aliquot of purified EBs.Add 30 μl EBs to 270 μl 1x Hanks buffered saline solution (HBSS). Vortex to mix.Serially dilute 1:10 in 1x HBSS.Remove media from the 24-well plate using a serological pipette.Add 200 μl of each dilution in triplicate to 3 wells of the 24-well plate.Add 1 ml RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for ~24 h.Note: For wild-type C. trachomatis L2 prepared using this protocol we obtain a titer of ~109/ml. Thus, we plate the 104, 105, and 106 dilutions. Depending on the efficiency of the purifications the plating dilutions may need to be lower or higher. Determine titerRemove media from the 24-well plate using a serological pipette.Wash each well with 0.5 ml 1x PBS twice.Add 0.5 ml methanol to each well and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Remove methanol and discard in methanol waste container.Wash each well with 0.5 ml 1x PBS twice.Add 0.25 ml of anti-LPS diluted 1:1,000 in 1x PBS. Incubate on a shaker at 70 rpm for ~1 h at room temperature.Wash each well with 0.5 ml 1x PBS three times.Add 0.25 ml of anti-mouse 488 diluted 1:1,000 in 1x PBS. Incubate on a shaker at 70 rpm for ~1 h at room temperature.Wash each well with 0.5 ml 1x PBS three times.Leave 0.5 ml 1x PBS in each well after the final wash.Note: Plate can be stored at 4 °C till counts are complete. Count 10 fields of view per well using 20x object on fluorescent microscope (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191215/20191215222917_7847.jpgFigure 2.
