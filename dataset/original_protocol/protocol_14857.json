  "procedures": [
    "The procedures described below were performed as part of a protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health.\n1. Preparation for Surgery\nGas sterilize catheters and instruments.\n2. Prepare the Catheters\nFlush the catheters with heparinized glycerol (250 IU heparin/1 ml glycerol) to ensure patency and avoid leakage. Plug end of the catheter with a metal stopper (20 ga, 15 mm) to retain heparinized glycerol.\n3. Prepare Aseptic Workstation\nUse 70% alcohol to spray the workstation and instrument trays. Use a sterile drape to cover the operating table and instrument trays and place instruments on the tray.\n4. Prepare Rats for Surgery\nPlace rat individually in a Lucite chamber and expose to an anesthetic; isoflurane (3-5%) mixed with oxygen until unconscious. Remove rat from the chamber and shave fur from anterior and posterior areas of the neck. Apply lubricant ointment to eyes.\n5. Catheter Implantation\nPlace anesthetized rat (confirmed by toe pinch) onto a heated surgical table in the ventral position; place its nose into the nose cone to maintain anesthesia with spontaneous respirations (isoflurane; 3.5%). Gently scrub the surgical area 3 times alternating use of Betadine and 70% alcohol. Make a 0.5 cm midline skin incision between the scapulae using a surgical scissor.\nReposition rat in the dorsal position; gently restrain the legs to each side of the table using rubber bands; maintain anesthesia. Place two rolled sterile 4x4 gauze under neck to slightly hyperextend for better exposure. Make a 2 cm ventral cervical skin incision right of the midline of the neck at the level of the clavicle using a scalpel.\n6. Right Jugular Vein Catheterization",
    "Using a hemostat, bluntly dissect the right jugular vein, separate out the salivary and lymphatic tissues to visualize and isolate a 5 mm section of the vessel. Using 4-0 silk suture, place a loose tie on both cranial and caudal ends of the vessel to maximize the exposure of the vessel. Using a micro surgical scissor make an incision large enough to pass the catheter, in line with the vessel between the two ligatures and tie the cranial ligature around the vessel.\nInsert the venous catheter into the vessel towards the heart with the assistance of the micro dissecting hook and forceps and advance the catheter until all of the PU 3F segment is in the vessel. Use the ligatures at the cranial and caudal ends to secure the catheter to the vessel.\n7. Left Carotid Artery Catheterization\nUsing a hemostat, bluntly dissect the omohyoid muscle longitudinally to expose the left carotid artery and isolate a 5mm section of the vessel. Ensure the vagus nerve (white in color) is completely separated from the artery. Take care not to shred or break the nerve.\nUsing 4-0 silk suture, place a loose tie on the caudal end of the vessel, tie off the cranial end of the vessel and place a bulldog clamp caudally above the suture to stop the blood flow following the incision. Using a micro surgical scissor, make an incision, large enough to pass the catheter, in line with the vessel between the two ligatures. Insert the arterial catheter towards the heart with the assistance of the micro dissecting hook and forceps.",
    "Use a smooth needle holder without lock to hold the portion of the catheter inside the vessel tight before removing the bulldog clamp. Advance the catheter with a pair of forceps while loosening needle holder slowly until the entire PU 2F segment of catheter is in the vessel. Tie the loose caudal ligature around the catheter and vessel to secure, but not so tight as to occlude, the catheter.\n8. Using a Straight Hemostat, Tunnel a 5 cm Tube back Subcutaneously behind the Ear and through the Incision between the Scapulae. Exteriorize the Catheters through the Tube and Remove the Tube.\n9. Close the Ventral Incision with Three Stainless Steel Wound Clips, and the Dorsal Incision with 4-0 Silk Sutures to Secure the Exteriorized Catheters in Place.\n10. Post-surgical Monitor and Care\nFollowing catheterization, terminate the anesthesia and recover the rat in lateral decubitus position in a cage with cellulose bedding. Observe the rats at 2 hr intervals for at least 4 hr or until showing no signs of pain and then once daily. Give Ketoprofen [5 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection (SQ)] immediately post procedure and every 12 hr if the rat shows signs of pain or distress. In our experience, no rats have required additional analgesia for pain following the initial injection. Characteristics observed that would elicit consideration for additional doses of analgesia include but not limited to; abnormal posture; increase/decrease in respiratory rate, unthrifty/ungroomed, infection/inflammation of the incision site, eye discharge, piloerection (“spiked haircoat”), reduction in activity in response to audible or tactile stimuli.\n\tNOTE: Rats recovered for 72 hr that gain >10 g from pre-catheterization weight will be enrolled in the study.\n11. Connection to Hemodynamic System",
    "Following recovery, enroll healthy rats (weight gain > 10g) in the study. Place rats in Lucite chamber and anesthetize as previously described.\nPlace sterile drape on surgical table with sterile hemostat, micro forceps, 1 ml syringes with blunt needle attached.\n\tNOTE: The tips of the hemostat should be covered with rubber to avoid damage to the catheter. Place anesthetized rat on a surgical table in the ventral position and place nose into the nose cone to maintain anesthesia (3-5%) with spontaneous respirations.\nClamp arterial and venous catheters using a pair of rubber capped hemostats just below the metal plug pins. Use a pair of forceps to remove the metal pin at the end of the catheter and attach a 1 ml syringe filled with heparin saline with a blunt needle attached. In turn, remove the hemostats and withdraw 0.1 ml to ensure the catheters are patent.\nRe-clamp the catheters, remove the needle and attach this end to a longer catheter (pre-flushed with heparin saline) that’s connected to a swivel and tethered on top of the shoebox cage. Connect these catheters to the transducers for data acquisition and recording, sampling, or infusion.\n\tNOTE: All catheters are protected with coiled spring conduits long enough to allow an animal’s full range of motion in their cage.\nFollowing catheter connection, terminate anesthesia and recover the animals in the sternal position in a cage with cellulose bedding. To maintain arterial catheter patency, manually flush the lines with 0.05 ml heparin saline (50 IU/ml) every 1 hr for 24 hr which coincide with the regular assessments of the animals.\n12. Blood Sampling, Pressure Monitoring and Drug Administration",
    "Attach empty syringe to stopcock connected to arterial catheter and withdraw 0.6 ml inline flush. Attach sample syringe, take sample, and return the 0.6 ml inline flush followed by 0.7 ml heparinized saline flush.\nUse data acquisition hardware and software to measure and record MAP and heart rate continuously.\nConnect the automated drug delivery system (ADDS) to the venous catheter.\n\tNOTE: ADDS adjusts the rate of vasopressor infusion (high, low, or 0 dose) based on the MAP detected to maintained pressures within the normal physiologic range."
