    "All experiments on human tissue or blood samples must be approved by an ethics committee and conducted according to any guidelines given in the ethics vote.\n1. Cellular Enrichment\nLiquid tumors/Fluorescence-activated cell sorting.\n\t\nIsolate mononuclear cells from bone marrow or blood sample by performing erythrocyte lysis using ammonium chloride or by Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation.\n\t\t\nFor erythrocyte lysis, combine 1 ml of sample with 4 ml of ammonium chloride solution. Incubate the solution on ice for 5 - 10 min. Add 40 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) + 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) and centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g and 4 °C.\nFor Ficoll gradient centrifugation, layer 10 ml of sample on 15 ml of Ficoll-Hypaque to form 2 distinct layers (be careful not to disturb the layers). Centrifuge at 400 x g for 30 min at RT (15 - 25 °C) carefully and harvest the mononuclear cells that collect at the interphase.\nSpin down the cells and take them up in PBS + 2% FCS. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min and take up in 1 ml PBS + 2% FCS. Take one aliquot as negative control and one aliquot for each fluorescent dye used in the final stain.\nIncubate with fluorescence-labeled antibodies useful to isolate the leukemic cell population in dilution according to manufacturer’s instructions on ice for 30 min. Also stain the aliquots used for compensation with each antibody individually. Wash twice with PBS + 2% FCS.\n\t\tNOTE: The antibodies used were mouse anti-human against CD117-PE (Clone 95C3), CD34-FITC (Clone 8G12) and CD33-PE (Clone P67.6).\nFilter cells through 35 µm cell strainer, ideally using tubes with cell strainer integrated in cap.",
    "Add cell viability stain (e.g., 7-AAD). Sort cells using an appropriate cell sorter11 (Figure 2). Collect cells in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) containing 10% FCS.\nSolid tumors/Laser-capture microdissection.\n\t\nFor the described experiments, FFPE samples from lung cancer specimen were used. For this purpose lung cancer tissue was immediately fixed in 4% buffered formalin after surgical resection and pieces of about 3 x 2 x 1 cm where embedded in paraffin for further analysis.\nCut sections of 5 - 10 µm thickness from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sample with a microtome. Mount sections on film-covered membrane slides and dry at 37 °C for 1 hr. Deparaffinize and rehydrate the mounted sections by successive incubation in xylene, absolute ethanol, 70% and water, each for 1 min.\nStain the sections with hematoxylin for 20 sec and then rinse with tap water. Collect the cell population of interest by using a laser-capture microdissection system (also see 12).\n2. Protein Extraction\nLiquid tumors.\n\t\nCentrifuge the cell suspension from step 1.1.5 at 400 x g, 4 °C for 4 min and discard the supernatant. Wash twice with 500 µl of cold PBS and centrifugation for 5 min at 400 x g and 4 °C\nAdd 40 µl lysis buffer per 106 cells and incubate for 15 min on ice (105 cells (approx. 10 µg total protein) should be the minimum cell number). Centrifuge the lysate at 14,000 x g, 4° C for 10 min and transfer the supernatant (cleared cellular lysate) to a new reaction tube. Discard the pellet.\nSolid tumors.\n\t\nAdd 60 µl of tissue lysis buffer to the microdissected tissue and incubate for 15 min on ice, collect the fluid by short centrifugation and transfer the suspension to a new reaction tube. Sonicate the lysate on ice for 3 min.",
    "Add 15 µl of 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to a reach a final SDS concentration of 4%. Incubate the microdissected tissue at 99 °C in a heating block for 1 hr and agitated at 600 rpm. Centrifuge the lysate at 16,000 x g, 18 °C for 10 min and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\n3. Establishment of a SILAC Spike-in Quantification Standard (Super-SILAC Standard)\nNOTE: The quantification standard consists of a SILAC-labeled protein mixture derived from 4 - 6 cells lines that match the tumor type of interest. To achieve the maximum overlap between the SILAC-labeled reference proteome and the tumor-derived proteome, a principal component analysis needs to be performed before cell lines are selected for the quantification standard14.\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA).\n\t\nTo determine the protein expression patterns of cell lines, cultivate about ten different cell lines in appropriate cell culture media. Lyse the cells as described in step 2.1. Prepare cellular lysates for mass spectrometry as described in step 6.1.\nAnalyze the protein expression pattern of each cell line on a high-resolution, liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometer (nanoLC-MS/MS).\nAnalyze the resulting raw data using a free ware MaxQuant and perform a principal-component analysis using the associated software such as Perseus16,17.\nSelect 4 - 6 cell lines that show the greatest diversity between their protein-expression profiles and use them to generate the Super-SILAC spike-in standard.\nSILAC-labeling and label check.\n\t\nCultivate the selected cell lines for at least five cell cycles in appropriate SILAC cell culture medium, in which arginine and lysine are labeled with stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (SILAC medium)4.",
    "Lyse the cells as described in step 3.1 and prepare cellular lysates for mass spectrometry as described in step 6.1. Measure the incorporation efficiency of SILAC labeling by nanoLC-MS/MS. Analyze the resulting raw MS data with MaxQuant and determine the efficiency of SILAC-labeling. This is achieved by counting the numbers of peptides identified in their labeled (heavy) and their endogenous forms (light), and calculating the ratio (heavy)/(heavy+light). Labeling efficiency should exceed 98%.\nCombination of SILAC proteomes and validation.\n\t\nCultivate and expand selected cell lines according to manufactures instructions in appropriate SILAC medium. Lyse the cells as described in step 2.1 for liquid tumors or as described in step 3.2 for solid tumors and determine protein concentration for each cellular lysate.\nMix equimolar protein amounts of each cell line and divide the mixture into aliquot. Snap-freeze the aliquots and store at -80°C until measurement. For one experiment you need 20 - 50 µg of Super-SILAC standard. Take care to prepare the standard in excess as changing the standard within a series of experiments should be avoided.\n4. Measurement of Protein Concentration and Spike-in\nLiquid tumors.\n\t\nUsing protein quantitation assay determine the protein concentrations of the respective cellular lysates and the Super-SILAC standard.\nMix equal amounts of cleared cellular lysate and the Super-SILAC standard and subsequently add lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) buffer (25% of the sample volume) and reducing agent (10% of the sample volume).\nHeat the resulting solution in a heating block at 72 °C for 10 min. Optionally, store the resulting denatured proteins at -80°C.\nSolid tumors.",
    "For protein concentration measurement on a plate reader, mix a standard bovine serum albumin (BSA) dilution solution series, the lysate and the appropriate Super-SILAC standard with an commercially available protein assay in a 96-well plate, and shake for 1 min, incubate for indicated time and measure absorbance as indicated by the manufacturer.\n\t\tNOTE: The high concentration of SDS and dithiothreitol (DTT) in the lysate is a problem for most available assays for protein concentration determination.\nMix equal amounts of clarified lysate and the Super-SILAC standard with 200 μl of urea in the filter unit and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 30 min at 20 °C. Do not use more than 50 µl of clarified lysate and the Super-SILAC standard. Avoid temperatures below 15 °C, so that urea does not crystallize out.\n5. Sample Separation and Protein Digest\nLiquid tumors.\n\t\nSeparate 30 - 100 µg total protein per lane on a 4 - 12% gradient SDS-PAGE Gel. Stain proteins with Coomassie Blue O/N. Remove excess Coomassie stain by two subsequent washes with water.\nCut each lane from the gel and divide it into 23 equal-sized slices irrespective of the pattern of gel staining. Process the gel slices separately, each in a in 0.6 ml polypropylene vial.\nWash the gel slices with water and methanol/water (50:50, v/v), reduce with 10 mM DTT by incubating for 30 min at 56 °C. Alkylate the gel slices with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) by incubating at 60 min at RT in dark.\nBetween sample-handling steps, wash slices with acetonitrile for 15 min and dry in a SpeedVac to remove excess solvent and improve uptake of reagent solution.",
    "Perform protease cleavage by rehydrating dried gel slices with the minimum amount of porcine trypsin solution (12.5 ng/µl in 0.025 M aqueous ammonium bicarbonate) for 16 hr at 37°C.\nAdd 10 µl water to gel slice and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Add 80 µl acetonitrile and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Centrifuge at 15,800 x g, for 1 min. Collect supernatant and store in a separate 0.6 ml tube.\nAdd 65 µl of 5% formic acid solution, vortex and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Add 65 µl acetonitrile and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Centrifuge at 15,800 x g for 1 min. Collect the supernatant and add it to the supernatant from the previous step. Evaporate the combined supernatant to dryness in a vacuum concentrator.\nSolid tumors.\n\t\nTo remove SDS from tissue lysate use the following FASP protocol, also described as in reference15.\nAfter the first centrifugation described in step 5.2.3 add a further 200 μl of 8 M urea on the filter, and further centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 20 °C. Discard the flow-through filtrate.\nAdd 100 μl IAA and mix in a thermomixer at 600 rpm for 1 min. Incubate the filter for 20 min at 20 °C in the dark. Centrifuge the filter at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 20 °C.\nAdd 100 μl of urea to the filter and centrifuge at 14,000 x g, for 15 min at 20 °C. Repeat this step one more time.\nAdd 100 μl of NH4HCO3 to the filter and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 20 °C. Repeat this step twice.",
    "Add 40 μl NH4HCO3 + 1 µl (= 0.4 µg) trypsin and mix in thermomixer at 20 °C for 600 rpm, 1 min. Incubate the filter O/N in a wet chamber at 37 °C. Transfer the filter to new collection tubes.\nCentrifuge the filter at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 20 °C. Add 50 μl of NH4HCO3 and centrifuge the filter at 14,000 g for 10 min at 20°C. Store the resulting peptides at -20°C until mass spectrometric measurement.\nFor peptide concentration measurement, dispense 50 µl of the resulting flow-through and a series of appropriate dilutions of neat tryptophan into a 96-well plate. Measure tryptophan fluorescence. Convert the resulting concentration of tryptophan to peptide concentration, as 0.1 μg of tryptophan corresponds to 9 μg protein.\n6. Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometric Analysis\nRedissolve peptides in 30 µl loading buffer for 5 min in a sonication bath. Spin down in a centrifuge at 15,800 x g for 1 min and pipette the clear solution into an MS autosampler vial.\nInject 5 µl of sample per analysis using the autosampler of the nanoLC-MS/MS system. Concentrate and desalt peptides online on a reversed phase C18 pre-column (0.15 mm ID x 20 mm with 5 µm pore size C18 material) mounted in either a vented column setup or a precolumn switching setup.\nSeparate peptides on a reversed phase C18 microcolumn (0.075 mm ID x 200 mm self-packed with 3 μm or smaller pore size C18 material in a self-pack nanospray column such as PicoFrit, using a 90 min gradient of 5>35% acetonitrile vs. 0.1% aqueous formic acid at 300 nl/min. Transfer eluent into a hybrid quadrupole/orbitrap mass spectrometer via a nanospray ion source.",
