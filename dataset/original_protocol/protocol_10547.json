    "1. Generating Elastomeric Stamps\nTo generate the PDMS stamp’s silicon masters, design the photomask’s feature patterns using computer-aided design software.\n\t\nDesign the first pattern as a 20 x 20 array of annuli with 300 μm inner diameter (ID) and 600 μm OD with 1,200 μm center-to-center spacing.\nDesign the second pattern as a 20 x 20 array of annuli with 600 μm ID and 900 μm OD with 1,200 μm center-to-center spacing.\nAdditionally, place 1 x 1 mm2 square reference marks at all four corners of each array design spaced 1,200 μm center-to-center from the corner pattern at a 45° angle.\nFabricate the silicon masters for use in this experiment with 1:1 aspect ratios, correlating to a 300 μm feature depth using standard lithography techniques detailed elsewhere15 or in collaboration with a microfluidic foundry.\n\t\tNOTE: Feature depths lower than 100 μm can lead to abnormal deformation of stamps prior to contact with substrate surfaces.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol begins with having already obtained silicon masters with the described patterns of photoresist, which requires specialized equipment and clean rooms to create. It is best to consult with a fabricator or core facility to create these patterned masters.\nSilanize silicon masters O/N by incubation with (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydroocty) trichlorosilane vapor.\n\tNOTE: Silane vapor is highly toxic and should only be handled in a chemical fume hood.\nCreate inverse replicas of the silicon masters by curing a 10:1 ratio of PDMS pre-polymer and PDMS curing agent on top of the silanized silicon masters in a petri dish O/N at 60 °C.\nRemove the PDMS stamps from the silicon masters, and bond the stamps to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) backings or any other rigid materials using glue.",
    "NOTE: The material of choice need not be transparent or biocompatible. However, it must provide a flat surface for interface with the robotic tooling and higher rigidity than PDMS.\n2. Preparing Coverslides\nRinse microscope coverslides (24 mm x 50 mm #1) in toluene, methanol and sonicate in acetone for 1 min before rinsing with ethanol and drying under a gentle nitrogen stream.\n\tNOTE: Handle toluene and acetone only in a chemical fume hood.\nCoat coverslides with ~3.5 nm titanium (Ti) followed by 18.0 nm gold (Au) using a focused electron-beam evaporator.\n\tNOTE: This procedure is compatible with a variety of gold-coated substrates including silicon and polystyrene. While it is possible to generate these on-site, gold-coated substrates are also available via commercial suppliers.\n\tNOTE: Ti layers should be at least 3 nm thick, while Au layers on substrates should be at least 5 nm thick and can range all the way to 1mm in thickness depending on the ideal optical properties of the final substrate16,17. Substrates are not required to be optically clear for fabrication; however, it facilitates microscopic analysis of fabricated substrates.\nRinse gold-coated coverslides with ethanol and dry under gentle nitrogen immediately before use.\n3. R-μCP of Outer Annulus\nBefore R-μCP with the selectively compliant articulated robot arm (SCARA) system, calibrate the robotic tool effectors and accompanying dual camera systems using the system’s software.\n\tNOTE: These implements are pictured in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52186/52186fig1highres.jpg\nFigure 1. R-μCP System and Robotic Arm Tooling.

    "Manually place a PDMS stamp with 600 μm ID and 900 μm OD protruding annuli face down in the stamp nesting fixture. Manually place a freshly cleaned gold-coated coverslide on top of the vacuum chuck, displayed in Figure 1A, and immobilize it using the connected lab vacuum.\nUsing the robot controls, align the downward facing camera over the center point of the gold-coated coverslide, as in Figure 2A.\n\tNOTE: This point can initially be defined by visual inspection and does not require great accuracy, as the PDMS stamp is much larger than the gold-coated slide.\nInstruct the robotic arm to etch four reference “X” marks at the vertices of a square with dimensions 3.8 mm by 3.8 mm centered on the gold-coated coverslide using the diamond-tipped etching tool attached to the robotic arm. (Depicted in Figure 2B; AUTOMATED PROCESS)\n\tNOTE: This ensures all four reference marks are within one visual frame of the downward facing camera.\nUsing the robots pneumatic suction tooling, pick-up and hold the PDMS stamp 1 mm above the stamp nesting fixture as in Figure 2C. (AUTOMATED PROCESS)\nUsing the upward facing camera and LED illumination ring pictured in Figure 2D and E, visualize the stamp’s square reference marks and identify them with the camera software 10 times in order to determine the stamp’s average X, Y, and angular offset from the center of the robot tooling axis. (AUTOMATED PROCESS)\nAs in Figure 2A, use the downward facing camera to visualize and detect the coverslide’s etched reference marks 10 times to determine the coverslide’s average X, Y center locations and angular offset from the center of the robot tooling axis. (AUTOMATED PROCESS).",
    "NOTE: An internal computation is performed by the robotic system’s software to precisely align the stamp’s and coverslip’s X, Y center locations and angular offsets in future R-μCP steps.\n3.8) Place the stamp in a bath of alkanethiol ATRP initiator, ω-mercaptoundecyl bromoisobutyrate (2 mM in ethanol) as depicted in Figure 2F. (AUTOMATED PROCESS)\nRemove the stamp from the alkanethiol solution and place it over nitrogen stream pressurized to 0.48 bar (5 psi) to evaporate the ethanol as in Figure 2G. After 1 min increase the nitrogen stream’s pressure is to 1.03 bar (15 psi) to ensure uniform dryness. (AUTOMATED PROCESS)\n\tNOTE: Incomplete drying will result in total or partial loss of pattern fidelity.\nAfter drying, move the stamp over the calculated center position of the gold-coated slide and lower it at 100 μm increments while monitoring Z-axis motor force as depicted in Figure 2H.\n\tNOTE: This is communicated as torque experienced by the Z-axis motor and displayed in the robot guidance software. (AUTOMATED PROCESS)\nStop lowering the stamp once the predetermined pressure of 79.2 kPa has been achieved, and maintain contact with the gold-coated slide for 15 sec. (AUTOMATED PROCESS)\n\tNOTE: The pressure values here are optimized for the current stamp design and feature height. If the stamp design is changed, specifically for high aspect ratio stamps, tune these accordingly by a trial and error process.\nSlowly remove the stamp from the gold-coated slide and place the stamp back in the stamp nesting fixture. (AUTOMATED PROCESS)\n4. SI-ATRP of PEGMEMA on Micropatterned Coverslides\nRelease vacuum pressure holding the micropatterned coverslide, and transfer it to a 50 ml Schlenk flask. Seal and degas the Schlenk flask using a vacuum pump.",
    "Add 5.5 ml of ATRP reaction mixture containing the macromonomer PEGMEMA (208.75 mmol), water (34.4 ml), methanol (43.8 ml), copper(II) bromide (1 mmol), and 2’,2-bipyridine (3 mmol) to the Schlenk flask.\nAdd 0.5 ml of L-sodium ascorbate (454.3 mM) in water to initiate the reaction, and allow it to continue for 16 hr at RT under inert gas.\n\tNOTE: Following addition of L-sodium ascorbate, reaction color will shift from light green to dark brown as shown in Figure 3A-B.\n\tNOTE: The reaction can continue beyond 16 hr, but it will not significantly increase the length of the PEG brushes.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52186/52186fig3highres.jpg\nFigure 3.

R-μCP of Inner Annulus and SI-ATRP of PEGMEMA\nCarry out R-μCP steps as previously described in Steps 3.2 and 3.6 – 3.12, substituting a PDMS stamp with 300 μm ID and 600 μm OD protruding annuli, such that the annuli with smaller features are placed inside the previously micropatterned annuli.\n\tNOTE: The pressure threshold for this stamp is 132.0 kPa. As previously mentioned, these pressure settings are optimized for the stamp features being used in this experiment.\nCarry out SI-ATRP steps as previously described in steps 4.1 – 4.4.\n8. Acetylene Functionalization of Micropatterned PEGMEMA Chains\nPlace micropatterned coverslide in a 20 ml glass reaction vial.\nAdd 6 ml of DMSO containing 100 mM propargylamine to the reaction vial.
