    "NOTE: This procedure is a modification of a chicken model culture protocol developed by Bauer et al. 2013 and Nakazawa et al., 2011. 2,9\n1. Prepare Healthy Embryonic Day 5 Embryos from Japanese Quail\nPlace 1 male and 3 female sexually mature Japanese quail together in the same cage. Supply feed and water ad libitum. Adjust the light in the animal room to 14 hr of light and 10 hr of darkness.\nCollect fertilized eggs in plastic bags every day in the afternoon and keep them in a 16 °C refrigerator to retard the growth rate of embryos.\nAfter collecting a sufficient number of eggs within a two-week period, incubate the fertilized eggs in a 37 °C incubator with good ventilation for five days.\n2. Prepare Basal Medium and Wash Solutions\nUse DMEM/ F-12 medium (adjusted to pH 7.2) as the growth medium, and supplement it with 10% new born calf serum (NBCS) and 1% Pen-Strep Ampho. Solution (PSA; Penicillin, 105 units/L; Streptomycin, 100 mg/L; Amphotericin B, 0.25 mg/L).\nPrepare phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution at a 10x concentration for storage; use 1x PBS solution (containing NaCl, 137.93 mM; KCl, 2.667 mM; KH2PO4, 1.471 mM; Na2HPO4-7H2O, 8.06 mM; adjust to pH 7.2) to wash and moisten the yolk sac membrane while separating the endoderm from egg yolk and albumin.\nUse DMEM medium (adjusted to pH 7.2) to re-suspend endoderm pellets.\n3. Collection of Primary EECs from Japanese Quail YSMs\nIncubate the collected eggs for 5 days (step 1.3). Examine the eggs by an egg candler to confirm normal embryonic development.",
    "NOTE: On embryonic day 5, the boundary of YSM mesoderm is very clear and the 3 embryonic layers are less tightly-linked together, so it is easy to obtain endoderm. Only use the eggs showing normal capillary circulation development for YSM collections.\nClean the eggshell carefully using fresh water and 75% ethanol. Open the eggshell from the air cell position by a pair of scissors, gently peel out and collect the whole YSM by forceps and place in a 10 cm culture dish filled with 37°C 1x PBS.\nUsing a pair of scissors remove the embryo, yolk and egg-white, and gently wash the YSM with 1x PBS three times and place YSM in PBS solution in a 10 cm culture dish.\nUse forceps and a pair of scissors to remove the ectoderm from YSM. Use 2 forceps, one to firmly hold the endodermal cell layer, and the other to hold the capillary mesoderm.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, pull apart and separate the endoderm from the edge of the mesoderm in the direction towards the embryo. Collect the light-yellow endoderm in 50 ml centrifuge tubes using a dropper and place in 15 ml of growth medium in a 37 °C water bath until all tissue collections are completed.\n4. Digestion of the Endoderm Slices by Collagenase Digestion\nFreshly dissolve 6.5 units of type IV collagenase in 10 ml of DMEM.\nCentrifuge the 50 ml tubes (3.4) at 130 x g for 3 min at RT. Aspirate the medium and place all the endoderm in a 6 cm culture dish using a pipette. Add 1 ml collagenase solution to this culture dish.",
    "Slice the endoderm collected from 2 quail embryos with a pair of curved scissors until the size of each slice is approximately 2 to 3 mm. Use a dropper, collect all the slices into a 50 ml centrifuge tube along with 9 ml of fresh collagenase solution.\nDigest the tissue with collagenase for 30 min in a 37 °C shaking water bath at 175 rpm. This partial digestion with collagenase is used to improve the explant cell proliferation.\nCentrifuge at 130 x g for 3 min at RT and gently remove the supernatant fraction using a pipette. Wash the pellet by suspension in 20 ml DMEM and remove the supernatant fraction after 130 x g centrifugation for 3 min.\nRe-suspend the pellet with 12 ml of growth medium (DMEM/F12 with 10% NBCS and 1% PSA) and seed gently and equally into a 24-well plate (each well with 500 µl cell solution).\nIncubate tissue explants at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air for 2 days to allow cells to proliferate out of the tissues.\nIncubate cells for another 2 days and characterize for cell viability by a cell viability assay protocol.15\n\tNOTE: Living cells maintain a reducing environment within the cytosol. Resazurin, the active ingredient, is a non-toxic, cell permeable compound that is blue in color and virtually non-fluorescent. When added to cell cultures, resazurin is reduced to resorufin in the cytosol by mitochondrial enzymes. Resorufin is red in color and highly fluorescent. Viable cells continuously convert resazurin to resorufin, increasing the overall fluorescence and color of the culture medium surrounding cells.\nPerform endoderm epithelial cell total RNA isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR of marker gene mRNA expression as described. 16,17",
    "Use reverse transcriptase PCR to detect SOAT1 mRNA (sense: 5'-GAAGGGGCCTATCTGGAACG-3'; antisense: 5'-ATCTGCACGTGACATGACCA-3'; PCR product = 168 bp) as a specific marker for the EEC cells. Use β-Actin mRNA (sense: 5'- TGGTGAAGCTGTAGCCTCTC-3'; antisense: 5'- GTGATGGACTCTGGTGATGG-3'; PCR product = 151 bp) as a housekeeping gene and internal control.\nUse gel electrophoresis to detect the product size of RT-qPCR. Prepare 1% agarose gel, and mix 10 μl qPCR product with 2 μl loading dye. Load 10 μl mixture into each well in the 1% agarose gel, and run the gel by 100V for 30 min.\nSubscription Required.
