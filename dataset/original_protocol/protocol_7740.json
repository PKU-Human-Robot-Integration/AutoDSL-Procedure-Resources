    "I.   Preparation of sucrose gradientsPrepare 50 ml of 60% (w/v) sucrose solution in MilliQ water and 10 ml of 10x sucrose gradient buffer. Filter solutions with 0.22 μm filter.Prepare 10-50% sucrose solutions using 60% sucrose. Prepare gradients at least one day before cell lysis to allow gradient to diffuse overnight at 4 °C.Carefully add 1.2 ml of each sucrose solution (starting with the 50% sucrose solution) to Beckman tubes (12 ml total volume).To improve efficacy at this step, the gradients can be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen following each addition of sucrose solution. This helps in generating equally poured gradients and prevents too much diffusion.Cover tube with parafilm and incubate at 4 °C overnight. Alternatively, sucrose gradients can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely.II.  Isolation of polysomesPrepare cells at least one day before lysing. Confluency is very important. About 80-90% confluency gets the maximum polysomes. 1-5 15-cm dishes are needed to see polysome profile.Prior to lysing the cells, treat cells with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide at a final concentration for 5 min.Wash cells twice with 10 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide.Scrape cells with 5 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, collect them in 15 ml tube and rinse with 5 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide.Centrifuge cells at 1,200 rpm (300 x g) for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant, resuspend cells in 425 μl of hypotonic buffer and transfer all to a new pre-chilled 1.5 ml tube.Then add:5 μl of 10 mg/ml cycloheximide1 μl of 1 M DTT100 units of RNasinVortex for 5 sec.Then add:25 μl of 10% Triton X-10025 μl of 10% Sodium DeoxycholateVortex for 5 sec.Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm (21,000 x g, a maximal speed on a bench top centrifuge in 1.",
    "5 ml eppendorf tube) for 5 min at 4 °C. Transfer supernatant (about 500 μl) to a new pre-chilled 1.5 ml tube. Measure OD260nm for each sample using NanoDrop.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141104/20141104222128_8420.jpgFigure 1. Polysome profiling from MEFs treated with DMSO or Ink1341 (250 nM) for 8 h from Dowling et al. (2010). 40 S, 60 S and 80 S denote the corresponding ribosomal subunits and monosome, respectively.Load the same OD amount of lysate onto each gradient (10-30 OD260nm is loaded). Keep 10% of lysates as an input.Weight and balance each gradient.Centrifuge at 35,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C using SW40Ti rotor in a Beckman Coulter (Optima L-80 ultra centrifuge). No brake of brake at 1 (maximum) for deceleration. Acceleration does not matter much.While the samples are centrifuging, clean fraction collector with warm MilliQ water containing a bit of RNase ZAP (a few sprays).Carefully remove tubes from the rotor and place them at 4 °C until they are ready for running.Switch on computer, pump, UV detector and fraction collector. Set pump at 1.5 ml/min and the fraction collector by time. Place 2 ml tubes on fraction collector.Open TracerDAQ program.Run chasing solution (60% (w/v) sucrose with bromophenol blue) through the system until it reaches the needle. Make sure to see at least one drop coming out of the needle such that no bubbles are introduced into the gradient.Screw each tube onto the ISCO UV detector and then pierce the tube with the needle.Begin running the chasing solution through the gradient. Run solution with the pump at 1.5 ml/min. Click on acquire data button and press run on the fraction collector.Place fractions on dry ice or liquid nitrogen.Add 750 μl of Trizol for RNA isolation.III. RNA isolation and RT-qPCRMQAdd 150 μl of chloroform to each fraction.Isolate RNA according to manufacturer’s Trizol protocol.",
