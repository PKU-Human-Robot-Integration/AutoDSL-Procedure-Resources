    "All experiments involving animals were approved by and carried out following the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, following the \"Principles of Laboratory Animal Care\" (NIH, Bethesda, USA); permit number IBCCF-035 for fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs.\n1. Preparation of solutions\nPrepare Krebs solution: (132 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.4 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 6 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 373 mOsm).\nPrepare saline buffer (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free solution - CMF): 76.55 g/L NaCl, 3.05 g/L KCl, 1.65 g/L Na2HPO4, 0.610 g/L KH2PO4, 21.95 g/L glucose, and 7.90 g/L NaHCO3.\nPrepare incubating solution (with Fura-2 in Krebs solution:) 5 µM Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2), 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.02% Poloxamer 407.\nFor mixed population or glia culture, prepare DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 40 mg/L gentamicin as the medium.\nFor neuron enriched culture, prepare DMEM/F12 with 1% FCS, neuronal cell culture supplement, 40 mg/L and gentamicin as the medium.\n2. Retina dissection and cell culture preparation\nOpen the 8-day old chick embryo (E8) egg where the air cell is located.\nRemove the egg contents to a Petri dish and proceed with the embryo euthanasia by decapitation with a pair of tweezers.\nBring the head to a clean Petri dish and pour some calcium and magnesium free solution (CMF) to wash it.\nRemove the eyes, taking care not to damage it in the process.\n\tNOTE: Try to avoid cutting or shredding eye's layers before removing it from the eye cavity.\nBring the eyes to a clean Petri dish containing CMF.\nBegin the eye dissection by removing the lens.",
    "Make 3 or 4 longitudinal cuts in the eye, starting by the hole left by the lens. Make cuts by pulling the tweezers, holding the eye sclera in opposite directions.\nRemove the transparent vitreous body with caution, making sure that the retina is not bound to it.\nDetach the retina from the pigmented epithelium and remove any remaining tissue.\nCut the clear retina in small pieces.\nTransfer the retina to another recipient and briefly centrifuge (~1,800 x g for 1 min) it to remove the CMF.\nEnzymatically dissociate the retina with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin, by incubating it at 37 °C for 10 min.\nStop the reaction by adding 1 mL of medium containing 10% FCS.\nWash the retina 2 or 3 times with medium. The wash consists of cycles of adding medium and removing it by centrifugation (~1,800 x g for 1 min).\nAdd 2 mL of complete medium per retina and gently mechanically dissociate the retina by pipetting it up and down.\n\tNOTE: Here, investigators can choose which type of culture will be prepared. For an enriched neuronal culture, use DMEM-F12 + neuronal supplement + 1% FCS + antibiotics. For mixed population or purified glia, use DMEM-F12 + 10% FCS + antibiotics.\nCount the cells and dilute them to the desired density.\n\tNOTE: Ideally, this should be a low-density culture with ~ 2 x 106 cells or less.\nAdd 50 µL of the cell suspension to each coverslip.\nCoverslip treatment\n\t\nIncubate coverslips for at least 1 h (ideally overnight) in 1 mL of 10-50 µg/mL poly-L-lysine in sterilized purified water at 37 °C.\nRemove the poly-L-lysine solution and wash coverslips with sterilized purified water 2-3 times.",
    "Let coverslips dry in a safety cabinet with UV lights turned on. At this point, store them in a sealed container at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nOptional step: For neuron enriched cultures, add 50 µL of 10-20 ng/mL laminin in PBS or medium to each coverslip for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, remove laminin solution excess and the coverslip is ready to use.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C at a 5% CO2 atmosphere until they attach to the glass. This should take about 1-2 h.\nAdd 1 mL of complete medium to each well and return the plate to the incubator until the day of the experiment. If needed, change the medium every 2-3 days.\n3. Loading cells with Fura-2 AM\nReconstitute a 50 µg vial of Fura-2 AM with 50 µL of DMSO.\nTo prepare working Fura-2 AM solution, add 3 µL of 10% Poloxamer 407, 7.5 µL of Fura-2 AM in DMSO and Krebs solution q.s.p. to 1.5 mL.\nSonicate the mixture for 7 min in a water bath.\nWash the coverslip with the cell culture 3x with Krebs solution before incubating it in Fura-2.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nAfter incubation, wash it 3x again and transfer it to another recipient containing Krebs and protected from the light.\n\t​NOTE: Working Fura-2 AM solution remains stable for 24 hours if protected from the light.\n4. Calcium imaging of cells\nBefore each run, add silicon to the coverslip support and chamber to avoid leakage during the experiment.\nWash the bottom of the coverslip with distilled water to avoid salt crystallization on the microscope lens.\nPut the coverslip on the support, gently pressing the borders.\nAttach the support and chamber to the microscope and start perfusing cells with Krebs solution.",
    "NOTE: Cell perfusion during single cell calcium imaging experiments is calibrated to a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and it takes 8-10 s for the platform solution to be fully replaced.\nHave a look at the cells and select an appropriate field of view.\nManually select the cell bodies based on their distinct morphology.\nBefore applying any stimulus, wait for baseline stabilization. Each stimulus should take about 30 seconds.\n\t​NOTE: Prepare all the solutions immediately before each experiment.\nEvaluate the variations in [Ca2+]i by quantifying the ratio of the fluorescence emitted at 510 nm following alternate excitation (750 milliseconds) at 340 and 380 nm.\nProcess acquired values using a fluorescence analysis software.\nExpress experimental results in a table where each row represents an individual cell, and each line a time point.\n5. Data processing\nUsing a spreadsheet software, plot the variation of Fura-2 fluorescence ratio values of singular cells separately or of all of them at the same time.\nTo quantify the number of reactive cells to determined stimulus, set a cutoff of 30% increase in calcium baseline levels\nSubscription Required.
