    "1. Assay Preparation (Day 1)\nPlace the metabolic analyzer (Table of Materials) in an incubator or a temperature-controlled room set to 11 °C.\n\tNOTE: This temperature is ideal for measurements taken at 25 °C, as it allows for the ~14 °C temperature fluctuation that occurs while running the assay. This is caused by the heat generated by the instrument during the run.\nOpen the appropriate software on the computer attached to the metabolic analyzer. Click on the numerical temperature in the bottom left side of the screen. In the new window that opens, click on the box next to the \"Heater on\" command and ensure a check mark appears. Adjust the temperature to 25 °C and adjust the tolerance range to 0.2 °C using the arrows.\n\tNOTE: Several hours are required to achieve stable temperatures.\nOpen the cartridge container (Table of Materials) and remove the cartridge from the utility plate without touching the probes.\n\tNOTE: The utility plate is used during the calibration of the cartridge and is not used while the metabolic assay is run.\nAdd 200 μL of a calibrant solution (Table of Materials) to the utility plate and place the cartridge back on top of the utility plate to rehydrate the sensor probes on the cartridge. Do not touch the probes and protect them from light.\nSeal the cartridge with the paraffin film.\nIncubate the cartridge overnight at 25 °C.\n2. Assay Media Preparation (Day 2)\nAdd 10 mM glucose and 10 mM sodium pyruvate to the assay medium.\nIncubate the medium at 25 °C until the liquid has equilibrated to this temperature.\nAdjust the pH to 7.4 using a pH meter.\n3. Setup of the Software for the Metabolic Analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster Brains (Day 2)",
    "Set up the metabolic software on the metabolic analyzer used in step 1.2.\nSelect \"Template\" on the software home screen.\nDouble-click on \"Blank\" to start a new assay design.\nClick on the \"Plate Map\" button in the top toolbar to view the design of the cell assay plate.\n\tNOTE: The cell assay plate will contain the brain samples and will be paired with the cartridge before beginning the metabolic assay run.\nClick the Add groups button 3x.\nDouble-click on the \"Group 1\" label and rename it to \"Experimental\".\n\t\tNOTE: This group will contain a fly brain and a micro-tissue restraint treated with drugs.\nDouble-click on the \"Group 2\" label and rename it to \"Control\".\n\t\tNOTE: This group will contain a fly brain and a micro-tissue restraint with no drug treatment.\nDouble-click on the \"Group 3\" label and rename it to \"Restraint only\".\n\t\tNote: This group will contain a micro-tissue restraint without any brains or drug treatment.\nAssign the wells to each group based on where samples in the cell plate are intended to be placed.\nClick on the \"Experimental\" label and then highlight wells B2 - B8 on the plate map.\nClick on the \"Control\" label and then highlight wells C2-C8 on the plate map.\nClick on the \"Restraint only\" label and then highlight wells D2-D8 on the plate map.\nCheck that all four corners (A1, A12, H1, and H12) are designated as background.\n\t\tNote: Wells along the perimeter of the plate are not used to reduce any edge effects. This is a default setting in the software.\nClick on the \"Protocol\" button in the top toolbar to set up the protocol.\nClick on the \"Edit measurement details\" in the baseline measurement box.",
    "Adjust the time that the metabolic analyzer will measure the brain by changing the basal measure cycle time to \"3:00\" by clicking the up and down arrows.\nAdjust the time that the metabolic analyzer will wait between brain measurements by changing the basal wait cycle time to \"0:00\" by clicking the up and down arrows.\nAdjust the time that the metabolic analyzer will mix the media prior to measuring the brain by changing the basal mix cycle time to \"1:00\" by clicking the up and down arrows.\nAdjust the total number of basal cycles, which includes the measure, wait, and mix cycles, to \"7\" by clicking the up and down arrows.\n\t\tNOTE: Stable Oxygen Consumption Rate measurements are obtained after ~25 min from the start of the assay.\nClick on the \"Add injection\" button, located in the upper left toolbar.\nClick on the \"Injection label\" and change it to \"Oligomycin\".\nAdjust the injection measure, wait, and mix times to match those for the basal.\nAdjust the total number of injection cycles to \"6\" by clicking the up and down arrows.\nRepeat steps 3.7.6 - 3.7.8 but change the label to \"Rot/AA\" and adjust the total number of injection cycles to 7 by clicking the up and down arrows.\nClick on the \"Run Assay\" button in the top toolbar.\n\"Save\" the assay and begin setting up the assay cartridge (Table of Materials).\n4. Preparation of the Cartridge for the Calibration (Day 2)\nRemove the cartridge from the 25 °C incubator and take off the cover.",
    "Add 20 μL of 100 μM oligomycin to the small upper left circular injection port, port A, in the cartridge for all corresponding experimental wells on the cell plate and add 20 μL of assay media to port A in all other wells, including the control and background wells.\n\t\tNOTE: The cartridge contains 4 ports (A-D) for each of the 96 wells corresponding to the cell plate what will contain the samples. This step is done prior to adding the samples. Adding 20 μL of 100 μM oligomycin results in a final oligomycin concentration of 10 μM in the cell plate well once the drug is injected by the metabolic analyzer. Oligomycin is an inhibitor of ATP synthase. The resulting oxygen consumption value will reflect the amount of ATP-linked respiration in the brain. In order to properly inject the drugs into the specified wells, all ports of the same letter must be filled with the same volume of liquid, even if not in use.\nAdd 22 μL of 50 μM rotenone/antimycin A to the small upper right circular port, port B, in the cartridge for all corresponding experimental wells on the cell plate, and add 22 μL of assay media to port B of all other wells, including the control and background wells.\n\t\tNOTE: This results in a final rotenone/Antimycin A concentration of 5 μM in the cell plate well once the drug is injected by the metabolic analyzer. Rotenone and antimycin A are inhibitors of electron transport chain complexes I and III, respectively. The resulting oxygen consumption value will reflect non-mitochondrial respiration in the brain.",
    "Click \"Start run\" to place the loaded cartridge with the utility plate into the metabolic analyzer with well A1 positioned in the upper left corner when facing the instrument, with the plate loader extending from the right side of the machine.\nSelect \"I’m Ready\" in the software to begin the equilibration and calibration of the cartridge prior to beginning the metabolic assay with the cell plate containing the samples.\n\tNote: The program will ask to save the file and then begin equilibrating and calibrating. These steps can take up to 1 h. Steps 5–8 are conducted during the equilibration and calibration time.\n5. Preparation of the Micro-tissue Restraints (Day 2)\nSelect 1 micro-tissue restraint per brain that is being measured, plus at least 3 for use as restraint-only controls, from the storage container (contains 70% ethanol).\nRinse the restraints with fresh 70% ethanol and wash them with deionized water 3x for 2 min each, using a mesh basket and 6-well plate (Table of Materials). Add additional water washes if the restraints still give off an alcohol odor.\nWash the micro-tissue restraints in assay media and leave them in this solution until they are ready for use.\n6. Dissection of the Drosophila melanogaster Larval Brains (Day 2)\nSelect late (wandering) third instar larvae from a vial of cultured Oregon-R flies using high precision, style 5 (0.10 x 0.06 mm2) tweezers.\nPlace the larva in the well of a clean dissecting spot plate (Table of Materials) containing 500 μL of 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: A spot plate is a glass plate with depressions, used to dissect small tissues and organisms.\nWash the larva by gently shaking it in the well, using tweezers.\nMove the larva to the clean well of a spot plate containing 500 μL of 1x PBS.",
    "Place the spot plate under the dissecting microscope.\nGrasp the larva at its midsection with one pair of tweezers, while grasping the eye hooks with a second pair of tweezers.\nGently and smoothly pull the larva in opposite directions using the two sets of tweezers.\nVisualize the brain, which typically stays attached to the eye hooks and will commonly have eye-antennal discs attached to it.\nCarefully remove additional tissues from the brain, using the eye hooks to hold the brain in place. Lastly, separate the eye hooks from the brain.\nUse tweezers to move the dissected brain to a new well on a spot plate containing 1x PBS.\nRepeat steps 6.1–6.10 until 14 brains are dissected.\n\tNOTE: The total time from the start of the dissection to the assay run should not exceed 30 min.\n7. Addition of the Dissected Brains to the 96-well Metabolic Assay Cell Plate (Day 2)\nAdd 50 μL of assay media to the wells of the 96-well metabolic assay plate (Table of Materials) being used in the experiment, including the experimental, control, restraint-only, and background wells.\nCarefully place one brain in each well from A2-A8 and B2-B8 of the cell plate, using tweezers, a spatula, or a pipette.\n\tNOTE: This may be done away from the dissecting microscope.\nUnder the dissection microscope, use a bent needle micro-probe to sink the brains to the bottom of the well.\nGently position the brain in the middle of the three raised spheres using the probe.\n8. Addition of the Micro-tissue Restraints to the 96-well Metabolic Assay Cell Plate (Day 2)\nUsing tweezers, place the micro-tissue restraint on the edge of the assay plate well, and use the microscope to inspect that it is oriented with the plastic ring facing down and the mesh on top.",
    "Remove the plate from under the microscope and use tweezers to grasp the restraint on both sides and gently drop it into the well.\nUse a bent needle micro-probe to push the restraint down into the well.\nUnder the microscope, verify that the brain can be seen through the tissue restraint and that it is centered in the well.\nRepeat steps 8.1–8.4 for all the wells that will be in the assay — A2-A8, B2-B8, and C2-C8.\nCarefully add 130 μL of assay media to each of the experimental, control, and restraint-only wells.\nVerify that the brains and micro-tissue restraints have not moved while adding the media by visualizing them under the microscope.\nAdd 180 μL of assay media to the four corner wells for use as background control.\n9. Addition of the Cell Plate to the Metabolic Analyzer and the Start of the Assay (Day 2)\nVerify that the equilibration and calibration are complete by waiting for the software to prompt for the cell plate containing the sample.\nSelect \"Open Tray\" and wait for the instrument to eject the utility plate.\nRemove the utility plate and add the cell plate, without the lid, in the same orientation.\nSelect \"Load Cell Plate\" for the instrument to take in the cell plate and close the tray, and then begin the assay.\nView the measurements in real-time with error bars on the computer screen running the software.\nRemove the ejected cell plate and cartridge when the assay is complete.\n\tNOTE: Paired cartridges and cell plates can be re-used 5x.\n10. Post-measurement Analysis (Day 2)\nUse a dissecting microscope to verify that the brains and the micro-tissue restraints are still positioned properly in the well after the assay has completed. Exclude any wells with abnormalities from the analysis.",
