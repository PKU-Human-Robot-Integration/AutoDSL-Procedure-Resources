  "procedures": [
    "1. Scaffold Liposome Preparation\nNOTE: Ideally, initial experiments should use a relatively simple and featureless scaffold (comprised of DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or PC) and DGS-NTA(Ni2+) (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)succinyl](nickel salt)). Building off of these experiments, lipid charge, flexibility, and curvature can be introduced as individual factors with the potential to alter membrane-proximal interactions. These changes can be achieved by adding defined amounts of specific lipid constituents, including phosphatidylserine or cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE or PE), or galactosyl(β) ceramide.\nCombine lipids dissolved in chloroform in a clean glass test tube. Evaporate the solvent with dry nitrogen gas while rotating the tube to form a thin lipid film. Remove residual solvent with a centrifugal evaporator for 1 h at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Various liposome formulations are used in the protocols described below: scaffold liposomes (3.3 mol% DGS-NTA(Ni2+) / 96.7 mol% DOPC), scaffold liposomes with cardiolipin (3.3 mol% DGS-NTA(Ni2+) / 10 mol% cardiolipin / 86.7 mol% DOPC), flexible scaffold liposomes with cardiolipin (3.3 mol% DGS-NTA(Ni2+) / 10 mol% cardiolipin / 35 mol% DOPE / 51.7 mol% DOPC), and enriched scaffold liposomes (10 mol% DGS-NTA(Ni2+) / 15 mol% cardiolipin / 35 mol% DOPE / 40 mol% DOPC).\nAdd Buffer A (25 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 150 mM KCl, pH adjusted to 7.5 with KOH) preheated to 37 °C such that the final lipid concentration is 1 - 2 mM. Incubate 30 min at 37 °C with occasional vortexing to fully resuspend the lipid mixture (Figure 1a).\nTransfer to a plastic test tube, place the tube in liquid nitrogen until completely frozen (roughly 30 s), and place in a 37 °C water bath until fully thawed (roughly 1 - 2 min). Repeat for a total of 4 freeze-thaw cycles (Figure 1b).",
    "Prepare a lipid extruder by soaking 4 filter supports and a polycarbonate filter in buffer and assembling the extruder according to manufacturer instructions. Extrude the lipid solution through the filter 21 times. Use gentle, constant pressure to ensure a homogenous size distribution (Figure 1c).\n\tNOTE: For all experiments described in this protocol, a 1.0 µm polycarbonate filter was used for extrusion. Drp1 interaction with anionic lipids can be observed with a variety of liposome diameters ranging from 50 nm to 400 nm12 or larger13. Hence, the filter size of 1 µm was chosen to be ideal for both GTPase activity and for electron microscopy. If other liposome diameters are desired, preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles14,15 (GUVs) or small unilamellar vesicles16 (SUVs) can be used. Dynamic light scattering can be used to assess liposome size heterogeneity13.\nStore extruded liposomes at 4 °C and discard after 3 - 5 d.\n2. Use of Scaffold Liposomes for Protein Binding Analysis\nSample Preparation\n\t\nIncubate His-tagged MffΔTM (5 µM final) with scaffold liposomes (40 mol% PC / 35 mol% PE / 15 mol% CL / 10 mol% DGS-NTA(Ni2+); 50 µM final) for at least 15 min at RT in Buffer A + BME (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME), pH adjusted to 7.5 with KOH). For an Mff-free control, incubate liposomes with a his-tagged control protein (such as GFP) to bind and shield exposed NTA(Ni2+).\n\t\tNOTE: MffΔTM was expressed and purified as described in a previous study2. GFP was purified in a similar manner, but the ion-exchange step was omitted. BME was required for these experiments because Drp1 is sensitive to oxidation, which can alter its activity and assembly properties.\nAdd Drp1 (2 µM final) and incubate for 1 h at RT.",
    "NOTE: Drp1 was expressed and purified as described in a previous study2. After incubation with Drp1, the effect of nucleotide binding on membrane deformation can be investigated by incubating one additional hour with 2 mM MgCl2 and either 1 mM GTP, 1 mM GMP-PCP, or Buffer A + BME.\nNegative Stain Transmission Electron Microscopy (EM) Analysis\n\t\nTransfer 5 µL of sample to a sheet of laboratory film, and lay a carbon-coated Cu/Rh grid on the sample. Incubate the grid 1 min on the sample, blot away excess liquid on filter paper, and transfer to a drop of 2% uranyl acetate. Incubate 1 min, blot excess stain on filter paper, and transfer to a grid box. Store under vacuum O/N to ensure full desiccation.\nImage samples using a transmission electron microscope at 18,500 - 30,000X magnification to observe ultrastructural changes in protein and liposome morphologies17. \n\t\tNote: Ultrastructural changes can be quantified using image analysis software, such as ImageJ13 (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Protein decoration can be measured when compared with naked lipid templates. Additionally, the diameters of tubular segments can be measured from the outermost portion of the assemblies13. A more detailed analysis can be performed using cryo-electron microscopy17. This method can be used to image native protein-lipid assemblies in solvent without the use of heavy metal stains that coat the sample. In this way, detailed structural features not apparent in negative stain, including changes in the underlying lipid morphology, can be examined and quantified.\n3. Use of Scaffold Liposomes for Enzymatic Assay\nNote: A colorimetric GTPase assay18 was used to measure phosphate liberation via GTP hydrolysis. Alternative GTPase assays are available19 and can be implemented as needed.",
    "Incubate His-tagged MffΔTM (Mff), Fis1ΔTM(Fis1), or GFP (5 µM final for all) with scaffold liposomes (150 µM final) for 15 min at RT in Buffer A + BME (volume = 30 µL). Add Drp1 (500 nM final) and incubate an additional 15 min at RT (volume = 80 µL).\n\tNOTE: Fis1 was purified in a similar manner to Mff2, but the ion-exchange chromatography step was omitted. The purpose of His-tagged GFP is to shield the NTA(Ni2+) headgroups and prevent nonspecific charge interactions with other proteins. If no effect is observed in the absence of GFP, then this control may not be required. Alternative blocking proteins (of comparable size to the protein of interest) can be used as well, but GFP allows for direct visualization of the interactions with scaffold liposomes.\nTransfer tubes to a thermocycler set to 37 °C, and initiate reactions by addition of GTP and MgCl2 (1 mM and 2 mM final, respectively; volume = 120 µL).\nAt desired time points (i.e. T = 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 min), transfer 20 µL of reaction to wells of a microtiter plate containing 5 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to chelate Mg2+ and stop the reaction.\nPrepare a set of phosphate standards by diluting KH2PO4 in Buffer A + BME to calibrate results. A useful set of standards is 100, 80, 60, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 0 µM. Add 20 µL of each to wells containing 5 µL of 0.5 M EDTA.\nAdd 150 µL of Malachite green reagent (1 mM malachite green carbinol, 10 mM ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, and 1 N HCl) to each well, and read OD650 5 min after addition.",
    "NOTE: GTP is acid labile, and will hydrolyze in the presence of malachite green reagent. Ensure that the time between adding malachite reagent and reading is constant to ensure reproducible results.\nGenerate a standard curve by plotting OD650 of the standards as a function of phosphate concentration. Use linear regression to determine the relationship between OD650 and phosphate concentration in a sample.\nUsing the linear regression, convert the OD650 of the protein reaction samples to µM phosphate. Determine the rate of phosphate generation for each reaction mixture by plotting phosphate concentration as a function of time, and convert to kcat by dividing the rate by the Drp1 concentration (0.5 µM).\n\tNOTE: Only the initial linear rate should be used to determine the rate of phosphate generation, and a minimum of 3 data points must be used. If the rate of reaction is sufficiently rapid that the first three data points are not linear (i.e. the r2 of the linear fit is less than 0.9) a significantly shorter time course with at least 3 time points should be performed.\nSubscription Required.
