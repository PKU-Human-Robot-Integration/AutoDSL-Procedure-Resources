    "1. SAXS Sample Preparation and Data Acquisition\nSample Preparation:\n\t\nSAXS experiments require homogeneous, stable and non-aggregating protein samples; observe stability and oligomeric state with size exclusion chromatography (S), DLS and/or AUC prior to data collection.\nSubject samples (nidogen-1 and laminin γ-1 in this case) to DLS analysis and tricine SDS-PAGE to visualize sample purity10.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples may cover a range of concentrations (1-4 mg/mL) depending on their size, their solution behavior such as self-association and aggregation along with stability; here, five concentrations of nidogen-1, (139 kDa), three of laminin γ-1 (109 kDa) and four of the S-purified equimolar complex were prepared as previously described10.\nData Collection:\n\t\nCollect SAXS data using an in-house system or synchrotron, according to manufacturer’s or facility guidelines.\n\t\tNOTE: Data used in this work was collected using an in-house system (see Table of Materials) that contains a 3-pinhole camera equipped with + 002 microfocus sealed tube (Cu Kα radiation at 1.54 Å) and Confocal Max-Flux (CMF) optics operating at 40 W. The system is also equipped with a 200 nm multi-wire 2D detector for data collection. However, with the availability of modern synchrotrons in France, Germany, UK, USA, and other countries, which provide access to an S-SAXS set-up that facilitates separation of a monodispersed preparation from possible aggregation/degradation, we now routinely collect data at synchrotron facilities. A recently published article on a DNA G-quadruplex11 is an example of an S-SAXS data collection strategy. In this case, the SAXS data were collected in the range of 0.08 ≤ q ≤ 0.26 Å for 3 hours for nidogen-1 (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 mg/mL); the laminin γ-1 (1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mg/mL) and their complex (0.8, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 mg/mL).",
    "Reduce data for buffer and samples using processing software specific to the system. Subtract the buffer contribution from protein data using a program like PRIMUS/qt12 (Figure 2A).\n2. Data Analysis\nNOTE: Currently, there are a few software packages that are useful for SAXS data analysis: ScÅtter43 (download available at www.bioisis.net), bioXtas RAW44, and the ATSAS suite13. This section provides an overview of general steps to be taken when analyzing raw SAXS data using the ATSAS program suite and specific steps are taken from the ATSAS 2.8.1 download. Other programs can be used and are briefly discussed later.\nBuffer Subtraction\n\tNOTE: These steps are relevant for static SAXS samples only.\n\t\nSelect the “OPEN” menu option in PRIMUS/qt and select the data files of interest. Be aware that data files must be in ASCII format, in which the first column is the s-vector axis and the second column is the intensity. Repeat this step for data collected for the buffer itself by inserting this data into the same menu.\nSelect “SUBTRACT” in the Data Processing window, which will generate a subtracted scattering curve representing only scattering from the macromolecule of interest. Repeat this step for each concentration.\nGuinier Analysis\n\t\nTo perform Guinier analysis, load a buffer subtracted scatter curve into PRIMUS/qt as previously described in step 2.1.1.\nClick “Radius of Gyration” which will proceed in opening the Primus Guinier Wizard; a plot of ln(I) vs q2 will be displayed.\nTo obtain a preliminary Rg use the “AUTORG” function, which is an external module built into PRIMUS/qt. Find the \"Autorg\" button and click it.\nInput multiple files at once by highlighting them all and inserting them into the menu on the right hand side, very similar to 2.1.1.",
    "Use the Guinier plot created earlier to assess the data quality; the green line under the Guinier plot shows the residuals plot representing a linearity of the fit. Be aware that non-linearity in the Guinier analysis could be a sign of sample aggregation and further analysis should not be performed in this case.\n\t\tNOTE: A linear Guinier fit gives an Rg with a small error (<5%) and suggests a high-quality sample.\nKratky Analysis\n\t\nLoad the data to be visualized in a similar manner as described above.\nClick on the “SELECT BOX” next to the data file name. This will plot the data in a separate window.\nClick the “PLOT” button followed by “Kartky Plot” selection in the dropdown menu.\nThis will plot the data as “q2 x L(q) vs q”. Be aware that globular proteins display a Gaussian peak, while unfolded proteins will display a plateau instead of a peak and resemble a hyperbolic plot17.\nData Merging\n\t\nLoad buffer subtracted data for each concentration in PRIMUS/qt once again, as in step 2.1.1.\nTo merge the data, simply click on the “MERGE” button in the processing window.\nInspect each curve and the I Scale number, which correlates to the dilutions made from the original sample.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples at higher concentration display less noise in the tail region of the curves.\nP(r) Distribution\n\t\nTo generate the P(r) plot, load the merged data curves into PRIMUS/qt as previously described.\nClick on the “Distance Distribution” button to open a new window presenting the merged data of intensity of scattered light vs. q and pair-distance distribution function plot on the right-hand side.\n\t\tNOTE: The information on the right-hand side presents the overall quality of the pair-distance distribution function calculations.",
    "Adjust the data range of the merged data to avoid any significant noise at the tail end of the raw data.\nOmit data points close to the beam stop in the low-q region.\nTo determine the Dmax, start with a range of ~5 times the Rg obtained from the Guinier analysis. Gradually decrease this value until the P(r) plot does not abruptly drop to zero on the Y-axis and does not have a long-tail before approaching zero.\nCheck that the Experimental Rg/I0 (derived from Guinier approximation) and P(r) Rg/I0 numbers are similar.\n\t\tNOTE: In some cases, further manipulation on the range of data, data points, and ALPHA (a regularization parameter which tells the program the ratio of how much attention is paid to the smoothness of the distribution compared to fitting the experimental data) is also required21 to obtain a good quality P(r) plot.\n3. Ab initio bead modeling and averaging\nOnce the data collected at multiple concentrations are merged, or the data collected using S-SAXS is minimized, and the Kratky plot, P(r) plot and Guinier analysis have been verified, calculate low-resolution structures of macromolecules and their complexes. This pipeline can be used to study solution structures and interactions of nucleic acids, proteins, and nucleic acids-protein or protein-protein complexes10,11,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. One of the most popular programs is DAMMIN, developed by Svergun35 and a part of the ATSAS package13, which employs simulated annealing protocols with preliminary input information on Rg and Dmax. The ab initio modeling approaches and principles are described in detail elsewhere18,36."
