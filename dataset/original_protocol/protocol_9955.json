    "All in vivo procedures conformed to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania.\n1. Synthesis of Ti3C2 MXene\nNOTE: The reaction procedures described in this section are intended for use inside a chemical fume hood. Washing steps included in this procedure are intended to be used with balanced centrifuge tubes. All waste produced is considered hazardous waste and should be discarded appropriately following University guidelines.\nCAUTION: Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is an extremely dangerous, highly corrosive acid. Consult the materials safety data sheets (MSDS) for the chemicals used to synthesize MXenes before use and implement and follow appropriate safety measures. Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for handling HF includes a laboratory coat, acid resistant apron, close-toed shoes, long pants, goggles, full face shield, nitrile gloves, and HF resistant gloves made of butyl rubber or neoprene rubber.\nMAX phase synthesis\n\t\nSynthesize Ti3AlC2 by ball milling TiC (2 µm), Ti (44 µm), and Al (44 µm) powders at a molar ratio (TiC:Ti:Al) of 2:1:1 for 18 h using zirconia balls. Place the powders in an alumina crucible, heat to 1,380 °C (5 °C heating rate) and hold for 2 h under argon. After the powders have been cooled, mill the MAX block and sieve through a 200 mesh sieve (<74 µm particle size).\n\t\tNOTE: The Ti3AlC2 MAX phase precursor used to synthesize MXenes has been shown to have direct implications on the resulting Ti3C2 MXene properties38. The Ti3C2 used to fabricate neural electrodes was selectively etched from MAX prepared following a previous procedure26.\nEtching: Removal of the Al layer in Ti3AlC2 in an acidic etchant solution (Figure 1A)",
    "Prepare the selective etching solution in a 125 mL plastic container by first adding 12 mL of deionized water (DI H2O) followed by the addition of 24 mL of hydrochloric acid (HCl). Wearing all appropriate HF etching PPE, add 4 mL of HF to the etchant container. Perform selective etching by slowly adding 2 g of Ti3AlC2 MAX phase to the reaction container and stirring with a Teflon magnetic bar for 24 h at 35 °C at 400 rpm.\nWashing: Bringing the material to neutral pH.\n\t\nFill two 175 mL centrifuge tubes with 100 mL of DI H2O. Split the etching reaction mixture into 175 mL centrifuge tubes and wash the material by repeated centrifugation at 3,500 rpm (2,550 x g) for 5 min. Decant the acidic supernatant into a plastic hazardous waste container. Repeat until the pH reaches 6.\nIntercalation: Insertion of molecules between multilayer MXene particle to waken out-of-plane interactions (Figure 1B)\n\t\nAdd 2 g of lithium chloride (LiCl) to 100 mL of DI H2O and stir at 200 rpm until dissolved. Mix 100 mL of LiCl/H2O with the Ti3C2/Ti3AlC2 sediment and stir the reaction for 12 h at 25 °C.\nDelamination: Exfoliation from bulk multilayer particle into single- to few- layer Ti3C2 MXene (Figure 1C)\n\t\nWash the intercalation reaction in 175 mL centrifuge tubes by centrifugation at 2,550 x g for 5 min. Decant the clear supernatant. Repeat until a dark supernatant is found.\nContinue to centrifuge for 1 h at 2,550 x g. Decant the dilute-green supernatant.\nRe-disperse the swollen sediment with 150 mL of DI H2O. Transfer supernatant to 50 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 2,550 x g for 10 min to separate remaining MAX (sediment) from MXene (supernatant).\n\t\tNOTE: Re-dispersion of the sediment will become difficult and will require agitation or manual shaking.",
    "Collect supernatant as Ti3C2 MXene. Perform further size selection and optimization of the solution to isolate single- to few-layer flakes by collecting the supernatant following a centrifugation step at 2,550 x g for 1 h.\nSolution storage: Packaging the MXene ink for long-term storage (Figure 1D)\n\t\nArgon bubble the solutions for 30 min prior to packaging in an Argon sealed headspace vial (transfer via a syringe). Store solutions at high concentrations (>5 mg/mL), away from sunlight, and at low temperatures (≤5 °C) to ensure longevity.\n2. Fabrication of Ti3C2 MXene Microelectrode Arrays\nNOTE: The procedure described in this section is intended for use inside a standard university clean room facility, such as the Singh Center for Nanotechnology at the University of Pennsylvania. This facility, as well as similar facilities, are accessible to outside users as part of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). In these facilities, many of the tools, equipment, and materials described in this section are provided along with access to the clean room facility and would not require separate purchase.\nCAUTION: Many of the chemicals used in the fabrication of MXene electrodes are hazardous, including photoresists, RD6 developer, remover PG, aluminum etching solution, and buffered oxide etchant. Consult MSDS for these chemicals before use and implement and follow appropriate safety measures at all times. All chemicals should be handled in a fume hood.\nDeposit a 4 μm thick bottom layer of parylene-C onto a clean Si wafer (see Figure 2A).\nUse the first photomask (mask-1) to define the metal interconnects of the devices, as well as a metal ring around the edge of the wafer to aid in later lift-off steps (Figure 2B).",
    "Spin coat NR71-3000p onto the wafer at 3,000 rpm for 40 s. Soft bake the wafer on a hot plate for 14.5 min at 95 °C.\nLoad the wafer and mask-1 into a mask aligner. Position the wafer so that the ring on the photomask overlaps with all edges of the wafer.\nExpose with i-line (365 nm wavelength) at a dose of 90 mJ/cm2. Hard bake the wafer on a hot plate for 1 min at 115 °C.\nImmerse the wafer in the RD6 developer for 2 min, continuously agitating the solution. Rinse thoroughly with DI H2O and blow dry with an N2 gun.\nUse an electron beam evaporator to deposit 10 nm Ti, followed by 100 nm Au onto the wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical deposition parameters are a base pressure of 5 x 10-7 Torr and a rate of 2 Å/s.\nImmerse the wafer in remover PG for ~10 min until the photoresist has dissolved and the excess metal has fully lifted off, leaving Ti/Au only in the desired interconnect traces and the ring around the edge of the wafer. Once lift-off appears complete, sonicate for 30 s to remove any remaining traces of unwanted metal. Rinse wafer first in clean remover PG solution, then thoroughly rinse in DI H2O and dry the wafer with an N2 gun.\nDeposit the sacrificial parylene-C layer (Figure 2C).\n\t\nExpose the wafer to O2 plasma for 30 s to render the underlying parylene-C layer hydrophilic. Spin coat 2% cleaning solution (e.g., Micro-90) in DI H2O onto the wafer at 1,000 rpm for 30 s. Allow wafer to air dry for at least 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The dilute soap solution acts as an anti-adhesive, allowing the sacrificial parylene-C layer to be peeled up later in the process.\nDeposit 3 μm of parylene-C onto the wafer.",
    "Use the second photomask (mask-2) to define the MXene patterns and a ring around the edge of the wafer (Figure 2D).\n\t\nRepeat steps 2.2.1−2.2.4, this time using mask-2 and carefully aligning the alignment marks between the wafer and photomask before exposure.\nUse O2 plasma reactive ion etching (RIE) to etch through the sacrificial parylene-C layer in the areas not covered by the photoresist to define the MXene electrodes and traces, which should partially overlap with the Ti/Au interconnects, as well as the ring around the edges of the wafer. Confirm complete etching of the sacrificial parylene-C layer by using a profilometer to measure the profile between the exposed Ti/Au interconnects and the bottom parylene-C layer.\n\t\tNOTE: When etching is complete, the profile across the exposed metal surface will be smooth, while the bottom parylene-C layer will be rough and partially etched. This etch step should be completed in a planar etch RIE system, not a barrel asher, and etch times and parameters will be highly dependent on the RIE system.\nSpin-coat the MXene solution onto the wafer (Figure 2E).\n\t\nPipette MXene solution onto each of the desired MXene patterns, then spin the wafer at 1,000 rpm for 40 s. Dry the wafer on a 120 °C hot plate for 10 min to remove any residual water from the MXene film.\nUse an electron beam evaporator to deposit 50 nm SiO2 onto the wafer, to act as a protective layer over the MXene patterns for subsequent processing steps.\n\tNOTE: Typical deposition parameters are a base pressure of 5 x 10-7 Torr and a rate of 2 Å/s.\nRemove the sacrificial parylene-C layer to pattern the MXene and SiO2 layers (Figure 2F).",
    "Apply a small drop of DI H2O to the edge of the wafer and use tweezers to peel up the sacrificial parylene-C layer, beginning where its edges are defined in the ring around the outside of the wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: The water will combine with the soap residue beneath the sacrificial parylene-C layer to enable this lift-off.\nRinse the wafer thoroughly in DI H2O to remove any remaining cleaning solution residue. Dry the wafer with an N2 gun, then place on a 120 °C hot plate for 1 h to remove any residual water from the patterned MXene films.\nDeposit the 4 μm thick top layer of parylene-C (Figure 2G).\nUse the third photomask (mask-3) to define device outline and openings over electrodes and Au bonding pads (VIAs) (Figure 2H).\n\t\nRepeat steps 2.2.1−2.2.4, this time using mask-3 and carefully aligning the alignment marks between the wafer and photomask before exposure.\nUse an electron beam evaporator to deposit 100 nm Al onto the wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical deposition parameters are a base pressure of 5 x 10-7 Torr and a rate of 2 Å/s.\nImmerse the wafer in remover PG for ~10 min until the metal has fully lifted off, leaving Al covering the devices with openings for the electrodes and bonding pads. When lift-off is complete, sonicate for 30 s to remove any remaining traces of unwanted metal. Rinse wafer first in clean remover PG solution, then thoroughly rinse in DI H2O and dry the wafer with an N2 gun.\nEtch the parylene-C to pattern the device outline and openings over electrodes and Au bonding pads (VIAs) (Figure 2I). Use O2 plasma RIE to etch through the parylene-C layers surrounding the devices, and through the top parylene-C layer covering both the MXene electrode contacts and the Au bonding pads.",
    "NOTE: Etching is complete when no parylene-C residue remains on the wafer between devices. The SiO2 layer covering the MXene will act as an etch-stop layer, preventing the O2 plasma from etching into or damaging the MXene electrode contacts.\nEtch the Al layer covering the devices using a wet chemical etch in Al etchant type A at 50 °C either for 10 min, or for 1 min past when all visual traces of Al have disappeared, whichever comes first. Etch the SiO2 covering the MXene electrodes using a wet chemical etch in 6:1 buffered oxide etchant (BOE) for 30 s (Figure 2J).\n\tNOTE: The MXene microelectrode arrays are now complete.\nRelease the devices from the Si substrate wafer by placing a small drop of DI H2O at the edge of a device, and gently peeling up the device as water is wicked underneath it by capillary action (Figure 2K and Figure 3).\n3. Adapter Construction and Interfacing\nNOTE: At this point, the thin film microelectrode arrays must be interfaced with an adapter to connect to the electrophysiology recording system. The 128ch stimulation/recording controller with the RHS2000 16-ch stim/record headstage (Table of Materials) used in this protocol requires input via a connector compatible with the 18-pin connector A79039-001. This section uses a printed circuit board (PCB, Figure 4A) with a zero-insertion force (ZIF) connector for interfacing with the Au bonding pads on the microelectrode array and the connector A79040-001 for interfacing with the head-stage of the recording system. Depending on the data acquisition system, different connectors can be used on the PCB to enable interfacing with the electrophysiology headstage.",
    "Solder the Omnetics and ZIF connectors to the PCB by applying a thin film of solder paste to each of the contact pads on the PCB, placing the parts in their appropriate locations, and heating on a hot plate until the solder reflows to form connections (Figure 4B).\n\tNOTE: Reflow soldering can be done very easily on a hot plate or in a toaster oven and does not require the use of a costly reflow oven.\nApply two layers of polyimide tape (Table of Materials) to the back side of the Au bonding pad region of the MXene microelectrode array to give the device sufficient thickness to be secured in the ZIF connector. After applying the tape, trim any excess beyond the edges of the parylene-C device using a razor blade or precision scissors (Figure 4C).\nEither under an inspection scope or using magnifying glasses, align the MXene microelectrode array in the ZIF connector so that the Au bonding pads align with the pins inside the ZIF connector, then close the ZIF to form a secure connection (Figure 4D,E).\n\tNOTE: The ZIF connector used here is an 18-channel connector, while the device used here has 16 channels. The extra uncontacted channels are easily identified as an open circuit by means of impedance testing during recording sessions.\nTest the electrochemical impedance of the MXene electrodes using a potentiostat to ensure successful fabrication and connection to the PCB adapter.\n\tNOTE: Reasonable impedance values are given in the discussion section to aid in troubleshooting.\n4. Acute Implantation and Neural Recording\nNOTE: Surgeries on adult male Sprague Dawley rats are performed using sterile instruments and with aseptic technique. Respiratory rate, palpebral reflex, and pedal pinch reflex are checked every 10 min to monitor depth of anesthesia. Body temperature is maintained with a heating pad.",
    "Administer preemptive analgesia (subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine sustained release [SR], 1.2 mg/kg).\nAdminister anesthesia (intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 60 mg/kg ketamine and 0.25 mg/kg dexmedetomidine).\nConfirm proper level of anesthesia every 10 min throughout the experiment by checking for absence of palpebral and pedal pinch reflexes.\nSecure rat in stereotaxic frame, apply ocular lubricant to the eyes, and clean shaved scalp with 10% povidone-iodine.\nExpose the calvaria with single midline scalp incision and blunt dissection of underlying tissue.\nPlace a 00-90 screw into the skull to serve as the ground for recordings.\nUsing a dental drill with a small burr, make a craniotomy at the desired cortical recording site.\nSecure the array connector to a stereotaxic manipulator and position the device over the craniotomy. Gently lower until the entire array is in contact with the exposed cortex.\nWrap the ground wire around the skull screw.\nConnect the recording system headstage to the array and begin recording spontaneous activity.\nSubscription Required.
