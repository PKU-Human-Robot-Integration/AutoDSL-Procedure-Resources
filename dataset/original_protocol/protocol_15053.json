    "All animal studies were performed in compliance with international (Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament) and national (UK Home Office, Act 1986) regulations. The procedures herein described are part of our plan of work under UK license authorities and have not been undertaken for the purpose of recording.\n1. Preparation of Cells\nThis protocol describes the preparation of a specific cell line (Human Embryonic Kidney, HEK293 cells) for demonstration purposes. Cell-specific protocols must be employed for growing and eventually differentiating pluripotent or adult stem cells into specific cell lineages.\nGrow cells in DMEM media (high glucose, 4,500 mg/L) containing 1% sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, 1% antibiotic Pen/Strep and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). One 10 cm plate should be normally split at 1:3 and media supplemented fresh every two days.\nTreat cells mildly with trypsin 1x and resuspend in DMEM medium as described in 1:1.\nCount cells in a hemocytometer chamber and collect 3 x 106 cells into a separate tube.\nCentrifuge in a swing bucket rotor at 100 g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cell pellet with sterile phosphate buffer 2x.\nResuspend in PBS 1x at a concentration of 106/50 ul for injection into the left ventricle of immunodepleted mice.\n2. Presurgical Conditions\nMaintain immunodepleted mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdscid/JHliHSD) with sterile food pellets and water in a temperature-controlled isolator (22 °C; Table 1) before each surgery.\nPerform surgery of immunodepleted mice under a laminar flow hood. Clean the working area with 70% Ethanol and autoclave surgical tools (forceps and scissors).\nTurn on heating pads for the surgery and for the recovery. Heating pads are important to block the decrease of body temperature occurring during and post-surgery.\nPlace a clean and autoclaved cage on the recovery-heating pad.",
    "Transport the mice in their original cages from the isolator to the surgery room into a sterile autoclaved bag.\nWeigh the mouse and according to the body weight inject subcutaneously (s.c.) a solution containing medetomidine and ketamine hydrochloride diluted in 0.9%  sterile saline solution to anesthetize the mouse, as well as to relax the musculature (medetomidine 1 mg/kg; ketamine hydrochloride 75 mg/kg).\nRemove the mouse from the cage when fully anesthetized (within 1-2 min, no toe-pinch reflex after stimulation)\nApply hair removal cream on the left side of the chest and the throat area. After an appropriate amount of time (approximately 2-5 min), wipe away the loose hairs with a water-wet tissue.\nPlace the mouse on the surgery panel in a supine position. From the surgeon's viewpoint the position is vertical, tail down-head up.\nInject analgesic solution at 0.1-0.2 μg/g diluted in sterile saline solution (buprenorphine) into the hind limb subcutaneously and cover the shaved area with the aseptic solution povidone iodine using a cotton tip applicator.\nFocus the microscope (2.5X objective) on the throat area.\n3. Surgical Conditions\nWith blunt scissors make a midline ventral skin incision of about 0.5-1 cm length slightly below the cricoid cartilage. Separate the skin from connective tissue to visualize the salivary glands.\nSplit the salivary glands on their natural midline division by simultaneously pulling each part sideward with forcep and magnetic chest retractor and expose the trachea.\nPull the tongue gently to the side to expose the larynx. Slide the intubation tube carefully into the trachea. The tube tip is visible through the displayed larynx and trachea. Importantly, if the tube is in, but not clearly visible, it is in the esophagus. Remove it and change the position of the tube tip.",
    "Connect the tube to the ventilation machine. Set the stroke volume at 200 μl and 150 stroke/min. Secure the ventilation tubing on the surgery panel with a tape.\nWith blunt scissors and forceps, make a vertical tail to head 1- to 1.5-cm-long skin incision over the left thorax area.\nLoosen the skin from the connective tissue/muscle layers and the major and minor pectoral muscles without making incisions.\nPerform thoracotomy between the third and fourth ribs as follows:\n\t\nPerforate the intercostal muscle layer by pinching and scratching with small, rounded forceps.\nOnce the intercostal muscle layer is perforated, place the chest retractor to maximally open the chest cavity. The upper and middle parts of the left ventricle (LV) with its overlying auricle (atrium) are now visible.\nPrepare a precision syringe with cells. The syringe should be able to deliver an amount of volume of 10 ul for each injection. Cast a 30 G needle at the tip of the syringe.\nFix with tape a small plastic cannula (from an introcan-W 20 G) on the needle, leaving exposed only 1 mm including the open tip of the needle. This will prevent the needle from perforating the entire left ventricular wall and injecting the cells into the left ventricle cavity.\nWith the help of a 5X objective, visualize at this magnification the left ventricle and inject the cells into the left ventricular wall in 5 different locations (each injection will deliver 10 ul for a total of 106 cells injected). If the injection is successful, a white area and the absence of major backwash of the cells will be visible (if the injection was not successful, the animal would be excluded from functional analysis).",
    "Remove the retractor. Close the thoracic wall by enclosing the two separated ribs with two stitches of 6-0 silk suture.\nMoisturize the pectoral muscles and skin with a cotton tip drenched in PBS 1x and gently put the muscles back into the original position with the forceps.\nClose the skin with 3-4 stitches of 6-0 silk suture. Suture the throat incision with 2-3 stitches to close the skin.\nInject atipamezole (1 mg/kg final concentration) to revert the anesthetic effects.\nAs soon as the mouse starts breathing autonomously, take out the tube from the trachea and put the mouse on its right side. The mouse is expected to recover within minutes.\nWhen the mouse starts to turn and walk, place it in the warm recovery cage (small IVC cage with closed filtered top) for an hour.\nLeave the animals overnight in a controlled heated box (37 °C).\nFill a dish with water and pellet food to support recovery during the first 2 days after surgery.\n4. Post-surgery Analyses\nTen hearts injected with cells and 10 control not injected hearts are analyzed histologically as follows:\nPerform analysis of the grafted cells 1 week after injection (Figures 1 and 3).\n\t\nAfter euthanasia by overdose of isoflurane, perfuse the hearts with 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to fix the tissue. Dehydrate the fixed tissue in increasing percentages of ethanol (from 70-100%) and embed in paraffin blocks.\nSection the hearts in paraffin with a microtome at 5 μm and stain with hematoxylin and eosin for morphological analysis.\nVisualize connective tissue by using Masson's Trichrome stain.\nAnalyze the images under a slide scanner microscope (Figures 1A, 2A, 3A, 3B, and 3C) and visualize the entire heart in short axis view using a digital slide scanner microscope (Figures 1B and 1C).",
    "After the above analyses, deparaffinize the heart tissues in xylene, rehydrate by submerging specimens in decreasing percentages of ethanol (from 100% to water) and process for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) as follows:\n\t\nIncubate deparaffinized blocks with 1% tannic acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 1 hr.\nDehydrate specimens in increasing percentages of ethanol (from 25-100%).\nDry samples with HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane).\nMount the specimens on Stubbs with Acheson Silver Dag and coat them with gold-palladium.\nView samples in an analytical scanning electron microscope (Figure 2B).\nSubscription Required.
