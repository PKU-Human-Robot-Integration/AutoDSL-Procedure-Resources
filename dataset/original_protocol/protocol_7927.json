    "Zebrafish were raised and maintained in the Notre Dame Zebrafish facility in the Freimann Life Sciences Center. The methods described in this manuscript were approved by the University of Notre Dame Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Traumatic brain injury paradigm\nAdd 1 mL of 2-phenoxyethanol to 1 L of system water (60 mg of Instant Ocean in 1 L of deionized RO water).\nPrepare an aerated recovery tank containing 2 L of system water at room temperature.\nSelect the desired weight of ball bearing and a desired length and diameter of steel/plastic tubing and determine the energy and impact force.\n\tNOTE: Tubing should have an inner diameter that allows the ball bearing to pass through without changing its path or speed of movement.\n\t\nDetermine the kinetic energy upon impact:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62709/62709eq01.jpg\n\t\tWhere, KE = kinetic energy, m = mass (in kg), g = gravitational force, h = height (in m) from drop point to fish.\n\t\tNOTE: This provides kinetic energy in J. Multiply the value by 1,000 to determine mJ. KE is based on an accelerating object, which occurs when the ball bearing is dropped from a stationary position.\nGenerate a mild TBI (miTBI) using 7.62 cm long steel/plastic tubing that ends 1.5 cm above the plate on the zebrafish skull (total distance 9.1 cm) and a 1.5 g (6.4 mm diameter) ball bearing. These produce a kinetic energy of 1.33 mJ. This damage was empirically decided to be equivalent to a miTBI based on key pathophysiological TBI markers, such as vascular injury, subdural/intracerebral hematoma formation, neuronal cell death, and cognitive impairments that largely recapitulated what was reported in the human population in a severity-dependent manner.\nCalculate kinetic energy miTBI = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62709/62709eq02.jpg",
    "Generate a moderate TBI (moTBI) using 12.7 cm long steel/plastic tubing that ends 1.5 cm above the plate on the zebrafish skull (total distance 14.2 cm) and a 1.5 g (6.4 mm diameter) ball bearing that produces kinetic energy of 2.08 mJ.\nCalculate kinetic energy moTBI = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62709/62709eq03.jpg\nGenerate a severe TBI (sTBI) using 7.62 cm long steel/plastic tubing that ends 1.5 cm above the plate on the zebrafish skull (total distance 9.1 cm) and a 3.3 g (8.38 mm diameter) ball bearing that produces a kinetic energy of 2.94 mJ.\nCalculate kinetic energy sTBI =  imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62709/62709eq04.jpg\nFill a Petri dish with modeling clay (Figure 1, step 1) and use a blunt instrument (i.e., the back of a pair of forceps) to create a raised platform (5 cm x 1.5 cm) with additional modeling clay (Figure 1, step 2).\n\t\nUse a razor blade to divide the raised platform lengthwise into two approximately equal halves (Figure 1, step 3, red dashed line). Form the two halves into a channel that accommodates the length of an adult fish (Figure 1, step 4). Use additional clay to build walls that will secure ~2/3 of the fish body, leaving the head exposed.\nMold a small support in the exposed head region perpendicular to the walls to support the head to avoid rotation or recoil of the head upon injury (Figure 1, step 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The channel should be deep enough to support the fish in a dorsal-up position but should still allow the head to rest above the surrounding clay. Additionally, the head support should follow the natural curvature of the fish, supporting the lower mandible and gills.\nEnsure that the dropped weight is not impeded by the channel's sides (Figure 1, step 4).",
    "Create a 3 mm diameter steel disk using a mini hole-punch and 22 g steel flashing. Each disk may be used multiple times.\nAnesthetize one fish by placing it into a beaker with 50-100 mL of 1:1000 (1 mL/1 L, 0.1%) 2-phenoxyethanol until it is unresponsive to tail pinch.\nPlace the fish, dorsal side up, on the clay mold within the channel so that the body is secured on the sides and place a 3 mm 22 g steel disc on the head, centered over the desired impact point (Figure 1, step 5).\n\t\nEnsure that the fish is aligned as perpendicularly as possible to avoid its head from tilting to one side, which could cause an uneven impact.\nSecure the steel/plastic tubing, using a standard ring stand and arm clamp, so the bottom of the tubing is 1.5 cm above the head of the zebrafish (Figure 1, step 6). Ensure the tubing is straight.\n\t\nLook down the tubing and ensure that the tubing is aligned above the steel plate.\nDrop the ball bearing (1.5 g for mild and moderate TBI, and 3.3 g for severe TBI) from a predetermined height (described in Steps 1.3.3-1.3.5) down the tubing onto the steel plate located over the desired neuroanatomical region of interest (e.g., cerebellum, Figure 1, step 5) to produce the blunt-force TBI for the desired severity of injury. Place the injured fish in a recovery tank to be monitored.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the severity of the injury, mortality or tonic-clonic seizures may occur. If the fish are unresponsive for a prolonged period of time following the TBI, use a transfer pipette or forceps to administer a tail-pinch and evaluate for a pain response.\n2. Scoring seizures post-TBI in the adult zebrafish",
    "Anesthetize and injure the fish according to the injury protocol outlined in section 1 and place the injured fish in an aerated recovery tank of 2 L of system water.\nObserve the fish for any signs of post-traumatic seizures beginning immediately after being placed in the recovery tank. Set an observation time (i.e., 1 h) and record all seizure activity, including the seizure score (described below), duration of each seizure, and the percentage of fish that experienced seizures (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: Seizures can occur immediately upon injury, as well as hours or days post-TBI. Seizures can persist long term and a single fish can have multiple seizures. Setting an observation time of 1 h or greater will yield a good representation of the overall trend of seizure rates.\nScore fish using the Mussulini18 guidelines for adult zebrafish seizure phenotypes.\n\t​NOTE: Without using the tracking software, it is difficult to assess seizure scores below 3 unbiasedly. Therefore, only seizure scores of 3 or greater should be recorded when the assessment is being performed without software.\n3. Brain dissection\nEuthanize fish in a 1:500 (2 mL/1 L, 0.2%) solution of 2-phenoxyethanol, until gill movements cease, and they are unreactive to fin pinch, at the desired endpoint.\nFill a Petri dish with modeling clay and create a small cavity to support the body during dissection.\nPlace the fish, dorsal side up, in the clay mold. Place one dissection pin through the midline halfway down the body of the fish and a second pin ~5 mm behind the base of the head.\nUnder a dissecting light microscope, bluntly sever the optic nerve with a pair of #5 Dumont forceps and remove the eyes (Figure 2A).\nOrientate the fish so that the rostral end is furthest when looking through the microscope (Figure 2B).",
    "NOTE: The following steps are for right-handed individuals. Left-handed individuals may prefer to perform the following steps in a mirrored orientation.\nUse #5 forceps to slowly place one end of the forceps under the right parietal plate, making a deliberate scissor action moving toward the rostral end and remove the right parietal and frontal plates (Figure 2C).\n\t\nKeep the forceps at an angle of 45° or lower in order to avoid penetrating the brain during dissection.\nRotate the fish 90˚ clockwise. Place one end of the #5 forceps under the left parietal plate and use the same scissor motion to remove the left parietal and frontal plates exposing the entire dorsal aspect of the brain (Figure 2D,E).\nBluntly transect the maxilla with #5 forceps. Preserve the olfactory bulbs and do not damage them if this is the region of interest.\nRemove the right opercle, preopercle, interopercle, and subopercle with #5 forceps (Figure 2F).\nBluntly resect the musculature at the caudal end of the calvarium opening using #5 forceps, exposing the spinal cord.\nBluntly transect the spinal cord with #5 forceps. Carefully place forceps under the brain and gently remove the brain from the calvarium.\n\tNOTE: Never pinch the brain. Use forceps to \"cradle\" the brain or resect caudally and utilize the exposed spinal cord as a pinch point to maneuver the brain.\nFix the removed brains in 9 parts 100% ethanol to 1 part 37% formaldehyde overnight at 4°C on a rocker platform.\n4. Edema studies in the zebrafish brain\nAnesthetize and injure fish according to the injury protocol outlined in section 1 and allow the fish to recover in a recovery tank until they start swimming freely.\nPlace fish back in the normal housing conditions post-injury for 1 day.\nEuthanize the fish in 1:500 2-phenoxyethanol, after time has elapsed.",
    "Dissect the whole brain or region of interest according to the protocol outlined in section 3 and place the brain immediately on a small weigh boat.\n\tNOTE: Use caution when transferring the brain, using fine forceps to gently place it on the weigh boat without stabbing or scraping the brain, which could result in the loss of tissue.\nLabel (with injury group and brain number) and tare an additional small drying weigh boat on a scale. Use a scale with the ability to measure a minimum of 0.001 g to get an accurate measurement.\nTransfer the brain to the tared drying weigh boat and record the wet weight of the brain. Orient the brains so that they lay flat on the weigh boat with the dorsal side facing up.\nPlace the drying weigh boat and brain in a hybridization oven set to 60 °C for 8 h.\nAfter drying, the brain may stick to the drying weigh boat and may be difficult to remove and transfer to a new tared small weigh boat. Avoid pinching the brain with forceps, as this might result in damage to the dry brain and loss of tissue. Instead, pinch the fine forceps together and, starting at the ventral side of the brain, scoop in an upward motion.\nDetermine the water content of each brain using the formula (Figure 4):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62709/62709eq05.jpg\n5. Labeling cellular proliferation across the neuroaxis and preparing fixed tissue.\nPrepare 10 mM 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) in 2 mL of ddH2O.\nAnesthetize 3 to 4 fish at a time in 50-100 mL of 1:1000 (1 mL/1 L, 0.1%) 2-phenoxyethanol until the fish are unresponsive to tail pinch, at the desired time point following injury (using the protocol outlined in section 1).",
    "Make a partial incision on a wet sponge and place one fish at a time in the opening, ventral side up.\nUse a 30 G needle to inject ~40 µL of 10 mM EdU into the fish's body. Return the fish to a holding tank filled with system water.\n\tNOTE: Repeated injections may be performed at different time points to label a greater number of proliferating cells and may be needed if a chase period of greater than 1 week is desired.\nCollect brains as outlined in section 3 and place them as a group in a 5 mL glass vial containing 2 mL of 9 parts 100% ethanol to 1 part 37% formaldehyde. Fix the brains at 4 °C on a rocker platform.\n\tNOTE: A rocker or shaker platform prohibits the brains from resting at the bottom and the telencephalon of whole brains from curling.\nRehydrate brains, in the same glass vial used to fix brains, in washes of descending ethanol series, 75%, 50%, and 25%, for 15 mins each, followed by a 1.5 h wash in 5% sucrose/PBS on a rocker at room temperature. Store the brains in a glass vial overnight in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4° C on a rocker platform.\nRemove brains from 30% sucrose/PBS and transfer them with forceps into a 12-well plate (one treatment group per well) with wells filled with a 2:1 solution consisting of 2 parts tissue freezing medium and 1 part 30% sucrose/PBS. Incubate the brains overnight at 4 °C on a rocker platform.\nTransfer brains to the next row of wells within the 12-well plate submerging brains in 100% TFM for 2-24 h at 4 °C.\nUse a cryostat chuck to embed the brains in TFM in the desired orientation on dry ice.",
    "Perform cryosectioning (16 μm thick sections) and collect the sections on positively charged slides. Dry slides on a slide warmer for 1 h and then store at -80 °C or continue with immunohistochemistry.\nPrepare a hydrophobic barrier on the slide around the tissue sections and allow to dry on a slide warmer for 20 min.\nBriefly wash the slides in PBS for 5 min and then twice in PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%) for 10 min each.\nPerform EdU detection using the EdU Cell Proliferation Kit and the manufacturer's instructions.\nAnalyze the slides and quantify the fluorescent EdU-labeled cells using either an epifluorescent microscope or a confocal microscope. A minimum of a 40x objective will be required to clearly distinguish individual cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
