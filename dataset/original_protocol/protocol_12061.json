    "The collection of skin samples from healthy adult volunteers undergoing plastic surgery requires approval from the ethical committee in the host institutions. This protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee of Region Midtjylland, Denmark (M-20110027). The method described here is derived from similar studies by Maciaq et al.10 and Liu and Karasek11.\n1. Isolation of Keratinocytes from Human Skin\nStart by making the following solutions: 50 mL solution of 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% glucose in DPBS. Mix and filter sterilize (0.2 µm) the solution. Prepare 10 mL of RPMI-1640 + 2% FBS solution, 50 mL of DPBS and keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM). Add KSFM supplements and 250 µL of gentamycin to 500 mL of KSFM. Pre-warm the solutions to 37 °C before use.\nCollect skin from healthy adult volunteers undergoing plastic surgery. The skin samples used are approximately 10 cm x 15 cm, but can vary in size. Keep the skin cool under transportation by transporting the skin samples in a Styrofoam box containing a cooling element. If necessary, the skin sample can be stored at 4 °C overnight.\nRemove fat from underneath the skin section using sterilized scissors, scalpels, and forceps.\nBuckle out the skin section (approximately 10 cm x 15 cm) on a sterile cover on top of a plate using needles. First, clean the skin with a dry sterilized gauze pad. Then clean the skin using a sterilized gauze pad with 70% ethanol.\nUsing a foot planer, cut of the upper layer (epidermis) of the skin section and put it in a 9 cm Petri dish. Then, immediately add 25 mL of the DPBS/trypsin/glucose solution (prepared in step 1.1) to the Petri dish. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.",
    "Using a pipette remove the DPBS/trypsin/glucose solution from the Petri dish and add 10 mL of RPMI-1640 + 2% FBS to inactivate the trypsin.\nUsing two forceps, now release the epidermal cells into the medium by gently scraping and agitating both the epidermal and the dermal compartment of the skin sections.\nFilter the epidermal cell suspension through a metal filter (1 mm hole size), and collect in a 50 mL tube. Add the remaining skin sections to a 50 mL tube containing 10 mL of RPMI-1640 without FBS and vortex for 10 s. Filter the suspension through the metal filter into a 50 mL tube containing the epidermal cell suspension. Add DPBS to a total volume of 50 mL.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 10 min at 450 x g at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the epidermal cell pellet in approximately 10 mL of 37 °C KSFM depending on the size of the cell pellet. Count the cells using the Trypan Blue staining method under microscope. The number of cells obtained from a 10 cm x 15 cm skin section is approximately 50 - 100 x 106 cells. To each 75 cm2 culture flask, transfer 8 x 106 cells together with 12 mL of 37 °C KSFM. Gently shake the culture flasks to ensure uniform distribution of the cells.\nIncubate the keratinocytes in a 37 °C incubator with 100% humidity and 5% CO2. Change the medium after 2 days and three times weekly. Passage cells when the culture is 70 - 80% confluent, which takes approximately 2 weeks depending on the proliferation rate of the keratinocytes.\n2. Passaging of Keratinocytes\nHeat the appropriate amount of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution to 37 °C in an incubator. Use 4.5 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution for a 75 cm2 culture flask.",
    "Remove medium from the cells, and add 4.5 mL/75 cm2 culture flask pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution to the cells. Place the culture flask in the incubator (37 °C) and after approximately 5 min, check under the microscope if the cells have started loosening.\nWhen approximately 50% of the cells have loosened, gently hit the culture flask against the hand to loosen the remaining cells. Then, to inactivate the trypsin, add 6 mL of RPMI-1640 + 2% FBS (37 °C) to the 75 cm2 culture flask and transfer the cell suspension to 50 mL tubes.\nRinse the culture flasks with 3 mL of RPMI 1640 + 2% FBS and add to the 50 mL tubes. Centrifuge cells for 10 min at 450 x g at room temperature.\nResuspend the pelleted cells in 10 mL of KSFM (37 °C). Count the cells and transfer 3 x 106 cells to a 150 cm2 culture flask together with 20 mL of KSFM (37 °C). Gently shake the culture flask to ensure uniform distribution of the cells. Freeze the cells when the culture is 80 - 90% confluent, which takes approximately 4-6 days depending on the proliferation rate of the keratinocytes (see Section 3, freezing protocol below). Expand the keratinocytes to generate appropriate frozen stocks.\n3. Freezing of Keratinocytes\nHeat the appropriate amount of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution to 37 °C in an incubator. Use 9 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution for a 150 cm2 culture flask.\nRemove medium from the cells, and add 9 mL/150 cm2 culture flask pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution to the cells. Place the culture flask in the incubator (37 °C) and after approximately 5 min, check under the microscope if the cells have started loosening.",
    "When approximately 50% of the cells have loosened, gently hit the culture flask against the hand in order to loosen the remaining cells. Then, to inactivate the trypsin, add 12 mL of RPMI-1640 + 2% FBS (37 °C) to the 150 cm2 culture flask and aspirate the cell suspension to 50 mL tubes.\nRinse the culture flasks with 6 mL of RPMI 1640 + 2% FBS and add to the 50 mL tubes. Centrifuge the tubes for 10 min at 450 x g at 4 °C. Prepare ice-cold cell freezing medium (KSFM + 10% DMSO).\nResuspend the cell pellet in KSFM + 10% DMSO, count the cells, and freeze cells at a density of 6 x 106 cells/mL using standard slow-freezing cryopreservation methods12.\nStore the keratinocytes in liquid nitrogen (vapor phase) until ready to use.\n4. Thawing and Culturing Frozen Keratinocytes\nRapidly thaw the appropriate frozen vials in a 37 °C water bath. Use 70% ethanol to clean the outside of the cryovial. Transfer the appropriate number of cells (approximately 15,000 cells/cm2) to a culture flask and immediately add pre-warmed growth medium (KSFM) to the culture flask.\n\tAny size of culture flasks can be used depending on the setup of the experiment.\nUse 5 mL culture medium for a 25 cm2 culture flask. The number of cells added the culture flask might vary because the growth of the cells varies from donor to donor. Incubate cells in a 37 °C incubator with 100% humidity and 5% CO2.\nChange the medium after 2 days and three times weekly using fresh pre-warmed KSFM.\n\tNote: Our data have demonstrated that on average 95% of the cells isolated by the protocol described here are positive for the keratinocyte-marker cytokeratine-1413.\nSubscription Required.
