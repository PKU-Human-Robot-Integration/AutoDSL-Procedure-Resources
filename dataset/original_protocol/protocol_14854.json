    "NOTE: This study was approved by the appropriate Ethics Committees.\n1. Primary Culture of Human Lung Fibroblasts\nCollection of lung tissue:\n\t\nObtain human lung tissue samples from the surgical operating room directly. Collect approximately 1 cm3 blocks from cancerous and non-cancerous lung tissue, with the non-cancerous sample collected as far away from the tumor as possible.\nSuspend the samples in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (serum-free medium). Maintain the suspended samples in sterile 50 ml tubes and transfer to the laboratory.\n\t\tNOTE: Fibroblasts are highly migratory and proliferative compared with other cell types, such as epithelial, endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The outgrowth method takes advantage of these features of fibroblasts, and outgrowing cells from tissue sections are abundant in fibroblasts. After several cell passages, other cell types fail to survive and propagate in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), resulting in purified fibroblast cell cultures. The cells could be used 3-7 passages following primary culture.\nExplant culture and conditioning for cell outgrowth:\n\t\nPerform primary culture of fibroblasts using a previously reported protocol with modifications5.\nIn the laboratory, place the tissue sample on a 10 cm tissue culture dish without culture medium and cut into small sections ~2-3 mm in size using sterile forceps and a scalpel. During this process, avoid making the section dry, otherwise the efficiency of cell outgrowth is impaired.\nSeparation of the epithelial cell layer and connective tissue:\n\t\nSoak the cut tissue sections in culture medium containing 2,000 PU/ml dispase I and culture for 16 hr at 4 °C.\nTransfer the tissue sections to a dish, and separate the epithelial cell layer from the adjacent connective tissue. Process the sections in a clean bench to avoid contamination of microorganisms.",
    "NOTE: If primary culture of epithelial cells is needed, perform step 1.3. If only fibroblasts are to be isolated, omit step 1.3 because the subsequent explant culture and cell passages are unfavorable for epithelial cells, which yield purified fibroblast populations.\nAttachment of tissue sections:\n\t\nMince the tissues into 1 mm pieces using two scalpels. If the pieces are not small enough, they detach more easily from the dish, and the cells will fail to outgrow on the dish surface.\nPlace small lung tissue sections apart from each other to maintain an empty area surrounding each piece. Make scratches on the surface of the tissue culture dish using a scalpel blade to facilitate attachment of tissue sections.\n\t\tNOTE: Scratching also appears to facilitate cell outgrowth, providing tracks along which cells can migrate.\n\t\t\nAlternatively, place minced tissue pieces individually into each well of a 6-well plate, and cover them with a cover slip. Attach the cover slip to the surface of the plate using silicone grease.\nPlace silicone grease at two points 1.5 cm apart in each well using a sterile pin. Coverage of tissue pieces enhances the efficacy of cell outgrowth and cell propagation following several passages.\nSubsequent explant culture:\n\t\nGently add culture medium to the dish before the tissue sections dry out, as efficient cell outgrowth is lost for the most part if the samples dry out. Do not pour the medium too rapidly as the tissue sections would detach.\nCulture cells in DMEM with 10% FBS. Use enough medium to just cover the tissue, but not too much that it allows floating, as additional buoyancy promotes detachment from the dish.\nCell passage:\n\t\nHandle the culture medium with care at all times as repeated movements of the culture dish can lead to detachment of the tissue sections.",
    "Place the culture dishes in an incubator at 37 °C for 5-7 days. Refresh the medium every other day, and handle the culture dishes minimally during the medium changes. Fibroblasts outgrow from the edge of the tissue sections over the next few weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: After ~2-3 weeks, outgrowing fibroblasts almost reach confluence, depending on the amount of surface area.\nWash cells with 1x PBS, and add 1 ml of trypsin I to the plate.\nAfter trypsinization, detach the cells using 9 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Collect cells suspended in the medium in a 10 ml tube, together with the tissue sections. Following centrifugation to form cell pellets, resuspend the resulting pellets in the new medium.\nSeed the cells and tissue sections onto a new culture dish, at which point the tissues fail to attach to the dish while the cells adhere and grow. The following day, remove the floating tissue pieces by aspiration, and change the medium. Attached fibroblasts propagate with subsequent cultures.\n2. Three-dimensional Co-culture of Human Lung Fibroblasts and Cancer Cells\nPreparation of cells and reagents:\n\t\nApproximately use 2 x 105 epithelial cells and 2.5 x 105 fibroblasts per well. Prepare collagen type IA (3 mg/ml, pH 3), FBS (100%), reconstitution buffer (50 mM NaOH, 260 mM NaHCO3, 200 mM HEPES), 5x DMEM, DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for fibroblast culture, and a 3D co-culture medium (a 1:1 mixture of fibroblast culture medium and culture medium for cancer cells).\nCulture A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, the fibroblasts and the A549 3D co-culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nCollagen gel formation:",
    "Wash fibroblasts cultured on 10 cm dish with 1x PBS, and add 1 ml of trypsin I to the plate. After trypsinization for ~5 min at 37 °C, detach the cells using 9 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Collect cells suspended in the medium in a 10 ml tube, and centrifuge them at 200-300 x g to form cell pellets.\nResuspend the resulting pellets in 100% FBS at a density of 5 x 105/ml.\nPrepare the collagen gel on ice. Cool the reagents, pipettes and tubes in a refrigerator prior to the following procedure. Even on ice, the mixture solidifies to some extent, and the total volume is less than the sum of all constituents.\nIn each well, prepare the collagen gel by mixing 0.5 ml of fibroblast suspension (2.5 x 105 cells) in FBS, 2.3 ml type IA collagen, 670 μl 5x DMEM, and 330 μl reconstitution buffer. Allow the gels to set readily at room temperature.\n\t\t\nVigorously pipette to ensure a homogenous mixture. Avoid creating bubbles during the pipetting process.\nAdd the mixture (3 ml) to each well of a 6-well plate and allow to gelatinize in the incubator at 37 °C without disturbance for 30-60 min.\nCancer cell culture on the collagen gel:\n\t\nPerform three-dimensional co-culture using a previously reported protocol with modifications6.\nResuspend cancer cells in the 3D co-culture medium (or in DMEM with 10% FBS in the case of A549 cells) at a density of 1 x 105/ml.\nPour 2 ml of the resuspended cell solution (2 x 105 cells) onto the surface of each gel. Modify cell number of cancer cells or fibroblasts in co-culture depending on experimental conditions.\nGel contraction:",
    "Incubate gels overnight at 37 °C so the cancer cells can adhere to the collagen gel. Detach each gel, and generate a ‘floating culture’ in each well of the 6-well plate.\n\t\tNOTE: By using a floating culture, various changes in gel size are induced by mechanical tension and collagen degradation, which are mediated by cellular interaction between co-cultured cancer cells and fibroblasts.\nUse an angled 21 G needle or small spatula to separate each gel from the edge of the well. Every 2-3 days, refresh the wells with 2 ml of 3D co-culture medium. Measure the size of each gel every day for 5 days.\nAnalysis of collagen gels:\n\t\nMeasure the collagen content of each gel using collagen quantitation methods, such as the Sircol assay. Perform transcriptomic analysis or quantitative RT-PCR after collecting RNA from the gels5.\n3. Air-liquid Interface Culture and Invasion Assay\nAfter culturing the collagen gels at 37 °C for 5 days, expose the contracted gels to air by placing them on a mesh (70 μm pore size) in new 6-well plates. Make the mesh from commercially available cell strainers used for flow cytometry.\nGently fill each well with 11 ml of 3D co-culture medium.\nPosition the gels onto the mesh using a sterile spoon, and remove any remaining medium from the gels. On this condition, submerge gels in the medium while expose the upper surface of the gel to air. Define this culture condition as air-liquid interface.\n\tNOTE: After 5-7 days of maintaining the air-liquid interface culture at 37 °C in the incubator, invasive cancer cells migrate into the gel. Depending on the cell type and as a result of cellular interactions, variable degrees of cell morphological change in the cancer cells are induced by the air-liquid interface culture.",
    "For histological evaluation, fix the gel in formalin solution overnight at room temperature and embed in paraffin. Stain vertical sections (4 μm) with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Perform immunohistochemical analysis on the sections4.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
