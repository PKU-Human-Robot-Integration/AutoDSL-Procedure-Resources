    "NIRS is conducted as part of the hospital’s clinical routine. It is recommended in pediatric cardiac surgery interventions within the scope of quality assurance from the Competence Network for Congenital Heart Defects (http://www.kompetenznetz-ahf.de), the Pediatric Cardio Anesthetic Working Group and the German Society for Cardiovascular Engineering25. The protocol follows the guidelines of the institution's human research ethics committee. We obtained written informed consent regarding filming and publication of the material from both parents of each infant appearing in the video. The protocol we present corresponds to the clinical practice in the hospital and applies to infants and children of any age. If there are special concerns for a specific age group, we indicate this in a note in the protocol.\n1. Preparation\nPlug in and turn on the NIRS device. Enter the patient’s data according to the device’s setup.\nSelect the proper probe according to the patient’s weight and intended site of use. The weight range is given on the probe’s packaging and depends on the manufacturer (see Table 1 for an overview of the weight ranges in common manufacturers).\nMake sure the patient’s skin is clean and dry for optimum adhesion. Dry the skin with a swab if necessary. Be very careful or omit cleaning if the skin is vulnerable.\n2. Place the probe\nAfter identifying the correct probe position, carefully bend the center of the probe toward the side of the white cover until it starts to come off. Gently peel off the cover without touching the probe’s sticky surface.",
    "Place the sensor on the skin from the center of the probe to the sides. Make sure the edges of the probe are firmly connected to the skin. If the probe disconnects, wrong NIRS values will be obtained. Disconnection in a bright environment causes false high values; disconnection in a dark environment causes false low values.\n\tNOTE: To avoid skin lesions, do not place the probe on very immature or vulnerable skin. If the probe must be placed on vulnerable skin, use a layer of cellophane between the skin and the probe, or leave the cover on. When fixing the probe, avoid putting pressure on it (e.g., via an infant flow cap or headband) as this can impair skin perfusion and cause an erroneous measurement.\n3. Select the probe position\nCerebral: Place the NIRS probe in the supra-orbital region on the forehead below the hairline to obtain values from the frontal cortex. Do not place the probe above hair, the frontal sinus, the temporal muscle, nevi, the superior sagittal sinus, intracranial hemorrhages or other anomalies, as that can alter the measurement and the values obtained will not represent regional tissue oxygenation. Placement of two probes, one on each forehead allows selective analysis of both hemispheres if the clinical setting requires this. Neighboring probes emit and measure signals alternately to avoid interference.\n\tNOTE: The rSO2 value only reflects the oxygenation status of the tissue underneath the probe – for a large organ like the brain, obtained values do not reflect the entire organ‘s oxygenation status.",
    "Somatic: Select a position above the region of interest. Avoid fat deposits, hair, and bones. Do not place the probe above nevi, hematoma, and injured skin. Always remember that the depth of the NIRS signal is approximately 2.5 cm - if the organ of interest is farther away from the probe, it cannot be analyzed. For renal or hepatic NIRS, use ultrasound to ensure correct placement.\n\t\nKidneys: Locate the kidney via dorsal sagittal sonogram before placing the probe. Make sure that the skin-to-organ-distance does not exceed the maximum depth of the probe.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of ultrasound may interfere with the minimal-handling principle (e.g., in very preterm infants).\nIntestines: Place the probe in the region of interest (e.g., below the umbilicus or in the right or left lower quadrant).\n\t\tNOTE: Free air or liquid in the abdomen can make measuring the desired organ’s tissue oxygenation impossible.\nLiver: Place the probe exactly above the liver. If possible, confirm its position by ultrasound. To avoid measuring the wrong organ, make sure the liver tissue underneath the probe is at least as deep as the emitted light penetrates (1-3 cm, according to the probe selected).\nFoot: Place the probe on the plantar portion of the foot. Measuring NIRS in the most distant part of the body gives information about peripheral perfusion during hypothermia, in patients with shock or in any situation where pulse oximetry does not work.\nMuscle: Place the probe over the muscle of interest.\n4. Set the baseline\n1-2 minutes after placing the probe, set the baseline by pushing the corresponding button on the device. The baseline reflects the starting point of the measurement. The evolution of tissue perfusion in each monitored area can be observed and interpreted individually by relying on the change from the baseline value.",
    "5. Check for problems with the device or clinical complications\nIf the device indicates bad recording quality or values are implausible, confirm that all the aforementioned steps have been taken correctly. If necessary, replace the probe and preamplifer, and check all electrical plug contacts.\nCheck for external light sources that might affect the sensor and contact. Cover the probe light-tight if disturbing light sources cannot be eliminated.\nAfter ruling out technical problems, check the patient for clinical complications."
