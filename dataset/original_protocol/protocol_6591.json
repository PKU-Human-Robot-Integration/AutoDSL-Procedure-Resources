    "Day 1: Pre-culture the attacker cells and the recipient cellsPre-culture the attacker cells. Choose a single colony of A. tumefaciens C58 wild type (WT) grown on 523 agar and grow it in a test tube with 5 ml of 523 medium at 25 °C, 220 rpm for overnight.Pre-culture the control recipient cells.Choose a single colony of E. coli BW25113 WT carrying pRL-nptII plasmid and grow it in a test tube with 5 ml of LB medium with 20 μg/ml kanamycin. Grow the cells at 37 °C, 220 rpm overnight.Note: The pRL-nptII provides BW25113 WT with kanamycin resistance so that it can be selectively grown after co-incubating with A. tumefaciens. Sterilize the 96-pin microplate replicator.Place an alcohol burner on the left. Take a 200-μl tip box, remove the tip holder inside, flatten the box, and then put it on the right of the burner. Fill the left well of the flattened box with 0.6% bleach and the right well with sterilized water (Figure 1).Fill the 96-pin microplate replicator holder with 70% ethanol and place it on the right of the sterilized water-containing well (Figure 1).Note: Do not put the 70% ethanol-containing replicator holder next to the ethanol burner.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200902/20200902015018_9492.jpgFigure 1. Setup for sterilizing the microplate replicator. From left to right: alcohol burner, 0.6% bleach, sterilized water, and 70% ethanol. Place the alcohol burner distal to the 70% ethanol to avoid accidents.Immerse the pins of the 96-pin microplate replicator serially in 0.6% bleach, sterilized water, and 70% ethanol. Let the replicator stand for 10 s in each solution.Sterilize the replicator with an alcohol burner (Figure 2) and cool the replicator for 10 s to room temperature. The sterilized replicator is ready to subculture E. coli mutants.Note: Be very careful when handling the alcohol burner. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200902/20200902015043_6186.jpgFigure 2. Sterilize the microplate replicator by flame.",
    "Place the 96-pin microplate replicator after its pins are immersed in 70% ethanol on top of the alcohol burner for sterilization. Move the replicator around the flame to make sure the alcohol on each pin is burned out, then cool the replicator for 10 s at room temperature. The sterilized replicator is ready to subculture E. coli mutants.Pre-culture the E. coli mutants from the Keio library that serve as recipient cells.Take a U-bottom 96-well microplate and fill each well with 100 μl LB medium with 20 μg/ml kanamycin.Take out an E. coli Keio mutant plate, which is stored as glycerol stock in a 2.2-ml 96 deep-well format in a -80 °C refrigerator. Apply the sterilized replicator to the frozen E. coli stocks.Note: Make sure each replicator pin contacts the surface of the glycerol stock. Stamp the bacteria-containing replicator onto the LB medium in each well of the 96-well microplate prepared in Step A4a and agitate the liquid to resuspend the bacteria thoroughly (Figure 3).Note: Make sure each replicator pin contacts the LB medium in each well of a 96-well plate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200902/20200902015116_2358.jpgFigure 3. Pre-culture the E. coli mutants from the Keio library. Stamp the bacteria-containing replicator onto LB medium in each well of a 96-well microplate and agitate the liquid to resuspend the bacteria thoroughly.Reseal and return the E. coli Keio mutants plate back to -80 °C and place the replicator in the 0.6% bleach prepared in Step A3a.Add a 96-well lid to the E. coli-containing U-bottom 96-well microplate and incubate at 37 °C, 220 rpm for 16 h (Figure 4).Note: The incubation can be achieved by adding the anti-slip pad on a regular incubator.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200902/20200902015220_5048.jpgFigure 4.

    "Fix the anti-slip pad with screws. The anti-slip–containing area is ready for incubating the 96-well microplate.Sterilize the 96-pin microplate replicator (Steps A3c to A3d).Day 2: Sub-culture the attacker cells and the recipient cellsNote: This step incorporates BW25113(pRL-nptII) into the Keio mutant-containing microplate and synchronizes their growth. Sub-culture the attacker cells.Sub-culture 1 ml of the A. tumefaciens C58 WT from Step A1a with 100 ml of 523 medium in a 500-ml flask, prepare two cultures (200 ml in total). Grow the bacteria at 25 °C, 220 rpm, overnight.Sub-culture the recipient cells.Take a U-bottom 96-well microplate and fill each well with 100 μl LB medium with 20 μg/ml kanamycin. Use an 8-channel pipette to subculture 2 μl E. coli mutants grown from Step A4e in the LB-containing U-bottom 96-well microplate but leave some wells empty for the control strain, BW25113(pRL-nptII) (Figure 5).Note: Remove appropriate tips from the 8-channel pipette while sub-culturing to leave the well empty for the control strain. Sub-culture 2 μl BW25113(pRL-nptII) from Step A2 into the empty wells in Step B2a (WT label in Figure 5).Grow the sub-cultured E. coli strains at 37 °C, 220 rpm, for overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200902/20200902015248_0876.jpgFigure 5. Sub-culture the E. coli Keio mutants and the BW25113(pRL-nptII). Use an 8-channel pipette to subculture 2 μl of the overnight-cultured E. coli mutants from step A4e into a new plate filled with 100 μl LB medium with 20 μg/ml kanamycin. Do not sub-culture the wells reserved for BW25113(pRL-nptII) controls (e.g., Wells 3C, D8, D10, and F12 in this case). Sub-culture 2 μl overnight-cultured BW25113(pRL-nptII) into the empty wells as controls (e.g., wells labeled WT).Day 3: Co-incubate the attacker cells and the recipient cells to enable interbacterial competitionPrepare the competition surface.",
    "Pour 25 ml melted AK agar on a 96-well lid in the laminar flow and allow it to dry for 45-60 min.Note: It is crucial to fix the drying time because surface dryness affects competition outcomes. Adjust the OD600 of the attacker cells.Centrifuge the 200 ml cultured A. tumefaciens C58 WT at 8,000 x g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 20 ml of 0.9% NaCl.Centrifuge the A. tumefaciens cells at 5,000 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 10 ml of 0.9% NaCl.Measure the OD600 of the washed A. tumefaciens cells and adjust to OD600 = 3.0 with 0.9% NaCl.Aliquot attacker cells to a 2.2 ml 96 deep-well microplate using the automated pipetting system.Open the automated pipetting system and the EzStarter software that controls the operation of the EzMate automated pipetting system. Set the software to aliquot 150 μl of the sample in Block R1 into each well of Block A; repeat the procedure once so that each well contains 300 μl liquid (Figure 6A)Dispense 50 ml of the OD600-adjusted A. tumefaciens to a pipetting reservoir and place the reservoir in Block R1, a sterilized 2.2 ml 96 deep-well microplate in block A, and a box of EzMate 250 μl tip in block D (Figure 6B).Use the automated pipetting system to aliquot 150 μl A. tumefaciens into each well of the 2.2-ml 96 deep-well microplate.

Cover the dried AK agar with another 96-well lid. Place the plate at 25 °C for 16 h to allow competition to take place (Figure 8).Note: All liquid must be dried out before being placed in an incubator.

    "The wells with BW25113(pRL-nptII) as the recipient cell should yield no or only 1-2 colonies. Thus, the wells with multiple colonies are the E. coli mutant candidates that are less susceptible to A. tumefaciens T6SS attack."
