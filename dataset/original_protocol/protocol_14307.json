    "Male Wistar rats were handled in accordance with the National Institutes of Health animal use guidelines and a protocol approved by the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was performed on rats while under anesthesia prior to drug administration and 72 h after to verify the effect of the trans-tympanic drug delivery.\n1. Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR)\nNote: ABR measurements were collected using the auditory testing equipment and software. ABR represents evoked potentials or high-frequency waves generated by the eighth cranial nerve (wave I and II) and other higher auditory brain stem structures including anteroventral cochlear nucleus (wave III), lateral lemniscus (wave IV), and inferior colliculus (wave V). These waves are differentiated depending on the latency. ABR measurements were performed as described previously12.\nAnesthetize rats with a mixture of 90 mg/kg ketamine and 17 mg/kg xylazine via intraperitoneal injection. Confirm the depth of anesthesia via toe-pinch reflex. Apply ophthalmic lubrication (or mineral oil drops) to both eyes to prevent the eyes from drying and avoid ulceration during anesthesia.\nPlace the rat in the prone position on a heating pad (37 °C) inside of a controlled acoustical booth. Audiology testing equipment is located outside and next to the booth.\nInsert stainless steel electrodes accordingly: the ground electrode in the rear flank, the positive electrode between the two ears directly atop the skull, and the negative electrodes below the pinna of each ear.",
    "Apply acoustic stimuli using High-Frequency Transducers as a 5 ms tone burst at 8, 16, and 32 kHz. Determine stimulus intensities as decibel sound pressure level (dB SPL). This begins at 10 dB SPL and reaches 90-dB SPL with a 10-dB step size. Calibrate the sound intensities to a maximum output of 90-dB SPL using an impulse precision sound level meter.\nNote: The test result gives an indication of the integrity of the peripheral hearing organ, the cochlea, and the aforementioned auditory structures. The waveforms are generated within 15 ms of stimulus input and the latency of the waves depends on conduction time, which in turn is regulated by three critical factors: volume of the brain, the intensity, and the frequency of the sound. Auditory evoked potentials were recorded using software provided by the manufacturer.\nConsider the minimum intensity which can evoke two different waveforms (II and III) of 0.5 µV amplitude as threshold prominently.\nNote: Threshold shift represents the difference in the threshold measured after treatment compared with the threshold obtained prior to treatment.\n2. Trans-Tympanic Injections\nTo administer the drug trans-tympanically, place the rat in the left lateral decubitus position.\n\t\nInsert 2.5 mm disposable ear specula into the ear canal.\nWith the use of a surgical scope, position the specula so that the tympanic membrane is visible.\nUsing a 29 G X ½, 0.5 mL insulin syringe, draw up 50 µL of the [R]-N-phenyl isopropyl adenosine (R-PIA) solution (1 µM), 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) solution (3 µM), or siRNA solution (0.9 µg) to inject (5 units).\nUse the specula to direct the needle to the anterior inferior region of the tympanic membrane.\nPoke a hole through the membrane with the needle and administer the drugs mentioned in 1.2.3. Allow the rat to rest in this position for 15 min.",
    "Note: 50 µL should be the adequate volume to fit behind the tympanic membrane. No fluid should be in the ear canal after administration.\nPlace the rat in the right lateral decubitus position and repeat steps 1.2.1 through 1.2.5 for administration in the other ear.\nFor rats receiving cisplatin intraperitoneally, place the rat in the supine position on a heating pad at 37 °C.\n\t\nUsing a 21 G X 3/4 butterfly needle (12\" length tubing), draw up cisplatin (11 mg/kg, 1 mg/mL solution in sterile phosphate buffer saline [PBS]).\nUsing a syringe pump, administer cisplatin (1 mg/mL) via intraperitoneal injection over 30 min.\nNote: For a 250-g rat, the volume would be 2.75 mL at a rate of approximately 0.1 mL per min.\nContinue to monitor the depth of anesthesia throughout these procedures. Once cisplatin administration is complete, place the rat back in the cage in the prone position, making sure there is nothing to obstruct its breathing.\nMonitor the rat until fully recovered.\n3. Cochlea Dissection and Decalcification\nFollowing the final ABR (after 72 h), anesthetize the rat with a mixture of 90 mg/kg ketamine and 17 mg/kg xylazine via intraperitoneal injection. Confirm anesthesia with a toe-pinch reflex. Euthanize the rat via decapitation.\nDissect out the temporal bone as described previously13.\nPlace cochlea in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS solution in a 7-mL glass scintillation vial (completely covering the cochlea). Refrigerate overnight at 4 °C. Remove paraformaldehyde and wash with 1x PBS at room temperature.\nRemove PBS and fill the tube completely with a 120-mM solution of EDTA (pH 7.3). Place on a rotator at room temperature and allow decalcification for 2 to 3 weeks, changing the EDTA solution daily.\n4. Cryosectioning",
    "Upon the completion of decalcification, completely immerse the cochlea in the following solutions (7 mL each) for 24 h at 4 °C: 10% sucrose, 20% sucrose, 1:1 mixture of 20% sucrose, and optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding compound.\nPlace fresh OCT compound to fill and completely cover the cochlea in a 15 mm x 15 mm x 5 mm disposable embedding mold. Orient the cochlea on its side so that it is parallel to the bottom of the embedding mold, as described by Whitlon et al.14\nImmediately place the mold on dry ice to solidify the OCT and store at -80 °C overnight.\nImmerse microscope slides in 0.01% Poly-L Lysine at room temperature for 30 min. Remove the slides, do not rinse, and allow to dry overnight. Use these slides for cryosections.\nRemove the cochlea in OCT from the -80 °C freezer and place it on dry ice. Using a sharp microtome blade (L x W: 80 mm x 8 mm, thickness 0.25 mm, cutting angle of 34 °), section the OCT blocks at 10 µm using a cryostat at -30 °C. Place two sections per slide.\nRefrigerate slides at 4 °C when finished.\n5. Immunohistochemistry\nPlace the slides in a glass microscope slide staining dish on a slide rack. Fill the dish with 350 mL of 1x PBS and wash the slides for 5 min three times at room temperature.\nRemove the slides from the dish and dry off the area surrounding the tissue using a dry wipe, being sure not to dry off the tissue.\n\t\nUsing a liquid blocking pen, draw a circle around the tissue section.\nBlock the tissue for 1 h at room temperature by adding 150 µL of blocking solution containing 10% normal (donkey) serum, 1% nonionic detergent, and 1% BSA in 1x PBS.",
    "Tap off excess blocking solution and incubate the tissue overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with 150 µL of 10% normal (donkey) serum, 0.1% nonionic detergent, and primary antibody (see the Note below) in 1x PBS.\nNote: For the following antibodies, these dilutions were used: For Figure 2 and 3, p-STAT1 Ser727 1:300. For Figure 4, p-STAT1 Ser727, 1:100 and TRPV1 1:100.\nPlace the slides in the glass microscope slide staining dish on a slide rack. Fill the dish with 350 mL of 1x PBS and wash slides for 5 min three times at room temperature.\nIncubate with the secondary antibodies diluted in a solution containing 0.01% nonionic detergent and 10% normal (donkey) serum in 1x PBS for 2 to 3 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber in the dark.\nNote: For the following secondary antibodies, these dilutions were used: For Figure 2 and 3, Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG 1:600. For Figure 4, Rhodamine (TRITC) Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG 1:500 and Donkey Anti-Goat IgG 1:500.\nPlace the slides in the glass microscope slide staining dish on a slide rack. Fill the dish with 350 mL of 1x PBS and wash slides for 5 min three times at room temperature.\nTap excess liquid off the slide, and dry the slide with a dry wipe around the tissue. Mount slides by adding one drop of the mounting agent with DAPI directly onto the tissue. Slowly place the coverslip on top, ensuring that no bubbles are formed underneath, and allow the slides to cure overnight at room temperature in the dark. Store slides at 4 °C.\nImage slides using confocal microscopy. Use lasers for imaging as follows: UV laser for DAPI, 488 nm laser for Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG, and 543 nm laser for rhodamine TRITC.",
