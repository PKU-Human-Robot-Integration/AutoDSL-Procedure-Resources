    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFixation of the specimens\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nInstructions for the protocol of fixation of the specimens are detailed.\nPrepare the paraformaldehyde (PFA) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nDissolve the 1 piece of PBS tablets and 1 mL sodium azide into the 999 mL distilled water.\nIf a contrast agent is required, solve 10 mL Gadoteridol (Gd), 1 piece of PBS tablets, and 1 mL sodium azide into the 989 mL PBS (called Gd-PBS). Solve 10 mL of Gd into 990 mL paraformaldehyde (called Gd-PFA).\nPut PFA and Gd-PFA into the refrigerator to cool them at 4°C.\nFix the embryos (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2895-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Step-by-step protocol to dissect the mouse embryo\n(A–H) White arrow: cut direction by sessors. Red dot: cut along with the red dot to remove the uterine horn. (H) In case the embryo is big, make a small hole helps to invade 4% PFA into the embryo.\nEuthanize by cervical dislocation pregnant mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nWipe the pregnant mouse with ethanol and open the abdomen with scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nRemove the embryo and place it on a petri dish containing PBS (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E).\nAfter washing with PBS, transfer to a fresh dish containing PBS and remove the embryo (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nWash the removed embryo in PBS, transfer it in 4% PFA, and store it in at 4 °C at least 1 day (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). It can be stored until 12 months. The larger samples can also be perfusion fixed with more days for fixation depending on the sample size.\nIn the case of large samples that do not penetrate PFA well, making a small hole is also effective (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nMove the specimens to PBS or Gd-PBS and store them at 4°C.\nFix the wasp.",
    "Naturally died wasp in the winter is used.\nPut the specimens into the PFA or Gd-PFA.\nStore the solution in the refrigerator at 4°C until the scan. It can be stored until 12 months.\nTransfer the specimens into the PBS or Gd-PBS.\nStore the fixed wasp at 4°C.\nMake PS-PBS samples\nTiming: 30 min\nMake PS-PBS or Gd-PS-PBS solution.\nPrepare 7.25 g of potato starch powder and 5 mL PBS (or 5 mL Gd-PBS if a contrast agent is required) at room temperature.\nPrepare 7.25 g of potato starch powder and 5 mL PBS (or 5 mL Gd-PBS if a contrast agent is required) at room temperature. This concentration provides enough to decrease the proton signal from water around the embryo.\nPut the potato starch powder into the PBS or Gd-PBS gradually.\nWait 10 s.\nMix the PS and solution with a Pasteur pipette.\nMake samples.\nPlace the specimen into the tube. Tubes with inner diameters similar to the size of the specimen should be used.\nNote: Tube diameter smaller than the size of the specimen should not be selected because the deformation of the specimen will occur.\nRepeat from i to ii until penetration of potato starch covers the whole specimen.\nMix the potato starch and PBS with a Pasteur pipette.\nTilt the tube and add the PS-PBS or Gd-PS-PBS into the tube with a Pasteur pipette little by little.\nRemove supernatant PBS or Gd-PBS with a Pasteur pipette.\nNote: The specimen will float when PS-PBS or PS-Gd-PBS is rapidly added.\nWait for 10–30 min until the PS sinks to the bottom completely.",
    "Confirm that the specimen is within the PS and it does not move by eyes. A part of the specimen is visible when you chose the correct size of the tube, which is fit to the size of the specimen.\nNote: The supernatant should not remain a lot. Because global shimming in MRI corrected the field homogeneity including the supernatant, the contamination of signals from the supernatant may affect the adjustment of the global shimming.\nPrepare for micro-MRI\nTiming: 24 h\nSet the tube into the MRI magnet. We show the example with an 11.7T vertical magnet.\nMark the right position, which is the center of the magnetic field, with magic pen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPut the tube at the right position in the radio frequency coil. Immobilize the tube tightly with the tape and sponges (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2895-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Setup of MRI coil\n(A) The plus mark indicates the position of the tube to the edge of the coil.\n(B) The correct position to set the specimen in the magnet.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2895-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Example of T1-weighted image of wasp\n(A) 3D image of T1-weighted image.\n(B) Photo of wasp.\nPlace the MRI bed into the MR bore.\nMRI scanning\nAdjust the tuning and matching under the wobble mode.\nStart the tripilot sequence. It adjusts the field homogeneity, shimming, and reference pulse gain automatically.\nScan the T1-weighted or T2-weighted images of mouse embryo or wasp. Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] show the example of micro-MRI with Gd-treated specimens.\nFor the mouse embryo, a T1-weighted image was scanned with a 3D-fast low angle shot (FLASH) following parameters:",
    "TE/TR = 6/60 ms, flip angle = 90 degree, field-of-view (FOV) = 15 × 15 × 10 mm3, matrix = 512 × 512 × 200, resolution = 29 × 29 × 20 μm3/voxel, Average = 20, total scan time = 11 h 22 min.\nFor the mouse embryo, T2-weighted image was scanned with the rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) following parameters:\nTE/TR = 40/5,000 ms, FOV = 20 × 20 mm3, matrix = 512 × 512, resolution = 39 × 39 μm2/voxel, slice thickness = 100 μm, 100 slices, RARE factor = 4, Average = 20, total scan time = 2 h 50 min.\nFor wasp, T1-weighted image was scanned with FLASH following parameters:\nTE/TR = 4.1/60 ms, FOV = 27 × 20 × 15 mm3, matrix = 540 × 400 × 150, resolution = 50 × 50 × 100 μm3/voxel, flip angle = 90 degree, Average = 20, total scan time = 20 h.\nAfter MRI scanning\nTiming: 30 min\nRemove the specimen from PS suspension (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nMix the deposited potato starch with a Pasteur pipette.\nCheck that the specimen floats.\nRemove the PS suspension by a Pasteur pipette.\nGently pick up the sample with tweezers and pull it out of the solution.\nWash the specimen with PBS.\nTransfer the specimen into PBS or Gd-PBS.\nNote: The potato starch suspension is conservative for at least six months and it can be re-used."
